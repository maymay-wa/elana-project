the three packages until monday as reporters looked on as they 
carefully went through the stacks pictures of brown ducks blue 
jays tiny hummingbirds almost hidden in bunches of flowers a huge

barnett refused to identify the galleries including the chicago 
gallery that returned the 40 prints 
its a gentlemens agreement they are cooperating fully and 
to help them save face we wont release their names at this time 
barnett said 
the chicago gallery is still trying to recover five prints it 
sold for 100000 barnett said when it does they will be 
returned as well he said 
its not very pleasant for them they have to repurchase the 
prints plus try to save face with their customers he said 
a second chicago gallery is expected to return four prints 
within a week barnett said a dealer from philadelphia and new 
york claims seven of the prints were destroyed while he was trying 
to restore them but cant document the loss barnett said 
barnett said the state is aggressively seeking the return of the 
art work 
we would like to have back out property those who dont 
return it we will pursue both civilly and criminally barnett

the ghost of jimmy carter hangs over president 
bushs handling of the mideast crisis from the former presidents 
preoccupation with the hostages in iran to his call for sacrifices 
by the american people 
bush writes one observer appears to be operating on a single 
and sofar successful principle imagine what jimmy carter would 
do then do exactly the opposite 
the president has refused to interrupt his vacation or promote 
energy conservation with any deep conviction for days he refused 
to call trapped westerners by their rightful name hostages he 
was prompt however when it came to flexing us military muscle 
the administration has not invoked carters name outright but 
white house chief of staff john sununu widely believed to be the 
man behind the vacation strategy took an unmistakable shot at him 
last week 
id rather have a president who kept the whole thing in 
perspective than one who locked himself behind closed doors and 
brooded about the problem sununu said 
the comment annoyed and puzzled some democrats 
here weve got a president in the middle of a major 
international crisis and the one thing you like to have there is 
bipartisan support said jody powell a public relations 
executive who was carters press secretary why do you want to go 
out of your way to stick your finger in someone elses eye 
powell said the remark also revealed hollow motives for keeping 
bush away from washington during the crisis its the sort of 
thing you ought not come out and say he said its sort of 
like saying were just doing this for show 
democratic party spokesman mike mccurry called sununus comment 
a gratuitous potshot at a time when democrats including 
carter have lined up nearly unanimously behind bushs gulf policy 
after all a lot of the stuff jimmy carter tried to do in the 
wake of the iran crisis is exactly the kind of thing that might 
have helped us in this particular moment like a national energy 
policy mccurry said 
carter himself made that point recently in a long washington 
post article with a strong i told you so undercurrent 
the former president berated the country for wasting 17 years 
since the first oil price scare and 11 years since the second 
without coming up with an energy policy if it is true that 
providence punishes the foolish then we face some difficult days 
indeed carter wrote 
some were amused he said when he called his drive for an 
energy policy the moral equivalent of war now weve actually 
sent us troops to the middle east carter said and i hope that 
our national response will be more sober 
carter may have been prescient about the need for a national 
energy policy but his persian gulf record doesnt give the 
democrats much else to brag about which makes him say some an 
inevitable and somewhat justifiable target 
his was a failed presidency said stephen hess a scholar of 
presidents and politics at the brookings institution it takes a 
lot not to get a second term that doesnt mean the judgment of 
historians 40 years from now will not be otherwise but its not as 
if the democrats are standing on the barricades saying this is the 
brilliant way that carter did it 
joseph s nye jr director of harvards center for 
international affairs and a deputy undersecretary of state during 
the carter administration agreed that bush is doing better than 
carter in handling a middle east crisis 
but the world is a little different carter was dealt lower 
cards nye said 
bushs advantages according to nye and others include the 
waning of the cold war permitting increased military flexibility 
substantially more petroleum in the us strategic reserve a rapid 
deployment force initiated by carter ready to head for trouble 
spots instantly and the cooperation of a gulf state that has 
sought us troops 
given all of these assets nye said it is a little bit 
churlish to draw comparisons 
jim hoagland the washington post columnist who attributed 
bushs success thus far to doing what carter didnt said his 
comparisons were not meant to open old wounds 
poor carter has suffered enough for his handling of the 
iranian crisis to renew the assault now he wrote just as he 
is establishing himself as americas only effective living 
expresident

brazilian television which was 
pretty steamy already is filling prime time with nudity and 
semiexplicit sex in a network ratings battle 
viewers have been favored with such wonders as an allnude rock 
band and a nearcomplete striptease 
what many call the tv sex war has inspired heated debate of 
electronic eroticism and how much is too much 
the pornographic use of nudity is indecent but nudity in 
itself is innocent said darcy ribeiro anthropologist and former 
education minister the ancient greeks performed acts far more 
indecent than anything seen on local tv 
it all started in april when manchete tv brazils thirdlargest 
network launched the primetime soap opera pantanal about a 
wealthy ranching family in the vast pantanal wetlands of central 
brazil 
manchete had an instant smash for the first time its ratings 
surpassed those of globo tv the leading network and the worlds 
fourthlargest after abc cbs and nbc of the united states 
pantanal broadcast six nights a week and scheduled to run 
through december has an excellent cast and features breathtaking 
views of the wetlands 
was it the scenery that attracted huge audiences and started the 
whole country talking not a chance it was nearexplicit love 
scenes the penchant of female stars for bathing in the river the 
total frontal nude of an underwater swimmer in the opening credits 
as manchete celebrated its success globo counterattacked with a 
week of steamy uncut movies running opposite the soap opera 
globo also unveiled literally popular star claudia raia during 
a beach scene in its own primetime soap opera queen of the junk 
yard which runs just before pantanal 
other networks joined in 
silvio santos owner of sbt the secondlargest broadcast a 
series of literary adaptions as an alternative to the racy fare of 
other channels and said later we had the worst audience ratings 
in the nine years of sbt 
a university of sao paulo survey in late june counted 1145 
displays of nudity and 276 scenes of explicit or implict sex in one 
week of television 
some viewers are outraged 
we are not voyeurs we are normal people ana conceicao of 
rio wrote to a major newspaper the scenes being shown are so raw 
that explicit sex will soon be broadcast into our homes 
romeu trussardi filho head of the commercial association of sao 
paulo accused the networks of opportunism to generate higher 
ratings and greater profit opportunities 
justice minister bernardo cabral has scheduled a meeting in 
early september with station owners writers soap opera stars and 
religious officials to discuss creation of a television code of 
ethics 
most brazilians seem to like the spice 
a survey by the newspaper folha de sao paulo found 83 percent of 
those questioned felt comfortable with the nude scenes in 
pantanal 13 percent were embarrassed when watching with 
others and 4 percent were embarrassed when watching alone 
most said they wanted as many or more nude scenes 
the public likes the sex and nudity said marta suplicy a 
psychoanalyst and author of several books on sex and culture 
most people have boring lives and enjoy watching others have a 
good time 
brazilians are used to exposed bodies in minuscule tanga 
bikinis on the beaches or at the wild carnival holiday before lent 
but eroticism on television was limited until a new constitution 
abolished all censorship in 1988 
coverage of carnival heated up immediately and the justice 
ministry asked networks to exercise restraint in live broadcasts of 
seminude samba dancers at private clubs 
rosemarie muraro a prominent writer and feminist said 
television merely reflects the way most brazilians view sex and 
sexuality 
people here are much more comfortable with their bodies than 
in anglosaxon countries she said no one even notices the 
skimpy bikinis on copacabana beach 
she advocated more male nudity most of the bare scenes on 
television feature women 
ms muraro said her one concern about sex on television was that 
it might increase the rate of teen pregnancy 
mrs suplicy the psychoanalyst said gratuitous sex scenes 
reaffirm a macho culture and sexist stereotypes and could harm 
younger viewers 
no country in the world exposes its children to the same level 
of eroticism on television as brazil she said sevenyearold 
girls think about nothing but romance and seducing boys 
the ratings battle like the debate rages on 
in late july globo presented skid row a mystery with the 
fully exposed form of actressmodel silvia pfeifer as its main 
attraction 
manchete struck back with the song of the mermaids a 
nearplotless revelation of the bare breasts of three other 
actressmodels 
critics panned mermaids including one who said if the 
show is any guide homers ulysses did not plug the ears of his 
brave sailors to protect them from the mermaids enchanting song 
it was to spare them from the stupidities they spouted 
the public felt otherwise mermaids crushed skid row in 
viewer polls

abu raed kharwan who 
built a career as an accountant in kuwait now finds himself back 
in the squalid palestinian refugee camp where he was born 39 years 
ago 
i used to send money home kharwan said as he sat on his 
fathers porch wearing a white cotton gown that is the typical 
garb in the persian gulf region now i am a burden 
kharwan and his family are among thousands of palestinians in 
the israelioccupied territories who face economic hardship as a 
result of iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
in addition to providing palestinians with jobs kuwaits 
contributions helped palestinian hospitals and funded refugee aid 
programs 
ironically most palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip support iraqi president saddam hussein whom they see as an 
increasingly powerful leader capable of restoring arab pride and 
supporting their cause for independence 
but former kuwait resident workers like kharwan carefully 
characterize their backing of the iraqi leader 
we palestinians are not with saddam against kuwait he said 
we are with saddam against the united states 
kharwan who was on vacation in the gaza strip when kuwait was 
invaded does not know when if ever he will be able to return to 
his job he also worries he may never see the 70000 in savings 
and pension accumulated in 14 years of work in the persian gulf 
the israeli government estimates that more than 30000 
palestinians from the occupied territories were employed in kuwait 
at the time of iraqs invasion kuwaiti businesses banks and 
offices have not reopened 
the takeover abruptly cut off the 140 million a year that had 
flowed to the territories from the palestinian workers and kuwaiti 
government aid programs israeli officials said 
palestinian economists say workers in other persian gulf 
countries whose jobs could be threatened if the turmoil spreads 
contribute an additional 160 million to the territories 
the financial fallout goes far beyond family pocketbooks 
jerusalems mukassed hospital the largest palestinianrun 
health facility in gaza has appealed to western countries for aid 
to make up for the 1 million a month kuwait had supplied it 
palestinian merchants fear their trade with arab countries will 
be disrupted about 40 trucks of produce and products move daily 
from the territories to markets in neighboring jordan and on to 
kuwait and iraq 
there may be a shortfall in the 35 million that persian gulf 
nations pledged to a un emergency program which provides food 
and health care for the 17 million palestinians in the territories 
local palestinian activists who insist on anonymity say funds 
clandestinely supplied to the territories by the palestine 
liberation organization have dried up since the iraqi invasion 
the plo closely allied with saddam relies on contributions 
from palestinian workers and oilrich gulf states 
saeb erakat a west bank professor and proplo activist warned 
that the economic impact could be even greater if other gulf 
countries notably saudi arabia penalize palestinian workers 
because of plo support for saddam 
there are thousands of innocent civilians working in the gulf 
and it would be unfair to threaten their salaries or their jobs 
erakat said 
he estimated the work force throughout the gulf region includes 
840000 palestinians from the territories or from families 
displaced to other arab lands at israels creation in 1948 
about 200000 of the palestinians currently in kuwait do not 
have passports or travel documents that allow them to return either 
to the territories or other arab nations he said 
they have no place to go and are left between the guns of the 
americans and egyptians and the guns of iraq erakat concluded 
the united states and egypt among other countries have deployed 
troops to deter further aggression by saddam 
ghasan khatib a palestinian economic development expert said 
families throughout the arab world are being hurt by the sharp 
decline in values of arab currencies 
many palestinians in the territories are paid in jordanian 
dinars which have fallen 15 percent against the dollar since the 
iraqi invasion he said gulf workers have savings in kuwaiti 
dinars down 75 percent in value and united arab emirates riyals 
which also have been sliding 
for kharwan the persian gulf troubles mean he has had to move 
his wife and five children into his fathers stoneblock nusseirat 
camp house eighteen people were already living there 
he says he has no word of the fate of two other brothers still 
in kuwait 
in the nearby palestinian village of zawayda abu hazen abu 
suerieh also is worried about his future after fleeing from kuwait 
where he worked 23 years as a port official 
he his wife and their six children are living without furniture 
in the house he built for his retirement abu suerieh 43 said he 
still hopes he will be able to return to his job in kuwait but had 
to flee the chaos of the iraqi invasion 
we couldnt get money because the banks were closed he 
said we couldnt buy food because there were nothing left in the 
stores

as iraq and the united states square off 
in the persian gulf region iran is reaping economic and political 
benefits from the confrontation between two countries it considers 
its greatest foes 
since the crisis began aug 2 irans oil revenues have 
skyrocketed iraq has withdrawn from occupied iranian territory 
and nations that once considered iran the regional bogeyman are 
beginning to see iraq as the main threat 
the events of the past few weeks have been a godsend for 
irans president hashemi rafsanjani an asian diplomat in iran 
said 
an official iranian source said we do find ourselves in a 
comfortable position but as a matter of principle we 
unequivocally condemn iraqs invasion of kuwait 
both spoke on condition of anonymity in telephone interviews 
from tehran 
the embargo on iraqs vital oil exports has pushed up oil prices 
more than 50 percent boosting irans oil revenues by 33 million a 
day 
those earnings account for more than 90 percent of irans hard 
currency earnings badly needed to speed up an ambitious 
reconstruction launched after the august 1988 ceasefire in its war 
with iraq 
the iranians are producing oil at capacity said charles 
snow a political analyst with the middle east economic survey a 
widely respected oil market newsletter published in nicosia its 
really in their interests to keep prices as high as possible 
mohammad adeli head of irans central bank last week told 
tehran radio that irans foreign exchange earnings were up 12 
percent over last year largely due to higher oil prices 
iraqi president saddam hussein anxious to secure his vulnerable 
eastern border with iran while confronting the usled 
multinational force in saudi arabia earlier this month bowed to 
tehrans demands for an iraqi withdrawl from territory occupied in 
the closing stages of the iraniraq war 
he also agreed to exchange all prisoners of war and share 
sovereignty of the shattalarab the confluence of the euphrates 
and tigris rivers that forms the southern boundary between iran and 
iraq 
iranian officials have called the settlement irans greatest 
victory since the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini overthrew shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi in february 1979 and installed an islamic 
republic 
many arab and western nations including the united states 
backed iraq in its war with iran because they feared that 
khomeinis fundamentalist revolution would spread in the pergion 
gulf region 
but with iraq now universally denounced for invading kuwait 
the iranians feel vindicated said shahram chubin an iran 
specialist with genevas graduate institute of international 
affairs 
weve benefited from higher oil prices and the peace 
settlement with iraq but its just as important that other 
geopolitical realities are also being realized the iranian 
official said 
those countries which considered us a threat and threw their 
weight behind iraq are reassessing their policies because they 
realize who the real aggressor is he added 
rafsanjani leader of irans socalled pragmatists has been 
cautiously moving to improve relations with the west but many 
countries especially the united states have been wary of irans 
intentions in the region 
iran has long called for the withdrawal of foreign forces and 
said security in the gulf was a matter for the region itself but 
its calls have gone unheeded by gulf arab states 
now that they find themselves threatened by saddam there may be 
an opening for iran to act in concert with regional countries 
chubin noted 
in another step in that direction iran offered on sunday to 
allow the thousands of foreigners who were trapped in iraq and 
kuwait by baghdads invasion to flee across the iranian border 
turkey and jordan who have been receiving the bulk of the 
evacuees have threatened to close their borders 
although it has condemned the iraqi invasion iran has 
criticized the united states for deploying its forces in saudi 
arabia and the gulf 
iran is afraid that the us presence in the region may become 
longterm chubin said they want to make sure the foreign 
military buildup is a un operation and not a us one 
iran has blamed iraq for giving the united states the pretext to 
massively increase its presence in the region 
nor does iran have any illusions that because saddam caved to 
its demands it can let its guard down 
if iraq is able to stay in kuwait then its possible that it 
will turn back and threaten iran again chubin noted iraq will 
also have frontage on the gulf and can increase its oil flow 
without needing the shatt 
iran has said it will enforce the unimposed embargo on trade 
with iraq along its 730mile border 
the iraqi concessions also have strengthened rafsanjanis hand 
against radical opponents diplomats in tehran said in telephone 
interviews 
rafsanjani has been locked in a power struggle with antiwestern 
hardliners led by former interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
they oppose his policies of improving ties with the west and 
tempering the revolution to concentrate on reconstruction 
theres little doubt that rafsanjanis emerged as the victor 
in the power struggle said the asian diplomat speaking on 
condition of anonymity

the night was filled with fierce mosquitoes 
humidity thick as an invisible syrup and the cries of a politician 
railing against indolent welfare recipients 
i dont mind them having illegitimate babies ladies and 
gentlemen david duke shouted to supporters at a coastal rally 
i just dont think we should have to pay for them 
duke is the head of the national association for the advancement 
of white people former grand wizard of the knights of the ku klux 
klan a man who once wore a swastika they are white and 
bluecollar workers and they hope to elect him to the us senate 
as he continued his tirade against welfare cheats and 
affirmative action they swapped horror stories of welfare abuse 
of waiting at grocery counters to buy bologna while welfare mothers 
bought steaks with food stamps 
nearly 500 strong they stood as one roaring approval when he 
talked of working for benefits and competing for jobs on merit 
when he charged that the liberals in washington had sold working 
men and women down the river many responded with open yells that 
the niggers are taking over 
duke a boyishlooking 40 was elected last year to the 
louisiana house from the new orleans suburbs his bills aimed at 
welfare and affirmative action have met with no success but he has 
proven himself an articulate spokesman for the far right his fans 
regard him as more than a messenger they see him as a savior 
dukes the only chance weve got to let america know were 
tired of those lazy bastards collecting checks a woman yelled 
over the din of a typical duke rally 
we want people to get off their ass and go to work said an 
elderly postmaster in a tiny rural community who showed up to hear 
duke in central louisiana weve got to have someone stand up for 
us were paying the tab for the coloreds even our president is a 
niggerlover 
duke drew widespread attention in 1973 when as a university 
student he demonstrated in a nazi uniform against antiwar 
protesters later in the 1970s he took off his hood as the 
persuasive head of the klan 
he was accused of trying to sell secret klan membership lists 
and in 1980 he left the kkk and formed the naawp in the next few 
years he ran unsuccessfully for a state senate seat wrote for a 
living and operated a bookstore 
he defeated the brother of former republican gov dave treen for 
a state house seat in 1989 and only a few months later started 
talking about the us senate race 
the national gop has repudiated dukes candidacy and let out a 
collective groan when he opened a washington office under the 
auspices of a group called republican action for the 90s the 
duke revolution of the 90s will collapse liberalism at home the 
group said in a letter to conservatives 
while duke builds steam us sen bennett johnston dla has 
barely launched his reelection campaign and state sen ben bagert 
the designated republican nominee is a distant third despite 
appearances with ollie north and robert bork 
a recent poll for television stations gave johnston 52 percent 
of the voters support duke 24 percent and bagert 7 percent 
all three and another three unknowns will compete oct 6 in an 
open primary professional political consultants say duke has a 
good shot at keeping johnston below 50 percent and thereby forcing 
a runoff in november but they say ultimately he wont be able to 
overcome the threeterm senate veteran 
johnston has urged voters to avoid a runoff saying it would 
attract even more undesirable national attention to the state 
it matters what people outside louisiana think said 
johnston we dont want people to think were like south africa 
people dont invest their money there 
gus weill the dean of louisianas political consultants 
attributed much of dukes appeal to the states ailing economy 
in louisiana we are absolutely in hard times and duke has 
presented us with a villain black people weill said hell 
get support that will surprise some people but there arent enough 
callous people in this state to elect him 
linus juneau head of the american legion in tiny bordelonville 
predicted a large number of world war ii veterans will back duke 
people like what he says about giveaways he said theyre 
not concerned about the past 
duke has spent more than 12 million so far to convince voters 
that he repudiates the reckless past of my youth i was 
intolerant im ashamed of that he stresses in every appearance 
that his past is dead 
there are indications however that duke has not undergone a 
complete transformation as late as 1989 his bookstore still was 
selling pronazi literature and on a television talk show this 
month he was asked about racial songs including one called 
some niggers never die that he recently sold in his 
bookstore he called them humorous 
the rev james stovall chairman of the louisiana coalition 
against racism and nazism said dukes remarks prove he is still 
a bigot and a hater 
whatever he is duke believes he is speaking for millions you 
may think my message is just mine he told one audience but 
what im saying openly is what the other politicians are saying in 
private if a man with my past can be elected to the us senate 
more politicians will follow and america will be heard

growing economic uncertainty from the mideast 
crisis has complicated the united auto workers effort to get an 
improved contract from the big three automakers 
some industry analysts watching the unionmanagement maneuvering 
say the mideast element could toughen the uaws demands for job 
security as it gets into intensive bargaining others say the 
chances for a strike by the uaw are shrinking 
in the oil crises of the 1970s and early 1980s us automakers 
marketed big cars that burned so much gasoline they lost customers 
to the japanese who wooed the us market with small gassippers 
that became immediate hits 
since then japanese automakers have chewed away at the big 
threes collective market share and now account for about 30 
percent the big three have battled back but gm ford and chrysler 
executives say competition is the toughest its ever been 
the uaw entered bargaining with general motors corp ford motor 
co and chrysler corp in midjuly saying job security would be 
the overriding issue more than 450000 workers are covered by 
contracts that expire sept 14 
the uaw leadership which will meet tuesday in detroit have 
said they plan to concentrate on agreement with a target company 
expected to be gm then use that accord as a pattern for contracts 
at the other two automakers 
last week uaw and company bargainers said mention of the 
mideast situation arose at bargaining tables but it hadnt 
dominated discussions 
before the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait auto analyst ronald 
glantz of dean witter reynolds inc of san francisco said a 
twoweek uaw strike against gm was likely 
glantz held fast to his position friday as the gulf crisis 
worsened and the government reported a lackluster 12 percent 
increase in secondquarter economic growth 
because of economic threats stemming from the mideast crisis 
glantz said workers are saying im more determined to get job 
security 
but scott merlis who follows the auto industry for morgan 
stanley amp co of new york has come to a much different conclusion 
i think on the margin it creates a more conciliatory position 
at the bargaining table he said i think uaw leadership 
probably recognizes the threats and the union remembers the harm an 
energy crisis can do to the industry

children dont play outside here in the 
summer and they go to school armed nearly everyone is enlisted in 
the battle against public enemy no 1 mosquitoes 
williston located at the confluence of the missouri and 
yellowstone rivers is a kind of mosquito mecca the rivers create 
an ideal breeding ground for hundreds of thousands of the insects 
theyre bad says 23yearold kellee cox who moved to the 
area from fargo last spring i cant believe it ive got a 
million mosquito bites 
i went into my back yard and got swarmed with them she 
says revealing dozens of irritated red bites on her arms they 
just swarmed over me and attacked me like killer bees 
it isnt a new problem explorers lewis and clark complained 
about the bugs during their brief visits to the rivers confluence 
in 1805 and 1806 a historian called a mosquito attack of 1947 the 
worst on record 
some say the mosquitoes enjoy the predominantly norwegian blood 
of the towns 13000 residents others have proposed getting rid of 
the bugs by building a bubble over the town or setting up huge fans 
to blow them away 
for years several agencies including the impressivesounding 
vector control district board labored unsuccessfully to put down 
the insect uprising too many people were running the same 
program says bill cole chairman of the vector board things 
werent getting done 
but a new idea emerged from a heated city meeting last summer at 
which residents were challenged to come up with their own ideas for 
mosquito control 
two housewives joined a pediatrician two teachers and the owner 
of a day care center to form the bug busters a volunteer group 
that studied ways to control the pests while protecting the 
environment 
they enlisted the local high school a woodworking club and the 
army corps of engineers to make about two dozen minihouses along 
the river each designed to attract bats and sparrows natural 
mosquito predators 
were not importing bats or anything like that said bug 
buster jackie stenehjem the bats are already here were just 
hoping theyll move out of town and move into the houses along the 
river 
before the bug busters the spraying of newly discovered larvae 
had to be approved by several agencies taking up to a week now 
the decisions are in local hands and extermination can start within 
10 minutes 
in april voters approved an annual fee of 12 per household to 
help bolster mosquito control 
despite a rough week or two this summer generally was better 
than last but children still stay mostly indoors and when they 
they go to school they take cans of bug repellent with their 
pencils and notebooks 
residents try to make the best of the bug situation which they 
recognize is an unwinnable war 
its a numbers game were playing cole said we just want 
to get it down to where its livable

environmentalists digging in for a new assault 
on what they consider sacrosanct energy reserves as threatened oil 
shortages and rising gasoline prices spurred by the persian gulf 
crisis start biting into american pocketbooks 
iraqs invasion of kuwait was only a few days old when sen 
frank murkowski ralaska persuaded colleagues to approve a 
measure that would make it easier to expand oil drilling on federal 
land bypassing some environmental restrictions 
the oil industry was just as quick to call for abandoning recent 
curbs on offshore oil drilling relaxing requirements for cleaner 
burning gasoline and drilling in some environmentally sensitive 
areas 
although neither murkowskis nor any of the other proposals has 
won final congressional approval environmentalists fear an 
intensified push by industry to win relief from hardfought 
environmental gains when congress returns from summer recess after 
labor day 
now that were on the verge of another major national debate 
on energy policy were about to be deluged with a lot of bad 
ideas marc ledbetter of the american council for an 
energyefficient economy said in a recent interview 
ledbetter and other environmentalists worry that the debate will 
be fueled by renewed declarations that the united states depends 
too much on imported oil from the middle east and thus may be too 
ready to commit troops to fight for it 
the oil companies are trying to use the middle east crisis to 
get congress to push the panic button and wipe out 20 years of 
public lands protection complained peter a berle president of 
the national audubon society 
there is also concern that the latest oil price shocks will 
complicate final clean air legislation 
some industry spokesmen are suggesting that skyrocketing oil 
prices the threat of armed conflict and a declining economy argue 
against imposing expensive new environmental controls that 
eventually will cost at least 20 billion a year 
we must respect the environment but cant afford to continue 
keeping rich us energy potential under lock and key when were 
sending young americans overseas to protect western oil 
interests richard seibert vice president of the national 
association of manufacturers said last week 
richard rahn chief economist for the us chamber of commerce 
said the middle east crisis should wake people up to the need 
to balance environmental protection and economic cost 
these arguments are nothing new said michael mccloskey 
chairman of the sierra club he recalled the dreadful times 
after oil shocks in 1973 and 1979 when environmental programs were 
under similar attack 
the oil companies are now trying to get the american people to 
believe that our country needs to sacrifice its public lands so 
that it can pump its way out of todays oil disruption he said 
but mccloskey and other environmentalists say the middle east 
crisis also points out the need for more energy conservation and 
less use of fossil fuels the burning of fossil fuels is a major 
cause of global warming and urban pollution 
last week a group of environmentalists called for new energy 
conservation efforts including passage of a senate bill to 
dramatically boost auto fuel efficiency requirements 
environmentalists say that while the current situation may 
clarify how far americans are willing to support environmental 
protection they believe their movement can fend off any attacks 
there will be some old battles reopened by the oil companies 
especially but im quite confident that the environmental 
positions are going to prevail christopher flavin of the 
worldwatch institute said in a recent interview the american 
people will not abandon environmental issues 
the bush administration has given no indication that it will 
reverse its recent decision to curtail offshore oil development 
along vast stretches of us coastline for at least the next decade 
there also is no clear sign that congress is prepared to go 
along with the oil industry and open the arctic national wildlife 
refuge for drilling or to scuttle major sections of the proposed 
clean air legislation 
but energy secretary james watkins said recently he would seek 
to resolve a longstanding dispute between chevron corp and the 
state of california over pumping oil from two existing offshore 
wells near santa barbara and the white house renewed its call to 
open the arctic refuge to exploratory drilling

the day a voice on the telephone 
invited colombian judge clara parra to her own funeral she knew it 
was time to get out 
the judge who worked in a red zone so designated because 
of drugtrafficking and guerrilla violence packed her bags 
collected her 16yearold son and left for massachusetts she is 
now seeking asylum in the united states 
unlike most defections parras has the support of the country 
she fled 
her career as a judge and as a lawyer in colombia is almost 
finished so we need her to be a legal citizen in the united 
states colombian consul bertha ospina said 
were not asking for money or anything like that were asking 
only for permission for her family and her to live here with legal 
permission so she could work 
ospina wrote a letter from the boston consulate to us 
authorities in support of the asylum request and a hearing has 
been set for oct 5 
parra a municipal judge in guamal colombia who had been on 
the bench since 1985 said the threatening calls began in january 
1989 
in april of this year i received a last call by which i was 
invited to my funeral on may 5th whereupon i could not bear it any 
longer she wrote in her petition for asylum filed in july 
i asked what they wanted they never answered parra 41 
said in a recent interview she said she doesnt know who 
threatened her she issued dozens of search warrants and detention 
orders against drug traffickers and guerrillas and still wonders 
how the callers got her unlisted phone numbers 
i lost confidence in everybody she said 
drug lords in colombia have threatened to kill 10 judges for 
every trafficker extradited to the united states and more than 200 
judges have been killed as colombia stepped up law enforcement 
efforts ospina said 
its unusual for a country to back one of its citizens in a 
quest for asylum elsewhere immigration officials said 
if the colombian government wants to go on record that the 
individual would be subject to persecution on return to that 
country then we would have to take that under consideration said 
timothy whelan deputy district director for the immigration and 
naturalization service 
parra is seeking us residency for herself and her son as well 
as for an older son sent to study in texas before the death 
threats she went to western massachusetts because she has 
relatives there 
eighteenyearold mauricio parra said his mother did the right 
thing 
they tell you that theyre going to kill you sooner or later 
theyre going to do it he said

ten years ago warriors of the krahn 
tribe led a bloody campaign of revenge against liberians descended 
from american slaves who had ruled the country since it was 
founded in 1847 
now the krahn and their allies of the mandingo tribe are 
themselves being hunted in a tribal war waged without mercy 
members of the krahn tribe kill people of other tribes and the 
others kill krahn solely because of tribal allegiances 
descendants of the freed slaves brought here early in the 19th 
century by american civil rights groups are known as 
americanliberians their forbears organized the true whig party 
which ruled without interruption and americanliberians were 
widely accused of brutalizing the native inhabitants 
a revolution in 1980 led by samuel doe brought an end to their 
rule 
president william tolbert was killed in his executive mansion on 
april 12 1980 a week later 13 of tolberts ministers and heads 
of government corporations were executed in public tied to stakes 
on the atlantic beach near the mansion 
the coup and subsequent executions were the work of doe and 16 
other noncommissioned officers from the krahn homeland grand 
gedeh county in the distant eastern interior many were illiterate 
and had never been in touch with civilized life 
liberias new rulers appeared to have no sense of money and the 
result was economic disaster 
americanliberians kept a low profile their standard of living 
often dropped to the level of their tribal compatriots 
since they had no tribe of their own they became known 
collectively as the congo tribe congo was a popular term at the 
time of the un operation to save the former belgian congo now 
zaire from chaos 
a part of monrovia is known today as congo town after the 
americanliberians who settled there 
after does coup the krahn were the masters the masonic temple 
that dominated monrovia once the place where the major decisions 
were made became a ransacked shell 
the national motto the love of freedom brought us here was 
an insult to native tribes but none of the krahn in authority 
thought to change it 
doe ran the country like a private estate the army commander 
brig gen thomas quiwonkpa attempted a coup in 1985 and was 
killed 
popular dissatisfaction with does rule grew and in 1989 
tribes that had suffered under the krahnmandingo oppression 
rebeled 
most americanliberians remained on the sidelines but one of 
them charles taylor sought to lead the rebellion 
taylor and his lieutenant prince johnson had spent four years 
in libya being trained in military tactics and indoctrinated in the 
green book ideology of moammar gadhafi libya still is taylors 
main arms supplier 
most of taylors followers are from aboriginal tribes and he has 
tried to shake off his congo tribe background 
johnson of the gio tribe broke with taylor after an argument 
over the execution of several rebels johnson accused of desertion 
johnson had the deserters shot and taylor has been his sworn enemy 
ever since 
generally unlike taylor johnson has tried to humanize the 
conflict he distributed food to civilians ordered men of his 
executed for looting and insisted he was fighting only to remove 
doe from power 
as soon as this war is over i and my men are returning to 
barracks he says repeatedly civilians tend to believe him 
taylor has fought with the same brutality as doe unlike the 
other two contestants he refused to have anything to do with a 
peace force of west african states and said he would fight the 
peacekeepers if they arrived 
then johnson and doe concluded a truce to unite against taylor 
laying the foundation for an even longer civil war 
the fivenation west african force arrived friday night was 
welcomed by prince johnson and according to the ghana news agency 
repulsed an attack on saturday by rebels loyal to taylor 
countless atrocities have been reported in the many months of 
fighting many of them attributed to does krahn warriors up to 
400 people were killed aug 5 in a night attack on gio refugees 
sheltering in st peters lutheran church in monrovia 
us marines were sent to protect the us embassy but were 
instructed to stay out of the general conflict 
to many liberians however the united states is their only hope 
of rescue from destruction they look to america as their countrys 
founder 
america is my fatherland said johnson whose personal 
experience of the united states is minimal we expect the 
americans to come to our help as the french came to the help of 
gabon or the british to the help of uganda

un officials making their first formal effort to mediate the 
persian gulf crisis announced sunday they will meet this week with 
iraqi officials and iraq allowed 52 dependents of captive us 
diplomats to flee to turkey 
sundays announcement came a day after the world body authorized 
the use of force to back international economic sanctions on iraq 
iraq freed 52 of 55 dependents of american diplomats evacuated 
last week from the us embassy in kuwait who had been detained in 
baghdad but iraqi officials kept other us citizens as hostages 
to deter any american attack 
the group left baghdad by car and crossed into turkey at the 
habur border post about 2 am monday state department officials 
in washington said 
they were met by officials from the us embassy in ankara 
they were all very very tired but they were all very 
enthusiastic very happy to be in turkey embassy vice consul 
david kostelancik said from diyarbakir 
but three young men sons of us diplomats assigned to kuwait 
were turned back at the border with turkey a state department 
spokeswoman said the three all over age 18 sent back to baghdad 
she said 
kostelancik said the rest of the group was heading for the 
interlik air base near adana he said it will remain there until 
leaving turkey for the united states probably on tuesday 
us embassy personnel from kuwait were detained in baghdad and 
iraq says they will not be freed until the mission in kuwait city 
has closed 
united nations chief javier perez de cuellar will meet thursday 
in jordan with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to engage in a 
full exchange of views on the crisis said the 
secretarygenerals spokeswoman nadia younes 
it would be the first formal un attempt to mediate the crisis 
which began when iraqi president saddam hussein sent his troops 
into kuwait on aug 2 and annexed the country in a dispute over 
land and oil 
the action led to a trade embargo against iraq and a huge 
usled troop deployment to protect neighboring saudi arabia 
aziz said in baghdad on sunday that he planned to meet with 
perez de cuellar this week but he did not elaborate he declined 
to say whether iraq was prepared to compromise on kuwaits status 
we are open to listen to suggestions aziz told cnn 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said sunday in 
washington that the bush administration would have no problem 
with a mediation effort by perez de cuellar 
but scowcroft said the united states wants iraq to withdraw from 
kuwait after that he said were prepared to talk about 
anything 
meanwhile in the persian gulf us warships shadowed iraqi 
vessels but did not immediately exercise their newly won authority 
to stop them by force 
the soviet union said its ships will not use force to uphold 
trade sanctions moscow however played a key role in the passage 
of the un resolution allowing military enforcement of the iraqi 
trade sanctions 
for a second day skeleton crews at embassies in kuwait city 
defied an iraqi order to close their missions iraq surrounded the 
us and other compounds with soldiers and cut off their services 
but did not resort to force 
in other developments 
the us army on sunday ordered 50 more army reserve and 
national guard units in 25 states to report for active duty by aug 
31 the callup on friday of air national guard reserve units from 
six states began a national mobilization of reserves authorized by 
president bush 
three weeks after the united states began sending troops to the 
gulf region to defend saudi arabia against iraqi aggression 
sources in washington estimated that 60000 us soldiers airmen 
and sailors were deployed 
several days after jordan and turkey said they may have to 
close their borders to refugees from iraq and kuwait iran said it 
would allow evacuees to pass through its territory to freedom 
pope john paul ii in his first public condemnation of iraqi 
actions criticized human rights violations and prayed for the 
foreign hostages 
the american women and children freed by iraq left baghdad in a 
13car convoy for the turkish border according to carole lee 
heileman a spokeswoman at the us embassy in ankara 
an additional 54 or 55 personnel mostly men who had been 
stationed in kuwait are still in baghdad and we have not secured 
their release she said 
iraq last week ordered nations to close their embassies in 
kuwait claiming that the oilrich nation was now part of iraq 
the united states sent about 110 diplomats and dependents to 
baghdad they were stranded there when saddam reversed an earlier 
promise and said they would be detained until the united states 
closed its embassy in kuwait 
iraqs us ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat said saturday 
that the us diplomats must remain in bagdhad because they dont 
have diplomatic status 
in all about 21000 westerners have been caught in iraq and 
kuwait including 3000 americans iraq says some have been 
distributed among iraqi strategic sites for use as human shields to 
deter a us attack 
iraq continues to round up westerners from their homes in kuwait 
city britain and france each said iraqi troops detained eight of 
their nationals they said the british were moved to an 
unidentified civilian establishment while the french were 
placed in a hotel

said the us embassy in kuwait has been told two additional 
americans were detained by iraqi troops dozens of americans have 
been rounded up in iraq and kuwait and moved to undisclosed 
locations 
in the persian gulf and the red sea more than two dozen us 
warships continued to keep iraqi vessels under surveillance sunday 
the un security council on saturday authorized military action 
to enforce the trade embargo on iraqi commerce especially its oil 
exports 
us officials have said the united states and its allies can 
now use force to disable vessels by wrecking the rudders of ships 
breaking the embargo 
although two us warships have fired warning shots over the bow 
of two iraqi oil tankers iraq may retaliate militarily if its 
vessels are hit 
asked for an update sunday on activity in the persian gulf navy 
spokesman chris baumann said only that us ships were tracking 
numerous vessels as they had been for several days there is 
no action he said

the ordinary person even the ordinary 
politician has a difficult time distinguishing a prison from a 
jail 
its a difference howard safir had to explain over and over for 
the last 12 years as operations director of the us marshals 
service safir was responsible for finding jail cells not prison 
cells for federal inmates 
safir who recently retired got them from the us bureau of 
prisons or leased them from other governments 
the us justice department uses jails differently from the 
states counties and cities 
federal jail cells house only individuals who have been denied 
bail while they await trial or for those convicted but awaiting 
sentencing 
state and local jails do that too but they also hold 
individuals serving short misdemeanor sentences the federal 
government sends such convicts to lowsecurity prisons and prison 
camps 
many states now also keep some more serious offenders in jails 
because their prisons are overcrowded 
marshals lawyers and judges agree that the most efficient jails 
are connected by secure tunnel or bridge to the courthouse where 
the inmates are tried 
a prison in a cornfield works fine a jail doesnt safir 
said because jail inmates have to go to court each day they 
need access to their lawyers they are almost all still notguilty 
prisoners under our system they have more rights than convicts

the arrival of powerful us military 
forces in the persian gulf has strongly bolstered the immediate 
security of many prosperous oil states 
but some analysts say the us forces could become liabilities 
the longer they stay and that gulf states truly interested in more 
security may have to change their government structures to rally 
more longterm popular support 
king fahd of saudi arabia who has invited the bulk of the us 
forces onto the territory of his conservative islamic nation has 
said repeatedly that their presence will be temporary they will 
leave as soon as saudi arabia no longer faces the threat of 
invasion from iraq according to the king 
but it was a fundamental change in policy to invite nonmoslem 
military forces into saudi arabia the birthplace of islam and 
sensitivies in the area about foreign forces are high 
the american military presence is friendly at least for the 
time being and until the iraqi danger is repulsed and crushed 
said jassem murad a former bahraini parliament deputy 
but if the americans try to prolong their stay in the gulf 
they would be regarded as enemies worthy of nothing less than 
denunciation 
murad contended that gulf governments will have to revive and 
encourage the incipient democratization movements reconsider the 
distribution of their countries wealth and institute a foolproof 
system of social justice 
over the past two decades kuwait has had off and on the only 
freely elected parliament in the arab world it was suspended twice 
in 1976 and in 1986 because of alleged abuses by radical 
deputies 
elsewhere in the region no government has been willing to 
facilitate the democratic process saudi arabia has promised but 
never established an islamic constituent body known as a shura 
consultative council bahrains threeyear democratic experience 
ended in the dissolution of parliament in 1975 other countries in 
the region without exception remain under dynastic rule with no 
elected constituent institutions 
some saudi arabians however seem to care little about 
democracy or a formal redisribution of oil wealth 
whats democracy westernstyle is only a farce said mutlaq 
alassiri a merchant in jiddah our leaders are incomparably 
benevolent they protect our faith build us roads and give our 
sons jobs we can see any of our top leaders anytime we desire at 
majlis consultative meetings and air our grievances education is 
free through university medical care is free and ours is the 
safest land 
fahd and his predecessors spent hundreds of billions of dollars 
to transform saudi arabia into a modern country with a vast 
network of roads light industries schools and hospitals 
many people seem to have ambivalent feelings about the american 
military presence the iraq of saddam hussein has accused the 
saudis of encouraging the massive us deployment but other arabs 
blame iraq itself 
the saudis did not bring the americans to the gulf said 
malek alsaghir a restaurant owner in the gulf sheikdom of dubai 
saddam forced the americans to deploy in the gulf twice in 
this decade once when he invaded iran and again when he invaded 
kuwait 
some say the americans should have acted sooner 
the americans are to blame for all the tragedies saddam has 
precipitated said murad they knew him long before his rabid 
aggression against kuwait when he invaded iran violated human 
rights of his own citizens and used chemical weapons to burn the 
kurds in northern iraq 
the americans and the arabs saw in saddam a war criminal and 
ruthless dictator why didnt they stop him why did they appease 
him 
many commentators agree that the longer us forces remain the 
less hospitable arabs will be to them 
said medhat sadeq general manager of the bahrainbased arab 
financial services company in the foreseeable future it is good 
to have american forces in the gulf but if these forces stay 
longer than necessary the old antiwestern sentiments will resume 
among arab masses 
initially the saudis were discreet about the us military 
influx they slammed their gates shut to journalists 
but apparently at american behest the saudis later allowed 
increasing numbers of foreign journalists to enter and a senior 
gulf official told reporters accompanying us defense secretary 
dick cheney everyone is accepting theres going to be a longterm 
presence 
many gulfbased arab diplomats speculate the united states is in 
for a very long stay 
im confident the saudis wont relent until the alsabah 
family is reinstated and the iraqi tyrant is crippled said one 
arab diplomat referring the kuwaiti ruling family deposed by the 
invading iraqis 
and when reinstated the alsabahs will have to implore the 
americans to maintain some kind of military presence in kuwait as 
a protection against the eventuality of aggression by either iraq 
or iran said the diplomat who insisted on anonymity 
i hope the stay of foreign forces in the gulf will not be very 
long a former british ambassador to saudi arabia sir james 
craig said in a telephone interview a long stay could swing the 
public opinion in the west against the military role in the gulf

when americans recall the gulf crisis of 
august 1990 theyll picture their president in a golf cart and a 
motorboat images that some democrats are mentally stockpiling for 
their 1992 campaign arsenal 
why does the white house permit president bush the nations 
bestknown vacationer to be photographed talking about troops 
tensions hostages and hardships while hes fishing or golfing 
its overcompensation its an attempt to prove that george 
bush and iraq are not jimmy carter and iran said gop analyst 
stuart rothenberg editor of the political report 
but he and others suggest that bush could have made the same 
point in a less jarring way by taking a working vacation at camp 
david for example or by limiting his activities in maine to a 
morning run relaxation with his family and work related to the 
crisis 
virtually every night we see the guy in his little golf 
cart said geoff garin a democratic pollster if hes going to 
be in kennebunkport you want him on the phone not on the links 
to the imagemakers bush is committing a cardinal sin and 
taking a potential risk 
what you need when youre the president is a lot of personal 
credibility to get you over the rough spots said bob squier a 
democratic media consultant this operation is not going to be 
easy hes squandering his goodwill by giving pictures that make it 
look like hes not taking this seriously 
bush defends his decision to play and play hard and then 
work like hell the rest of the time 
what you dont want to do is appear to be held hostage in the 
white house to events he said 
but jody powell who was carters press secretary said bush 
runs the risk of being the first american president whos ever 
been held hostage in a cigarette boat he cant come back to the 
white house even if he wants to 
political analysts invoking the public relations masters of the 
reagan white house say bush is sending mixed signals 
there is bush using his boat and golf cart while calling on 
americans to conserve energy there is bush in casual clothes 
fishing or golfing flashing on the tv screen seconds after footage 
of us troops on warships and in the saudi desert 
and perhaps most jolting there is bush answering questions on 
grave matters from the seat of his boat or golf cart 
he ought to be giving pictures that go with his words said 
squier hes being tough hes being presidential hes being the 
commanderinchief the pictures he gives are of this kind of hack 
golfer or gasguzzling speedboat monster 
democrats admit that the golf and fishing footage may be 
insignificant in a political campaign if bushs diplomatic and 
military policies succeed 
if everything turns out all right the fact that bush dealt 
with this from kennebunkport wont matter said garin 
everybodys going to be celebrating the bush style 
but some say the vacation pictures could be effective if for 
example the gulf crisis turns into a protracted standoff that 
damages the domestic economy and makes bush vulnerable in general 
you can imagine the democratic arguments said rothenberg 
he was on furlough when the reserves were being called up 
while squier has been outspoken about the possible impact of the 
boating and golf images in a 1992 presidential race the official 
democratic party line is that such speculation is inappropriate now 
party spokesman mike mccurry said no one at the democratic 
national committee is stockpiling bush vacation footage for 
political purposes but he acknowledged that its potential has not 
escaped notice 
with all the hardships in store for the families of soldiers and 
reservists mccurry said no one wants to think that politicians 
are out there calculating the odds but they do and thats a fact 
of life

us dairy exporters are discovering that 
consumers in foreign countries appreciate a big scoop of ice cream 
on a hot day as much as americans 
over the last five years ice cream exports have tripled 
reaching 94 million worth last year according to an article in 
the agriculture departments latest agexporter magazine 
the more developed a nation is the better the chance of selling 
it ice cream said david young and ron verdonk authors of the 
article 
its important for example that most of the countrys 
residents have refrigerators with freezers for the nation to be a 
truly fertile market 
with close to 14 billion gallons produced and annual per 
capita consumption of 45 pints the united states is still its own 
best customer and the largest single market for ice cream 
worldwide according to the magazine 
but other developed nations particularly the booming and 
burgeoning economies of the pacific rim in asia are potential hot 
markets for frozen dessert 
in the case of a product like ice cream it is important to 
work on familiarizing consumers in potential foreign markets with 
the joys of consumption advise young and verdonk 
the major markets and the amount of ice cream imported last year 
were hong kong 26 million worth bermuda 1 million and 
mexico 700000 as regions top buyers were the far east 36 
million the caribbean 23 million and the european community 
17 million 
given the hot climate and large numbers of us and european 
tourists the caribbean market is a natural one for us ice 
cream said the authors sales in this region have grown in 
tandem with the increases in tourism revenues 
they said exports there almost tripled from 1985 to 1989 in 
bermuda purchase grew from virtually nothing a few years ago to 1 
million in 1989 
exports of us yogurt are showing the same rapid growth as ice 
cream said young and verdonk

us commercial red meat production in july 
totaled 31 billion pounds up 2 percent from the same month last 
year 
however slaughter was down 1 percent at 222 billion pounds for 
the full first seven months of the year compared to 1989 the 
agriculture department reports 
for the period from january through july beef slaughter was 
down slightly compared with the previous year veal down 12 
percent pork down 3 percent lamb and mutton up 8 percent 
the julyjuly comparisons with 1989 first are as follows 
beef 188 billion pounds 193 billion 
veal 27 million 26 million 
pork 110 billion 110 billion 
lamb and mutton 25 million 28 million 
the agriculture department says that cattle and hog prices are 
declining from recent highs as red meat supplies increase 
seasonally 
pork production will rise through midfall resulting in further 
price declines large fed cattle marketings at heavier weights 
will be partially offset by a less than seasonal increase in cow 
slaughter says usda

the united states and other nations that 
donate food are putting more emphasis on the needs of recipient 
countries and less on their own domestic concerns such as getting 
rid of surplus commodities say two usda economists 
since the early 1970s the principal donors have been the united 
states canada and the european community with wheat and wheat 
products constituting about 83 percent of the tonnage shipped 
other products include coarse grains rice vegetable oils 
beans and fish in the late 1980s the united states and ec reduced 
dairy product surpluses and consequently the giveaways 
over the years food aid has grown more humanitarian said 
the economists shahla shapouri and margaret missiaen 
also there has been an expansion of multilateral programs in 
which organizations such as the world food program of the united 
nations jointly help distressed nations they said 
the researchers who studied donations in 1975 and 1985 found 
more aid was given in the latter year and more widely dispersed 
major recipients in 1985 were in africa instead of south asia they 
said

iraqs invasion of kuwait has ravaged the 
hollywood of the middle east depriving egypts film industry of 
the kuwaiti money that keeps the reels turning 
producers actors and directors in the regions largest film 
industry watch with worry as each day of occupation costs them 
thousands of dollars in lost ticket revenues and financial backing 
and next to suffer may be the moviegoing public 
for arabs egyptian films are the main source of 
entertainment said munib shafei chairman of the egyptian 
chamber for movie industries and this invasion has caused severe 
problems for our industry 
egyptian studios have been the center of arabic moviemaking for 
six decades and produce an average of 60 films annually about 80 
percent of foreign financial backing for the films comes from the 
arab oil states of the persian gulf mainly kuwait 
before iraqs the aug 2 conquest of kuwait that small state 
was the main distribution center for the persian gulf which under 
the egyptian industrys production system meant they also were 
coproducers 
before production kuwaiti entrepreneurs bought distribution 
rights to an egyptian film the egyptian filmmaker then used that 
money to help produce his film which the kuwaiti backers 
subsequently distributed under a leasing arrangement with 
exhibitors in neighboring states 
its a unique situation the distributor is effectively a 
coproducer said mustafa gamaleldin a director persian gulf 
distributors financed a third and sometimes up to threefourths of 
a films production costs he said 
egyptian films typically feature maudlin love stories 
farfetched intrigue and psychologybook treatment of social 
problems theyre great favorites in the persian gulf states 
especially among women who rarely leave their houses because of 
strict islamic rules and searing heat 
outside of egypt persian gulf states account for 80 percent of 
egyptianmade movie sales in the arab region and for the gulf 
area kuwait was the boss said shafei 
he said three of four films that were being wrapped up when iraq 
invaded kuwait would be finished although with financial 
difficulty otherwise he said all plans for new films are on 
hold 
no figures have been compiled on how much the film industry 
stands to lose 
we no longer have any contact with our kuwaiti distributors 
shafei said in an interview they owe us money and we owe them 
distribution rights and in saudi arabia theyre worrying about 
whether they will have a war on their hands not about films 
by standards of the industry abroad where a 10million movie 
is a cheapie egyptian balancesheet figures are miniscule shafei 
said producing a film costs between 40000 and 160000 
the egyptian cinema also depends on the persian gulf for its 
profits which are low at home because of high advertising costs 
and tickets too expensive for many egyptians additionally there 
is no effective law regulating video distribution leaving the 
field open to video pirates 
egyptian films normally earn 20000 to 30000 in each persian 
gulf country with total foreign distribution sales sometimes 
reaching as much as 100000 
by comparison a film sold in iraq earns 12000 to 20000 
shafei said and the iraqis have been known to take up to four 
years to pay up 
a number of people have come out and said one solution to the 
loss of persian gulf money is for actors to take salary cuts but i 
think thats a very bad idea gamaleldin said 
egyptian movie stars are vastly underpaid compared to their 
counterparts in the united states but in a country where the 
average wage earner takes home less than 1000 a year they dont 
do badly 
superstar comedian adel imam is in a class of his own 
reportedly pocketing close to 150000 per film otherwise the top 
actors and actresses earn 11000 to 60000 a film 
some egyptian movies are shot in a month but better ones with 
the highestpaid stars take up to six months to make

in 1922 urvan ubbens parents had his 
funeral picture taken certain hed be the next family member 
to die of diabetes 
today the 77yearold laughs at the childhood photo and how he 
cheated death by being one of the first people to test insulin 
experts say he may be the worlds oldest surviving diabetic 
i was one of the guinea pigs when eli lilly was trying to 
massproduce insulin in indianapolis back in 1922 ubben said 
in those days they figured that if you had diabetes you didnt 
have a chance and my parents were highly skeptical of insulin 
so when i came back from the experimental treatments in 
indianapolis my parents still thought i was going to die and they 
wanted a picture of me so they had my picture taken 
years later i was looking at my mothers old pictures with an 
aunt when we came across that photo she said urv theres your 
funeral picture we just laughed about it 
diabetes a disease caused by excess sugar in the bloodstream 
was no laughing matter when ubben developed it in 1922 
earlier that year ubbens sister theola died after slipping 
into a diabetic coma ubben already had lost an aunt an uncle and 
his greatgrandfather to the disease 
it was quite scary for my parents and they were pretty 
discouraged ubben said insulin had just been discovered 
earlier that year no one knew anything about it 
of course now we know its wonderful stuff its kept me 
alive all these years 
a spokeswoman at eli lilly and co in indianapolis confirmed 
ubbens 1922 diagnosis and his testing of insulin after its 
discovery in toronto 
the pharmaceutical company isnt sure if one other member of the 
first test group is alive ubben may be the oldest surviving 
diabetic said gene mccormick retired lilly historian 
ubben suffered frequent bouts with diabetesrelated illnesses 
brought on by ignoring doctors orders to maintain a strict diet 
he became partially blind from an attack in 1938 
he and his wife of nearly 53 years wilma raised three children 
and worked a small farm he later ran a coinoperated machine 
business and worked as a furniture maker and wood sculptor 
ubben learned the dangers of insulin overdose when he 
experienced one of the first documented insulin reactions after 
his treatment in indianapolis he was in a peoria hospital for 
observation when he passed out 
the doctor didnt have any idea what was wrong said ubben 
who described the episode in an autobiography 10 years ago 
because the hospital had no facilities to analyze ubbens blood 
for sugar content a specimen was raced to a doctors laboratory by 
police 
the lab technician was at the movies while ubbens parents were 
summoned to their dying sons bedside every theater in peoria 
flashed an emergency message on the screen to locate the technician 
the message worked 
the technician raced back to her lab to study ubbens blood and 
found the lowest blood sugar she had ever seen 
but the hospital had no glucose to counter the insulin 
overpowering ubbens body 
so his doctor pried the unconscious boys teeth apart shoved a 
rubber hose down his throat and poured a bottle of corn syrup into 
his stomach in a crude effort to raise his blood sugar ubben was 
revived 
my parents were racing to the hospital to see me shove off 
ubben said they thought i was going to die but i fooled them 
they got there in time to see me wipe syrup off my face

how much trouble could it be to 
repair a few hundred feet of earthquakedamaged pavement in the 
case of highway 1 plenty 
half a million cubic yards of the winding twolane highway 
800 feet of road and the dirt below have been sliding into the 
pacific since octobers quake 
it was closed in january ordinarily a few months of work would 
have the highway looking brand new 
but highway 1 isnt an ordinary road nature and man keep it 
unique 
the stretch of road north of san francisco was carved into a 
cliff hundreds of feet above the sea the scenic route chronicled 
by john steinbeck linked the northern and southern ends of the 
state in the days before superhighways 
because the road cuts through a variety of jurisdictions a 
small army of bureaucrats has to approve before repairs can begin 
stinson beach residents say the closed section is killing summer 
tourism those living along panoramic highway the mountain route 
chosen as a detour complain about heavy traffic they say isolates 
them from emergency vehicles 
the detour carries about 6000 vehicles a day double last 
summers figure 
if this road is blocked and someone up here has a heart 
attack the normal six to sevenminute response time of paramedics 
could turn into an hour said del goetz organizer of the 
neighborhood highway 1 emergency committee 
business at stinson beach usually a popular summer hangout for 
tourists and sunbathers is down an estimated 30 percent 
the california department of transportation which routinely 
removes slides from the coastal highway initially estimated it 
would take three months to clear and repair the fallen road 
but the project was stalled by 13 federal state and local 
agencies that didnt want the dirt and blacktop shoved into the 
ocean or dumped on land they protect 
what used to be a county road through ranch land is now a 
state road through state parks surrounded by federal parks near a 
marine sanctuary at a time when environmental laws not only are 
very strict but are being enforced with vigor said jerry hauke 
a caltrans engineer 
involved are the army corps of engineers the state department 
of fish and game the us wildlife service and the golden gate 
national recreation area along with state and local commissions 
and other groups 
all of these little agencies have their microscopic duty 
thats the only angle theyre looking at our problem is there is 
no bureaucracy looking at it from the peoples standpoint said 
farhad mansourian deputy director of the county public works 
department 
the environmental impact reports demanded by many of the 
agencies could have delayed repairs up to three years hauke said 
but a compromise worked out earlier this month could reopen the 
road by next summer at a cost of 3 million to 5 million 
the 13 agencies agreed to a state plan to rebuild the damaged 
section on more stable ground 200 to 300 feet inland the proposal 
calls for pushing only the earth above the present road into the 
ocean hauke said 
the army corps of engineers which must issue the permit said 
formal approval could be given within 45 days of receiving 
environmental clearance from other agencies 
goetz said history and red tape shouldnt be allowed to paralyze 
the present 
we need to revamp our culture so we dont become mired in the 
bureaucracy he said

desert nomads dashing to the saudi 
border with refugees from kuwait have hundreds of new landmarks to 
guide them as they evade a gauntlet of iraqi soldiers 
now we are using the abandoned cars as a sign of where to 
go said abdullah alajmi a bedouin guide who planned to make 
his next foray into kuwait today 
aside from the hundreds of stranded cars left by escapees the 
nomads rely on trees telegraph poles and geography on the 
dangerous journey 
i know not to turn at say the first hill but at the second 
hill said alajmi thinking of his routes i know the desert 
very well from hunting trips before the invasion 
tens of thousands of refugees arrived across the desert sands in 
the first three weeks after iraqs aug 2 invasion and subsequent 
annexation of kuwait 
although refugees still come across the border this frontier 
town has largely fallen silent the only sound at midday is a rope 
flapping against an aluminum flagpole 
with buildups of more than 100000 troops on both sides of the 
border the saudi government over the weekend declared all but the 
official border crossing a closed military area 
this is the new policy governor khalid alotaishan said 
before entering a meeting with saudi and american military officers 
there are constant consultations about plans in case of an iraqi 
attack 
a saudi official in dhahran speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the saudi army is fanning out along the front lines with the 
americans at least 25 miles behind them 
we would never put americans up near the border that could be 
disastrous politically the official said if there are going 
to be casualties a saudi will have to die first 
meanwhile doctors at the red crescent tents near the border 
said there are reports of deaths among those fleeing kuwait as they 
run out of water the red crescent is the equivalent of the red 
cross in moslem countries 
people who crossed the border sunday said the iraqis are now 
shooting at anything that moves one car arrived with its right 
headlights smashed a second with its spare tire punctured 
about 60 people trickled across sunday including a group of 35 
pakistani and bangladeshi workers in two vehicles they lost a 
pickup truck plus all their food water cigarettes and video tapes 
to an iraqi soldier 
we were always afraid said aboul qassem a 44yearold 
refinery worker from bangladesh 
he said he decided to get out after iraqi soldiers led away four 
westerners working in a hospital near where he works iraqi troops 
have also taken to burning automobile showrooms and westernstyle 
supermarkets qassem said 
the fear is not deterring some from crossing into kuwait to try 
to bring out family members 
its very difficult and dangerous said alajma if there 
are too many iraqis on the way we have to turn back 
mohammed almatar who planned to cross back into kuwait with 
alajma said that on two previous trips they got past iraqi troops 
with gifts of bananas cigarettes and cold water 
one group told us that for four days they had been drinking 
the water from the windshield washers of abandoned cars he said 
groups usually travel around 2 pm when the temperature climbs 
above 100 degrees and the soldiers usually seek shelter to rest

the state department recently reevaluated the pay structure at 
the american embassy in kuwait and concluded employees there were 
making too much money 
as a result the socalled hardship post differential was 
cut from 25 percent to 20 percent 
the change was made before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
theres no word on whether officials now plan to up the amount 
the 30odd staffers at the american consulate in dhahran saudi 
arabia also receive a 20 percent differential 
the amount of the differential depends on a number of factors 
including weather the quality of health care danger availablity 
of goods and services and mail service 
in kuwait city iraqi soldiers cut off electricity and other 
utilities to the us embassy and surrounded the compound where 
ambassador nathaniel hawthorne and about 10 staff members remain in 
defiance of iraqs order to close foreign embassies

in the swiftness of the us 
military deployment a limited transport capability has left some 
units still without antiaircraft weapons and other equipment field 
commanders consider vital 
yet to arrive are the biggest american tanks armored vehicles 
and artillery all key cogs in the us strategy for any extended 
desert ground war against iraqi troops 
some field commanders report isolated shortages of parts others 
are still waiting for groundtoair antiaircraft protection 
but the unprecedented deployment of us forces in saudi arabia 
so far appears to have proceeded without major problems 
weve accomplished miracles in a short period of time said 
army maj gen gus pagonis who is in charge of logistics for the 
us deployment 
pagonis who met with reporters near a major us staging area 
in saudi arabia called the effort probably the largest exercise 
ever accomplished in a short period of time since world war ii 
the delays in getting the heavy equipment are blamed not on 
logistical or command lapses but on the limited capacity of the 
militarys air and sea transport capacity officials say many of 
the concerns should be addressed over the next week to 10 days as 
more ships arrive 
pagonis said an average of 50 transport flights arrive in saudi 
arabia daily carrying troops equipment and supplies he is hoping 
to build into at least a 30day reserve stockpile 
much of the heavy equipment sought by field commanders m1 
tanks armored vehicles heavy artillery and antiaircraft 
batteries are on ships headed for the saudi kingdom 
the first such shipment is due to arrive by midweek the tanks 
will be deployed into the desert in northeastern saudi arabia 
the united states has no military stockpiles in the middle east 
with the emphasis in getting troops to saudi arabia air force 
cargo planes had carried only limited equipment until last week 
when civilian aircraft were pressed into duty as troop carriers 
also it takes more than 24 hours to fly from the united states 
to saudi arabia and nearly a month for even the fastest sealift 
ships to make the trip and the navy has just eight of those 
pagonis said he assumed the united states would explore 
establishing a storage depot somewhere in the region 
among units still waiting for some of its heavy equipment is an 
army helicopter unit based in the saudi desert the unit would need 
forwardbased refueling and repair facilities in the event of 
extended fighting but had just a few mobile fuel tankers as of 
saturday barely enough to keep choppers at its staging camp 
refueled 
if they go to forward positions i would have nothing back 
here an officer with the unit said 
the officer also said stockpiles of certain spare parts were low 
parts that would be needed in any extended combat situation 
because of the toll of the desert heat and sand on the helicopters 
and other equipment 
were told theyll be here pretty soon the officer said 
another concern voiced by a number of officers was the shortage 
at some sites of heavy artillery and groundtoair defense systems 
were concerned about it an air force officer said during a 
recent visit to his desert base area when asked about the lack of 
antiaircraft protection were pretty naked out here right now 
the concern for heavy ground forces particularly tanks and 
armored vehicles stems from iraqs formidable tank force 
air force col sandy sharpe commander of a wing of a10 
tankkillers stationed in the saudi desert said his unit had a few 
minor problems with spare parts but said theyll roll in 
still sharpe said the deployment here proved the need for an 
expanded airtransport capacity to guarantee against any shortages 
if you dont have it you can have all the jets in the world 
and theyll just sit he said

weapons by bombing an iraqi reactor in 1981 
now we feel vindicated but that doesnt make us any 
happier arad told a gathering of the international bnai brith 
on sunday for these recent events bring the danger of another 
war in the middle east closer to israel and yes closer to 
america 
arad addressed about 1000 people from more than 40 countries at 
the gathering of the worlds largest jewish organization 
he said that to prevent upsetting any usarab efforts to turn 
back saddam the jewish state is keeping a low profile in the 
crisis america is widely resented in the arab world because it 
is seen as israels protector 
arad said arabisraeli friction is just part of the formula 
creating tension in the middle east 
the major source of conflict is the intent of arab dictators 
to pursue their grand designs to achieve power and influence 
through military might he said 
indeed the absence of democratic regimes in the arab world 
and the wild enthusiasm for violence there will make the resolution 
of the arabisraeli conflict even more difficult 
american support for arab countries opposing saddam including 
recent approval of sophisticated new fighter planes for saudi 
arabia might one day hurt israel the statesman said 
when this crisis is over we must remember that there might be 
another crisis with its center an arab front against israel 
arad said the present conflict and crisis should not be allowed 
to upset the military balance in the region 
the ambassador took the opportunity to blast longtime enemies 
for their actions during the crisis palestine liberation 
organization leader yasser arafats support of saddam shows the 
kind of regime he would impose on his own people and the kind of 
peace the plo intends for the region and for israel he said 
arad criticized and warned king hussein of jordan who he 
said is trying to please saddam 
unless he takes a courageous position against iraqi 
aggression he might find himself pretty soon the next victim on 
saddams list arad said

after the six whites on the panel refused to renew the contract of

the soviet union which over the weekend supported 
a un resolution sanctioning military action to back an 
international trade embargo against iraq says it will not include 
itself among the enforcers 
but foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said sunday that moscow 
would not object if the united states and other nations use force 
within the framework of that resolution 
in a joint statement shevardnadze and visiting french foreign 
minister roland dumas urged iraq to show realism and common sense 
and to heed the will of the international community expressed in 
the resolutions of the security council on the persian gulf 
crisis 
the un security council approved the resolution saturday it 
called for such measures commensurate with the specific 
circumstances as may be necessary to end trade with iraq which 
invaded kuwait aug 2 and annexed it 
the soviet union has two warships in the gulf of oman and they 
are part of a large international naval armada in the persian gulf 
region to pressure iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
but shevardnadze said moscow had no plans to send any more 
vessels to the region adding we will not take part in the use 
of any force 
we voted for the un resolution because other nations 
are ready to take part in inspecting the ships craft vessels 
which are suspected of carrying prohibited products and 
merchandise he said 
the united states and other countries which are represented in 
this area i mean which have their own armed forces they should 
act but within the framework of that resolution he said 
the soviet union however continued diplomatic efforts to 
resolve the threeweekold middle east crisis egypts foreign 
minister esmat abdelmeguid met with shevardnadaze today tass 
said without providing details 
at a news conference with dumas on sunday shevardnadze denied 
reports that 193 soviet military advisers still in iraq are 
participating in preparing details of military operations 
he said the advisers would be brought home soon after their 
contracts expire and soviet women and children have been evacuated 
shevardnadze however noted that un resolutions do not 
prohibit the presence of advisers but acknowledged there is a 
moral side of the issue and the political aspect and we understand 
this 
certain mass media put forward information that our military 
advisers take part in preparing details of military operations 
etc that is not true he said 
soviet officials said last week that the military experts 
continue to repair and maintain sovietbuilt weapons and teach 
iraqi soldiers how to use them 
soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov said friday that about 900 
of the 7791 soviets still in iraq are women and children whom he 
hoped would be evacuated by sept 1

thailands foreign minister architect 
of its hardline stance this past decade on vietnams invasion of 
cambodia lost his post in a major cabinet reshuffle today 
five new deputy prime ministers were named and the heads of six 
of the 13 ministries were replaced in the shakeup which was 
engineered by prime minister chatichai choonhavan and announced by 
his office 
it was designed to boost the governments image after corruption 
scandals in which two deputy ministers had been fired 
siddhi savetsila foreign minister since 1980 was replaced by 
subin pinkayan who had been commerce minister siddhis deputy 
prapas limpabhandu also was replaced they both belonged to the 
scandalplagued social action party but were not themselves accused 
of any wrongdoing 
we have to change to a new team but foreign policy will 
not change chatichai told reporters today 
siddhi had led efforts to isolate and punish vietnam after it 
invaded cambodia in late 1978 installed a new communist government 
and put thousands of hostile troops at thailands doorstep 
but his influence declined markedly after chatichai became 
premier in august 1988 and set out to turn indochinas 
battlefields into marketplaces thailand still backs the 
cambodian guerrilla forces but siddhis approach gave way to thai 
mediation in peace talks involving increased contacts with vietnam 
and the vietnameseinstalled government 
also two wellknown technocrats without any party affiliation 
took over key ministries virabongse ramangura became finance 
minister and amaret silaon became commerce minister 
the reshuffle added a seventh party to the ruling coalition the 
puangchon chaothai party of former army commanderinchief gen 
arthit kamlangek arthit became a deputy premier 
arthit went into politics after he was fired as army chief in 
may 1986 by former prime minister prem tinsulanonda for publicly 
challenging the government 
the government was badly shaken by scandals that led to the 
firing the past two weeks of two deputy ministers belonging to the 
social action party 
fired saturday was deputy commerce minister pinya chuayplod who 
was held responsible for the import of parts for assembling illegal 
gambling machines deputy interior minister santi chaivirattana was 
sacked aug 15 after accusations that he took bribes to ease safety 
regulations of gas stations 
due to the scandals siddhi last week resigned as leader of the 
social action party and returned the reins to kukrit pramoj 79 a 
former prime minister who founded the party and had gone into 
political retirement 
the conservative prowest chatichai administration has been 
dogged by allegations of corruption since it came to power for a 
fouryear term in the july 1988 parliamentary election

a savings and loan regulator solicited campaign 
contributions from other thrift watchdogs for a us senator on the 
banking committee 
kermit mowbray former president of the federal home loan bank 
in topeka kan raised money for former sen david karnes rneb 
the denver post reported sunday 
federal law restricts government employees from raising money 
for federal campaigns but home loan bank employees arent covered 
by the rule 
mowbray is the target of a treasury department investigation 
into allegations he delayed the seizure of the failed silverado 
banking savings and loan to protect thenpresidential candidate 
george bush from bad publicity 
bushs son neil was a silverado board member and loans he 
approved for a business associate have come under scrutiny by sampl 
investigators 
mowbray who was fired without explanation after silverado 
failed defended his fundraising for karnes 
i didnt see anything wrong with that mowbray said in an 
interview last week karnes deserved our support 
karnes was chairman of the topeka branch of the home loan bank 
before being appointed to the senate when democrat ed zorinsky 
died he ran unsuccessfully for the seat in 1988 
mowbray was in charge of regulating silverado when he asked 
colleagues to support karnes campaign he contributed 2000 and 
others donated at least 1000 records show 
edwin gray former chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
which governed the topeka bank said mowbrays fundraising shows 
very poor judgment its dead wrong 
if there was any kind of coercion i would say that it is at 
the least highly improper and possibly a violation of the law 
gray said 
karnes said he spoke with mowbray by telephone frequently but 
was unaware of the contributions from thrift regulators frankly 
i was so busy i didnt have time to notice where my campaign funds 
came from he said 
regarding the alleged delay in closing silverado mowbray 
testified before the house banking committee in june that he 
received a phone call from washington directing him to postpone 
silverados closing from october 1988 to december 1988 bush was 
elected president in november 
he said he didnt remember who called or whether he took the 
call himself 
mowbray who earned 190000 a year as president of the topeka 
regulatory bank gave 2000 to karnes campaign in june 1987 he 
said he suggested to presidents of the systems 12 regional banks 
that they also contribute 
federal election records show that in june 1987 thurman 
connell president of the systems bank in des moines and brian 
dittenhaufer president of the new york branch each gave 500 to 
karnes campaign the newspaper said 
last week karnes whose committee had a role in regulating the 
industry denied ever discussing neil bush or silverado with 
mowbray 
i talked to kermit because he was in washington about once a 
month and he called just to say hows it going karnes said 
it was against the law to talk about specific institutions so 
even if we wanted to we couldnt discuss it

the administration is expressing hope the 
persian gulf crisis still can be resolved without military 
conflict if worldwide economic sanctions force iraqs saddam 
hussein to withdraw his forces from kuwait 
hes a classic case of someone who is vulnerable to 
sanctions thomas pickering the us ambassador to the united 
nations said of saddam 
the strategy is to put maximum pressure on iraq through the 
un pickering said 
were watching if the sanctions are going to bite and how 
rapidly pickering said on nbcs today show pickering said 
saddam is heavily dependent on oil exports and it might be a 
month or two before it begins to bite 
i can see a peaceful way out of it national security 
adviser brent scowcroft said sunday saddam hussein must now see 
hes facing overwhelming world opinion 
he is casting about for a way out of the box in which he finds 
himself scowcroft said 
a final piece of the administration strategy was set in place on 
saturday when the united nations security council agreed to 
authorize the use of military power to enforce the worldwide 
economic embargo against iraq 
it was the first time in un history that approval had been 
given for military action to support economic sanctions the united 
states had lobbied hard for the un resolution 
pickering said the resolution is significant in two ways 
first it gives us the muscle all of us cooperating to to enforce 
the un sanctions secondly it is the first time in 45 years 
literally weve gotten this kind of world unity to deal with an 
agressor 
in turkey 52 americans connected with the us embassy in 
kuwait were permitted to cross the border from iraq into turkey on 
sunday and planned to return to the united states today three 
young males were detained by iraqi border authorities 
an administration official with president bush in kennebunkport 
maine said all three young men were over 18 years old the 
official who declined to be identified by name said there was no 
indication that the three were harmed but that they were sent back 
to baghdad with the escort officer 
about 2500 other americans have been barred from leaving kuwait 
and another 500 face a similar fate in iraq all told more than 50 
are under arrest in the two countries according to the state 
department 
if he touches one of those civilians if he touches one he 
is liable under the geneva convention of 1949 which was put into 
international treaty with iraq as a party sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny said today on abcs good morning america 
that means he hangs and his commanders hang moynihan said 
the specter of global economic pressure on iraq combined with 
the usled military buildup in saudi arabia prompted several 
analysts who appeared on network television talk shows sunday to 
forecast an eventual reversal by saddam of his aug 2 conquest of 
kuwait 
former national security advisers henry kissinger and zbigniew 
brzezinski indicated there was room for hope that the gulf crisis 
could be resolved short of military conflict 
kissinger said he believes that saddam hussein is looking for 
some way out if we stay firm we will get it 
crown prince hassan of jordan said he was optimistic about 
saddams willingness to negotiate 
both scowcroft and iraqi ambassador mohamed almashat endorsed 
the concept of a mediating role by un secretary general javier 
perez de cuellar who is seeking urgent talks with iraqi officials 
this week 
scowcroft said saddam has shown himself to be a realist citing 
his willingness two weeks ago to bow to irans terms for a 
settlement of their eightyear war among other concessions saddam 
agreed to recognize the prewar boundary of the two countries 
almashat contrasted iraqs desire for peace with the 
american design to have war he said the us aggressive 
intentions were demonstrated by the dispatch of offensive weaponry 
including stealth fighter bombers to saudi arabia 
he said the us allegation that iraq posed a threat to saudi 
arabia was the biggest deception in history 
the undersecretary of state for political affairs robert 
kimmitt said that sooner or later saddams hand will be forced by 
the economic sanctions 
i think they the sanctions are becoming increasingly 
effective i think the difference between this sanction regime and 
past sanctions regimes is that it enjoys the virtually unanimous 
support of the world community and therefore i think the sanctions 
are beginning to pinch more and more as each day goes by kimmitt 
said 
when he saddam sees that the world community is not breaking 
rank that it is staying behind the un security councilmandated 
sanctions that he would understand that he has only one way out and 
that is to withdraw from kuwait he said

rescue crews said today that they had 
pulled 69 bodies from a coal mine rocked by an explosion that 
trapped 179 pit workers officials said they believed all still 
below were dead 
rescuers working around the clock since the blast late sunday 
reported problems reaching remaining miners tons of concrete 
blocks and other debris blocked the shaft where the explosion 
occurred 
the blast at the dobrnjajug pit of the kreka mine 90 miles 
west of belgrade left a crater 45 feet wide and about 15 feet 
deep the explosion was thought to have been caused by a buildup of 
either coal dust or methane gas 
only one man who was working near the surface was pulled alive 
from the mine said vidan krsnanovic a director of the rescue 
operation 
bosko zelic a member of the mines managing board said there 
were 180 miners in the pit at the time of the explosion and that 
no other survivors were likely earlier reports indicated 169 were 
below ground 
if the trapped pit workers died it would be the worst mining 
disaster in yugoslav history 
there was no immediate indication how far underground the miners 
were trapped the blast occurred at a depth of about 1500 feet 
tangled ruins of the conveyor belt that carried coal from the 
shaft were scattered around the mines mouth huge pieces of a 
concrete archway that formed the mine entrance were being pulled 
away by cranes 
the force of the blast ripped out steel supports and ventilation 
equipment the tanjug news agency reported 
kreka mine one of the oldest in yugoslavia was the site of a 
weeklong strike for higher pay that ended friday mining experts 
interviewed by belgrade radio said high concentrations of the 
highly flammable methane gas might have accumulated in the shafts 
during the strike 
strikers demonstrated in sarajevo capital of yugoslavias 
central region of bosnia throughout the past week they returned 
to work saturday after being promised a 100 percent increase in 
their average 270 monthly salaries 
yugoslavias worst mining disasters occurred in 1965 when 128 
miners died in another colliery in bosnia 
ninety miners died in a methane gas blast last november at a 
coal mine about 125 miles south of belgrade the explosion was 
apparently caused by welders working inside one of the shafts 
that mine was closed permanently after officials determined it 
could not be repaired 
officials consider many of yugoslavias coal mines unsafe but 
only recently have they begun issuing orders to close the most 
dangerous ones

opec ministers were moving today toward 
an agreement allowing for a temporary increase in oil production to 
help fill the gap caused by the persian gulf crisis sources said 
ten of the 11 nations of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries meeting informally in vienna have agreed in principle to 
authorize an increase said a delegation source who demanded 
anonymity 
they see the need for some kind of opec sanction to increase 
production he said 
only iran which contends there is enough excess oil in the 
industrialized world to meet any shortfall was opposed he said 
about 4 million barrels of oil a day have been lost to the world 
market because of the international embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti 
oil the sanctions were imposed after iraq invaded and occupied 
kuwait on aug 2 
venezuela and saudi arabia would like the cartels backing to 
boost oil production and help make up part of the loss 
ministers from 11 of the cartels 13 countries began informal 
talks on sunday to decide whether to grant exemptions to their 
current production agreement 
only iraq and libya were not present sunday for the 
consultations with opec president sadek boussena the algerian oil 
minister libyan officials were expected to arrive later today and 
they might oppose any move to raise production 
under the supply accord worked out last month the ministers 
agreed to restrain production at 225 million barrels a day in the 
second half of the year to try to reach a new target price of 21 a 
barrel the benchmark was reached almost immediately because of the 
gulf crisis 
crude oil prices have topped the 30 mark on fears of military 
escalation and a shortage of supplies in the oilrich gulf region 
the delegation source said any new accord to permit increased 
crude pumping would likely include promises that production be 
reduced once the crisis ends 
it also would probably call on consuming nations to take steps 
to use oil in storage to help meet any shortages he said 
he said talks were continuing to work out the details an 
accord he said could be arranged without holding a formal meeting 
of the cartel 
on sunday venezuelan oil minister celestino armas appealed to 
his counterparts to call an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis 
the oil market he said is suffering an important 
disruption and we have to do something about that 
armas said six nations one short of the needed majority 
wanted to convene an urgent meeting they are saudi arabia 
venezuela qatar the united arab emirates ecuador and kuwait 
saudi arabia and venezuela were turned down last week in an 
attempt to call an emergency meeting but armas said the informal 
talks could result in a formal session this week 
we do think that these consultations should lead to an 
extraordinary conference in order to take the decisions and to take 
the actions that the world is waiting from opec at this moment 
he said 
sheik ali khalifa alsabah the finance minister of the kuwaiti 
government in exile urged higher output quotas for countries with 
the capacity to pump more sabah was kuwaits oil minister until 
july 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer has said the kingdom 
will raise its output by 2 million barrels a day with or without 
opecs blessing the oil giant has a supply quota of 54 million 
barrels a day 
analysts said the united arab emirates venezuela nigeria and 
libya also have the capacity to lift production 
armas said his country will increase pumping to fill its stocks 
because of the possibility that the oil crunch will continue for 
some time 
analysts say venezuela could add as much as 500000 barrels a 
day to its opec quota of 19 million barrels 
opec nations are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

irish pop singer sinead oconnor threatened 
to walk out on a concert if the starspangled banner was played 
beforehand she won the battle but lost the war 
the national anthem was not played but the singer known for her 
skinheadstyle haircut was banned from any future performances at 
the garden state arts center officials said 
backstage staff relented following the ultimatum friday out of 
fear that a lastminute cancellation would cause a commotion said 
dennis ingoglia a spokesman for the new jersey highway authority 
which operates the 9000seat venue 
oconnor whose recordings include nothing compares 2 u and 
mandinka gave no reason for her demand ingoglia said 
a telephone message left this morning at the offices of 
oconnors publicist elaine schock was not immediately returned 
this morning 
but todays editions of usa today quoted oconnor as saying i 
dont see what anthems have to do with me or my music or my 
fans 
she said she didnt mean to be disrespectful but wouldnt 
perform after any national anthem even irelands she said she had 
been unaware that the garden state arts center routinely plays the 
us anthem before shows 
she added some criticism of us policy on arts funding i 
feel very strongly about censorship and i dont want to go onstage 
after the anthem of a country thats arresting people and harassing 
people for expressing themselves onstage 
george zilocchi acting executive director of the highway 
authority said in a statement no performer who does not agree 
to have the national anthem played will be allowed to perform 
in may oconnor refused to perform on saturday night live 
because the guest host was controversial comedian andrew dice clay 
whose offcolor humor much of it at the expense of women earlier 
prompted cast member nora dunn to boycott the show

a predicted teacher shortage probably will not 
materialize because many veterans who left the profession are 
returning a study said today 
the national center for education information said more than a 
third 38 percent of current public school teachers have had at 
least one break from teaching 
nearly half 46 percent of new teachers hired since 1985 have 
had at least one break and 18 percent of these have had two or 
more breaks 
teaching appears to be a revolving door the study said 
there is absolutely no question that statistics projecting 
teacher shortages are not accurate said emily feistritzer 
director of the center an independent nonpartisan research 
group she said little attention has been paid to the returning 
teacher phenomenon 
all this business of teachers being miserable and leaving is 
not being borne out in data anywhere she said 
the study analyzed the results of a 58question survey of 3201 
current elementary and secondary school teachers 2380 public 
school teachers 469 teachers who had participated in alternative 
teacher certification programs in texas and new jersey and 352 
private school teachers 
alternative teacher certification programs are for people who 
did not earn a college degree in teaching twelve percent of those 
teachers who were hired in the last five years have taught before 
the study also showed 
the teaching force in america is getting older whiter and more 
female the average age of all public school teachers is 42 years 
of new teachers hired since 1985 the average age is 35 years 
ninetytwo percent of all public school teachers are white and 71 
percent are women 
to become a teacher alternative routes attract minorities more 
than traditional certification routes fortythree percent of the 
teachers from the texas alternative route and 20 percent from the 
new jersey alternate route are minorities 
alternate route teachers are much more willing to teach in 
inner cities than those coming through traditional programs a 
third 33 percent of alternate route teachers say they would be 
willing to teach in large inner cities compared with 12 percent of 
the new hires from traditional programs and 12 percent of all 
current public school teachers 
since most teachers are women feistritzer said childbearing was 
listed most often as the reason for taking a break from teaching 
about threefourths of all teachers said they chose the 
profession because of a desire to work with young people 
ninetythree percent of the private school teachers said they 
were satisfied with their jobs that compared with 89 percent of 
the alternative route teachers in texas and new jersey 87 percent 
of the returning teachers and 83 percent of all public school 
teachers 
there are 23 million public school teachers and another 300000 
private school teachers some educationrelated groups are 
predicting a shortage based on teacher attrition increasing 
student enrollments and fewer college graduates seeking teaching 
jobs 
thanks to teachers an organization sponsored by the national 
education association and private business groups reports that 
many school districts already are reporting shortages the group 
says far too few college students are enrolled in teacher training 
programs to fill the expected 13 million teaching job openings 
expected by 1994 
other studies have estimated that about 200000 new teachers 
would be needed a year 
however feistritzer said about 650000 teachers have been hired 
in the last five years averaging out to 130000 a year about 
71000 of those hired each year are new teachers 
in the study 74 percent of all teachers said they expect to be 
teaching five years from now eight percent plan to retire 7 
percent expect to switch to an occupation outside of education 10 
percent expect to be in another occupation in education 1 percent 
plan to be homemaking or raising children full time and 1 percent 
expect to be attending a college or university full time

sales of existing homes rose 33 percent in 
july their second straight increase as mortgage rates dropped 
into the single digits a real estate trade group reported today 
the national association of realtors said house resales totaled 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 344 million units compared to 
junes rate of 333 million 
the 09 percent gain in sales in june was the first advance in 
seven months 
fixedrate 30year mortgages fell from 1006 percent to 98 
percent during july according to surveys conducted by the federal 
home loan mortgage corp however they turned upward after the aug 
2 iraqi invasion of kuwait and reached 1029 percent by last friday 
home buyers watched rates keep drifting down and started 
making their move realtors president norman d flynn said 
the rate drops brought in some borderline buyers who were priced 
out of the market earlier this year as well as buyers who could 
have bought sooner but chose to wait out the rate increases 
but flynn said the recent rate increases probably will push down 
sales this month 
iraqs craziness will be felt in us housing markets he 
said 
the national median existinghome price was 98400 in july up 
09 percent from june the median price means half of the homes 
cost more half less 
sales increases were posted both in the northeast and south in 
the northeast the pace jumped 143 percent to 560000 units while 
it gained 69 percent in the south to 140 million units 
julys buildup in resales in the northeast was the result 
of greater activity in the lower price ranges according to john 
a tuccillo the realtors chief economist sellers have adjusted 
their prices to fit a buyers market and buyers have responded 
the median price in the northeast was 143300 in july 34 
percent below the june level 
the resale increase in the south reflected rising activity in 
the southwest tuccillo said where several formerly depressed 
oildominated markets are springing back the median price in the 
south was 88900 up 16 percent from june 
sales fell 103 percent to 520000 units in the west the 
median price there was 141500 up 25 percent from the previous 
month 
sales fell 31 percent in the midwest to 930000 units the 
median price there was 76300 up 05 percent from june

tens of thousands of blacks in the 
soweto township stayed away from work today to protest factional 
fighting that has claimed more than 500 lives over the past two 
weeks 
buses taxis and trains in soweto were carrying roughly a third 
as many passengers as usual into neighboring johannesburg many 
schools were closed and the main streets in the township of 25 
million people were mostly empty 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu addressing a funeral for seven 
people killed in the violence told a roaring crowd that police 
actions not tribal divisions were fueling the conflict 
we have never quarreled because of tribalism tutu told some 
5000 african national congress supporters at a soweto 
amphitheater the evidence is overwhelming that the police have 
not been impartial 
most of the fighting in soweto and other townships around 
johannesburg has pitted zulus loyal to the conservative inkatha 
movement against xhosas and other blacks who support the anc the 
countrys largest black political organization 
anc leader nelson mandela and other antiapartheid figures have 
accused police of siding with inkatha a charge police deny 
the government and many neutral observers portray the conflict 
as mostly tribal fighting linked to the power struggle between the 
anc and inkatha 
inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi has blamed the anc for 
instigating the fighting which has resulted in some of the worst 
violence since nationwide unrest during the mid1980s buthelezi 
says the anc wants to crush all opposition 
our freedom is at hand tutu said to tumultuous cheers 
and there are those whites who say they dont want us to have 
our freedom so they have made us fight one another 
heavily armed soldiers and police ringed the amphitheater no 
arrests or violence were reported 
the general strike was called by the antiapartheid soweto civic 
association to protest the violence police behavior and to mourn 
our dead residents in neighboring townships also took part 
a group of xhosa and zulu tribal chiefs sympathetic to the anc 
toured the townships sunday and said the violence was not a 
zuluxhosa conflict but has its roots in the system of apartheid 
the problem is the collaboration between the police and 
inkatha said mwelo nonkonyana a xhosa chief 
the delegation which included seven xhosa and six zulu chiefs 
said it did not represent any political party but the chiefs all 
belong to the congress of traditional leaders of south africa a 
group with close ties to the anc 
the zulus and the xhosas are the two largest tribes in south 
africa but townships in the johannesburg area have blacks from all 
10 major tribes in the country 
townships around johannesburg have been relatively peaceful in 
recent days for the first time since the violence erupted aug 12 
a total of 515 blacks have died including more than 100 in soweto 
police said 
army troops and police continued to patrol the streets and 
confiscate guns spears axes and other weapons the government has 
declared townships ringing johannesburg unrest areas giving 
police wide powers to curb violence 
the government lifted a state of emergency in three provinces in 
june but retained the measures in the eastern province of natal 
where fighting between inkatha and anc forces has claimed about 
5000 lives in the past five years 
in natal seven blacks were hacked and stabbed to death and 
three were fatally shot over the weekend in separate attacks 
police said 
under south africas apartheid system of racial segregation the 
5 million whites dominate politics and the economy and the black 
majority has no voice in national affairs

teachers who enter the profession without a 
college degree in teaching are more likely to be minorities and to 
want to work in innercity schools according to a study released 
monday 
a third of the teachers who took an alternate route to the 
classroom say theyd be willing to work in large inner cities 
compared to 12 percent of all current public school teachers and 12 
percent of new hires from traditional programs according to the 
study by the national center for education information 
the independent nonpartisan reserach group looked at 
alternative certification plans in two states as part of a larger 
teacher study it found that 43 percent of the nontraditional 
teachers in texas and 20 percent of those in new jersey were 
minorities 
the overall teaching force is becoming older whiter and more 
female the study found the average age of all public school 
teachers is 42 years of new teachers hired since 1985 the average 
age is 35 years ninetytwo percent of all public school teachers 
are white and 71 percent are women 
the study of 3201 elementary and secondary school teachers 
currently on the job also concluded that a predicted teaching 
shortage probably will not occur because many teachers who leave 
the profession tend to return 
of the teachers in the study 38 percent have had at least one 
break from teaching 46 percent of those hired since 1985 have had 
one break and 18 percent of these have had two or more breaks 
teaching appears to be a revolving door the study said 
center director emily feistritzer said childbearing was listed 
most often as the reason for taking a break from teaching she said 
more attention should be paid to the returning teacher 
phenomenon 
all this business of teachers being miserable and leaving is 
not being borne out in data anywhere she said 
there are 23 million public school teachers and another 300000 
private school teachers in the united states some 
educationrelated groups are predicting a shortage due to teacher 
attrition increasing student enrollments and fewer college 
graduates seeking teaching jobs 
thanks to teachers an organization sponsored by the national 
education association and private business groups reports that 
many school districts already are reporting shortages the group 
says far too few college students are enrolled in teachertraining 
programs to fill the expected 13 million teaching job openings 
expected by 1994 
other studies have estimated that about 200000 new teachers 
would be needed a year 
however feistritzer said about 650000 teachers have been hired 
in the last five years averaging out to 130000 a year about 
71000 of those hired each year are new teachers 
threequarters of the teachers in her study said they expect to 
be teaching five years from now ten percent predicted theyd be in 
an educationrelated occupation 7 percent plan to switch fields 
and 8 percent expect to retire 
the feistritzer study is based on the results of a 58question 
survey of 2380 public school teachers 352 private school teachers 
and 469 people who had participated in the texas and new jersey 
alternateroute programs

saudi arabia a strictly controlled 
society has opened the floodgates to more than 250 reporters 
turning coverage of the us troop deployment into what one 
journalist called monday a media war 
the decision to let american and foreign journalists roam the 
oilrich kingdom is unprecedented 
its phenomenal said ray wilkinson newsweeks cairobased 
correspondent wilkinson had a visa request pending for 18 months 
before he was granted one i never thought i would see the us 
military in saudi arabia and i never thought i would see us here 
like this 
saudi officials speaking on condition they not be identified 
said the change in government policy came from the highest levels 
and was partly in reaction to pressure from the united states 
they know public opinion is important one official said of 
the saudi leadership pressure from the white house also played 
a role he said 
most reporters have been given monthlong visas 
after a month the situation is fluid although one saudi 
official said its possible major news organizations will be given 
a permanent presence in the kingdom 
the arrival of hundreds of journalists prompted the us defense 
department to disband its 17member media pool sunday two weeks 
after the first journalists arrived in the country under the pool 
arrangement writers photographers and television journalists made 
their work available to all news organizations 
some pool reporters complained about restrictions imposed by the 
pentagon but praised the access they were given to ontheground 
operations 
most irksome was the pentagons initial prohibition on the use 
of soldiers names and hometowns on saturday the pentagon lifted 
the ban saying the military situation had relaxed 
the pentagon and the saudi government still bar reporters from 
using exact locations when writing about military activities 
navy lt cmdr gregg hartung the pool coordinator said he 
thought the pool worked better than in the past during the 
december invasion of panama for example reporters were furious at 
being penned up away from any action for 24 hours 
i think we still have room for improvement hartung said 
for instance he would have liked daily briefings with operation 
desert shield commanders to give the pool uptodate details of 
the deployment 
but that was impossible because the operation was run out of 
riyadh the saudi capital while the reporters were based 200 miles 
away in dhahran scene of the major deployment 
the invasion of reporters has created a new set of headaches for 
american and saudi officials 
so many people are vying for limited space on official tours 
such as the visit to see three republican senators that the 
pentagon has given first priority to american reporters 
the saudis have also been besieged by reporters trying to get on 
sponsored trips a near riot broke out among reporters pushing to 
get on buses when the saudis took a group to the border with iraq 
its a media war thats the main feature said alix van 
buren of la repubblica of italy 
bring in a couple thousand copies of scoop said time 
magazines jay peterzell referring to evelyn waughs satirical 
novel about covering an african war a lot of people want to

after flirting with a tax increase and drawing 
political fire back home in georgia house republican whip newt 
gingrich is breaking with the bush administration and returning to 
his antitax political roots 
gingrich one of the gops most fervent antitax crusaders 
during the 1980s says he will propose billions of dollars in tax 
cuts when white house and congressional budget negotiations resume 
next month 
i think this kind of a tax package represents the best lessons 
of the 1980s in how to get economic growth and it avoids the 
greatest dangers of the 1970s which were to raise taxes going 
straight into a recession he said last week 
gingrichs announcement comes just a month after he told budget 
negotiators he would cosponsor and help line up gop votes for a 
50 billion defiit reduction plan that included up to 25 billion 
in new taxes 
that was the target budget negotiators agreed to shoot for after 
president bush in june abandoned his notaxincrease pledge and 
announced that new tax revenues were needed to reduce the deficit 
which is projected to reach 170 billion in fiscal 1991 
gingrich initially was outraged by bushs reversal calling it a 
mistake that will result in a severe blow to the presidents 
credibility and a significant blow to the republican party 
but he later bowed to administration pressure donned his house 
leadership hat and agreed to help bush strike a deficit reduction 
deal with congressional democrats 
he said at the time he could support a budget agreement with up 
to 25 billion in new tax revenues if it doesnt raise income tax 
rates and includes spending cuts budget reforms adequate defense 
spending and a capital gains tax cut 
gingrichs willingness to support new taxes however quickly 
became a major issue in his reelection campaign in georgias 6th 
district 
democrat david worley making his second try to unseat gingrich 
has blasted him repeatedly for backing higher taxes in washington 
while pledging in fundraising appeals to fight new taxes he says 
gingrich is proposing tax cuts now because he knows hes in 
trouble at home on the tax issue 
but gingrich said his new tax stance is simply a recognition 
that the equation has changed in the past month because of the 
persian gulf crisis and increasing evidence that the economy is 
headed into a recession 
id find it very hard to understand an argument for a tax 
increase in the face of a weak economy he said 
gingrich concedes that the administration isnt excited about 
his tax cut proposal neither is his fellow gop budget negotiator 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota the senior republican on the house 
budget committee 
i think it is interesting theology and i love tax cuts but i 
am not sure tax cuts are indicated at this stage of the game 
frenzel said in a telephone interview 
frenzel said a move toward tax cuts now likely would be 
interpreted by the credit markets here and abroad as an abandonment 
of efforts to reduce the deficit 
and if that happened he said interest rates would rise because 
we will be considered an unwise risk for creditors and we will 
find that we have an interestrate induced recession 
frenzel agreed with gingrich that worsening economic conditions 
coupled with the military crisis precipitated by iraqs invasion of 
kuwait have changed the dynamics of the budget negotiations 
almost everybody who did not want a successful budget 
agreement has a lot better reason to keep us from getting one he 
said but to me theyre all less significant than the reason 
that we started with and that is that we have a fiscal policy that 
is out of control

bulgarias police were instructed today 
to use force if necessary to prevent further violence a day after 
anticommunist demonstrators torched and ransacked the governing 
socialist party headquarters 
hundreds of police stood guard around the partially gutted 
building blocking off access to the nearby government offices and 
the presidential palace 
the socialist party held a rally in downtown sofia near party 
headquarters this evening apparently designed to show its strength 
despite the attack thousands attended a state radio reporter said 
the party headquarters was set ablaze late sunday by a small 
group of demonstrators who broke away from a larger anticommunist 
protest throwing torches into its windows 
they were incensed by the red star the symbol of communist 
oneparty rule on top of the building the socialist party is the 
heir to the communist party which changed its name earlier this 
year in a bid to retain power 
reformers in the party ousted hardline communist leader todor 
zhivkov in november and won a majority in june nationwide 
elections under the socialist banner 
the main opposition group condemned the assault today and said 
it could endanger the transition to democracy 
do not let yourselves be provoked keep the public peace calm 
down the impatient the union of democratic forces said in a 
statement carried by the official bta news agency let us show in 
these dramatic hours that we are sensible and civilized people 
several firemen and bystanders near the burning building were 
injured by falling debris a doctor on the scene reported one 
demonstrator said police clubbed protesters inside the building 
but there was no word of casualties 
the general prosecutors office said today that more than 50 
people had been arrested 
the targeted building dating to the 1950s is sofias largest 
and had been the communists headquarters 
in the protest demonstrators shouted down with the 
communists while others threw burning torches through windows of 
the building witnesses said 
inside in areas of the headquarters untouched by flames 
protesters destroyed furniture and hurled papers and other items 
onto the street 
state radio said looters later came to carry off television sets 
and computers from the building 
firefighters said demonstrators blocked their way and cut most 
of their hoses the fire was eventually extinguished early today 
more than five hours after it began 
president zhelyu zhelev cut short a holiday in the black sea 
resort of varna and went on national radio to appeal for calm 
the country is in danger of drifting into a military 
dictatorship zhelev said in an appeal for law and order 
as firefighters fought to control the blaze sunday night the 
commander of the national police announced that the main roads into 
sofia had been closed to all but those on official business today 
vehicles were allowed to pass after their occupants produced 
identification 
bulgarian media carried a statement issued by the unidentified 
commander announcing that police across the nation had been placed 
on alert so that no similar incidents happen in other regions 
the crowd outside the building swelled to as many as 10000 
people at one point about 800 police officers armed with clubs 
watched but made no move to disperse the crowd 
vice president atanas semerdzhiev a socialist ordered police 
not to use force against the protesters 
before it was brought under control the fire spread to two 
neighboring buildings belonging to the socialist party firemen 
said several apartments in nearby residential buildings also caught 
fire 
last week the parliament voted to remove red stars and other 
communist symbols from buildings after an activist threatened to 
set himself on fire 
the activist 20yearold plamen stanchev said he would burn 
himself by 9 pm sunday unless all communist symbols had 
disappeared 
when the deadline passed without removal of the red star from 
the party headquarters he poured what witnesses said was a 
flammable liquid over himself but was prevented from striking a 
match 
a small group of demonstrators set fire to the building less 
than 30 minutes later the witnesses said 
the socialists were the only former communist party in eastern 
europe to win elections after the democratic upheaval that swept 
the region last year 
but the socialists have seen their popularity steadily erode 
since the elections as the countrys economy deteriorates

against a desperate tide of refugees 
fleeing kuwait a widening stream of jordanian palestinians are 
heading the other way seeking fortunes in what they see as a 
promising province of iraq 
a little more stability comes each day in kuwait and 
palestinians are taking advantage said khanchand ahuja an 
electrical engineer who left behind six years of kuwaiti life to 
take his family home to india 
heavily laden sedans join the trucks carrying grain and steel 
through this besieged outpost to iraq 
about 2000 people crossed into iraq on sunday reported a 
senior security official at the border station this is picking 
up fast 
refugees agreed that because of tumultuous conditions 
iraqioccupied kuwait is ripe for adventuresome jobseekers 
entrepreneurs and criminals 
they said hoodlums from among the large palestinian population 
joined iraqi troops in the first wave of looting and are now 
stealing property at gunpoint despite iraqi attempts to restore 
order 
other palestinians are buying up refugees electronic goods 
furniture and clothing to resell in baghdad for big profits 
hatem elagha a young palestinian leaving his native kuwait to 
study in georgia said many jordanian palestinians who were on 
vacation or who fled after the invasion are returning 
things are stabilizing some and they want to protect their 
jobs and family holdings he said the politics dont matter to 
them 
an estimated 350000 jordanians mostly palestinians were 
settled in kuwait at the time iraq invaded and annexed it 
officials said 12000 of them left but many are going back 
among many jordanians political sympathies clearly lie with 
iraqi leader saddam husseins declared championship of the arab 
cause 
the 150mile twolane blacktop road between the jordanian 
capital amman and ruweishid is not only the escape route from 
iraq and kuwait but also a lifeline that jordanian road crews are 
hard at work improving 
on a drive to the border reporters saw a dozen trucks loaded to 
capacity with heavy steel ibeams and angle iron useful for 
building artillery platforms bunkers and bridges for tanks there 
also were open trucks piled high with wheat 
at an offlimits section of the border crossing reporters saw 
several heavy covered commercial trucks roll into iraq in the 
predawn darkness 
officials neither confirm nor deny that goods are crossing into 
iraq in spite of un sanctions 
on a few buses the drivers could hardly see around huge 
portraits of saddam taped to the windshield 
this problem came on an american wind and we are all with 
saddam said dr ahmed dagens a jordanian helping treat refugees 
in a makeshift red crescent first aid center his three colleagues 
nodded in agreement 
refugees agreed that essential items were rapidly disappearing 
from the market in iraq and kuwait 
kuwait is in a terrible state terrible said an indian 
petrochemical engineer who spoke freely when assured he would not 
be named i dont see how it can hold out 
he said kuwait relied on two water treatment plants and two 
power stations 
soon the filters and parts will go or the water works could 
be hit by a bomb he said the electrical plants could stop 
without water and refrigeration a million people could die 
ahuja confirmed that kuwaits essential services were crippled 
but he said iraq was making major efforts to bring stability 
looters were hanged in the market discouraging further raids 
he said bread shops and banks were opening one at a time iraqi 
officers took over abandoned police stations 
people described mass destruction when iraqi forces rolled into 
kuwait on aug 2 
they smashed everything and carried away everything they 
could the indian engineer said 
he said he watched thirsty troops looking for cold drinks break 
open what they thought was a refrigerator it was a computer worth 
a halfmillion dollars

later nunn told reporters that a briefing the senators received

sufficient force was in place to deter an iraqi attack on saudi 
arabia 
an iraqi attack on saudi arabia would be national suicide 
said nunn dga 
senate republican leader bob dole asked if he came away from

nunn said the senators would discuss the need for a bigger 
multinational force in saudi arabia with arabs on the front lines 
but did not answer directly when asked whether he thought egypt 
should send more troops 
of an bigger arab role on the front line nunn said i think 
thats important militarily but also more importantly politically 
and psychologically 
several of the senators when asked by reporters acknowledged 
that the presence of american hostages in iraq complicated efforts 
to resolve the nearly monthold middle east standoff 
but they said the hostage situation alone could not be the force 
behind us policy 
you cant run foreign policy on hostages said sen jake 
garn rutah if you did no american would be safe anywhere in 
the world 
the senators visited troops at an airbase in northeast saudi 
arabia shaking hands and asking about the desert conditions while 
being trailed by a horde of us and foreign media 
whats your biggest problem over here nunn asked several 
members of a marine light helicopter division and the armys 82nd 
airborne divisions 
no mail sir was the most common answer 
others in the group said they were impressed with troop morale 
in the harsh desert conditions 
the morale here is just unbelieveable sen john warner 
rva and the ranking republican on armed services said after an 
paratrooper recounted an exercise in 140degree heat 
the people back home are with you warner said 
in a brief tarmac interview warner said he was confident the 
american public could support the deployment even if it dragged on 
the weak link in this dilemma isnt the people back home 
warner said asked if by that he expected other nations to 
eventually loosen their enforcement of sanctions against iraq 
warner said i dont think so i certainly hope not 
other senators making the trip all republicans were don 
nickles of oklahoma steve symms of idaho alfonse damato of new 
york and connie mack of florida

tariq aziz iraqs cigarchomping foreign 
minister arguably has the toughest assignment in world diplomacy 
defending saddam husseins invasion of kuwait and the holding of 
thousands of western men women and children as hostages 
aziz the only christian in saddams 25man cabinet heads the 
iraqi presidents diplomatic offensive in the confrontation with 
the united states over baghdads aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
hes a sly fox and hes utterly in saddams pocket said 
hansheino kopietz a londonbased middle east analyst who knows 
him 
the silverhaired aziz who speaks english and often appears in 
public in olive drab military uniform has shown a flair for 
survival but like the rest of saddams inner circle aziz knows 
that if saddam goes down so does he 
the urbane aziz 54 has escaped the periodic purges of top 
political and military officials since saddam came to power 11 
years ago 
he survived an assassination attempt in baghdad on april 1 
1980 when members of the iranianbacked ad dawa islami or islamic 
call detonated a bomb several people were killed 
the bombing was one of a series of terrorist attacks by 
proiranian militants in iraq that was a factor in saddams 
decision to invade iran in 1980 launching the eightyear gulf war 
hes one of the brighter people in the regime kopietz said 
hes made a lot of friends in the united nations which gives him 
some diplomatic clout but he serves his master well and does what 
hes told 
aziz has been a close associate of saddam since the 1950s when 
they were in the baath arab socialist party underground struggling 
to overthrow the britishimposed monarchy 
in those days saddam was a street fighter and gunman aziz 
with a degree in english literature from baghdad university worked 
on party organization and propaganda 
the baath succeeded in seizing power in 1968 
saddam later became vice president and the real power behind the 
head of state president ahmad hassan albakr 
aziz was one of the partys leading ideologues and editor of its 
mouthpiece the althawra daily newspaper 
after saddam shunted albakr aside in 1979 aziz was named 
information minister and became a member of the baaths national 
command and the ruling revolutionary command council headed by 
saddam 
he is considered one of the most eloquent defenders of the 
baghdad government always available to foreign reporters for 
interviews in his booklined office 
given the totalitarian and ruthless nature of saddams rule 
aziz has no easy task 
the invasion and annexation of kuwait and saddams decision to 
hold several thousand americans and britons hostage in baghdad to 
deter western attack has made his job even more unenviable 
in a government dominated by sunni moslems the christian aziz 
has no independent power base of his own 
he was born near the northern city of mosul into a humble family 
of nestorian christians an ancient sect that still speaks aramaic 
the language spoken in the time of jesus christ his given name was 
mikhail yuhanna 
he changed it to the moslemsounding name he now uses 
aziz was named foreign minister and deputy prime minister in 
1981 
like other iraqi leaders he blamed the united states for the 
gulf war claiming washington had covertly encouraged the 
revolutionary government in tehran to provoke iraq so washington 
could regain control of iran 
aziz argued that iraq was not the aggressor iraq invaded iran 
in september 1980 but claimed the war had begun several weeks 
earlier with border attacks by the iranians 
during the latter stages of the war when saddam wanted to 
internationalize it so that iran would be weakened and respond to 
his peace appeals aziz and other leaders became less antiamerican 
in 1986 after the united states restored relations with 
baghdad broken in 1967 the antiamerican rhetoric stopped 
but it flared again several months ago saddam accused the 
united states and the west of a concerted campaign against iraq to 
prevent it from expanding its military power he claimed that 
western opposition was a prelude to an israeli preemptive strike

thousands of students commandeered buses 
and blocked streets monday in the latest of a series of protests 
against a move to give downtrodden castes a bigger share of 
government jobs 
the unrest began three three weeks ago when prime minister vp 
singh announced a plan to set quotas to guarantee more jobs to 
lower castes on monday singh said quotas would also be introduced 
for lowerincome groups regardless of caste 
hindus who make up at least 85 percent of indias people have 
a complex social system of castes and subcastes dividing them into 
a rigid hierarchy highcaste hindus hold the majority of 
government jobs and are usually richer than lower castes 
under the latest quotas the number of reserved government jobs 
would rise to nearly 60 percent with the rest awarded on merit 
the government employs about 18 million people in this country of 
880 million people 
the government says socially backward classes make up about 
half of the population and that the quotas would help equitable 
distribution of income 
opponents say the quota system would lead to the employment and 
promotion of unqualified people and would heighten caste tensions 
discrimination on the basis of caste is banned by law but in 
practice the caste system still permeates indian society 
especially in rural areas 
in new delhi students protesting singhs proposals ordered 
passengers off city buses broke the windows deflated tires and 
left the buses blocking major intersections 
riot police chased students from one protest site to another 
police said at least 50 youths were arrested at one point 
government employees on their lunch break joined the protesting 
students 
what they are doing is right a grayhaired government 
officer told a policeman trying to disperse the students your 
children and mine wont get jobs 
we are not going to take it we want jobs said somesh a 
teenage student who was stopping buses in connaught place the 
citys busiest commercial area 
most of the citys shops and schools were closed some closed to 
support the agitation others because they feared vandalism 
while the protests were under way singh was in parliament 
proposing more quotas this time for lowincome groups 
he said 5 percent to 10 percent of all government jobs would be 
reserved for lowincome groups but the eligibility standards would 
be decided later

this resort city is helping to throw 
a labor day weekend party in hopes that last years violence will 
be forgotten and that college students will continue to come to 
play on the beach and spend money 
but some are urging a boycott of virginia beach 
more than 100000 young people jammed the citys beachfront 
strip for the 1989 labor day weekend many were students from 
predominantly black colleges and universities along the east coast 
who have gathered here for an informal endofsummer party for 
nearly 10 years 
but violence and looting broke out city and state police and 
the national guard cleared the beachfront thoroughfare violent 
clashes between riot stickwielding police and young blacks 
degenerated into a riot 
hundreds of people were arrested or cited and more than 50 were 
injured most of those arrested were local residents not college 
students damage was estimated at more than 14 million 
both sides blamed the other 
the students said city officials and merchants had been hostile 
and rude charging high prices and harassing them 
city officials said it was simply a problem of too many people 
in too small an area with too little to do along the 24blocklong 
strip 
several groups are calling for black students to stay away this 
year 
we are doing this to help economically empower black americans 
and to protest the injustice done last year said c david 
walker a student at norfolk state university and part of group 
called concerned black awareness council 
he and others are promoting gatherings in washington baltimore 
and atlantic beach sc 
the virginia beach gathering started nearly a decade ago when a 
group of black fraternity and sorority members gathered on the 
beach from 1985 to 1988 the party had a promoter who called it 
greekfest and worked with the city to provide entertainment 
problems in 1988 with scattered vandalism and rowdiness had 
merchants pressuring the city council to do something about 
greekfest the council passed stricter alcohol and beach behavior 
laws and denied greekfest organizers the use of city buildings for 
dances 
a civic panel appointed to investigate the 1989 riots for the 
city council found that both sides went into the holiday weekend 
with a defensive attitude the group said there was enough blame to 
go around and that both sides needed to work together in planning 
for 1990 
the council then appointed another citizens group to plan the 
event with the condition that no tax money be spent to entertain 
the guests 
part of the festivities will be moved to a park several miles 
from the beach with business help the committee booked two days 
of musical entertainment at the park 
there will be a job fair a religioushuman services conference 
parade football game and prayer breakfast plus beach games and 
swimsuit and dance competitions celebrities such as new york 
knicks star patrick ewing christine king farris daughter of the 
rev martin luther king jr and naacp executive director benjamin 
hooks are expected to attended 
there will be planned festivities at the beach too 
but walker and other students still want to boycott the city 
all this the boycott is is to say for one fourday weekend 
where we would normally spend our money in a predominantly white 
community were going to spend it in a black community said 
mark thompson a howard university junior 
a boycott would be bad news for linwood branch president of the 
virginia beach hotel and motel association 
branch and others said they dont know what to expect from the 
weekend and hotel reservations at the beach are down nearly 70 
percent 
usually were about full for the weekend at this point said 
branch owner of a resort and shop on the beach labor day is 
normally the biggest weekend of the season that only lasts 60 to 70 
days now

rescuers monday recovered the bodies 
of 69 coal miners and tunneled toward about 100 others trapped by 
an explosion although there was no sign they were alive 
yugoslavias federal trade union demanded that all those 
responsible for the accident from local officials to government 
ministers resign the cause of what would be yugoslavias worst 
mining accident has not been determined but the investigation is 
focusing on an accumulation of coal dust or methane gas 
one miner who was working near the surface was pulled out of the 
mine alive shortly after the blast early sunday bosko zelic a 
member of the kreka mines managing board told reporters it was 
unlikely any more survivors would be found 
the mining minister radisa gacic said in a statement that the 
tragedy should not be compounded by by endangering the lives of 
any of the rescuers 
but rescue teams refused to give up hope as they reached a point 
about 300 yards from an area where the shaft widens that extra 
space could have dissipated the force of the blast said rescue 
technician rasim kekic 
if anybody happened to be in that spot during the explosion 
he may have lived through it he said 
rescuers had been working round the clock since the explosion to 
clear tons of concrete and other debris that blocked underground 
shafts they were concentrating on clearing or building new 
ventilation shafts in case some of the miners still were alive 
the inital blast left a crater 45 feet wide and about 15 feet 
deep where the entrance to the mine used to be huge blocks of 
concrete that formed the mine mouth lay strewn about the area and 
the charred remains of a coal conveyer system were being removed by 
workers 
mining inspector mehmed zulic said that the number of mining 
helmets and lamps that were issued indicated 170 men were 
underground at the time of the blast all but two had been 
identified 
earlier zelic had said the number of those trapped underground 
was 179 
the miners at kreka about 90 miles west of belgrade returned 
saturday from a weeklong strike that ended with a promised 100 
percent raise in pay that averaged 270 a month speculation about 
the explosion focused on the possibility that volatile coal dust 
and methane gas built up in the mine one of the nations oldest 
during the strike 
yugoslavias previous worst mining disaster occurred when 128 
miners died in 1965 ninety men were killed in a methane explosion 
at a coal mine last november

saturday that sanctions the use of military might to enforce a 
unordered trade embargo 
cbs news reported that iraqi captains have received new orders 
not to defy the embargo but to allow us warships to stop and 
search their vessels cbs did not cite a source for the report by 
its pentagon correspondent 
the multinational force got a boost today when the small gulf 
state of qatar agreed to allow use of its military facilities by 
the forces confronting iraq qatar has traditionally cooperated 
militarily with britain and france 
in paris the military chiefs of nine western european nations 
gathered to work out plans to enforce the united nations embargo 
the united nations said secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar will meet thursday in jordan with iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz to engage in a full exchange of views on the crisis 
it would be the first formal un attempt to mediate the crisis 
which iraqi president saddam hussein precipitated by invading 
kuwait on aug 2 and annexing the oilrich emirate

the us british french hungarian and danish embassies were 
among those surrounded sunday varying services such as water 
power and communications were cut to the us west german french 
canadian japanese danish missions 
iraq last week ordered embassies in kuwait closed but most 
nations said they did not recognize iraqs takeover of its neighbor 
and refused to heed the order there have been no reports of iraqis 
moving on the embassy holdouts

seized by iraqi troops as it set out for the saudi border and was 
taken to baghdad 
the united states sent about 100 diplomats and dependents from

iraqs invasion of kuwait prompted several nations to send 
warships to the region and the united states has moved dozens of 
warplanes and about 60000 troops in saudi arabia to prevent 
further iraqi aggression

but attention also turned to diplomacy 
a day after the un security council authorized the use of 
military force to back the trade embargo it ordered against iraq on 
aug 6 perez de cuellar offered to meet with iraqs top diplomat 
in baghdad aziz said he planned to meet with the un chief but 
declined to say whether iraq was prepared to compromise on kuwaits 
status he did say however that his country would listen to any 
proposal 
scowcroft said the united states will not back down from its 
insistence that iraq withdraw from kuwait but beyond that were 
prepared to talk about anything 
also in baghdad palestine liberation organization chief yasser 
arafat proposed today that an arab peacekeeping force be deployed 
in kuwait for six months to replace iraqi troops while elections 
are held

tens of thousands of blacks went on 
strike monday to demand an end to factional fighting that has 
killed more than 500 people anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
angrily blamed police and proapartheid whites for the violence 
tutu called for creation of a new police force acceptable to 
blacks as he addressed about 6000 people gathered at a funeral for 
seven anc supporters killed in the battles 
the evidence is overwhelming that the police have not been 
impartial he told the cheering listeners 
law and order minister adriaan vlok later rejected charges that 
police took sides in the conflict he said in a statement that 
individual officers may have acted improperly but that the force as 
a whole tried to maintain order 
the strike left the streets of soweto a sprawling black 
township of 25 million people nearly deserted many businesses in 
soweto and neighboring johannesburg were forced to close or operate 
with skeleton staffs most trains and buses were almost empty or 
did not run 
the strike was called by the antiapartheid soweto civic 
association to protest the violence police behavior and to mourn 
our dead residents in several neighboring townships also took 
part 
heavily armed south african troops and police in armored 
vehicles patrolled the townships police commanders reported no new 
violence in the johannesburg area 
savage fighting erupted in the townships around johannesburg on 
aug 12 pitting xhosas and other blacks loyal to the african 
national congress against zulus tied to the conservative inkatha 
movement police said at least 515 people were killed 
police said monday at least 10 blacks were killed during the 
weekend in the eastern province of natal which has been the scene 
of factional fighting since 1986 more than 5000 people have died 
there 
tutu a top antiapartheid leader passionately denounced the 
government and police for the violence he charged the unrest was 
fomented to frustrate blacks struggle to be free in south africa 
where the black majority has no voice in national affairs 
our freedom is at hand tutu said to tumultuous cheers 
and there are those whites who say they dont want us to have 
our freedom so they have made us fight one another 
zulus and xhosas are the two largest tribes in south africa but 
tutu denied the fighting was caused by tribal divisions we have 
never quarreled because of tribalism it is a lie it is a lie 
he shouted in anger 
other black leaders also attacked the government charging that 
apartheid created the ethnic tensions that triggered the fighting 
they called for abolition of the hostels where zulu migrant workers 
live those hostels have often come under attack 
it is a violence that has been organized by evil forces 
white and black said senior anc leader walter sisulu 
at the funeral anc honor guards in khaki uniforms stood around 
the coffins giving clenched fist salutes the stadium was filled 
with chanting and singing blacks many wearing the black green and 
gold colors of the anc 
i am proud i am black the crowd chanted in unison with tutu 
government and police leaders deny the charges of bias and 
insist security forces have been impartial elite army battalions 
were sent into the townships during the weekend to help police 
the government and many neutral observers portray the conflict 
as mostly tribal fighting linked to the power struggle between the 
anc and inkatha 
inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi has blamed the anc for 
instigating the fighting accusing it of wanting to crush all 
opposition 
president fw de klerk is negotiating with the anc and other

personal incomes grew 06 percent in july and 
consumer spending rose 05 percent the government said monday in a 
report that some analysts contend points to a stronger economy than 
expected 
stephen s roach senior economist for morgan stanley amp co in 
new york said the growth in both areas was important since it 
could tend to lessen the effect of the middle east crisis on the 
economy 
it holds out the hope that we might be able to scrape by 
without going into recession he said 
in another upbeat report the national association of realtors 
said existing home sales rose for a second straight month in july 
house resales rose 33 percent following a 09 percent gain in june 
the increase reflected decreasing mortgage rates at the end of 
july but the trend has reversed since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of 
kuwait and analysts predict a slowdown in sales 
the commerce department said consumer spending which represents 
twothirds of the nations economic activity totaled 367 
trillion that was up 166 billion from the previous month 
although the pace was slower than junes 1 percent increase 
a commerce spokesman said the slower pace resulted from fewer 
purchases of automobiles food and clothing 
nevertheless william k macreynolds forecasting director for 
the us chamber of commerce called the consumption expenditures 
for june and july a bright spot 
if the july consumption level can be maintained for the next 
two months consumption in the third quarter will increase at an 
annual rate of 23 percent over the second quarter he said 
this would be the highest quarterly increase since the third 
quarter of 1989 
but macreynolds and others said the inflationary effects of 
rising oil prices likely will reduce spending 
so far however there have been no horror stories 
according to economist sandra shaber of the futures group a 
washington management consulting firm 
people havent been canceling auto purchases she said 
retailers are complaining about soft business but theres no 
sign of further deterioration because of the middle east crisis 
the commerce department also reported that personal incomes 
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 467 trillion a 
263 billion increase from june it was the largest increase since 
a 07 percent gain in march 
the report said americans income after taxes increased 05 
percent down slightly from 06 percent a month earlier 
the gains were primarily from wages and salaries rather than 
dividends and interest payments and things like that ms shaber 
said it suggests some strength in the economy and thats money 
that people spend 
wages and salaries rose 162 billion after a 159 billion 
increase in june 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable 
income was unchanged from junes 49 percent 
a higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital 
since funds thus would be available domestically for business 
investment americans savings rate for all of 1989 was 46 percent 
on the spending side the increase in personal consumption 
which includes everything except interest payments on debt rose 
166 billion down from junes gain of 361 billion 
spending on durable goods bigticket items expected to last 
more than three years increased 53 billion it was the second 
consecutive increase after five months of declines 
nondurable spending however slipped 17 billion following a 
135 billion gain in june spending on services was up 130 
billion

interior secretary manuel lujans remark 
that yellowstone national park was devastated by fire two years 
ago is being criticized as too harsh 
critics also are upset that lujan said an apocalyptic group that 
owns land north of the park poses no threat to yellowstone park 
officials have warned some activities of the church universal and 
triumphant could harm the parks geothermal resources and its 
wildlife 
during a visit to the park in wyoming last week lujan said it 
was his impression that the 1988 fires in and near the park 
devastated yellowstone that was in sharp contrast to efforts 
by state and federal agencies to play down the extent of the damage 
lujans comments reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of two 
of the most serious issues facing the land and the people of park 
and gallatin counties sen max baucus dmont said in a letter 
to lujan 
baucus said lujans statements were out of line with public 
statements and professional judgments of your own park service land 
managers 
jeanne marie souvigney of the greater yellowstone coalition 
agreed 
he must not understand the issues to make statements like 
that she said there has been a big educational effort that 
the park was changed by the fires not devastated 
lujan last week met privately with elizabeth clare prophet the 
churchs spiritual leader in an effort to hear the churchs side 
of the conflicts with the park and to try to bring the two sides 
closer to conciliation 
he said the conflicts are not insurmountable and that he 
believed the park and the church can be good neighbors 
the church was criticized last spring when an estimated 31000 
gallons of diesel and gasoline leaked from three tanks at its 
underground shelter complex the shelters are intended to protect 
followers during what prophet says is a 12year dark cycle of 
global danger and catastrophe 
steve goldstein a spokesman for lujan said lujans intention 
in meeting with prophet was to try to bring the park and church 
closer together 
park officials have testified in public hearings and before 
congress that some activities of the church threaten the greater 
yellowstone ecosystem the concerns include development affecting 
wildlife migration patterns and the churchs drilling of a well in 
a geothermal aquifer 
church officials have said they are considerate of wildlife 
migration in the fencing of their property they also have promised 
not to develop the geothermal well if it would pose any risk to 
yellowstones geysers

president mikhail s gorbachev on monday urged 
arab countries to unite against iraqi aggression as he met with the 
egyptian foreign minister the tass news agency said 
gorbachev emphasized to esmat abdelmeguid the necessity of 
bringing the arab factor to bear more strongly on iraq the 
official news agency said 
the circumstances are such that arabs should show their 
ability to unify quickly and to make joint decisions in their own 
interests and in the interests of the whole world tass 
paraphrased gorbachev as telling the egyptian official 
this would be highly appreciated by the international 
community he reportedly added 
at an aug 10 summit in cairo 12 of the 21 nations in the arab 
league voted to condemn iraq for seizing kuwait and agreed to send 
arab soldiers to help defend saudi arabia against a possible iraqi 
offensive only egypt morocco and syria have contributed troops 
meanwhile the evacuation of the families of soviet oil workers 
and other technical specialists from baghdad was being planned a 
total of 983 soviet dependents have been living in iraq and all of 
them are slated to depart on special aeroflot flights by sept 1 
tass said 
gorbachev has called iraqs aug 2 invasion and subsequent 
annexation of kuwait an act of treachery and a blatant 
violation of international law 
the soviet union voted saturday for a un security council 
resolution allowing the use of force to impose an international 
economic embargo on iraq a longtime soviet ally but foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze said sunday that the soviet navy 
which has two warships in the persian gulf region would not itself 
use force 
shevardnadze denied that the soviet union was restraining itself 
for the sake of its 7791 citizens including 193 military 
advisers still in iraq 
there is no direct connection between the fact that we are not 
counting on the use of force and the evacuation of our citizens 
from iraq he said 
shevardnadze reiterated the soviet position that the gulf crisis 
should be resolved peacefully and politically rather than 
militarily 
another way other than a political solution would mean a 
catastrophe be told reporters 
despite the unwillingness to use force against its old ally 
soviet officials have maintained that moscow is in complete 
solidarity with western governments against iraqi president saddam 
hussein 
the resolutions of the security council will be strictly 
enforced tass said in summarizing gorbachevs remarks to 
abdelmeguid and iraq must draw the correct conclusions from the 
solidarity shown by the international community in these 
resolutions and must not try to aggravate the situation but 
rather seek from its side a way out of the impasse

a winddriven brush fire that mushroomed 
from 120 acres to 2500 in an afternoon killed two firefighters and 
destroyed 18 summer homes authorities said 
the firefighters whose names were not immediately released 
were apparently overcome by smoke early today a spokesman said 
the wind must have changed and got them disoriented with the 
smoke and trapped them in there said bevan killpack uinta 
national forest fire information officer that happens if you 
dont have people watching the behavior of the fire 
about 200 firefighters battled the blaze overnight and fire 
bosses issued a call for 160 more officials said dozens of 
residents were evacuated from the path of the flames which were 
sent racing by canyon wind gusting to 40 mph 
dick buehler deputy incident commander told more than 100 
residents at a noon meeting that only 18 homes and cabins in the 
swiss alpine subdivision had been confirmed destroyed a figure 
revised sharply downward from the 50 homes fire officials had 
believed were burned 
top priority was given to saving 300 homes in the devils hole 
lime canyon and snake creek areas the homes destroyed were in 
devils hole said uinta forest spokeswoman loyal clark the fire 
was partly in the forest 
its a summerhome area where the fires concentrated and 
most of the people in there have left and gone back to their homes 
most of those people had residences in salt lake city and other 
areas sheriffs deputy jeff winterton said 
the number of those who fled was not immediately known 
smoke from the blaze a halfmile south of midway drifted over 
salt lake city about 30 miles to the northeast 
joan smith a salt lake real estate broker visiting the area 
said the smoke in the afternoon was so heavy it looked like dusk 
the sun was blood red it was so thick she said 
when word came that flames were fast approaching the dahl home 
family members grabbed photo albums important documents and their 
two dogs 
we just freaked out millie dahl said the house is 
totally gone we didnt get our clothes our truck another car 
our snowmobile and the snowcat out of there in time 
mrs dahl 39 her husband will 48 and the couples three 
teenage children spent the night with friends their house in the 
swiss alpine neighborhood was one of the few permanently inhabited 
homes to go she said 
i wish we could have had 10 more minutes but the smoke was 
billowing she said it was obvious that there was a problem 
fortunately nobody cried no one got hysterical and no one fell 
apart 
the fire had simmered since thursday or friday until the wind 
sunday pushed the flames up a mountainside into pine forests and 
dry oak brush 
gusts carried embers into adjacent canyons making it difficult 
for firefighters to predict its spread clark said 
fire bosses ordered more crews from wherever they can get 
them said dave smith of the interagency fire center in salt lake 
city 
a call was also put out for more air tankers and helicopters 
firefighters late sunday had one of each officials said 
we need the air tankers really bad because of the threat to 
those structures clark said this looks like our big one of 
the year

the libyan government provided direct 
support in all phases of preparation for an unsuccessful may 30 
terrorist attack on jammed beach resorts near tel aviv israel the 
state department said monday 
in a paper it said was based on information from us sources 
the department said the six assault boats used in the raid were 
launched from the merchant ship tiny star known earlier as the 
inger m 
it said libya provided personnel who accompanied the ship as it 
sailed from a libyan naval base to ras elhilal on libyas 
mediterranean coast there it picked up at least 16 terrorists of 
the palestine liberation front 
the department said the tiny star then left libya for the 
dropoff point west of israel 
after launching the assault boats the tiny star probably 
traveled westsouthwest to blend in with the hundreds of merchant 
ships en route to and from the suez canal the paper said 
the ship was docked at the libyan port of tobruk in midjune and 
was in the harbor of tripoli the libyan capital later that month 
the paper said in late july it said the ship sailed from tripoli 
to piraeus greece 
the department said the tiny star was purchased in april by star 
navigation company of piraeus and sailed from cyprus for tripoli on 
april 10 
libya provided direct support in all phases of preparation for 
the plf attack against israel from assistance in planning the 
attack to providing personnel who accompanied the ship from which 
it was launched the department said 
it said the plf began preparing for the seaborne attack at least 
as early as october 1988 
from late 1988 until the operation was launched training and 
preparations took place in libya at several locations including a 
libyan naval base the paper said 
in a statement accompanying the paper the department said 
the us will retain its sanctions against libya we expect other 
governments will continue their sanctions until libya demonstrates 
concrete durable changes in its support for terrorism and 
cessation of other objectionable behavior 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said libyas 
involvement in this terrorist operation provides one of the 
clearest examples ever established of state sponsorship of 
terrorism and once again highlights the threat libya poses to its 
neighbors and to peace in the region 
four palestinian guerrillas were killed and 12 captured by 
israeli forces in the may 30 attack no israelis were injured 
although tens of thousands were at beaches and resort hotels near 
tel aviv to mark shavuot the jewish holiday that honors the giving 
of the ten commandments

ousted prime minister benazir bhutto 
said monday that charges of illegal weapons possession brought 
against her husband were politically motivated 
this is blackmail she said they are just trying to 
pressure the ppp pakistan peoples party and intimidate me and 
humiliate him 
police filed the charges sunday night against asif ali zardari 
but did not arrest the 37yearold businessman 
ms bhutto said the charges were designed to influence elections 
scheduled for oct 24 she already had expressed doubts that the 
balloting would be free and impartial many pakistanis have 
questioned whether there even will be elections in october 
ms bhuttos 20monthold government was dismissed aug 6 on 
charges of corruption abuse of power and its inability to curb 
relentless ethnic and political violence although she was removed 
under constitutional provisions ms bhutto called it a virtual 
coup 
the new militarybacked government is setting up tribunals to 
investigate corruption zardari who critics contend profited while 
ms bhutto was in power is expected to be the main target 
qazi abid a member of ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party 
also was charged with weapons possession however the charges may 
be dismissed because he is a minister in the new caretaker 
government 
the staterun television on sunday said all arms licences were 
being revoked presumably an attempt to curb repeated shooting 
sprees in the southern province of sindh the broadcast said former 
and current members of pakistans national assembly and senate 
would be allowed to keep their weapons licenses 
the charges stem from a raid saturday of an unregistered jeep 
that belonged to abid police said a large cache of weapons was 
seized and zardaris driver and bodyguard were arrested police 
said some of the weapons were licensed to abid and some to zardari 
in islamabad abid denied the charges

when americans have time to pause in their 
hurryup deployment in saudi arabia they find themselves admiring 
the kingdoms roads and ports which in some cases surpass those in 
the united states 
flying over sgt kenneth woods of avon park fla imagined 
nights in the pitch black desert eating field rations and trying to 
cope with the heat 
instead woods a member of the armys 82nd airborne division 
is staying in a dormlike room in an airconditioned trailer that 
has its own bathroom and shower 
trailer complexes built throughout saudi arabia to house 
construction and oil industry workers are serving as temporary 
homes to american soldiers 
the burgers and fries the saudis bring for dinner at the camp 
are sometimes cold by the time they get there but whos in a 
position to complain said woods 
the saudi government has been remarkably responsive said 
army maj gen gus pagonis who heads the pentagons logistics 
planning in saudi arabia 
because of its oil wealth saudi arabia has over the past 20 
years pushed an aggressive multibilliondollar infrastructure 
program often using american companies and consultants 
we have the money and we want our people to have the best 
possible conditions a saudi official said you cannot be a 
modern society without these things 
at times american military commanders stand in awe as they lead 
reporters through saudi military installations 
this is magnificent air force col john mcbroom said during 
a tour of f15 hangers at a saudi air base where his first tactical 
fighter wing has set up camp these are the best most modern 
facilities ive ever seen 
navy officials are similarly pleased with saudi docks 
we are getting tremendous use of the facilities here adm 
steve clarey told reporters last week as marine tanks trucks 
bulldozers and other equipment were offloaded from us cargo 
ships this is probably one of the most modern ports in the 
world 
so oversized are most saudi military installations that american 
forces have been able to move in without dislodging the saudis from 
hangers or barracks 
the armys 101st airbornes air assault brigade is using a saudi 
airstrip for its helicopters 
this saves a lot of wear and tear that would be caused if we 
had to land over and over again in the sand said col tom 
garrett the brigades commander 
when the huge transport planes carrying american troops and 
equipment land and unload at saudi airfields their cargo is 
shipped into field positions along a highway system that might make 
us urban planners jealous 
wide smooth highways stretch to and from all major cities and 
into some desolate desert it is common to pass construction crews 
working on new secondary roads around the clock 
you expect to be getting stuck in the sand all the time but 
instead youre worrying about the speed limit an army truck 
driver said last week

for single parents in the military 
reserves the possibility of being called to active duty has an 
added worry who will take care of the children 
air force reservist phillip meyer of savannah is preparing for 
that contingency now 
meyer a surgical technician with the 13th contingent hospital 
in warner robins received a call from his unit friday telling him 
to prepare to be activated for at least 30 days and asked if he 
preferred stateside or foreign duty he prefers to stay in the 
united states 
after the call meyer phoned his mother edith meyer who also 
lives in savannah to ask her to take care of his three children 
4yearold christopher 3yearold christin and 2yearold morgan 
then he began wondering what the kids would think if and when he 
goes 
christopher the oldest boy has an idea of what is going on 
meyer said but the two girls are just too young to comprehend that 
their father may have to leave them for a long time 
they know that im in the air force pretty much so that every 
time an airplane flies overhead they say theres daddy said 
meyer as he rocked morgan in his living room theyre used to me 
leaving once a month for drills but i dont know how they will 
handle it if im activated 
however even with three small children meyer said he is just 
like the other reservists trying to get ready noting that his 
commanding officer in warner robins is in a similar situation a 
single parent with two children 
despite uncertainty about which reserve units ultimately will be 
activated meyer said he wasnt surprised that president bush 
agreed with pentagon advice to call up the reserves 
and he said his medical expertise means he may be deployed to 
saudi arabia 
theres the possibility that i will be over there because we 
are a surgical trauma unit thats what we do

politics is driving a new bush administration 
report that will recommend ways to ease the economic toll of 
protecting the northern spotted owl environmentalists charged 
monday 
the governments interagency task force on the spotted owl is to 
recommend by saturday how the forest service should alter its 
timber harvests to protect the threatened owl across millions of 
acres in the pacific northwest 
the panels goal as outlined by agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter is to keep the species alive by enforcing the endangered 
species act without devastating the regions timber industry 
they are trying to find a political solution to a scientific 
problem said mike francis director of the wilderness societys 
national forest program 
if they are going to maintain the integrity of the endangered 
species act there is very little wiggle room for the 
administration he said monday 
frances hunt of the national wildlife federation agreed 
theres very little scientific about the task forces mission 
this is politics and very shortsighted politics its ignoring 
the real issues its only going to make a realistic solution 
harder to find she said 
officials for the forest service agriculture department and 
interior department have declined comment on the task forces work 
over the past week agriculture department spokeswoman jane stevens 
said members of the task force have been directed not to talk to 
the media 
environmentalists maintain that dramatic reductions in logging 
of the regions oldgrowth forests is the only legally and 
scientifically defensible way to take the rare owl off the road to 
extinction 
the government earlier predicted that one owl protection plan 
offered by forest service biologist jack ward thomas and a panel of 
government scientists would cut regional harvests in half and cost 
more than 20000 jobs 
but interior secretary manuel lujan jr said on sunday that the 
task force recommendation likely will not impact as much land or as 
many jobs as has been feared

president bush said today that he 
sees little improvement in chances for a diplomatic settlement to 
the crisis in the middle east but wished un negotiators well in 
their effort 
saddam hussein has been so resistant to complying with 
international law that i dont yet see fruitful negotiations 
bush said during a joint news conference with canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney 
bush reiterated us opposition to any agreement that would back 
away from demands for a complete withdrawal of iraq from kuwait and 
restoration of the former leadership 
bush said the demand for total iraqi withdrawal is not 
negotiable 
there is no room for compromise nor negotiation on that 
point he said 
there is no flexibility on iraq getting out of kuwait and the 
former rulers being permitted to come back bush declared 
theres no compromise on the question on getting the 
legitimate government back and getting the illegitimate invaders 
out he added 
the president also supported his administrations decision to 
cut by twothirds the staff of the iraqi embassy in washington and 
to limit the travel of those remaining to no more than 25 miles 
he disputed that the action announced earlier in the day by the 
state department might provoke tensions further 
nobody will be held against their will theyre all free to 
go were trying to keep some reasonable parallel in terms of 
numbers bush said 
asked if he was more optimistic now than earlier about a 
diplomatic settlement bush said i dont particularly see more 
hope now its so clear that what the world is demanding of 
saddam hussein is get out of kuwait and restore the rightful 
leaders to their place 
the president said he had a call in to un general secretary 
javier perez de cuellar who will meet with iraq officials in 
jordan on thursday in a mediation attempt 
bush insisted however that the united states would not back 
down from the un demand for a full iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
and he said its inconceivable that he perez de cuellar would 
not have that message in his talks its so clear its so 
obvious 
he praised mulroney for its decision to send three ships to the 
persian gulf in support of the trade embargo despite some earlier 
canadian reservations 
for his part mulroney called iraqi president saddam hussein a 
rogue leader who sought to annex another nation and the world 
turned against him 
were very pleased with the decision of the united nations 
security council in backing a full naval blockade of iraq 
mulroney said 
bush and mulroney spoke to reporters under clear skies outside 
the presidents family vacation complex on the atlantic ocean 
mulroney was here for a 24hour visit bush was to return to 
washington on tuesday and will remain in the capital before 
returning here on thursday 
in other comments bush 
said he was very pleased with soviet support for the un 
embargo against iraq even though it doesnt include military help 
he said he had not yet talked to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
about recent developments 
insisted only a tiny minority of the arab world supports 
this outrageous aggression by iraq its true and everyone 
knows its true 
declared he remains on top of the situation despite his 
vacationing he cited meetings with top aides and his planned 
return to washington this week and a previous trip back a week ago 
earlier the white house said iraq has once again reneged on 
its pledge in refusing to allow a full convoy of dependents of 
us diplomats to leave the country

earlier the white house said iraq has once again reneged on 
its pledge in refusing to allow a full convoy of dependents of 
us diplomats to leave the country 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said our best 
estimate is that 63 americans are missing or being held by iraq 
including seven americans known to be picked up over the 
weekend 
fitzwater speaking in advance of a meeting between bush and 
mulroney said the president plans to return to washington on 
tuesday and not resume his maine vacation until thursday 
mulroney his wife mila and their three children arrived at 
bushs seaside home at noon by helicopter 
fitzwater noted that three members of the convoy of american 
dependents to reach the turkish border late sunday had been 
detained 
fiftytwo others were permitted to leave the country 
we are disappointed that the iraqi government has once again 
reneged on its pledge to allow the entire convoy to depart 
fitzwater said weve been in touch with iraqi officials in 
baghdad and washington and continue to urge the safe release of all 
americans and foreign nationals 
in washington us officials said the state department summoned 
iraqs ambassador today and informed him that new restrictions were 
being imposed on the movement of iraqi diplomats in the united 
states 
as to what progress this weeks talks might produce fitzwater 
said it remains to be seen we wouldnt want to characterize 
this effort certainly we are pleased with the role the un is 
taking at this point 
we are willing to give it time and continue to pursue the 
objectives we have in place he added 
fitzwater noted that the united nations had called for a 
complete and unconditional withdrawal of iraq from kuwait

a beirut radio station said monday that 
anglican church envoy terry waite would be the next hostage to be 
freed by proiranian kidnappers in lebanon 
the communistrun voice of the people also said all six american 
hostages would be freed once irans frozen assets in the united 
states are released 
the station respected for its balanced reporting and 
investigative work said it drew the conclusions from interviews 
with iranian and syrian officials as well as shiite moslem leaders 
after the release of five western hostages in the past four months 
the latest to be freed was irish teacher brian keenan who was 
set free friday and is undergoing medical tests in a dublin 
hospital 
the first two were americans robert polhill and frank reed 
freed 10 days apart in april 
swiss orthopedic specialists of the international committee of 
the red cross emanuel christen and elio erriquez were released 
respectively aug 8 and 13 after 10 months in captivity 
sources familiar with the hostage issue are certain that terry 
waite is the next in line for freedom after keenan the station 
said in a 15minute evaluation of the hostage issue 
waite disappeared after leaving a west beirut hotel jan 20 
1987 for a rendezvous with islamic jihad a group that claims to 
hold american hostages terry anderson and thomas sutherland 
no group has claimed holding the 51yearold englishman from 
styal in cheshire and none of the freed hostages has mentioned 
seeing him in captivity 
several lebanese shiite leaders lately asserted that waite was 
alive and well which suggests he is being held separately from the 
12 other hostages in lebanon 
keenan said upon his release that he had seen anderson and 
british journalist john mccarthy in captivity and that both of them 
were well 
voice of the people quoted an unnamed source close to the 
iranian embassy in beirut as saying waite and other european 
hostages held in lebanon would benefit from positive stands 
lately taken by france and britain toward iran it did not 
elaborate 
france in july pardoned and freed from prison five members of a 
proiranian assassination team the french foreign ministry said 
the release of the swiss captives may have been a result of that 
britain has recently distanced itself from the satanic 
verses a novel by british author salman rushdie who is under an 
iranian death order for writing the book foreign secretary douglas 
hurd said this monthy his government had no wish to insult islam 
and understood that rushdies book offended moslems hussein 
musavian director general for west european affairs at the iranian 
foreign minstry said that met conditions set by an iranian 
parliamentary ruling last year for resumption of ties with britain 
there are four britons two west germans and an italian in 
addition to the six americans held in lebanon 
the station quoted the unnamed source as saying the solution 
of the question of iranian frozen assets in the united states will 
promptly lead to the termination of the plight of the american 
hostages in lebanon 
mohammad asfahanian the iranian embassy press officer denied 
in the radio program that his government was seeking financial or 
political rewards for its humanitarian efforts to gain the 
release of the hostages 
we segregate the iranian efforts to get the frozen assets and 
our legal rights from the hostages issue asfahanian was quoted 
as saying 
the radio station did not attempt to explain the discrepancy 
between what its anonymous source and the statement by asfahanian 
iran has an estimated 2 billion of assets frozen in the united 
states as a result of the 1979 overthrow of the prous monarchy 
in tehran and the seizure of the us embassy in tehran 
asfahanian said efforts by the west to gain the release of four 
iranian diplomats missing in lebanon since israels 1982 invasion 
would encourage iran to step up efforts to free the western 
hostages 
he said iranian president hashemi rafsanjanis government has 
lately obtained information that all four missing iranians are 
alive despite assertions by the us government that they were 
dead 
voice of the people quoted shiite leader hussein musawi reputed 
mentor of hostageholding factions in lebanon as saying 1990 was 
supposed to be the year of freedom for all western hostages in 
lebanon 
but the american military intervention in saudi arabia after 
iraqs invasion of kuwait has lessened the chances of freedom for 
the american captives in the foreseable future 
this is the logic of things as they stand now but if they 
take an illogical course soon then it is possible that something 
contrary to what i am saying could happen musawi said

an 84yearold woman dressed in lavender and 
lace nibbled pound cake monday a tanned unshaven man wearing a 
pajama top waited in line for barbecued ribs it was a picnic for 
the homeless 
there were homemade pies ribs and potato salad for 1500 people 
soup kitchens closed their doors and told their regular patrons 
to head to west park on the citys north side for the third annual 
picnic sponsored by shelters hospitals churches and the 
salvation army 
cecil johnston a salvation army shelter director said the 
picnic offered homeless people a chance to experience an event 
that most of us take for granted 
the food missions in pittsburgh usually serve 750 people per 
day johnston said 
the elderly woman in a lace blouse and wellcombed brown wig 
who would identify herself only as marlene said she lost her home 
in april after the friends she lived with died since then shes 
been living in a shelter far from her birth place on a tennessee 
farm 
because of high blood pressure her balance is unsteady and she 
skinned her knees and one hand when she fell on a sidewalk two 
weeks ago so now i use an umbrella to help me get up marlene 
said 
im going to die pretty soon she said without expression 
another woman wanted to make sure she wouldnt be photographed 
as she waited for the food to arrive 
i come to the picnic because of a lack of funds and no home 
im going to try to enjoy myself its a good thing for homeless 
people said the woman who identified herself as loloma

and green pants was slumped over quivering flailing and foaming 
at the mouth

asked 
he said he considered petty crimes so he could get arrested and 
get a bed for the night id be in jail but i least id be 
getting three meals a day he said 
light of life shelter chef lorenzo johnson said the city could 
use 1000 more beds instead people end up sleeping on grates in 
cardboard boxes and sprawled out in the park 
not everyone enjoyed the gathering 
the salvation army just gets money from it said a 
weatheredlooking david ferneza who said he had been accused of

the state department on monday ordered the 
expulsion of 36 members of the iraqi embassy staff and imposed 
strict travel limits on the 19 envoys allowed to remain 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the move came in response to 
the illegal order by iraqi authorities to close the us 
embassy in kuwait the state department has refused to comply with 
that order 
the 19 iraqis permitted to remain in the united states 
including ambassador mohamed almashat reflects the same number of 
americans accredited to the us embassies in iraq and kuwait 
at a news conference at his maine vacation home president bush 
said the united states was trying to keep a reasonable parallel 
in terms of numbers 
he also noted that although many americans cannot leave iraq or 
kuwait iraqis in this country wont be detained 
nobody will be held against their will bush said theyre 
all free to go 
the expelled iraqis were given 72 hours to leave the country a 
us official said among those expelled are seven accredited 
diplomats including all those who deal with commercial affairs 
diplomats at iraqs un mission in new york city are not 
affected by the order 
i dont think it was warranted or called for sami jabbouri 
of the iraqi embassy press office here said about the explusion 
order it is just part of the nerve war by the us authorities 
because they dont want a solution 
ms tutwiler said the iraqi diplomats allowed to remain in the 
united states will be restricted to travel within a 25mile radius 
of washington 
in addition all iraqi diplomatic visas will be changed from 
multiple entry to single entry tighter controls will be imposed on 
unofficial iraqis wishing to visit the united states and use of 
iraqi embassy funds for students and other humanitarian needs will 
be closely controlled she said 
the move follows by three days the iraqi deadline for closing 
the us embassy and other foreign missions in kuwait ms tutwiler 
said that order was in brazen defiance of mandatory un 
security council resolutions 
iraqi authorities have cut off water and electricity at the us 
embassy in kuwait and are restricting all personnel to the embassy 
grounds 
ms tutwiler said the reduced us embassy staff in kuwait has 
enough food and water only to last several more days power is 
being supplied by a generator 
the united states has refused to close its embassy in kuwait 
because it does not want to lend legitimacy to iraqs conquest and 
subsequent annexation of kuwait 
seven more americans were taken by iraqi authorities into 
custody over the weekend bringing the total to 63 42 in iraq and 
21 in kuwait ms tutwiler said 
she said that iraq has repeatedly failed to provide us 
officials with a list of those americans in their custody and 
consular access to them calling that a clear violation of 
international law 
ms tutwiler preceded her announcement of the expulsions with a 
ringing denunciation of iraqs recent behavior 
since its brutal aggression against kuwait on aug 2 iraq has 
demonstrated a blatant disregard for international law and the 
norms of civilized society through a series of acts she said 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger apprised 
almashat of the us actions at a morning meeting at the state 
department 
ms tutwiler said the united states was urging other 
governments particularly those whose embassies have been affected 
by iraqi actions in kuwait to consider taking similar actions 
against iraqs official and nonofficial presence in their 
countries 
she said representatives 34 other countries that are trying to 
maintain embassies in kuwait were invited to a rare state 
department meeting late sunday night for a briefing on the us 
action against iraq 
in another matter ms tutwiler said the department was unable 
to confirm reports that iraq had decided to allow its ships to be 
boarded for inspection 
we certainly hope they are true because that is obviously a 
very peaceful way to go about enforcing this embargo she said

about 20000 supporters of the governing 
socialist party the former communist party rallied monday night 
near their burned party headquarters their leader blamed hawks 
in the opposition for the arson 
about 4000 opposition supporters standing some distance away 
from the rally occasionally whistled in derision but no incidents 
occurred 
anticommunist demonstrators ransacked the building in downtown 
sofia and set it afire sunday night incensed by the red star the 
symbol of communist oneparty rule atop the building 
the blaze wrecked left much of the building and damaged 
adjoining structures 
flames licked at the top story of the sprawling eightfloor 
granite structure the largest in sofia the fire was put out 
shortly after 3 am monday about five hours after it began 
police on monday were told to use truncheons and tear gas if 
necessary to prevent further violence hundreds of officers guarded 
the party headquarters 
maj gen parvan rusinov deputy chief of sofias police force 
said 39 people were arrested after the attack he said most had 
criminal records 
he also said 17 people were injured including two policemen 
state radio said vandals attacked the building before the fire 
and looters carried off television sets and computers 
the socialist party is made up of reform communists who renamed 
themselves earlier this year they retained the headquarters and 
became the only former communist party in eastern europe to win 
multiparty elections after the regions democratic upheaval 
the party promised last week to remove red stars and other 
communist symbols after an anticommunist activist threatened to 
set himself on fire in protest but the symbols remained 
most windows in the badly burned building were shattered debris 
and charred paper and pictures were strewn on the sidwalks outside 
petar beron chairman of the 16party opposition union of 
democratic forces condemned the vandalism and blamed 
irresponsible elements 
socialist party leader alexander lilov said in a statement to 
reporters that extremely reactionary forces including the 
hawks that are among the opposition masterminded the attack 
lilov later said on tv that the arson was planned well in 
advance as shown by the attackers leaving behind a ground plan of 
the building iron bars and other implements 
maj gen rusinov said the organization for civil disobedience 
a group close to the opposition coalition took the initiative for 
the arson 
the official also quoted kostantin trenchev chief of the 
opposition podkrepa trade union as demanding on sunday that the 
red star be removed or else the building would be stormed the 
state bta news agency reported 
rusinov said the storming was announced by megaphone at 950 
pm 10 minutes after an ultimatum by trenchev expired he did not 
say who made the announcement 
the podkrepa union is part of the union of democratic forces 
the second strongest force in parliament with 144 of the 400 seats 
the socialists won 211 seats in june elections 
beron called the arson a blow against democracy and said 
trenchev would have to answer both to security organizations and 
the opposition coalitions leadership 
president zhelyu zhelev who led the union of democratic forces 
in the elections said over radio and tv that the vandalism 
disgraces the young democracy and said thwe arsonists benefited 
those who want the establishment of a new dictatorship 
the large crowd at mondays rally indicated the attack may have 
boosted the flagging image of the socialist party rent by 
dissension and its popularity eroding as the economy deteriorates 
lilov told the chanting crowd the partys supreme council will 
meet in the damaged premises tuesday because we have no other 
building he began a fundraising drive to repair the 
headquarters 
the crowd chanted never never when speaker after speaker 
conjured up the specter of an emerging neofascism in bulgaria

president bush said monday he sees 
little hope for fruitful negotiations in the united 
nationssponsored search for a peaceful solution to the persian 
gulf crisis 
he also said it was inconceivable that un secretary general 
javier perez de cuellar will make concessions to iraq 
asked if he was more optimistic than he had been about a 
diplomatic settlement bush said 
i dont particularly see more hope now because its so clear 
that what the world is demanding of saddam hussein clearly the 
objective remains the same get saddam out of kuwait and restore 
the rightful leaders to their place 
bush ruled out any settlement that did not fulfill those goals 
the president also said he didnt believe his sanctions against 
iraqs embassy in washington would worsen the situation because 
nobody will be held against their will 
theyre free to go unlike us diplomats being detained in 
baghdad and kuwait bush said 
the iraqi diplomats allowed to stay in the united states will be 
restricted in their travel to a 25mile radius of washington 
as to what kind of latitude perez de cuellar might exercise in 
his talks with the iraqis which begin thursday bush said there 
is no flexibility on iraq getting out of kuwait and the rulers of 
kuwait being permitted to come back 
saddam hussein has been so resistant to complying with 
international law that i dont yet see fruitful negotiations 
bush told reporters at a joint news conference with canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney at the presidents seaside vacation home 
however he said if perez de cuellar could make progress in 
getting the iraqis out of kuwait so much the better 
the united nations position is not negotiable bush said 
there is no room for compromise on getting the legitimate 
government back and the illegitimate invaders out 
the administration has taken a restrained view of perez de 
cuellars mediation initiative bush spokesman marlin fitzwater 
told reporters earlier monday that it remains to be seen 
whether the talks are likely to offer a promising resolution of the 
crisis 
the united nations condemned iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
called for iraqi troops to withdraw and endorsed an economic 
embargo against iraq to be enforced militarily if needed 
bush praised mulroney for sending three navy vessels to support 
the multinational forces led by the united states massive 
buildup in the gulf 
bush also pointedly praised the soviet union for its compliance 
with the international sanctions against iraq 
mulroney calling saddam a rogue leader said the canadian 
government considers its military response acceptable at this point 
but has not decided whether to beef up the canadian presence in the 
gulf 
the prime minister one of bushs closest international friends 
said the president should get credit for remarkable political 
leadership that led to the condemnation of iraq by arab and 
western nations 
bush also said there was no reason to think that because he has 
remained on vacation hes not at the helm of us policy in the 
crisis 
were on top of the situation he said i think the 
american people understand that 
bush returns to washington tuesday to brief members of key 
congressional committees and the leadership on his persian gulf 
strategy 
the white house said monday that the planned oneday visit would 
be extended to thursday afternoon to encompass a range of meetings 
on budget and other matters 
bush continued his vacation activities monday up at dawn to 
fish in the kennebunk river as onlookers gathered on the 
mosquitoinfested banks the president arrived from a boating 
expedition in his speedboat just moments before mulroneys 
helicopter arrived 
mulroney brought his wife mila and three children for a repeat 
visit of their stay with the bushes last summer

defaults on student loans will cost taxpayers 
nearly 2 billion this year and a major reasons given by people 
who welsh on debt is that they are out of work the education 
department said monday 
many said they simply didnt like the education they got the 
department said 
unemployed and without income was cited more than any other 
reason slightly ahead of working but insufficient funds the 
department said in an 80page booklet called reducing student 
loan defaults a plan for action 
behind the default statistics are students who are either 
unable or unwilling to repay their loans says education 
secretary lauro f cavazos in the introduction 
many of the defaults could have been prevented if everyone 
involved in student loans students postsecondary institutions 
lenders guarantee agencies and the federal and state governments 
had worked together the report says 
many defaulters are confused about the loan process and their 
repayment responsibilities the booklet says its first 
recommendation is that colleges and trade schools counsel borrowers 
on their responsibilities to repay the loans even if they do not 
complete the program or believe they benefited from the program 
a student leaving school or dropping out should be contacted 
immediately and the need for repaying the loan should be 
emphasized the department said 
the second recommendation is working closely with lenders to 
reduce defaults including notifying the lender when a student 
cant be located to allow banks to begin tracing 
one major reason for defaults the department found is the 
students unhappiness with the education he is offered and 
reluctance to pay the percentage is particularly high at 
proprietary schools such as trade schools 
schools should strengthen their curriculum beef up the quality 
of their faculties and update facilities and equipment the 
department report recommends 
it also calls for improved programs to keep students in school 
because many of the defaulters are illequipped to find 
employment later and do not have the means to repay their loans 
the book is not intended for students it is being sent to 
higher education associations lenders and guarantee agencies and 
includes examples of the way organizations have used interesting 
and innovative approaches to reduce defaults 
the total of student loan defaults is 78 billion of which 
19 billion was added last year 
in the current fiscal year the program will lend 11 billion to 
41 million students 
if defaults were a separate program it would be the 
fastestgrowing program in the department of education today the 
booklet says the department has stepped up its efforts including 
use of legal actions and private collection agencies increasing 
its collections this year to 637 million

out on the high seas with brian mulroney aboard 
bush and his wife barbara took the visiting canadian prime 
minister and his wife mila for a spin on the ocean following the 
joint bushmulroney news conference monday

point however when fidelity suffered an alternator burnout 
according to a written report from the white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater 
thus the boat was unable to operate the statement said 
the boaters were transferred to the coast guard boat that trails 
along when bush is out on the water 
there was no need for any special rescue of emergency 
equipment 
there was never any danger to the president or the prime 
minister 
fidelity is being towed back to walkers point fitzwater 
reported 
there was no word on future employment for the boat mechanic

shut my business down i had to hire people to fill in its not 
like i cast him out in a briar patch with no recourse he is doing

said sgt 1st class robert maydoney an army recruiter in 
providence ri but we get a lot of vietnam vets korean vets a 
lot of oldtimers who want to help 
a 54yearold korean war veteran called asking if he could get

most of the interest seems directed at the army which accepts 
recruits from age 17 to 35

the number of wouldbe recruits since iraq invaded kuwait and 
thousands of us troops were deployed to the persian gulf 
absolutely weve been getting more calls said sgt first

about an increase of 1000 percent on some days 
on his busiest day since the crisis began henager said he got 
23 or 24 call compared to the two or three he gets on a normal day 
henager took a call from a young man who had won a fouryear 
college scholarship but wanted to be a medic in the middle east if 
war broke out 
he said look im all set with my education but if we do go 
to war i want to be a part of it another kid said ive lived in 
this country 19 years its time i started helping with the rent 
 
first sgt bengt bernhardsen is in charge of 12 army recruiting 
stations in the new york city boroughs of manhattan and the bronx 
the largest such army unit on the east coast he said he received 
10 to 15 calls a day from all walks of life all age groups 
asking about joining the military 
it has really surprised me its nice to see patriotism hasnt

in louisville ky one of the busiest booths at this years 
kentucky state fair was the national guard display 
at past fairs the booth got about 100 inquiries said army sgt 
1st class ray jones a recruiter for the army reserve 
this year weve had 250 to 300 leads possible recruits 
he said the 11day fair ended sunday 
americans havent cornered the market on patriotism a us 
marine recruiting office in buffalo ny is getting about five 
calls a day from canadians wanting tough marine training 
its kind of sad because were getting more canadians calling

navy increased after troops went to the middle east 
we have seen quite a bit of interest from people who want to 
serve particularly nurses said navy lt cmdr shannah hensler 
said and just walking down the street we get a lot of favorable 
comments from civilians 
still many who feel the call of duty simply cant serve 
before this started only about 10 percent of the people who 
wanted to enlist could enlist henager said of the ones 
calling in now its probably less than 10 percent who are 
eligible 
maydoney said it wasnt easy telling wouldbe warriors they 
couldnt fight 
a lot of them cant understand it they feel they can still 
give something to their country maydoney said they say well 
maybe i cant be an infantryman but maybe i can train someone

portauprince haiti ap president ertha pascaltrouillot 
refused monday to heed calls for her resignation and said elections 
set for november would be held as scheduled 
seven of the 12 political groups that in march appointed mrs 
pascaltrouillot provisional president have called for her 
resignation and said they would refuse to participate in elections 
under her administration five cabinet ministers also resigned last 
week 
i will not fail to assume all the way to the end the 
responsibility of holding elections mrs pascaltrouillot said 
at the installation of her newly constituted 13member cabinet 
no one can believe that deviations from the will of the 
people can halt the electoral process mrs pascaltrouillot said 
in a speech broadcast on state radio 
the seven parties have also declared support for the council of 
state which broke off relations with the president aug 14 
describing her as an obstacle to credible elections 
the 19member council of state which is supposed to have veto 
power over mrs pascaltrouillot has accused her of abuse of power 
and of refusing to satisfy popular demands for administrative 
reform law and order and economic relief 
on saturday the chamber of commerce and several other business 
groups asked the president to postpone any decision which 
requires the approval of the council of state so as not to 
aggravate the crisis 
the new cabinet was appointed without the councils advice and 
consent 
mrs pascaltrouillot a supreme court judge was appointed 
president by a political coalition known as the unity assembly 
which spearheaded opposition to haitis last military ruler lt 
gen prosper avril he fled into exile in the united states in 
march after a week of violent protests 
although seven of the 12 groups that comprise the unity assembly 
are now calling for her resignation mrs pascaltrouillot said the 
five most important groups remained on her side 
we must note with satisfaction that important political 
groups representative of the majority of the electorate are on 
the election trail those who refuse elections are on the 
periphery of reality she said 
haiti an impoverished caribbean nation of 6 million 
inhabitants has had five different governments since the fall of 
dictator jeanclaude duvalier in february 1986 four of the 
governments have been led or controlled by the illdisciplined 
army which is widely accused of corruption 
the current civilian administration was set up to lead the 
country to its first democratic elections since independence from 
france in 1804 
haiti tried to hold free and fair elections on nov 29 1987 
but the elections were canceled after assassins supported by the 
army massacred at least 34 voters at polling stations

cuban president fidel castro said monday his 
country has seized 6000 tons of usbound cocaine and arrested 
more than 400 foreign drug traffickers over the past five years 
the mexican news agency notimex reported 
castro spoke at the opening of a unsponsored conference on 
crime prevention held in havana the cuban capital 
notimex said castro told the conference that cuba is studying 
harsher penalties against drug traffic 
cuban justice minister juan escalona recently said cuba might 
impose a death penalty on foreigners convicted of drug crimes on 
the island he said most of those arrested have been us citizens 
of cuban descent 
castro said that since 1985 cuba has seized more than 125 tons 
of marijuana as well as the 6000 tons of usbound cocaine and 
arrested more than 400 foreign drug traffickers 
the report did not give any further detail about the accused 
drug traffickers 
castro said the country has confiscated 73 boats and more than 
50 airplanes used to transport drugs 
notimex quoted the cuban leader as saying his country is willing 
to cooperate with the united nations to combat drug traffic but he 
said it was essential to solve the problem of drug consumption in 
united states 
cuba is sometimes used as a waystation by drug traffickers 
shipping products from south america to the united states

president bush said monday the voice of 
america television station aimed at cuban viewers has passed a 
fivemonth preliminary test and will become a permanent operation 
that means cubans who get up early enough to watch the predawn 
programming and whose television reception escapes cuban jamming 
efforts will be able to watch the news movies and shows such as 
cheers and mission impossible 
bushs announcement releases 16 million that had been withheld 
pending a presidential determination that the operation was both 
legal and technically feasible 
the station called tv marti has been broadcasting news and 
entertainment shows on a trial basis since march 27 cuba has 
jammed the broadcasts since the first day and has said that effort 
has been virtually 100 per cent successful 
the tv marti signal is sent from a balloon tethered over the 
florida keys 
tv marti airs from 330 am to 6 am each day the broadcasts 
are timed so that they do not interfere with local programming 
us officials said that to do otherwise would violate 
international regulations 
in the announcement made public at bushs vacation retreat in 
kennebunkport maine presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said the testing period demonstrated that tv marti did not 
interfere with florida television broadcasting and did not violate 
international telecommunications agreements 
cuban president fidel castro has denounced tv marti as illegal 
and a gross interference in cubas internal affairs 
a survey commissioned by the us information agency which 
oversees tv marti said polls of cuban emigres indicated there were 
about 273000 households in the stations target area which 
should be able to receive broadcasts at least occasionally 
but an unpublished report by the general accounting office a 
congressional watchdog agency said the administration vastly 
overestimated tv marti viewership a copy of the report was 
obtained last week by the miami herald which said classified state 
department estimates indicate the viewership is only about 50000 
to 70000 
according to the herald the gao faulted the administration for 
its methodology in obtaining the viewership estimates most of 
those polled were cubans who have emigrated since tv marti went on 
the air five months ago 
fitzwater said in his announcement that the rationale for tv 
marti is that it provides free access to information for people who 
are denied that right 
the statement regretted the cuban jamming effort but said the 
experience of us government sponsored broadcasts to eastern 
europe during the cold war era was that attempts at jamming often 
were ineffectual 
the voice of america has been beaming radio broadcasts tailored 
for cuban audiences since 1985 cuba began jamming the operation 
known as radio marti in the havana area shortly after the tv marti 
tests began

of 431 in 1986 is disturbing but not particularly surprising 
said college board president donald m stewart 
students must pay less attention to videogames and music 
videos and begin to read more 
blame for the poor verbal scores rests with parents and schools 
stewart said in an interview 
the requirement to read through homework has been reduced 
students dont read as much because they dont have to read as 
much he said 
reading is in danger of becoming a lost art among too many 
american students and that would be a national tragedy 
among the few bright spots in the gloomy report womens math 
scores reached their best levels in 16 years scores of american 
indians rose a combined 13 points and black testtakers continued 
a 15year trend as the most improved ethnic group 
the sat taken by 103 million collegebound high school 
students is a twopart multiplechoice exam each scored on a 
scale of 200800 it is sponsored by the college board and 
administered by the educational testing service in princeton nj 
it is the predominant college entrance exam in 22 states 
scores on the act the college entrance test that predominates 
in 28 states mainly in the midwest and west will be released sept 
11 
the sat has become the single most oftencited barometer of the 
nations educational progress or lack of it 
this years scores and the stagnation in student achievement 
that they suggest will almost certainly fuel public doubts about 
the success of the decadeold school reform movement 
but the college board and others caution that no single number 
can reasonably summarize the performance of 40 million students 
attending 83000 public schools across the country 
critics also have repeatedly accused the sat and act of bias 
against women and minorities the tests makers deny those charges 
but the sat is undergoing a massive revision that ets says should 
produce a fairer more accurate gauge of college aptitude by 1993 
among the reports other findings 
the higher a students family income the higher the average 
score testtakers from 151485 families earning 70000 or more 
averaged 468 on the verbal 527 on math the 41845 testtakers 
from families earning less than 10000 averaged 357 in verbal 419 
math 
womens math scores rose a point to their highest average in 
16 years 455 
american indians scored the best yeartoyear gains of any 
ethnic group a 4point gain in verbal averages to 388 and a 
9point rise in math to 437 
verbal scores among black students rose by 1 point to 352 and 
now stand 20 points higher than 1976 levels math averages were 
down a point to 385 but are still 31 points better than 1976 
scores 
averages among white students dropped 4 points on verbal 
scores to 442 and were unchanged at 491 in math 
nonwhite students now constitute 27 percent of all sat 
testtakers up from 25 percent in 1989 and 17 percent in 1980 
iowa posted the highest state average a combined 1088 on the 
verbal and math but only 5 percent of high school graduates took 
it 
south carolina where 54 percent took the test had the lowest 
average 834

the five permanent members of the security 
council opened private talks monday aimed at breaking an impasse in 
efforts to end cambodias 11yearold civil war 
the permanent council members the united states the soviet 
union china britain and france are discussing a formula for 
establishing a multiparty transitional cambodian administration 
that would organize free elections after a ceasefire said a us 
official speaking privately 
the transitional administration or supreme national council 
would work with un agencies and officials in organizing the 
elections the official said 
diplomats from the five nations were expected to brief un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on tuesday on the outcome 
of their discussions 
they were also expected to consult with representatives of 
vietnam and the cambodian guerrilla coalition as well as with 
officials from other countries in the region 
richard solomon the assistant secretary of state for east asian 
affairs was leading the us delegation in the private talks 
in bangkok thailand a us official said he expected that the 
five permanent council members would propose a new formula for the 
composition of the supreme national council in an effort to break 
the latest impasse in peace talks 
alexander watson us permanent representative to the united 
nations said he expected that the permanent council members would 
propose that the supreme national council be comprised of people 
chosen in their individual capacities rather than as 
representatives of specific cambodian factions 
thats an effort obviously to avoid endless squabbles over 
which factions are represented by how many people and in which 
way watson said after talks with thai officials he was in 
thailand on a sixnation asian trip 
this is a historic moment watson said never have all the 
pieces been in place like they are now for a real shot at getting a 
solution to the problem 
the vietnamesebacked cambodian government and the three 
guerrilla groups opposing it have argued over how many seats each 
of the factions should have on the supreme national council 
the guerrilla coalition comprises the khmer rouge which has the 
strongest guerrilla army the forces of former cambodian leader 
prince norodom sihanouk and the khmer peoples national liberation 
front 
vietnam installed the current government after invading cambodia 
in late 1978 and ousting the khmer rouge which killed hundreds of 
thousands of people during its 3year reign 
watson said he expected the security council to agree that the 
supreme national council would function as an advisory body for a 
un interim government 
in june secretary of state james a baker iii altered the 
diplomatic balance on cambodia when he announced that the united 
states was withdrawing its recognition of the guerrilla coalition 
and opening talks with vietnam 
us officials held their first round of talks with vietnamese 
diplomats last month at vietnams un mission 
the united states has been assisting the two noncommunist 
factions in the guerrilla coalition led by prince sihanouk and 
former premier son sann 
china is the main backer of the khmer rouge while the soviet 
union has supported vietnam and the phnom penh government

the first of a series of tests of sensors 
designed to support the pentagons brilliant pebbles 
spacebased missile defense system achieved only partial success 
the defense department reported monday 
the department said that electronic data being sent back to 
earth on the functioning of the experiment was cut off in mid 
flight 
but the pentagon said the 13minute experiment launched on 
saturday from the wallops island va flight facility was a 
beneficial first step in the scheduled series of 12 experimental 
flights 
the brilliant pebbles component of the strategic defense 
initiative or star wars would place a cluster of small interceptor 
rockets into earth orbit each capable of detecting the launch of 
hostile strategic missiles 
the interceptor rockets could be ordered to speed toward the 
incoming missiles over thousands of miles and destroy them by high 
velocity impact 
the brilliant pebbles experimental package was launched aboard a 
black brant x rocket at 304 am saturday the pentagon said the 
expendable rocket and its payload landed as planned in the atlantic 
the payload was to have been deployed at an altitude of 124 
miles but pentagon officials said they do not yet know if that goal 
was achieved 
only a partial set of objectives was achieved due to a 
premature termination of telemetry the pentagon statement said 
referring to the interrupted flow of electronic data 
a pentagon official who commented on condition he not be 
identified by name said program managers will now try to learn how 
much of the experiment was completed using backup sources from an 
aircraft a satellite and from radars at wallops island 
a number of the parts of the launch were very successful and 
validated other parts of the experiment the official said

former contra supply courier eugene hasenfus who 
was shot down in nicaragua won a partial victory monday in his 
lawsuit against an air carrier and former air force gen richard 
secord but jurors gave him no money 
hasenfus had filed a federal civil lawsuit against secord a 
figure in the irancontra scandal and miamibased southern air 
transport contending they controlled the illegal network supplying 
the contra rebels in nicaragua he maintained they were responsible 
for damages suffered as a result of nicaraguan soldiers shooting 
down a cargo plane hasenfus was on in october 1986 
hasenfus the sole survivor was joined in the suit by the 
family of copilot wallace sawyer jr who was killed in the crash 
ive had so much taken from me already hasenfus said 
this is a disappointment 
jurors found that there was a special relationship or joint 
venture among the plantiffs and defendants but that hasenfus had 
been paid all he was due and that there was no written contract to 
cover his legal expenses in nicaragua 
before jurors began deliberations on aug 21 us district 
judge c clyde atkins ruled in favor of secord and southern air 
that the jury should only consider claims for back salary for 
hasenfus and death benefits for sawyers wife of magnolia ark 
the plaintiffs had sought payment for legal bills lost income 
mental stress and other items 
attorneys for the defendants argued that hasenfus and sawyer 
were independent contractors who knew the risks of the operation 
and to whom the defendants had no special responsibility 
the jurors disagreed with that but said they could find no 
evidence of an written contract or other justification to award any 
damages 
jurors deliberated for nearly 32 hours over five days they 
apparently were deadlocked for several days last week on the 
question of damages and seemed frustrated by the decision they felt 
compelled to reach 
we did feel there was a secret operation we tried very hard 
to live by the evidence that they gave us but there wasnt any 
proof of any oral agreement juror wade harris said 
hasenfus of marinette wis sought 57000 in lost and back 
pay his wife sally wanted 66000 reimbursement for the legal 
expense involved in extricating her husband from the nicaraguan 
jail where he spent three months 
they removed their fingerprints quite well from everything 
hasenfus said afterward 
mrs hasenfus said state department officials had assured her 
they would help pay for her husbands legal expenses while he was 
held in nicaragua 
but hasenfus attorneys were unable to link secord and southern 
air to those state department officials explained one juror 
if we could have proved the state department employees were 
agents of secord and southern air we would have given them 
money juror ivis charbonier said 
secords attorney thomas spencer was pleased that no money 
damages were awarded 
these fellows were independent contractors they took those 
risks spencer said 
spencer said secord was overseas and unavailable for comment 
secord is on probation after a guilty plea to lying to congress 
about the irancontra affair

two nigerian warships captured a 
gunboat carrying weapons for forces loyal to liberian rebel leader 
charles taylor a spokesman for west african forces trying to end 
liberias civil war said monday 
lt col john dungs of the multinational force said the two 
nigerian warships seized the gunboat sunday 
a ghana news agency correspondent traveling with the 
multinational force reported 27 rebels were captured when the 
gunboat a converted trawler was seized as it was approaching two 
nigerian frigates the report did not say whether any shots were 
fired 
one of the frigates was carrying taylors rival rebel leader 
prince johnson to freetown to make flight connections for a 
meeting in banjul gambia of parties involved in the liberian 
conflict 
the two nigerian frigates and a ghanaian frigrate were expected 
to pick up more men supplies and armaments in freetown before 
returning to monrovia where the multinational force landed friday 
night it already has advanced out of the port area and secured 
some of the city 
nigeria gambia sierra leone ghana and guinea have provided 
3000 troops to end the 8monthold tribal war in liberia 
taylor whose forces control most of liberia opposes the 
intervention and accuses nigeria and guinea of supporting embattled 
president samuel doe both doe and johnson have welcomed what they 
call a peacekeeping force they have negotiated a truce between 
their fighters who together control most of monrovia 
the ghana news agency correspondent reported the streets of the 
liberian capital of monrovia were quiet sunday night and the only 
people in view were residents searching for food the city has been 
without electricity and water for two months and most food stocks 
were looted by government troops or rebels 
but a spokesman for taylors national patriotic front accused 
the west african force of shelling civilian areas 
they didnt come in with white flag waving they came in 
blasting taylors spokesman tom woewiyu said in ouagadougu 
burkina faso 
taylor has sent woewiyu on a tour of west african capitals to 
try to persuade their heads of state to oppose the presence of 
troops from other countries in the region in liberia 
reporters who recently returned from taylors headquarters in 
liberia said they had seen some soldiers from burkina faso there 
burkina faso president blaise compaore has criticized the decision 
to send in the west african force 
woewiyu said the west african force was a surrogate group put 
together by the united states since they couldnt use prince 
johnson to defeat us 
they went out and bought themselves some stool pigeons to 
carry the job for them 
the west african leaders who have sent troops to liberia say the 
war is affecting the entire region which must cope with an influx 
of 400000 refugees from the nation of 23 million people 
nine members of the multinational force who were injured in 
clashes with taylors rebels over the weekend in monrovia were 
airlifted to us navy vessels for medical treatment said abass 
bundu executive secretary of the economic community of west 
african states which ordered the foreign intervention 
none of the multinational troops had been killed bundu said 
the us ships are providing support for several squads of 
marines guarding the us embassy in monrovia 
journalists who had been covering territory controlled by taylor 
left during the weekend after the rebel leader accused an american 
journalist stephen smith of liberation of paris of being a spy 
taylors men conducted a mock execution of smith firing just over 
his shoulders 
taylors 10000 fighters represent the largest army in the 
country but many of his troops are teenagers and inexperienced 
the civil war has left 5000 people dead mainly civilians 
slaughtered for their tribal affiliations the war began in 
december when taylors forces invaded from neighboring ivory coast 
accusing doe of corruption and mismanagement johnson later split 
with taylor

sexually graphic photographs included in a 
traveling exhibit of robert mapplethorpes work were necessary to 
understand the life of the late artist a museum curator testified 
monday 
to have left them out would have been to leave out a chapter 
of a novel or a segment of history said janet kardon the 
director of the american craft museum in new york city who 
assembled the exhibit 
mrs kardon testified for two hours at a hearing for the 
contemporary arts center and its director dennis barrie they are 
charged with a misdemeanor count of pandering obscenity for 
displaying the homoerotic pictures 
hamilton county municipal judge david j albanese summoned mrs 
kardon to help resolve a dispute over whether a jury could consider 
the pictures individually or whether it must treat the whole 
exhibit as a single work of art 
prosecutors contend the pictures are separate works defense 
lawyers disagree and asked albanese to dismiss the case on the 
grounds that the exhibit as a whole isnt obscene 
albanese said he would rule sept 6 on the request for dismissal 
the photographs were included in a sixweek show that ended may 
26 
mrs kardon said she assembled the 175photograph exhibit with 
mapplethorpes help as an overview of his life mapplethorpe died 
last year at age 42 of aids 
outrage over the photos contributed to restrictions on federal 
funding for the arts 
most of the works in the exhibit are portraits or pictures of 
flowers although some show homosexual acts 
you really have to reflect everything an artist felt was 
important in their work mrs kardon said for the most part 
this is the only place those sexually graphic images appear and 
they were an important part of his work 
the judge earlier ordered barrie and the gallery to stand trial 
sept 24 on a misdemeanor count involving mapplethorpe pictures of 
naked children 
that charge and the other of pandering to obscenity each carry a 
maximum penalty of six months in jail and a 1000 fine for barrie 
the gallery could be fined 5000 on each charge 
the exhibition has appeared in several us cities but drew 
charges only in cincinnati

quebec premier robert bourassa broke off talks 
monday with indians involved in a sevenweek armed standoff with 
authorities and ordered the army to tear down mohawk barricades in 
two quebec communities 
the premier said the mohawks had not been negotiating in good 
faith and he was therefore obliged to assume his responsibility 
for public order 
i have asked the canadian army to continue its mission to 
take down the barricades bourassa told a news conference in 
montreal broadcast live on canadian television and i hope in 
the coming days we will have a resolution to this crisis 
at bourassas request troops a week ago replaced quebec 
provincial police at the barricades in the communities of oka and 
chateauguay 
gen john de chastelain chief of staff of the canadian forces 
did not say how or when the army would move but indicated it would 
be soon 
we have been told to take down the barricades were going to 
take down the barricades the general told reporters later 
monday we hope somebody will take them down for us 
he said the best way would be if the mohawks simply abandoned 
their positions and allowed the army to move in and simply cart 
away the pieces 
mohawk negotiators could not be reached immediately for comment 
on bourassas decision 
but georges erasmus national chief of the assembly of first 
nations a nationwide grouping of indian bands said hes 
declared war on the mohawks 
erasmus insisted that the mohawks wanted a negotiated 
settlement thats the only thing thats going to avoid 
bloodshed 
a reporter for canadian television reported from the scene at 
oka where the indian troubles began that armed mohawk men 
appeared to have withdrawn from the barricades leaving only women 
and children 
part of the problem with the negotiations has to do with the 
confused nature of mohawk politics various groups vie for 
leadership on the numerous reserves some claim the militant 
warrior society has usurped authority from elected native officials 
we quebeckers and canadians cannot tolerate groups of citizens 
living in quebec choosing which laws they want to respect and which 
they want to ignore bourassa told the news conference 
mohawks from the kahnesatake reserve at oka 18 miles west of 
montreal set up a barricade across the main road into the reserve 
to protest the towns plan to expand a golf course onto territory 
claimed by the indians 
on july 11 provincial police attempted to storm the barricade 
but were repulsed a policeman was shot dead in the attempt 
although it was not clear who killed him 
after the police action mohawks from the kahnawake reserve 
south of montreal set up a sympathy blockade at chateauguay 
cutting off the mercier bridge across the st lawrence river 
linking montreals southern suburbs with the city 
that blockade caused a major disruption of traffic forcing many 
people to make long detours it also led to rising tempers among 
local residents against both the police and the indians 
the issue of the golf course was resolved early on when the 
federal government agreed to buy the land and turn it over to the 
natives but since then the mohawks have used the situation to air 
a much wider series of demands including sovereignty 
bernard roy the federal governments negotiator spoke to 
reporters two hours before bourassa saying the mohawks must 
moderate their demands 
he said the mohawk demand for immunity from prosecution for 
those involved in the july 11 shootout was unacceptable 
the mohawks had agreed in what they called a gesture of good 
faith to open one lane of the mercier bridge to traffic that was 
rejected by bourassa who termed the offer not serious

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said monday he will insist that iraq respect security council 
resolutions demanding the withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait 
and the release of all foreigners 
perez de cuellar is scheduled to meet with iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz on thursday in amman jordan in an effort to 
negotiate an end to the persian gulf crisis 
since iraqi president saddam hussein ordered his troops into 
kuwait on aug 2 the un security council has passed five 
resolutions condemning iraq 
the resolutions have demanded the immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait imposed a trade embargo 
declared the annexation of kuwait null and void insisted that iraq 
allow all foreigners to leave and authorized military action to 
enforce the economic sanctions against baghdad 
now is the time for diplomacy in order to obtain full 
implementation of the security council resolutions perez de 
cuellar told reporters 
the security council is not a negotiator it is a body that 
adopts resolutions which are laws for the international community 
the secretarygeneral has to be a negotiator that is why i am now 
going to the area to see the ways and means of having the 
resolutions implemented he said 
the un chief said it is my hope that iraq is seeking a 
negotiated end to the crisis 
perez de cuellar held a series of private meetings monday with 
senior diplomats regarding his mission including the us soviet 
french british and chinese ambassadors the kuwaiti ambassador 
and the whole security council after which he met reporters 
perez de cuellar said he was open to discussion on the blockade 
of food and medicine shipments to iraq under the un trade 
embargo the security council resolution allows shipments of such 
goods in certain humanitarian cases 
asked whether he was bothered that the embargo is preventing 
food and medicine from reaching the iraqi public perez de cuellar 
replied that is a question which is as well one of the 
subjects i am going to discuss with the iraqis 
but perez de cuellar insisted that he would always bear in mind 
the five resolutions passed by the security council in his talks 
with iraqi officials 
in kennebunkport maine president bush told a news conference 
that if perez de cuellar could make progress in getting the iraqis 
out of kuwait so much the better 
but he said saddams resistance to comply with international law 
leaves little hope for fruitful negotiation in the 
unsponsored search for a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis 
the president said it was inconceivable that perez de cuellar 
will make concessions to iraq 
the united nations position is not negotiable bush said 
there is no room for compromise on getting the legitimate 
government of kuwait back and the illegitimate invaders out 
perez de cuellar said he had not yet heard from bush on his 
mission but added i am persuaded personally that president bush 
will not undermine my efforts 
saddam has invited perez de cuellar to come to baghdad but the 
un chief said he has no plans for now to visit iraq he did not 
explicitly explain why saying only that he thought it was 
important for him to meet aziz in jordan 
asked to assess the prospects for the talks perez de cuellar 
later told nbc news i am hopeful and i think that widsom will 
prevail

hundreds of people watched as a giant statue of 
vladimir lenin was toppled with official approval early tuesday in 
the georgian capital of tbilisi a local editor reported 
the statue of the founder of the soviet state had become a 
target of anticommunist activists in the caucasian republic months

during a meeting of the georgia supreme soviet on march 18 
demonstrators hurled cans of redbrown paint at lenin marring the 
statue and its pedestal 
zurab kodalashvili editor of the independent georgian agency 
novosti iberia said authorities gave in to public demands and

front of city hall was toppled shortly after midnight with about 
350 people standing by kodalashvili said

a manufacturers announcement last week that 
it was recalling one of its coffee makers has led to a flood of 
calls that have tied up a tollfree number and brought some 
consumers to a fast boil 
we know there is a large volume of calls were missing said 
jerry ray spokesman for proctorsilex co of richmond va 
ray said the company processed 75000 calls in the first four 
days after it pledged to provide free coffee makers to an estimated 
800000 consumers who purchased a model now declared a fire hazard 
proctorsilex said the coffee makers are subject to potentially 
dangerous overheating because their thermostats and thermal fuses 
may malfunction 
consumers have complained to news organizations that they spent 
hours unsuccessfully trying to get through to the toll free number 
or that they were connected to the wrong number 
amy paulman public affairs officer for the consumer product 
safety commission said it was not unusual for telephone lines to 
be jammed the first few days after a recall is announced 
ray said the company has 200 trained phone operators answering 
queries 24 hours a day he urged people to call at night when the 
line is not so busy and to keep trying 
ray however said telephone company officials have assured 
proctorsilex that there is no problem with phone connections he 
said some radio stations broadcast the wrong number and many 
consumers were simply misdialing 
the correct number is 18003413333 
ray said about 80 percent of the people calling have a6 models 
that are not subject to the recall the recalled models were made 
in 1985 and 1986 begin with a4 or a5 and have series number that 
end with the numbers 58 or 68 
calls are even received from people who own rival brand coffee 
makers ray said we get calls from people who own everything 
the phone service will be open several months he said and 
were glad people are trying to call were trying to get the 
coffee makers out of the kitchen

ten of 11 opec ministers tentatively 
agreed early tuesday to permit increased oil production immediately 
by some countries in response to the persian gulf crisis sources 
said 
iran was lone holdout at an informal meeting of 11 of the 13 
organization of petroleum exporting countries said sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity iraq and libya did not attend 
opec officials planned to try to persuade iran to join the 
arrangement which would lift the cartels quotas temporarily to 
permit increased production by countries with additional production 
capability 
the ministers were expected to meet tuesday to endorse the plan 
saudi arabia and venezuela have said they intend to pump more 
oil to help make up for the shortfall of 4 million barrels a day 
caused by the international embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti oil un 
sanctions were imposed after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the officials were trying to come up with an understanding 
that would sanction output increases by saudi arabia venezuela and 
others to help offset losses to the world market caused by the 
crisis said senior delegate sources 
most countries have already agreed to sanction production 
increases for the simple reason that the countries are 
going to do it anyway said one source 
if they do it outside opec it may be difficult to have them 
back in the mold again 
a source close to opec said it appeared saudi arabia the 
worlds largest crude exporter has already increased oil 
production to meet the extra demand but he refused to give details 
figures obtained monday from the us energy information 
administration estimate saudi arabias production at 6 million 
barrels of oil per day 600000 more than its opec quota of 54 
million barrels 
in venezuela the government said a 90hour shutdown of one of 
its oil installations began monday as that country prepared to 
increase production 
a subsidiary of the state oil monopoly petroleos de venezuela 
shut down a site to increase production capacity there from 180000 
barrels per day to 220000 barrels per day the government news 
agency venpres said 
venezuelas opec quota is 195 million barrels a day quotas 
were set last month under a production accord worked out by the 13 
producer nations that agreement sets an overall output ceiling of 
225 million barrels a day in the last half of the year 
iran has fought lifting the quotas iranian oil minister 
gholamreza aqazadeh taking a break from closeddoor discussions 
said monday it is not necessary now to boost output but 
maybe in the future 
iran says enough excess oil is stored in the industrialized 
world to make up for any shortages 
libyan officials were also expected to argue against any move to 
raise production a libyan delegation may arrive tuesday for the 
consultations with opec president sadek boussena the algerian oil 
minister sources said 
resentment has surfaced at what some nations view as political 
pressure on the group from the united states the worlds largest 
oil importer to lift production 
delegate sources said some countries received calls from 
american officials before the meeting asking questions about their 
positions 
we cannot be pressured said one source demanding anonymity 
any arrangement to permit higher pumping would likely include 
promises that production be reduced once the crisis ends according 
to the sources 
it also would probably call on consuming nations to take steps 
to use oil in storage to help meet any shortages they said 
another source suggested the talks might end with those nations 
wanting to boost output issuing a statement on their own without 
the cartels backing 
there also seemed to be some support for a solution that would 
not require a formal statement or even a formal meeting 
crude prices surged last week above 30 a barrel on fears of 
military escalation and a shortage of crude supplies in the 
oilrich gulf region but they plummeted monday with a barrel of 
light sweet crude for october delivery dropped 4 to close at 
2691 on the new york mercantile exchange 
the opec nations are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

black and white leaders trying to end eight 
months of racial protests over the public schools agreed monday on 
a plan to share power on the school board 
the agreement worked out over the weekend was approved by the 
city council and school board members of both races said mayor joe 
smitherman the plan would give each race an equal vote and the 
chairmanship would alternate between black and white 
smitherman and council members reached the agreement in meetings 
sunday with two dozen black leaders 
i think weve got something good worked out said 
smitherman who is white 
black protesters werent directly involved in the talks sanders 
said 
the trouble began in december when the five blacks on the 
11member school board walked out over a decision against rehiring 
norward roussell the public school systems first black 
superintendent 
daily protests lawsuits school boycotts sitins and several 
altercations with police followed roussell resigned in may about 
two months before his contract expired and settled a 10 million 
lawsuit against the school board for 150000 
state sen hank sanders a selma attorney and leader of the 
protests said monday that protesters and city attorney henry pitts 
were working toward an end to pending litigation he refused to 
release details 
the city filed misdemeanor charges against several protesters 
including sanders wife rose and the protesters in turn filed a 
10 billion lawsuit challenging the city councils appointment of 
school board members 
sanders has said the suit would be dropped and the protests 
would stop if the charges were dismissed 
selma schools reopened aug 20 with blacks making up 80 percent 
of the student body of about 5800 
the agreement worked out over the weekend was approved by the 
city council and black and white members of the school board 
smitherman said under the plan five white and five black board 
members vote on all issues and chairman carl barker would vote only 
on litigation matters 
the city council promised to keep a racial balance on future 
boards and to appoint a black as board chairman when barker 
eventually steps down the chairmanship would alternate between 
blacks and whites 
people have asked me how the board can operate with a 
fiveandfive split smitherman said monday well youre going 
to operate with the art of compromise 
the full board is to meet sept 13 the white members of the 
board have continued to meet throughout the walkout 
sanders said the agreement doesnt give blacks equal power 
because barker would control committee appointments and could vote 
on legal matters 
the rotation would be fair but that may not come about under 
this present agreement for several years he said 
the long and short of it is that at this point the protests 
would continue and the litigation would continue sanders said 
the black school board members would be back but that would be 
all

differences over a gambling initiative 
were at the center of a close race for governor between lt gov 
stephen mcalpine and former anchorage mayor tony knowles going into 
tuesdays democratic primary 
in the republican race state sen arliss sturgulewski was 
heavily favored to win her second consecutive nomination 
in oklahoma gov henry bellmon a republican opened the door 
for a wideopen race when he announced he would not seek 
reelection and five candidates in each party sought the 
nomination for his job in tuesdays primaries 
alaskans were expected to reject an initiative that would allow 
localoption casino gambling there was virtually no campaign for 
the measure and a poll last week found voters opposing it by 
2to1 
gov steve cowper a democrat helped lead the campaign against 
the gambling measure 
knowles who opposes the measure seized on the issue in the 
campaigns final weeks after mcalpine said he would vote for the 
initiative mcalpine said he opposes casino gambling but supports 
letting local voters decide 
mcalpine tried to paint knowles as soft on drugs because of the 
former mayors opposition to a measure on the november general 
election ballot that would restore criminal penalties for 
possessing small amounts of marijuana alaska is the only state 
that has no criminal penalties for possessing less than 4 ounces of 
marijuana at home 
knowles said he opposes the measure because it would allow jail 
terms for firsttime offenders 
in the republican race sturgulewski maintained a healthy lead in 
the polls in her second bid to become alaskas first woman 
governor she lost the 1986 race to cowper who is not seeking a 
second term 
jim campbell a former chairman of the alaska railroad corp 
advanced in the polls in recent weeks but still remained well 
behind sturgulewski in third place was state sen rick halford 
who appealed to conservative antigovernment voters 
in congressional races rep don young and sen ted stevens were 
expected to win the gop nominations easily young had token 
opposition from gary sinkola of fairbanks and stevens faced bob 
bird a teacher from kenai and antiabortion activist 
on the democratic former valdez mayor john devens was the only 
candidate to oppose young seeking the nomination for stevens seat 
were tom taggart of hyder and michael beasley of eagle river 
alaska is one of three states with an open primary in which all 
candidates appear on one ballot regardless of party voters are 
free to vote in one party in one race and another party in another 
race 
in oklahomas republican gubernatorial primary four candidates 
said they had a real shot at the anticipated sept 18 runoff they 
were oklahoma city attorney burns hargis former us attorney bill 
price restaurateur and former television newsman vince orza and 
truck stop operator jerry brown the other candidate was caddo 
rancher and political newcomer jerry hoyt 
in the democratic primary us rep wes watkins battled with 
oklahoma city businessman david walters who ran unsuccessfully 
against bellmon in 1986 and house speaker steve lewis the other 
candidates were john shorty barnett and anne hartin langston 
even a pillow came into dispute in the heated campaign 
walters chaged that watkins set on a pillow during a televised 
debate among all the democratic nominees in an effort to make 
himself look taller 
now thats the vintage wes watkins even while hes supposed 
to be debating the issues in front of the people he uses a prop to 
make himself appear to be something hes not walters said 
watkins replied he was shocked that mr walters is so 
sensitive about his height and said the pillow was to ease his 
back 
i offered to help him walters raise his chair but he 
declined watkins said 
us sen david boren faced two candidates in the democratic 
primary newcomer manuel ybarra and perennial candidate virginia 
jenner the winner will face the sole gop candidate lawyer stephen 
jones

at least four radio stations took sinead 
oconnor off the air after the irish singer offended patriotic 
listeners by banning the starspangled banner from her concert 
antioconnor backlash tied up radio switchboards in new york 
and new jersey but apparently didnt ripple beyond the region 
oconnors hits include nothing compares 2 u and 
mandinka 
during the peak morning drive time monday radio show hosts 
smashed oconnors records on the air 
listeners were incensed that the singersongwriter known for 
her confessional lyrics and shaved head threatened to walk out of 
the garden state arts center in holmdel friday night if the 
national anthem was played as it routinely is at the amphitheater 
mike opelka producer of the morning show at whtz in newark 
said the station got about 1200 unsolicited calls between 7 am 
and 10 am by a margin of 301 callers wanted oconnor off the 
air 
the ban will likely be shortlived said program director steve 
kingston 
its a statement based on the feelings of our audience 
kingston said tomorrow when people forget about it well 
probably go back to playing her record 
wplj in new york whtg in eatontown and wdha in dover nj 
also stopped playing oconnor songs including singles from her hit 
album i do not want what i havent got 
in a news release monday oconnor said she hadnt meant to 
insult anyone but objects to any national anthem being played at 
her concerts even my own 
the new jersey center gave in to the singers demand fearing 
that a lastminute cancellation would enrage the audience of 9000 
but prohibited any future appearances 
directors of rock stations in boston chicago los angeles and 
san diego said they hadnt heard of the controversy 
meanwhile armed forces radio said soldiers and their families 
overseas would continue to hear oconnor 
our position for music is if its a song that is popular and 
goes up the charts with various audiences in the us thats where 
we play our music from said spokesman jim kout we dont ban 
artists the only time we wouldnt carry a song would be when a 
judge declared it obscene 
a new york state senator was less forgiving 
nicholas spano a westchester county republican urged fans to 
boycott oconnors performance wednesday in saratoga springs ny 
hes pathetic responded oconnors publicist elaine schock 
politicians will jump on anything wont they schock said 
im surprised he believes in censorship because americans believe 
so strongly in freedom of speech he should be ashamed

more crews were mobilized monday as the wind 
picked up again whipping a 3000acre fire that killed two 
firefighters and destroyed 19 homes outside this northern utah 
mountain community 
the fire of unknown origin exploded across 2500 acres and 
through several canyons with the help of 40 mph wind sunday 
burning to within a halfmile of midway a community of 1200 
about 200 firefighters worked monday to build containment lines 
around the stubborn blaze 30 miles east of salt lake city at dusk 
the crew was cut in half to give exhausted firefighters a chance to 
rest the remaining crew should be able to handle the fire 
overnight as temperatures cooled and winds died down said dick 
buehler deputy incident commander 
uinta national forest spokeswoman vicki may said a fire line had 
been partially completed along the fires northeastern perimeter 
and air tankers made passes over the northwestern corner to aid 
ground crews in snuffing stubborn hot spots 
but while crews made against the blaze during the morning wind 
out of the south picked up early in the afternoon pushing flames 
northward through oak brush and pine trees left tinderdry by 
drought 
about 300 homes were evacuated in the fires path 
uinta spokesman bevan killpack said the two dead firefighters 
were working on a ridge late sunday trying to build a fire line 
with a bulldozer when flames blew up and confused them the 
pair apparently were overcome by smoke although their bodies were 
severely burned when they were found 
the wind must have changed and got them disoriented with the 
smoke and trapped them in there killpack said 
the victims were identified as wasatch county sheriffs deputy 
blake wright 39 of heber city and ralph broadhead 65 a county 
public works employee 
sheriff edd thacker said the two were trapped between the fire 
and a cliff and cleared wood and brush away with a bulldozer in a 
vain attempt to avoid the flames 
they did what they were supposed to do they tried what they 
knew how but it was a firestorm he said investigators 
estimate that 1100degree temperatures went through there thats 
like a blowtorch 
gov norm bangerter who flew over the fire area late monday 
morning offered his sympathy to the victims families 
atop faucett canyon dale jablonski area forester for state 
lands and forestry supervised firefighters cutting a line between 
the blaze and a nearby cabin monday 
what were trying to do now is get a safety zone where we can 
make a stand and if the fire makes a run at us we can get out 
he said watching his crew and a bulldozer clear away trees and 
brush 
in midway about 100 people gathered outside the town hall to 
watch the fire and look over a map of the area most were cabin 
owners trying to figure out if their summer homes lay in the fires 
path

said

the pentagon disbanded its persian gulf news 
media pool aug 26 saying it is not needed because open coverage 
is now being permitted 
the decision by the government of saudi arabia to allow 
reporters from the us and other countries to cover the military 
operation in the gulf region makes it unnecessary to continue the 
national media pool the defense department said 
the 17member pool had been filing press and broadcast reports 
and transmitting still photographs daily since its arrival in saudi 
arabia aug 13 
the decision came four days after president bush and defense 
secretary dick cheney said they would welcome freer media access to 
us troops in saudi arabia at that time they said it would be up 
to the saudis to allow it 
bush and cheney were questioned after reports that the saudis 
were beginning to restrict media coverage and considering whether 
to order most foreign journalists out of the country 
eleven major news organizations expressed concern about 
reporting restrictions in saudi arabia in a letter aug 22 to bush 
the media said minimum access had been available through the 
defense department pool and extremely limited unilateral 
representation with more severe limitations in the offing 
we respectfully request that the administration do everything 
in its power to gain full media access to saudi arabia and to the 
american presence there the groups said perhaps accreditation 
through the american military would be the correct solution 
the letter was signed by officials in the washington bureaus of 
abc cbs nbc and cnn the associated press time and newsweek 
magazines and the washington post the wall street journal the 
new york times and the los angeles times

an american marine from new york had one 
question when he arrived in this desert kingdom are the mets in 
first 
most of the thousands of us service men and women here have no 
access to american publications or any television so they 
incessantly ask visiting reporters about the situation back home 
do the american people want us here an army private on a 
desert exercise last week wanted to know 
is president bush saying well go to war asked an air force 
supply officer 
a mimeographed newsletter attempts to fill the void with a story 
headlined secretary of defense explains why we are here but 
it does little to satisfy the appetite of the newshungry americans 
the situation is very uncertain defense secretary dick 
cheney says in the newsletter we dont know how long it will 
last 
however there were signs the troops will be getting more access 
to the news a daily shipment of newspapers was sent to some camps 
last week 
they get passed around and read again and again and again 
said a spokesman for the 82nd airborne division the guys are 
hungry for news 
a few issues of the military newspaper stars amp stripes have 
turned up and the small newsletter that carried cheneys remarks 
is being published at one saudi airbase where us forces are 
positioned 
iraq is trying to fill the news void with radio broadcasts 
suggesting that while americans are protecting saudi oil fields the 
petrol emirs are in the united states and have enjoyed the 
company of american women 
i thought it was pretty funny actually said a member of 
the 82nd airborne who listened to the broadcast if thats their 
idea of psychological warfare i dont think we have much to worry 
about 
the saudi media also has had its fair share of recent propaganda 
local television which can be seen by some us forces staying 
in hotels or saudi barracks frequently includes lengthy segments 
showing the arrival and exercises of troops in the kingdom there 
is no narration but patriotic music booms 
saudi papers carry daily dispatches from a state press agency 
designed to assure the public that the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
will not affect saudi arabias food supplies economy or security 
in the united states a chicago cable television company is 
producing free 30second video greetings from family and friends of 
soldiers sent to the mideast 
edward k conklin spokesman for jones intercable inc said 
the military has agreed to broadcast the cable grams from home 
to us ships in the persian gulf he said arrangements were being 
made to broadcast the greetings to troops on land too 
the company will produce the videos this week at its 10 studios 
in suburban chicago conklin said 
we know people who have not had the chance to say goodbye to 
family and friends conklin said we had one lady who was 
contacted and all she got was a call from a computer that private 
soandso had been shipped to the persian gulf and no other 
information was available

iowa police must release the names of 
most rape victims to the news media the state attorney generals 
office said aug 24 newspaper editors and broadcasters said they 
would continue to protect the names 
in response to a request by gov terry branstad assistant 
attorney general gordon allen said state law does not permit police 
to keep the names of rape victims confidential the only exception 
is when release of the name would jeopardize the investigation or 
put the victim in danger he said 
a spokesman for branstad said the governor would seek to change 
the law to assure confidentiality 
allens opinion was criticized by a victim services counselor 
who said it would make sexual assault victims reluctant to report 
crimes 
the issue came up earlier this year when the des moines register 
challenged the practice by des moines police of routinely 
suppressing names and other information about rape victims the 
department has since released the names but none has been used in 
news stories

an investigative reporter angered by the new 
york times review of his book on the alleged links between 
organized crime and the national football league filed a 10 
million libel lawsuit against the paper aug 23 
dan e moldea filed suit in us district court in washington 
over the newspapers sept 3 1989 review of his book 
interference how organized crime influences professional 
football 
the newspapers top attorney expressed confidence the suit would 
be thrown out of court and said the review was based on accurate 
facts 
the review by times sportswriter gerald eskenazi said in part 
that moldeas book contains sloppy journalism as well as 
errors and unfounded insinuations 
the lawsuit alleges the review was intended to protect the nfl 
by personally attacking moldea discrediting his reputation and 
smearing his good name as a careful investigative reporter 
the review gave false impressions through use of false and 
misleading examples intended to injure moldeas reputation impeach 
moldeas honesty and integrity and destroyed the likelihood that 
interference would become a widely read book by the public the 
suit says 
moldea said in an interview that his publisher william morrow 
and co inc had printed 33000 copies of the book because initial 
sales had been strong but after the times review came out sales 
dropped off precipitously and only about 21000 were sold he said 
this thing could have been stopped so long ago had they just 
published a correction or my letter that countered point by 
point statements in the review moldea said 
eskenazi declined comment on the matter referring questions to 
times executives even though this is something im appalled at 
when people do it to me 
the times senior attorney george freeman said he had not seen 
the lawsuit but he was familiar with the case 
were totally convinced that the suit will be dismissed 
freeman said a book review is protected opinion particularly 
where a review is based on accurate facts as this one is

a newspaper editor sued the town of 
west hartford on aug 22 claiming the hartford suburb violated his 
rights when it sued him for writing an editorial critical of the 
way an antiabortion protest was handled 
john spear editor of the orange county post a washingtonville 
ny weekly claimed in the federal suit that the town tried to 
intimidate harass censor and silence a free press when it 
sued him for alleged racketeering and extortion 
spear did not take part in either of two large antiabortion 
protests in west hartford in 1989 but the town named him in its 
june 1989 racketeering lawsuit against antiabortion activists 
claiming his april 4 editorial northern red necks expressed 
support for illegal antiabortion activities he was dropped from 
the suit in december 1989 
if the freedom of the press means anything it means that we 
can criticize the government harshly thats what mr spear did 
joseph secola spears attorney said at a news conference 
they had absolutely no legal basis for suing him secola 
said they viciously abused the legal process 
spears suit filed in us district court in hartford seeks 
unspecified punitive and compensatory damages 
patrick g alair the assistant corporation counsel for west 
hartford said spears involvement in the protest went beyond 
writing the editorial he noted that one of spears employees was 
arrested in the protest 
still he said the town dropped spears from the suit because of 
concerns over spears first amendment rights 
we did not want the real issues in the case to be clouded up 
with a first amendment issue alair said as a legal issue 
spear is a newspaper person there is an issue of freedom of the 
press there 
spears editorial said antiabortion protesters at an april 1 
demonstration in west hartford suffered police brutality and were 
denied their civil rights 
the town claimed spear deliberately and maliciously published 
an incorrect defamatory account of the protest 
the town did not allege libel however instead the town relied 
on the racketeering law and claimed spears editorial was an 
attempt to extort a less diligent or softened response from the 
west hartford police department to future protest activities 
it also said spear as editor of the orange county post has 
actively supported the illegal activities of operation rescue 
through that medium

a municipal judge ruled aug 20 that a 
newspaper reporter does not have to turn over to defense attorneys 
a set of confidential notes on a murder case 
we have to weigh the tremendous interests of the defendants 
against the profound interest of society in a free press 
municipal court judge carol a corrigan said 
attorneys for three men accused in a 2yearold murder had 
demanded to see the notes of harry harris a crime reporter for the 
tribune 
in 1988 harris interviewed a key police informant and wrote a 
story based on that discussion defense attorneys said the notes 
contain evidence that could clear their clients 
but corrigan ruled that turning over the notes which she 
viewed after being ordered to do so by a higher court would have 
a chilling effect on the ability of reporters to interview 
confidential sources 
reporters should take heart from this decision said tribune 
attorney judith epstein it is an extraordinarily important 
case 
the case was the first major test of reporters rights in 
california since earlier this year when the state supreme court in 
a case called delaney vs superior court weakened protection 
afforded reporters by californias shield law epstein said 
the delaney ruling makes it easier for lawyers to demonstrate 
that previously protected reporters notes and other confidential 
information may be seized and used in court

its patrol division since jan 1 1989 and 10 other department 
employees 
leis on july 2 provided the newspaper with a list of people 
appointed to the patrol division but he refused access to any 
personnel files citing confidentiality provisions in two union 
contracts 
the newspaper then sent leis a letter noting an ohio supreme 
court ruling that union contracts do not permit local governments 
to deny access to police personnel files that are public record 
leis responded with a letter saying he was seeking a lawyers 
advice on the issue

environmentalists digging in for a new assault 
on what they consider sacrosanct energy reserves as threatened oil 
shortages and rising gasoline prices spurred by the persian gulf 
crisis start biting into american pocketbooks 
iraqs invasion of kuwait was only a few days old when sen 
frank murkowski ralaska persuaded colleagues to approve a 
measure that would make it easier to expand oil drilling on federal 
land bypassing some environmental restrictions 
the oil industry was just as quick to call for abandoning recent 
curbs on offshore oil drilling relaxing requirements for cleaner 
burning gasoline and drilling in some environmentally sensitive 
areas 
although neither murkowskis nor any of the other proposals has 
won final congressional approval environmentalists fear an 
intensified push by industry to win relief from hardfought 
environmental gains when congress returns from summer recess after 
labor day

when the united states goes to war or comes 
close to it it usually invokes one or both of two great purposes 
to protect the nation against an imminent threat or to protect the 
democratic ideal 
president bush is denied those rationales in the persian gulf 
instead he invokes the abstract principle that might should not 
make right and the pragmatic view that americas way of life is 
threatened if one man has the power to control the price and supply 
of petroleum 
the question that remains is whether the american people will 
support an enterprise based on those purposes 
bush says the lesson of the 1930s is that appeasement of tyrants 
does not work and he would not find widespread disagreement with 
that proposition among his countrymen 
however a public opinion poll probably would uncover virtual 
unanimous agreement with a counterbalancing proposition the 
united states cannot be the worlds policeman 
that is a lesson america extracted from the korean stalemate of 
the 1950s the vietnam failures of the 1970s the budget deficits 
of the 1980s 
bush probably would agree he notes that 23 nations have signed 
on to the effort to push the iraqi army of president saddam hussein 
out of kuwait and back behind the iraqi border it is iraq 
against the world bush said last week 
but bush wouldnt dispute that as in korea and south vietnam 
the chief ally bearing the burden is the united states 
the end of the cold war has denied american presidents the ready 
explanation that the line had to be drawn against the advance of 
communism 
international communism is no longer a threat it is not even 
very international its strongest remaining outposts are cuba a 
thorn but not a menace and china with which the bush 
administration maintains cordial relations 
the soviet union is bushs somewhatsilent partner in the iraqi 
engagement the soviets were the iraqis chief arms supplier which 
causes the rev william sloane coffin to observe that the persian 
gulf showdown could not have occurred had the cold war not ended 
if the cold war was still active the soviets would never have 
allowed iraq to risk a confrontation with the united states 
coffin said because such a confrontation all too easily could have 
led to an americansoviet encounter part of the history of the 
last 50 years is how the two superpowers avoided collisions 
coffin who as chaplain at yale was spiritual leader of the 
antiwar movement during the vietnam era is critical of bushs 
enormous and provocational buildup in saudi arabia he 
argues the effort should have been more genuinely multinational 
just as no realistic communist specter existed for bush to raise 
in justifying his course no democracy was threatened by saddams 
aggression no democracy existed not in the palaces of the 
emirate of kuwait or the kingdom of saudi arabia 
instead bush said naked aggression was at play in saddams 
invasion he equated saddams aggression in the 1990s to adolf 
hitlers in the 1930s and suggested the world could not afford to 
make the mistake it made then 
if history teaches us anything it is that we must resist 
aggression or it will destroy our freedoms bush said in a 
television address aug 8 to the nation appeasement does not 
work 
former sen thomas eagleton dmo writing in the st louis 
postdispatch demurs from the claim that appeasement was the issue 
we acted for one reason and one reason only oil eagleton 
wrote if mali were to invade burkina faso we would send a 
letter of deep regret by regular mail 
a week later bush cited the wayoflife argument declaring 
before a pentagon audience our jobs our way of life our own 
freedom and the freedom of friendly countries around the world 
would suffer if control of the worlds great oil reserves fell into 
the hands of saddam hussein 
thats unquestionably true but not much of a rallying cry

with some modest fanfare joan lunden today 
celebrates her 10th anniversary as cohost of abcs good morning 
america this makes her somewhat extraordinary lasting in a job 
that is a peopleeater 
i have to say im surprised that im sitting here being the 
person who has the most tenure on the morning shows she says 
referring to those in the cohost and coanchor business 
it seems like it was just yesterday that i was the new kid on 
the block 
her time on active dawn duty goes against tradition network 
morning show stars tend to be televisions wandering tribe often 
moving on because of their own decisions management anxiety or 
both 
within the last 12 months six other such stars have left or 
found new homes notably jane pauley 
succeeded by deborah norville as part of the controversial 
changes that sent once toprated today skidding into second 
pauley is doing well in with prime time nbc news specials after 13 
today years 
today news anchor john palmer an nbc news veteran got 
moved out in that shows shuffle he left nbc and now has a 
syndicated series faith daniels left the cbs morning news and 
now has palmers old nbc job 
kathleen sullivan of cbs this morning got the gate and now 
is pondering her next move she was succeeded by paula zahn who 
left abcs world news this morning 
and new mother maria shriver left nbcs sunday today to have 
more family time although she remains with nbc news 
but lunden who is only the third female cohost good morning 
america has had since it began in november 1975 has stayed put 
married to television producer michael krauss shes even 
managed to have three kids during her time on the program 
lunden who turns 40 next month and this summer signed a new 
fiveyear contract with abc says she hasnt had any desire to 
leave good morning america but then her life on the show has 
been relatively serene 
and her show unlike today and the shows that represent cbs 
many years of efforts to make ratings in the morning hasnt had 
the public turmoil of the kind that last year made today a 
daily twohour soap opera 
lunden a ceaselessly cheery woman better known for warmth than 
penetrating interviews hasnt even had a good headlinemaking 
incident like sullivans offair jabs at cbs management that made 
their way into print last year 
the best lunden has been able to stir up was a preemptive 
onair strike this summer she told viewers that reporters from the 
tabloid national enquirer had been poking into her life asking 
friends if shed seemed troubled lately 
why she bothered was a bit puzzling in any event the editor of 
the paper said the queries hadnt turned up anything oh well the 
nation said and life went on 
actor david hartman who hosted good morning america from 
the start until newsman charles gibson succeeded him in january 
1987 was an avuncular man on the air 
but offcamera he was said to be a tough demanding man one 
who wanted it known the shows focus was on him not his cohost 
despite that lunden who first worked for the show as a 
consumer reporter in 1976 said she got along fine with hartman 
because i just made sure that things between them stayed nice 
all the time 
im not saying that i wasnt very frustrated many times with 
the real tight restrictions that were put on my abilities to do 
stories and expand my job but i didnt allow that to become an 
issue with david and me 
because i knew very clearly that if that happened and that 
relationship went everything else was a moot point i was gone i 
was out of there 
while hartman was the host good morning america had a good 
run as first in ratings but it started slipping toward the end of 
his stay and generally stayed in second until coming on strong 
last year in the wake of the today debacle 
it has been first for 33 consecutive weeks but during its long 
stay in second lunden said those on the show didnt get a lot of 
pressure from abc brass or those of capital cities the networks 
new owners 
they really just said hey go out there enjoy it be 
curious and have a good time she said they said if it 
works the ratings will go up and they did 
 
elsewhere in television 
reason no 398 to continue breathing remember the teenage 
mutant ninja turtles well cbs feels it is not enough just to 
start a saturday morning cartoon series with them on sept 15 it 
now also says it will have a sneak preview of the onehour 
series for kids on sept 8 and include in the show a 
savetheenvironment segment called turtle tips

helping farmers make the best management 
decisions in the face of swift agricultural changes is the goal of 
a new university laboratory in the nations heartland 
the farm management laboratory is drawing on the university of 
illinois experience running its own farms as well as its records 
from more than 7000 private farms and its research in agricultural 
economics 
coming out of the financial crisis of the 80s we are 
concerned about the impact of environmental issues and government 
programs said rob hornbaker chairman of the board that will 
manage the laboratory 
the lab which opened recently in the department of agricultural 
economics is gathering information and plans to distribute it to 
farmers and extension advisers throughout the state one of the 
leading producers of corn and other key crops 
creation of the lab comes against a background of growing 
pressure on farmers to become increasingly sophisticated about 
managing a business subject to the whims of a global marketplace 
farm prices can rise or fall dramatically in one day because of 
the volatility created by trading in the futures exchanges of 
chicago where contracts on crops often are influenced by news 
beyond a farmers control 
we have a lot of knowledge relating to farm management and we 
wanted to put it together in one place said hornbaker an 
agricultural economist 
it will take about 250000 a year to operate the lab he said 
and university officials hope a substantial portion will come from 
outside research contracts and individual and corporate 
contributions 
one source of information will be production and financial data 
from more than 40 universitymanaged commercial farms 
another will be the universitys farm business farm management 
system which includes comprehensive records from more than 7000 
private farms in the state 
that system is directed at analyzing records for farmers and 
helping them look at their business plans said hornbaker but 
it does not research new issues 
the lab is gathering data from research under way and plans to 
launch new research projects 
for example information is being collected about raising 
conventional crops like corn and wheat vs alternative or exotic 
crops ranging from spices to belgian endive 
analysis of the economic implications of various enterprises 
has to be more site specific geared to a particular part of the 
state than it has in the past hornbaker said 
studies likely will evaluate the economic impact of various 
levels of production inputs as well as techniques for protecting 
the environment and dealing with changes in government farm 
programs 
there is a move toward more flexibility in farm programs so 
we have to help farmers take a closer look at the economic issues 
that raises hornbaker said 
an external advisory council of about 12 people from various 
segments of illinois agricultural industry will help the 
laboratory develop its priorities 
as the laboratory gathers research results and management 
information it will develop educational materials that can be 
distributed to farmers and extension advisers perhaps at workshops 
on particular subjects said hornbaker 
the bottom line benefit to farmers is a more precise economic 
analysis of all these issues that affect their operations so they 
have a basis for making the best management decisions hornbaker 
said 
everything we do will have an economic component

by defeating a virtual unknown in a traditionally democratic 
district 
and that was before the federal government decided to list the 
northern spotted owl as a threatened species 
republicans now are sensing that unsoeld may be endangered 
herself she is being challenged by a feisty conservative former 
state rep bob williams who would be the first gop congressman 
from the district in 30 years 
williams was the republican challenger against the states 
popular gov booth gardner in 1988 he lost in a landslide but 
gave the governor fits with his frenetic energy and kamikaze 
political style 
unsoeld and williams both have opposition in the sept 18 
primary but they already are campaigning against each other the 
candidates talk about the deficit and the savings and loan debacle 
abortion and basic philosophical differences but the campaign is 
dominated by the timber issue 
the owl in july was listed as threatened under the federal 
endangered species act the decision is certain to shut down 
millions of acres of prized oldgrowth timber largely on us 
forest service lands to protect the owl 
loggers fear that the annual harvest will be slashed by half 
decimating small timber communities that dot the lush olympic 
peninsula and other timberlands of washington oregon and northern 
california 
unsoeld an ardent environmentalist is on the defensive on 
several occasions shes waded into hostile timber rallies a sort 
of joleneinthelionsden approach that buttressed her scrappy 
image 
in may she was barred by angry picketers from a union hall 
where shed been invited she stood in the chill west wind for 
nearly three hours putting up with taunts and jeers 
im doing my damnedest to support you she cried at one 
point 
unsoeld a mountainclimber citizen activist and fouryear 
member of the state house before going to washington sees herself 
as a centrist and a realist on the issue 
she backed a congressionally approved ban on the export of 
unprocessed logs from most stateowned lands in the west in 
washington the new law will cut the exports of state timber by 75 
percent domestic mills will be helped but loggers and 
longshoremen say it will cause a net loss of jobs 
unsoeld 58 also wants tax breaks and negotiations with the 
japanese as possible ways to expand the timber supply and volume 
processed before export she champions new forestry which 
includes selective logging of oldgrowth timber 
unsoeld shrugs off the anger from the traditionally democratic 
loggers 
timber communities have been going through shock rage 
anguish and fear all absolutely legitimate emotions she said 
in an interview but we are beginning to see elected officials 
and community leaders say hey we can sit here screaming and 
crying or we can do something about it 
williams 48 a bespectacled intense man who served a decade in 
the legislature and earned his spurs as a budget watchdog says 
unsoeld deserves every ounce of the blame shes getting 
she was elected by the timber workers and she has deserted 
them he said they want someone in congress who will go to bat 
not only for their jobs but for their way of life 
he accuses unsoeld of representing the more extreme part of 
the environmental movement 
williams supports higher harvest levels amendments to the 
endangered species act to require consideration of socioeconomic 
impacts a study to see whether owls can survive in secondgrowth 
forests tax incentives for woodlot owners and tougher trade 
negotiations with the japanese he opposes export bans 
says unsoeld after ranting and raving for months my opponent 
is now advocating threefourths of my timber plan 
rep al swift dwash who represents a neighboring 
congressional district calls williams an opportunist challenger 
who is trying to exploit the fears of working people 
lance henderson spokesman for the state republican party 
shoots back unsoelds radical environmental views and her 
extreme liberal views on economics her antibusiness views and her 
lack of sufficient support for the timber community shows she 
doesnt fit the district

editors note mexico city has been largely rebuilt since that 
disastrous earthquake of 1985 but its citizens are not the same 
in rebuilding their shattered city the people learned something 
about themselves they learned that by pulling together they no 
longer had to depend on a sometimes undependable government 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
the catastrophic earthquake that devastated 
mexico city five years ago lasted only a minute or so but it set 
in motion political and social tremors still felt today 
besides leveling buildings and homes killing thousands some 
estimates say 30000 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless 
the quake seriously damaged the image of invincibility of the 
governing political party radicalized many citizens and 
demonstrated to many others if only briefly the viability of 
people power 
the institutional revolutionary party pri still governs the 
city of 15 million but less certainly than before most of the 
volunteers who poured into the streets returned home changed more 
confident of their power and distrustful of the government some of 
the volunteers stayed on as political activists 
in the moments after the thunder of buildings falling to the 
ground subsided citizens took charge 
they rushed into the battered streets to rescue the trapped and 
unearth the dead they set up shelters for the homeless and started 
rebuilding and they did all this without help from a paternalistic 
government that had always done everything did it without the 
omnipresent pri 
i would say that five years later it is still trembling in 
mexico city says adolfo aguilar zinser a political analyst 
newspaper columnist and researcher at the national universitys 
center for us studies 
it showed mexico city for just a second in the historical 
framework of time what it would be like to be in a city where the 
government becomes subordinate and accountable and the people 
emerge and the people rule and the government obeys 
the quake hit at 719 am on sept 19 while most people were 
at home or en route to work registering 81 in the richter scale 
it was classified a great quake another the next day measured 
75 but most of the damage was already done 
in a country where the government had been the main provider of 
assistance for decades citizens of all stripes students 
neighbors private engineers tough street gangs went into the 
streets by the thousands to help one government estimate said 
there were 1 million volunteers unusual in a country with no 
tradition of grassroots volunteerism 
they organized themselves into brigades to dig their way to 
survivors pull out bodies bring food and water to the homeless 
and the rescue workers 
the people were trying to save peoples lives and the 
government was trying to regain control says adrian de lope 
then a student at the private anahuac university 
now 25 de lope was one of those who stayed in volunteer work 
he spent four years after graduation working with the schools 
housing and community development project for earthquake victims 
hes still a fundraiser for the project 
the people have the power or at least they know that they can 
have it he says they now know that they are able to do things 
that they didnt know they were able to do before 
lorenzo meyer a historian at the colegio de mexico says many 
city dwellers were already fed up with the authoritarian political 
system 
but that particular governmental tardiness the slowness of 
the response made them more willing to criticize openly the 
behavior of the bureaucracy and the lack of leadership of 
president miguel de la madrid 
on the other hand government officials say no city hit by such 
a large disaster has been able to rebuild so fast they point to 
the reconstruction replacement repair or financing of 105000 
housing units in three years 
the magnitude of the damage the tragedy was so great that we 
even had to take a while to be able to perceive and know the extent 
of the disaster says enrique jackson president of the pri in 
mexico city certainly if it hadnt been for society we wouldnt 
have been able to begin to attend to and help the affected people 
the people had a big role 
the pri began to recoup organizing residents into 
reconstruction committees at the new housing units 
out of the rubble questions arose citizens asked how the 
buildings that fell had been built they wondered why hospitals 
government offices the 14story nuevo leon building collapsed 
killing hundreds 
after a week the government stopped counting bodies as if to 
try to diminish the disaster 
the government was directly in charge of some of those 
constructions somebody you can pinpoint as the guilty one meyer 
says you can end with another classic case of corruption so you 
diminish the importance of the damage and hope that society will 
not demand an inquiry 
no one went to jail in connection with any of the collapses 
but in the july 1988 general election de la madriess to negotiate 
both scowcroft and iraqi ambassador mohamed almashat endorsed 
the concept of a mediating role by un secretary general javier 
perez de cuellar who is seeking urgent talks with iraqi officials 
this week 
scowcroft said saddam has shown himself to be a realist citing 
his willingness two weeks ago to bow to irans terms for a 
settlement of their eightyear war among other concessions saddam 
agreed to recognize the prewar boundary of the two countries 
almashat contrasted iraqs desire for peace with the 
american design to have war he said the us aggressive 
intentions were demonstrated by the dispatch of offensive weaponry 
including stealth fighter bombers to saudi arabia 
he said the us allegation that iraq posed a threat to saudi 
arabia was the biggest deception in history 
the undersecretary of state for political affairs robert 
kimmitt said that sooner or later saddams hand will be forced by 
the economic sanctions 
i think they the sanctions are becoming increasingly 
effective i think the difference between this sanction regime and 
past sanctions regimes is that it enjoys the virtually unanimous 
support of the world community and therefore i think the sanctions 
are beginning to pinch more and more as each day goes by kimmitt 
said

the pris jackson says economic crisis and increasing masses of 
poor not the quake hurt his party the party won in the voting 
districts hardest hit by the quake he says 
the pri won the congressional and mexico city assembly races 
but in those same districts the left defeated salinas 
the city today looks much the same as it did many of the shiny 
glasswalled highrises are reconstructed earthquakedamaged 
buildings 
by contrast the weathered steel skeleton of an agriculture 
department building juts out on reforma boulevard one of numerous 
structures yet to be rebuilt or torn down there are parks or 
vacant lots where buildings once stood small camps house some of 
the thousands who remain homeless 
brightly colored vecindades small row houses around an inner 
patio stand out in lowincome neighborhoods where old shacks 
given a final blow in the quake were torn down 
some government offices moved out of downtown or to the 
provinces 
a construction code passed after the quake stiffened 
requirements for tall buildings but there is lingering worry about 
another major quake seismologists are keeping an eye on a fault in 
a different location off the pacific coast movement there they 
say could shake the lake bed where mexico city sits as strongly as 
the last quake 
if there is a tremor now its not the same as before now we 
know that buildings fall and people die now people react with more 
fear to earthquakes says carmen blanco a national university 
psychology professor she worked in the schools postearthquake 
psychology service 
if the city has been largely rebuilt its people will never be 
the same again 
evangelina corona 52 who worked as seamstress on san antonio 
abad street dared not confront her employer before the quake now 
she is an outspoken union leader 
before the quake she sewed so fast her machine smoked she 
thought it good of her employer to give a country woman with a 
thirdgrade education a chance 
then the buildings crammed with sewing factories gave way 
trapping hundreds of seamstresses her boss said the jobs were 
gone there would be little severance 
by midoctober seamstresses from the different factories had 
organized into a nongovernment union 
antonio paz quit his job as a government social worker because 
of the way the government was handling recovery efforts he helped 
organize his damaged neighborhood first to survive then rebuild 
without government help 
paz works with an organization called campamentos unidos camps 
united a selfhelp housing association rebuilding neighborhoods 
with no government assistance with help from operation usa and 
other international groups it also has built a neighborhood clinic 
and is planning to build a center for studies of the neighborhood 
to provide research advice and training for projects 
some of the quake victims are also rebuilding their lives 
inspired by handicapped vietnam veterans in miami where he was 
fitted for prosthesis celso garcia has remarried and he and his 
wife are expecting a baby his first wife one of his two 
daughters a sister and a cousin died in the quake when their 
fourthfloor apartment collapsed both his legs were amputated 
dr jose juan hernandez cruz trapped four days between the 
concrete slabs of the governments juarez hospital has not married 
but has adopted a daughter now 2 he works at a health department 
clinic until midafternoon and at a prison in the evenings hes 
looking foward to visiting the marseilles france team that 
rescued him 
the 19 babies who were discovered one by one in the wreckage of 
hospitals the last one nearly nine days after the quake are now 
in kindergarten one has met the american firemen who rescued her 
one of the 19 is evelia alvarez gasca who lost her mother in 
the quake she is being cared for by a 31yearold aunt who has 
cancer 
raul reyes gonzalez is a street vendor selling fried pork skins 
and other tidbits since the earthquake he has been doing volunteer 
work at a neighborhood housing association 
reyes gonzalez old slum neighborhood was the site of one of 
campamentos unidos first projects before the quake it was a 
collection of oneroom wood and cardboard shacks with two bathrooms 
for 600 people too flimsy to be damaged 
government and private projects put up condominiums replacing 
communal toilets and laundry sinks with facilities for each 
apartment 
simply with the bathrooms socially there has been a 90degree 
turn reyes says we arent yet high society but were living 
like human beings 
he says he still works as a volunteer for the satisfaction of 
seeing others have a home worthy of a mexican

five years ago the world of celso garcia 
collapsed around him today with the help of some handicapped 
vietnam veterans in florida he has put it together again 
garcias wife his 4yearold daughter a sister and a cousin 
all were killed when the fivestory building where they lived 
collapsed in the mexico city earthquake of sept 19 1985 garcias 
legs had to be amputated 
the walls split apart as if sliced by a knife he recalls 
just before that i watched the wall at the head of the bed fall 
on my wife 
i saw the floor open up and i fell through 
he called to his family one by one only rubi his 7yearold 
daughter pinned beneath him answered 
trapped in the rubble he at first felt a tingling in his legs 
then he felt nothing 
i began to see myself without legs he says 
when a rescue worker reached them hours later he took away the 
piece of glass garcia had been gripping in his hand a way out 
should the wait become too long and the pain too great 
rubi suffered severed tendons in one arm with therapy she has 
regained most of the use of her fingers 
with most of his family dead and his home destroyed garcia 
wondered what the future held answers came from the veterans in 
miami 
with help from the world organizations for private and voluntary 
assistance he went to south florida to be fitted for prostheses 
and for rehabilitation the broward county paralyzed veterans 
association paid his airfare 
his rehabilitation at the sunrise rehabilitation center in 
sunrise went far beyond the physical 
i thought at one time that a handicapped person wasnt 
respected or valued that he was a burden he said but i saw 
that even though they were handicapped in worse ways those 
veterans had their lives 
for nearly three months he went bowling with the veterans to 
shopping centers everywhere 
i saw that they were as normal as anyone and i asked myself 
why i couldnt do this in my country and this has raised my 
spirits he says 
garcia is now remarried and his new wife is expecting a baby he 
has a job as coordinator of the vocational junior high school where 
he used to teach 
they live in an apartment complex put up by rotary 
international he drives an adapted car also from world 
organizations he taught summer classes to neighborhood children 
when i have the opportunity when i go out i go without 
prostheses so that people who have this problem or may have it in 
the future know you can overcome things he says

among those original settlers were the brothers jacob and 
william kersh whose father andrew immigrated to south carolina 
from germany with his family in the mid18th century as a 
teenager andrew kersh was bonded out as an indentured servant to 
help pay for his familys passage to america he later fought in 
the revolutionary war with the 6th south carolina regiment 
jacob kersh served in the war of 1812 for years his sword was 
on display in the museum in the old state capitol but when they 
moved the museum somebody lost it 
william kersh was an enterprising blacksmith as well as a 
farmer figuring that cowbells were hard to come by on the 
frontier he hammered out a barrel full of bells before he left and 
sold them along the way 
he also brought along his slave bub an african he had bought 
off a slave ship in charleston and taught to speak english 
many of the early shiloh settlers owned slaves jones in his 
account says that after a new church was built part of it was 
set apart for the negroes and later on when there were white 
people enough to fill the church the negroes were allowed the use 
of it one sunday in each month and a preacher was employed to 
preach to them 
the first shiloh tabernacle was a brush arbor with six tents 
built of pine logs large bonfires made of pine knots provided the 
lighting 
for years a fence surrounded the grounds so that people could 
bring livestock and chickens for food they erected a communal feed 
pen filled with corn to feed the animals 
mary baines 64 another bean sheller at the recent meeting 
remembers the chickens 
before we had refrigeration everybody brought chickens she 
says we all had our own stump out back where we had the chickens 
cooked you could hire a cook to come up here night and day for 10 
for the whole time 
before electricity was installed campers brought with them wood 
stoves for the cooking 
mrs baines says her familys tent had a sawdust floor until the 
present structure was built 17 years ago now its sort of a 
triplex with quarters for the families of her son doug baines and 
soninlaw larry varner all under the same roof 
the rev rodney smith minister of shiloh united methodist 
church for the past four years says there are presently 50 tents 
any church member can build a cabin on the churchs 88 acres 
provided they maintain it most are passed along from generation to 
generation 
a new addition is a small museum built in the style of the 
tents which houses memorabilia photos and scrapbooks telling of 
shilohs history 
that history recalls the civil war which brought an end to the 
camp meetings for the next two decades 
when mississippi seceded from the union and war was imminent 
shiloh mustered a company of volunteers the rankin grays to go 
fight the yankees 
the camp meetings resumed in 1881 and have been held every year 
since except for three years later in that decade when the country 
was suffering a yellow fever epidemic 
the christian crusaders at shiloh have suffered some other 
tribulations 
a note written by mrs lula martin lindsey in 1928 from 
information provided by her father albert e martin tells of the 
struggle against demon rum 
almost from the beginning the camp meeting has met with 
opposition first from evil disposed persons who came to the 
grounds to create trouble when whiskey was plentiful the camp 
meeting rowdy was generally on hand and policemen had to be 
employed to keep order when whiskey was outlawed the camp meeting 
rowdy disappeared if the eighteenth amendment prohibition is 
repealed and we have whiskey again these disturbers of public 
worship likely will be on hand again 
in preparing for the 1860 meeting a meeting of the tent holders 
passed a resolution stating that we forbid the sale of cakes and 
spirituous liquors within the limits of the corporation 
shiloh survived the repeal of prohibition and attendance 
remains healthy though not as healthy as it once was smith 
estimated that 500 people came this year back in the 30s 
according to contemporary accounts campers averaged between 1500 
and 2000 
still they come year after year

editors note art treasures plundered from conquered nazi 
germany have been turning up from moscow to krakow to a tiny town 
in texas now with the two germanys ready to reunite officials 
hope to restore a cultural heritage that was torn asunder by war 
part of that effort is to find the pilfered artwork and get it 
back

in 1945 as the red army advanced on 
germany a soviet soldier stumbled across a stunning collection of 
drawings and watercolors by masters such as rembrandt durer and 
van dyck stashed in a castle for safekeeping 
the soldier an architect in an engineering unit bundled what 
he could off to moscow and stored the works in a museum there they 
sat for decades covered and concealed from the world 
now the aging soldier says the 364 pieces should go back to 
their original owner a german museum the kunsthalle in bremen 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has written to 
his soviet counterpart eduard shevardnadze asking that the works 
be returned 
the germanys racing to reunite their politics and peoples are 
also trying to restore their cultural heritage devastated by war 
and its plunders 
but the task is as monumental as some of the missing treasures 
during world war ii german museums libraries and churches 
packed up their most valuable works and shipped them off for 
safekeeping from allied bombing raids later many treasures were 
again moved by the nazis to caves or salt mines to hide them from 
advancing troops 
the destruction of war the multiple moves incomplete or 
missing inventories and plundering occupation troops all conspired 
to conceal the fate of some of the treasures 
art historians say troops from both the west and the east moved 
german artworks out of the country after the war 
in addition fires were often reported in art repositories some 
historians question whether some of the fires actually occurred or 
whether they destroyed everying that was claimed to have been lost 
i fear that much of what was officially burned is still 
somewhere said one museum researcher who didnt want to be 
identified by name 
in addition to individual instances of plundering many art 
historians say some treasures were removed with official sanction 
for use as cultural reparations 
although that policy was later rejected in the west and many 
objects were returned historians say it is not possible to tell 
how much of what was taken was given back 
the problem is that this was done by forces who were operating 
like the intelligence forces without documents or with documents 
that were not declassified up to now the museum official said 
it was a problem of all four of the allies 
for many years these things were considered lost anyway 
because we had no information whatsoever said a government 
source in bonn who spoke on condition of anonymity 
you could say this is one of the last fields of really 
finishing with the consequences of war 
in july government and art representatives from west and east 
germany agreed to establish a berlinbased databank to pool 
information from museums churches and libraries on missing art and 
its last known location 
klaus maurice director of the west german cultural foundation 
of the states said the list could be completed in three years 
we will make a list of what was lost not what must be 
found he said we dont want to give advice for police 
improving eastwest relations and recent finds have already 
fueled hopes that more could follow 
in a texas court an east german church financed by west 
germany is fighting the heirs of a us soldier who the church 
claims made off with a cache of priceless objects hidden in a mine 
us forces occupied the quedlinburg area 120 miles southwest of 
berlin in 1945 
the treasures include a silver ivory and gold reliquary from 
the 9th or 10th century a 10thcentury byzantine rockcrystal 
flask and an ivory comb inlaid with precious stones 
an art investigator working with the prussian cultural heritage 
foundation tracked the quedlinburg treasures to whitewright texas 
about 60 miles north of dallas last may 
the foundation which includes 15 museums in west berlin the 
prussian state library and prussian state archives houses the 
collections of the former prussian empire 
curators from its museums are working with varying degrees of 
success to find and return their lost treasures ranging from 
trojan gold to prehistoric baskets 
the bremen case is typical of what happened to germanys art 
during the war the museum sent its masterpieces to several places 
throughout the country for safekeeping in 1943 said director 
siegfried salzmann 
about 4000 items went to a castle northwest of berlin to 
prevent damages by air attacks he said soviet troops occupied 
the area in april 1945 
the soviet soldier victor baldin asked his superiors what was 
to be done with the art and when they showed no interest he packed 
off what he could to moscow salzmann said

editors note once the only sounds came from the constant rush 
of icy water or the occasional dip of a canoes paddle now 
however the pristine silence of this michigan woodland is 
shattered by the roar of war the national guard in training 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>

the trout still rise deaf to the war 
around them they lift to the surface rippling the black river in 
chase of mayflies hatching in the dusk of a michigan evening 
bombs make thunder in the distance the soldiers of camp 
grayling are in training 
if not for the national guard the au sable river would be 
heaven for trout fishermen as it once was 
if not for the fishermen the state forest in the heart of 
michigans lower peninsula would be a military paradise for 
simulating air raids and tank shellings 
the town of grayling delicately depends on both for its bustling 
economy 
you will find a way to compromise or you will perish city 
manager jerry morford says some people like to fish some people 
think the guard needs a place to train 
grayling needs both 
the river cuts through its heart and the town of about 2500 is 
literally surrounded by the accoutrements of war the airfield is 
on the northwest side of town the main camp sits on the west with 
a proposed air assault strip farther out the tank firing range is 
on the east 
on the airtoground artillery range north of grayling 4000 
jets and helicopters and gunships each year bombard the duncolored 
soil with bombs and bullets some of the bombs are live most are 
concrete dummies 
some local residents take comfort in the shelling i get some 
sense of security out of knowing that these people are here says 
henry mason a world war ii veteran living in nearby gaylord 
guard opponents worry that the exploded shells are lacing the 
river headwaters with lead and other heavy metals creating a toxic 
nomans land guard officials refute the claim 
to add to the irony a pair of bald eagles has been successfully 
raising chicks inside the artillery range for three years 
this was a rather contained battle until the late 1970s when 
the end of the military draft focused new attention on building up 
the nations oldest force the national guard 
national guard training camps are expanding around the country 
to train the nations estimated 568000 citizensoldiers many of 
whom are now headed for the persian gulf 
the guard proposes a firing range on federal land in 
northeastern montana a 630000acre tank range in nevada maines 
national guard wants to build a 720000acre training camp called 
deepwoods 
theyre squandering our natural resources says grace 
bukowski in nevada with the national rural alliance for military 
accountability i question the need for more acres the military 
now controls 25 million acres in the country 
in michigan camp grayling has become a yearround proving 
ground for the states forces for other states and even for 
military contractors wanting to test weapon systems 
the annual surge of guardsmen peaked in 1987 at more than 35000 
when the whole 38th infantry division based in indiana came to 
michigan to train 
the clash with fishermen came in 1988 on the opening day of 
trout season anglers on the au sable waded into the water to the 
sound of ohio guardsmen firing their tank cannons 
the timing was unfortunate says lt col brian downey a 
spokesman for the michigan national guard since then the guard 
has pledged to keep silent on holiday weekends and in the dead of 
night 
the basic element of the conflict is because we make noise 
downey says its the nature of the place until they find a 
silencer for a howitzer theres no way to get around it 
the guard means about 4 million a year to grayling by the 
militarys own estimates of what guardsmen spend on gasoline 
chewing gum beer and other items just to make sure the guard 
sends camp participants on their twoday passes with 100 in their 
pockets 
to some grayling has sold its heritage to the military 
theres a disease here says arnold copeland a connecticut 
fisherman who retired here last year the river is being 
stakedriven through the heart by military officials 
i am just sick of people whose life is dependent on wrecking 
cars or killing fish or blowing up trees 
a mile or two from the tankshelling range rusty gates lodge 
marks the beginning of what fishermen revere as the holy water 
that is how good the fishing is that is how religious trout 
fishermen are about their sport 
gates hosts fishermen from around the world and speaks with 
venom about the guard 
a forest fire raced along the au sable last spring gutting 
cabins and burning trees right to the waters edge 
guardsmen claimed they saved gates lodge from burning but when 
they showed up two days later with cameras to document the 
save gates ran them off his land 
instead gates gave credit to fate we are just fortunate 
he said sitting outside his lodge flanked by the river on one 
side and charred timber on three 
poet michael delp lived and taught in grayling for 13 years and 
recalls local stories an irate cabin owner who held a trespassing 
tank at bay with his shotgun guardsmen strolling into town 
convenience stores with rifles slung across their backs lying 
awake in the dark at 3 am as the house shakes from the 
concussions of artillery 
its ridiculous it looks like occupied europe sometimes he 
says

he kicked a drug and alcohol habit but actor 
gregory harrison is still addicted to surfing 
hes so addicted that he once went to denmark to surf in the 
chill north sea waters surrounded by nudist bathers 
i found an old surfboard and surfed for three days he says 
it was so cold thats what i remember that it was cold and 
everyone else was naked i was the only person on the beach with 
clothes on 
harrison who stars in the new cbs comedy series the family 
man plus a couple of tv movies during the 199091 season spends 
much of his time on a quest to ride the worlds best waves 
in the family man harrisons fourth series hes a fire 
chief trying to raise four children after the death of his wife it 
premieres next saturday his most recent series was falcon 
crest before that he starred in trapper john for seven 
years and was in logans run for one season 
in one of the upcoming tv movies harrison plays a psychopathic 
killer stalking jane seymour in angel of death on cbs later in 
the season he stars in sail away filmed on location in the 
virgin islands 
hes also the host of shore break a onehour syndicated 
show about travel sports and fashions 
harrisons passion for surfing has taken him to south america 
central america africa bali spain portugal france and the 
south pacific 
he grew up in catalina where his father operated a glassbottom 
boat and started surfing at age 11 
harrison says surfing is more than just a pastime its a 
craving he says now that i truly understand what cravings are 
all about in surfing terms im an addict people who are not 
addicted find they have to get up too early travel too far work 
too hard at it only the addicts keep at it seven out of 10 times 
you dont find waves its the other three times that keep you 
coming back 
he has kicked another addiction 
after trapper john ive been taking care of myself he 
says ive made some changes in my life and priorities i went to 
the betty ford clinic to stop my addiction to drugs and alcohol i 
cant blame that on trapper john im genetically inclined to be 
an an alcoholic and addict my income made it possible to succumb 
after trapper john i was burned out falcon crest was as 
pleasureable as the last few years of trapper john were 
miserable i enter this new series with confidence that it will be 
a good experience and knowing that i wont have to make sacrifices 
for a paycheck and to keep my career going 
harrison and his wife randi have two children and a third on 
the way in the family man he has four 
im trying to be father and mother to the family he says 
and pretty much making a mess of things hopefully in a comedic 
way one of the things i like about the show is that its more 
grounded in sentiment and truth than most sitcoms i see 
harrison not only grew up surfing but he grew up watching movies 
being made 
i was 15 when doris day and rod taylor came to catalina to 
make the glass bottom boat he says it was the most 
thrilling day of my life arthur godfrey ran the boat which was my 
fathers boat 
marlon brando and yul brynner came to catalina for morituri 
about a ship in world war ii i watched marlon like a hawk i had 
no idea then that id ever be an actor i was just fascinated my 
father was hired to bring the cast out to the freighter every day 
he did his tours in between 
harrisons first series was the science fiction logans run 
in 1977 i watched it the other day on cable he says 
my wife said its you or at least i think its you i 
thought it was so sophisticated then star wars came out it made 
us look like the 1930s buck rogers serial

rise amp shine irs john kay amp steppenwolf 
john kay may never produce another song to match the 
freedombreathing glory of born to be wild but he hasnt 
stopped trying 
the new steppenwolf album rise amp shine is like a postcard 
from a forgotten friend its not a work of fine art but it 
delivers effectively enough kays message that adulthood is no 
excuse for compromising on youthful ideals 
it would be easy to dismiss kay as just another 1960s act 
capitalizing on his appeal to baby boomers but steppenwolf wasnt 
just another pop band their music was as political as it was 
psychedelic and kay is still a social critic 
twenty years ago he condemned drug dealers in the pusher 
and railed against political apathy in monster 
on this album hes trying to raise his listeners environmental 
consciousness on do or die and lashing out slyly at the 
national addiction to debt in sign on the line 
the title track becomes a plea for social activism as kay 
recalls his own reawakening ive been searching for the man i 
used to be i found him waiting alive and well and he was 
screaming back at me rise and shine 
the album hits its most topical point on the wall in which 
kay first tells the story of his childhood escape from east germany 
with his mother then rejoices at seeing the berlin wall torn down 
late last year 
the 10 cuts on rise and shine lack the psychedelic sound of 
the original steppenwolf although kay still has that voice an 
animal growl that remains one of rocks most distinctive sounds 
most of the tunes are modernsounding straightahead rockers that 
allow the threeman band none of them original steppenwolf 
members to work out guitarist rocket ritchotte is an ace

tangled emi jane wiedlin 
jane wiedlin was largely responsible for everything that was 
good about the gogos on tangled her second solo project she 
improves vastly upon that 
the 10 selections nine of them cowritten by wiedlin with 
others lean toward bouncy guitardriven pop with engaging female 
harmonies that recall such 1980s gogos hits as our lips are 
sealed and weve got the beat 
but the songs on tangled are more complex and varied no two 
tracks sound alike perhaps because no two were written by the same 
team 
love is a common theme on the album but love has many faces and 
wiedlin takes a good look at a number of them 
the title track is about the tangled emotions that arise when a 
love goes bad but the need for love remains 
wiedlin explores the other side of the coin in big rock candy 
mountain in which a woman jaded by too many heartbreaks can 
hardly believe it when she finally finds the real thing 
world on fire the first single from the album is a 
playful pumpedup scorcher that contains the memorable line i 
feel the flames of love climbing up my pantyhose 
and paper heart a moving ballad by wiedlin and cyndi 
lauper is about the pain of seeing a beloved friend changed and 
consumed by drug addiction 
tangled is a solid release that sounds better with each 
listening wiedlin is an artist to watch in the 90s

tshirt and cowboy boots 
during gigs he nearly destroyed himself hawkins has seriously 
burned himself several times when using exploding fuse boxes on 
stage 
he used to climb out of a coffin during his acts something 
george clinton of the funk group parliament later did

because he was bribed by alan freed his former promoter and 
cleveland disc jockey credited with coining the term rock n 
roll in the 1950s he credits freed with his success

when gretel ehrlich irrigates her fields of 
hay and wildflowers she slips her tiny notebook into a plastic bag 
and tucks it in her back pocket 
with pen clamped to her tshirt and shovel in hand she hikes up 
the hill behind her rock ranch house to divert channels of water 
flowing from the jagged big horn mountains 
the setting here is provocative or evocative said the 
author who has gained increasing prominence as a western writer 
since she wrote the solace of open spaces in 1985 a collection 
of essays about ranch life in wyoming 
i think of the landscape as my laboratory in a sense except 
the landscape is doing its experiment on me and not the other 
way said ehrlich i am its humble student of violent weather 
endless drought wild diversity surprising and profound beauty 
almost impossible to calculate 
mountain lions bearcats foxes and eagamily pride all tied 
into one so they meet each year to live in tents with only the 
barest of essentials to celebrate their dedication to god they 
are the offspring of pioneers remembering the way it was a century 
and a half ago and feeling stronger for it

shiloh miss each year they come with their bibles and 
bedding cooking utensils and methodist hymnals food for the body 
and sustenance for the soul 
and as they gather in late summer for the shiloh camp meeting a 
throwback to the days of methodist circuitriding preachers 
someone is sure to tell the story of how it began more than 150 
years ago 
here in the piney woods of southcentral mississippi church 
history relates a wagon train stopped at a cool spring a needed 
rest for the wandering protestant pioneers and their oxen and their 
slaves the journey along wilderness trails out of the back country 
of south carolina had been arduous and the prairie of texas was 
still a long way off 
during the pause at the spring the story goes a young girl 
whose name has been lost wandered into the woods to play swinging 
on a grapevine she fell and broke her neck 
delayed by a day for a proper christian burial which was 
watched from a distance by a group of curious choctaw indians 
several of the families decided that these gentle wooded hills 
offered as good a place as any to start a new life 
the year was 1828 
as the wagon train pushed on the lingering families began 
felling the ample pine trees to build cabins and a church which 
they named shiloh for the church they had left behind in the 
orangeburg district of south carolina 
four years later they held their first camp meeting a 
convenience for frontier preachers on horseback who served widely 
scattered congregations 
to this day the descendants of those original settlers mostly 
of german scottish and scottishirish stock return to shiloh 
each august for 10 days of concentrated oldtime religion 
they share a sense of history family pride a love of the 
methodist tradition 
shiloh which for years was called the dutch colony because 
of the germanic background of many of its settlers is located 
about 8 miles south of the town of pelahatchie its still little 
more than a settlement with a church and cemetery and an 
opensided tabernacle surrounded on three sides by crude weathered 
cabins they call tents 
the tents have no windows only vents to open to the air until 
recent years they had no floors sawdust sufficed as it still does 
on the front porches and in the aisles of the tabernacle 
there is no airconditioning no television no radios the 
campers would have it no other way 
at midafternoon on a recent day during a break in the prayer 
meetings and worship services that go on from morning until well 
into the night the campers have taken refuge from the 95degree 
heat in the shade of their sawdust front porches this is a time 
for visiting relatives most of them are kin in one way or 
another gossiping and shelling beans for the evening meal some 
kids are shooting baskets outside the tabernacle 
mrs katherine varner the attractive mother of a 12yearold 
daughter and 7yearold son is sitting alone reading the wife of 
a jackson business executive she says she has not missed a camp 
meeting since she was 2 months old 
not one 
thats unheard of she says this is better than 
christmas christmas is just one day this is 10 days 
mrs willa dean perkins one of the women shelling butterbeans 
they had picked from their gardens that morning says she has 
missed only one camp meeting in all her 70 years that was 38 years 
ago when her husbands job took them too far away 
thats not a record either they say mrs mabel sowell the 
church historian has a perfect attendance record of 80 years but 
she was away this day tending an ailing sister in meridian 
how do the chldren feel about it 
they wouldnt miss it for anything mrs varner says 
since her home is only a few miles away close enough to commute 
to the services why would mrs varner subject herself and her 
family to the deprivations of the spartan cabins 
until you sleep with sawdust in your bed you havent 
experienced it she says its hard to express the feelings i 
have 
at 3 pm the church bell peals summoning the campers to the 
afternoon service the butterbeans and basketballs are put away and 
the porches empty as the campers file into the tabernacle 
down a slope in a clump of woods behind the tents is the clear 
spring that is the wellspring of the shiloh settlement the spring 
is still in use today shielded by a gazebo and surrounded by a 
garden 
those early emigrants from south carolina were said to be 
fleeing political turmoil brought on by that states defiance of 
federal law a defiance that eventually led to secession from the 
union the rev mr jones writing 100 years later said 
when the legislature of that state passed what was called the 
nullification act nullifying some of the laws of congress many of 
the citizens of the state became apprehensive that there would be 
serious trouble with the united states government therefore many 
of the south carolians sold out their possessions loaded their ox 
wagons and started westward 
some of the pioneers dropped out of the wagon train in alabama 
after the accident at the spring the kersh rhodes and myers 
families decided to stay here in what is now rankin county they 
would be joined later by the colliers martins nobles traxlers 
and others the wagon train continued on to arkansas and texas

the osborne brothers of the grand ole 
opry worry about the demise of bluegrass music which they helped 
popularize during the past 30 years 
bobby and sonny osborne best known for their bluegrass standard 
rocky top fear that the acoustic music will not be kept alive 
by the next generation of instrumentalists 
the kids just arent trying sonny osborne 52 said in an 
interview in his dressing room at the grand ole opry house the 
players are still the same ones as 15 years ago you have to invest 
time to learn what it takes 
says brother bobby 58 no one is coming along that has the 
talent the knowhow they cant think for themselves they just 
imitate others its ok to imitate but you must get something 
going for yourself 
there are exceptions bela fleck being among the most notable 
his banjo emerged from bluegrass roots and crossed into jazz new 
age and funk the bluegrass roots are there but becoming more and 
more obscured 
if the music of guitars and banjos and fiddles does die it 
wont be because of lack of effort by the brothers they have 
helped expose bluegrass music far beyond their birthplace of hyden 
ky a mountainous coal mining region 
they are now celebrating their 26th anniversary on the opry a 
live country music show seen and heard by millions in person and 
via tv and radio 
their 1968 hit rocky top is a classic in the bluegrass 
field in 1971 they were voted best vocal group by the country 
music association the last bluegrass act to win the award 
along with lester flatt and earl scruggs they helped spread 
bluegrass on college campuses in the 1960s at the invitation of 
then president richard nixon they performed at the white house in 
1973 in what is believed to be the first such performance there 
they have made several tours of foreign countries and were among 
the first country music acts to perform in a main casino showroom 
in lake tahoe nev 
bobby a mandolinist and sonny a banjoist are selftaught 
musicians they made their recording debut on a major label in 
1956 with bobby singing in an impressive high lead tenor voice and 
sonny singing baritone 
we found a little niche with our harmony bobby said after a 
recent opry performance 
these days when not singing and playing on the opry they 
perform at about 60 bluegrass festivals a year and on cruises to 
mexico every winter the festivals are especially popular with 
bluegrass fans whose loyalty to the music can be intense 
the people plan their vacations around them sonny osborne 
said the festivals are like a big reunion where you make friends 
and so forth and so many people can play the music after the show 
they go to the campgrounds and sit and play all night and you 
dont need any amps amplifiers to hook up to 
plus the parents can take their kids and turn em loose 
theres not a bunch of drunks around 
they are concerned about the future of their music because of 
what they feel is a lack of national exposure 
bluegrass music is rarely heard on radio and not often played on 
television even hee haw the nashville network a cable tv 
station with programming based on country music does not have a 
strictly bluegrass show a gospel music show was added in the past 
year but not bluegrass 
the top singers in country music such as randy travis and george 
strait are not bluegrass oriented others such as ricky skaggs 
had to set aside their bluegrass style and switch to traditional 
country music in order to be accepted by the country music 
mainstream 
the opry has more than 60 regular performers but only a 
halfdozen are bluegrass oriented 
bluegrass also has been hurt because it has been dominated by 
men bill monroe flatt scruggs and others 
while country music has provided women role models such as 
loretta lynn and reba mcentire bluegrass has provided none with 
the possible exception of emmylou harris 
the whole situation bothers me a great deal sonny osborne 
said there just isnt a new generation coming along 
aside from the lack of radio play for bluegrass sonny said 
theres also not very much bluegrass being written bluegrass 
also is hurt because youre restricted to just certain 
instruments he said 
bobby osborne hopes the opry will help the matter 
the opry has done a lot for bluegrass music he said 
maybe they can find some new groups that would be good for the 
opry and bluegrass music

some electronic gadgets just make life easier 
from microwave ovens that zap supper to fax machines for ordering 
junk food 
some gizmos make life more enjoyable such as the walkman 
watchman and video games that fit in the palm of the hand 
some save lives such as pacemakers that keep hearts beating in 
rhythm and laser beams that allow bloodless surgery 
some offer protection from the wizardry of national defense 
sensors to personal security alarms that ward off burglars 
some like computers do things that nothing else can 
whatever its hard to imagine life without electronics they 
are to modern living what the earliest flickers of fire were to 
evolving humans a means to cook get warm find safety defeat 
the darkness signal others and allow groups to gather 
theres no aspect of our life that is not touched by 
electronics even if we do not own the product theyve made our 
lives easier enhanced lifestyles and made us healthier said 
mark rosenker of the electronics industries association a 
washingtonbased trade group 
with each and every one of these enhancements you cant 
believe you ever did without it rosenker said 
on the down side they do raise expectations getting something 
there overnight just wont do anymore it has to be faxed 
instantaneously or sent by electronic mail 
and confound it electronics dont necessarily make life 
simpler just ask anyone whos had a computer system crash from a 
bugaboo computers can even catch a virus and please make sure no 
one pulls the plug 
the electronic age has beamed a revolution into the home 
microwaves heat water for instant coffee at breakfast and with 
pushbuttoned planning can automatically cook supper 
the tv now in stereo and soon to be high definition flashes 
instant news and entertainment from signals bounced off 
globecircling satellites to dishshaped receivers remote control 
negates the need to flip dials 
vcrs retrieve what was on too late to watch the night before or 
with a rental tape become movie projectors the popcorn comes from 
the microwave of course 
how we talk to others has also changed dramatically theres 
call waiting call forwarding and call conferencing machines will 
answer if youre not around new phones can dial numbers on voice 
command 
need freedom while talking there are cordless phones and 
portable cellular phones which fit in the car or can simply be 
carried around 
no need anymore to yell for the kids just beep them on digital 
pagers once the domain of doctors lawyers and the selfimportant 
pagers are ubiquitous even the criminal element drug dealers 
prostitutes and bookies have prospered by their wizardry 
and shades of dick tracy the new ones fit on the wrist 
remember the faxless days now your personal facsimile can 
order at mcdonalds send in a food order to the grocery store 
request a song on a radio station and oh yes send business 
documents and news releases 
the home computer has more memory and more power to figure taxes 
and keep bank records use it as a word processor and kiss the 
typewriter goodbye 
laptop computers and office organizers give executives a jump 
start to the business day before they get to the office 
hightech gadgets open and close the garage door and trigger 
burglar alarms if those burglars are caught and arent dangerous 
enough to be in jail they may serve their sentence wearing an 
electronic bracelet monitored by police 
you dont have to be a geezer to remember when cars were started 
with hand cranks now they come to life with electronic ignitions 
and computer chips tell a car how much gas to burn and how evenly 
the brakes are applied 
radar helps the cops catch speeders radar detectors help 
speeders elude the cops 
sensors turn on street lights at dusk and shut them off at dawn 
you can bank by machine pay bills get cash transfer money 
forget record albums now theres compact discs and digital 
audio tape 
nintendo video games turn tvs into arcades there are handheld 
versions that fit in the palm of the hand for entertainment on the 
hoof some even convert into portable tvs 
remember arithmetic with pencil and paper now the calculator is 
where its at as the slide rule becomes as quaint as the abacus 
there are other intrusions in education college courses now 
come on vcr tapes 
even the sports world is electronic instant replays govern 
football games and radar guns measure the speed on a pitchers 
fastball 
it hasnt been all that long since the dawn of the electronic 
age in 1883 when thomas edison controlled the flow of electrons 
through a light bulb 
now its growth seems to be stuck on fast forward the us 
electronics industry is worth about 285 billion a year almost 
triple what it was just 10 years ago 
and electronics has made the world a smaller place even 
totalitarian governments know what they can do in china students 
used electronic mail and fax machines to tell the truth about 
tiananmen square 
you cant close down a society anymore once people have 
access to these things it makes it much harder to shut off their 
minds said sara kiesler professor of social and decision 
sciences at carnegiemellon university 
and she also said parents shouldnt worry too much if their 
children prefer to use calculators instead of working out problems 
manually 
we tend to cling to old ways younger people think if a 
machine can do it its a waste of time to do it by hand kiesler 
said theyre saying why bother to rub sticks together when you 
can strike a match

with compact discs becoming the format of choice for playback of 
prerecorded albums and singles there is a new wave of players 
ready to catch the eyes and ears of dedicated audiophiles 
most major electronics manufacturers are now marketing compact 
disc changers to satisfy the appetites of those who hunger for 
hours of uninterrupted digital sound 
the two most popular versions of cd changers are the magazine 
and carousel styles 
most cd magazines hold up to six discs which are loaded and 
stored horizontally once loaded the magazine is inserted into the 
player and each disc is then pulled from the magazine and 
individually played 
carousel changers on the other hand hold five discs on one 
large platter a merrygoroundlike disc tray rotates to the 
pickup mechanism to play the cd 
regardless of the make or style of the compact disc changer the 
end result is the same hours of hasslefree listening 
cd changers incorporate the same laser optics used in 
singledisc players to read the information stored on the discs 
cd changers cost more than many singledisc players but dont 
be frightened by the thought of paying a higher price for the 
convenience of owning one shopping around can pay off as dealers 
on occasion will offer quality brandname changers on sale for 
around 200 
if you dont want to wait for a sale then expect to pay 279 to 
400 for a changer 
like singledisc units changers are also available with varying 
degrees of frills 
some carousel and magazine changers are available without remote 
control and have to be programmed on the units front panel 
eliminating the remote feature can save you a few dollars 
but fully programmable changers packed with options are 
attractive heres what most of them will do 
after loading a changer with discs it can be programmed to play 
only the selections you want and in any order thanks to the laser 
pickup and the way the digital recordings are stored the changer 
can go from one disc to another to find a song in a matter of 
seconds most changers allow around 30 selections to be programmed 
some also offer selection memory and title file memory so 
favorite programs may be saved 
changers with a random play function allow the unit to pick and 
play selections on its own that feature is nice when listening to 
group greatest hits cds its like having a jukebox in your 
home 
carousel changers are manufactured by magnavox sony yamaha 
technics and onkyo 
magazinestyle changers are available from pioneer magnavox 
sanyo yamaha onkyo and others 
some unique changers include the yamaha cdc500 which uses a 
sixdisc magazine and also has a tray for singledisc play 
sanyos cpm 900 will hold up to 10 discs in its magazine six 
5inch discs and four 3inch discs 
fishers dac199 has five individual loading trays and can be 
programmed to display disc titles on its lighted front panel 
the slpc45 toploading carousel changer from technics allows 
the user to insert discs while one is playing 
sharps mvd100 is a threedisc cd changer that also plays laser 
videodiscs 
consumers also have found it handy to keep discs permanently 
stored in the cd changers magazines you simply buy more magazines 
to accommodate additional discs and build a library some of the 
magazines also are compatible with auto cd changers 
as with any stereo component it is recommended that you give 
prospective units a full instore test before buying

the laser videodisc format is actually the big brother of the 
compact disc and is continuing to grow in popularity among 
audiovideo enthusiasts 
though the concept of the opticalread disc has not changed in 
its 11year history there have been some big quality advances 
todays laser videodisc players provide more than 400 lines of 
horizontal resolution to complement large screen monitors most new 
discs range from hit movies to music videos and also incorporate 
true digital sound 
and 1989 was a banner year for disc sales in the united states 
some of the popularity growth may be attributed to the 
acceptance of the compact disc 
what can this playbackonly disc system do 
heres the lowdown on the laser videodisc format 
discs 
they come in three sizes 12 8 and 5inch the 12inch discs 
feature hit movies concerts operas and educational material 
they can contain up to 60 minutes of audiovideo programming per 
side 
the 8inch discs are usually music videos with up to 20 minutes 
of programming per side 
the 5inch laser videodiscs are known as cdvs compact disc 
video and are gold in color they resemble standard cds but are 
able to hold up to 5 minutes of video along with 20 minutes of 
audio these discs are also devoted to music 
compact discs which can be played on most current models of 
laser videodisc players are available in 3 and 5inch sizes the 
5inch disc can store up to 74 minutes of material and the 3inch 
disc up to 20 minutes 
the price of laser videodiscs also make them attractive to 
collectors of classic and hit movies many new releases on disc are 
priced at under 30 whereas the same title on a tape may cost as 
much as 90 
music videos cost even less with cdvs listing for about 10 
since these discs are read by a lowpower laser beam there is 
no wear to them with proper handling and storage they should last 
a lifetime 
players 
many leading hardware manufacturers currently offer laser 
videodisc players you can select from such names as pioneer 
magnavox yamaha sony nec mitsubishi sharp and philips 
panasonic and proton are expected to market players soon 
all of the namebrand players are available as combi units 
they will play all of the optical disc formats from cds to 12inch 
laser videodiscs lds 
these combination players are available for about the price of 
hifi vhs videocassette recorder 
pioneer also offers a lowerpriced player for 8 and 12inch 
discs which has analog instead of digital audio circuitry 
players with all of the frills offer such features as twosided 
twodisc playback and singalong capabilities 
how they work 
i recently bought a new pioneer cld1070 my third laser 
videodisc player since becoming a charter member of the laser 
camp in 1979 
its connected to a 27inch sony monitor and my stereo system 
which has a separate dolby surround processoramplifier and rear 
speakers 
this combi player can do it all the remote control allows 
the user to program selected tracks from compact discs as well as 
laser videodiscs encoded with chapter stops 
for instance if i want to see a particular scene from raiders 
of the lost ark the player can locate it in a matter of seconds 
the player will also produce jitterfree freeze frame and slow 
motion on selected discs 
the picture provided by the laser videodisc is far sharper than 
my hq vhs deck colors are vivid and true and the picture is rock 
solid 
as for the sound nothing compares to digital audio 
its a stateoftheart component which makes the home 
theater concept a reality 
this deck like most laser videodisc players can be racked into 
an audiovideo system since it has a frontloading drawer 
the player will automatically select the proper playing mode for 
compact discs or the larger lds it also knows which big discs 
contain digital soundtracks and will switch on the digital circuit 
in scanning the current lineup of players most have similar 
features so its a matter of preference when making a purchase 
another important point about this highquality format is that 
many of the feature films being released may be purchased in the 
letterbox or widescreen format 
usually when a movie filmed for the widescreen comes to the home 
tube it is cropped in a process known as pan and scan by cropping 
the wide picture it will fill up the entire television screen 
but up to twothirds of the picture may be lost in this process 
so the viewer is not seeing all of the action 
by letterboxing a videodisc release the picture is not 
cropped instead black bars are inserted on the top and bottom of 
the programmed material and the original widescreen picture is left 
intact 
with disc production currently being increased and more strongly 
backed by hardware manufacturers the laser videodisc could prove 
to be a powerful force in home entertainment in the 1990s

ordinary consumers may want need and use home computers but 
not necessarily with all the complex gizmos that attract dedicated 
hackers 
so computer marketers aiming at this broad middle range group 
have begun to concentrate on basic usefulness of the machines with 
word processing school work household management and 
entertainment at the top of the list they also are making them 
easier to set up and use 
after its initial flop with the pcjr in the home computer 
marketplace ibm scrambled to recoup by interviewing consumers 
across the country about what they really want from a household 
computer 
the business computer giant reentered the market this summer 
with its ps1 line four compact models ranging in price from 
1000 to 2000 and dedicated to such prosaic functions as 
homework financial records correspondence and information 
gathering and entertainment through software like prodigy the 
computers have builtin modems that allow communication with other 
pcs or information networks each computer which can be bought at 
department or computer stores arrives with all components in one 
box ready to set up and go to work 
approaching from the other end of the market smith corona with 
long experience in homeuse typewriters has come up with a line of 
compact personal word processors 
scm word processors range from 500 to 900 with printers 
costing an additional 200 or 300 depending on type included in 
the line is the 65pound pwp 7000lt which the company says is the 
first laptop personal word processor in the industry with ports 
for printers and modems to latch into online information services 
scm also is marketing a line of electronic typewriters range from 
230 to 430 some with displays and keyboards similar to word 
processors 
ibm looking at a 20 millionunit market that is expected to 
double in five years found that their potential consumers wanted 
something relatively simple to set up and start with but didnt 
skimp on more serious computing capabilities 
because it was developed to meet the expressed needs of 
todays contemporary families the computer has the potential to 
become as necessary to the home as the microwave oven and as useful 
as the vcr says ibms james cannavino 
each ibm model features microsoft works and an ibm dos operating 
system with selectric touch keyboard photo graphic color or 
blackandwhite high resolution display and a mouse powered by 
intel 80286 microprocessors models offer options of either 512 
kilobytes kb or 1 megabyte mb of memory if more storage is 
needed users can add optional equipment such as a 35inch 
diskette drive a 30 mb hard disk or a 525inch external disk 
drive 
the ibm machines open with an information quadrant graphic that 
gets users into any of four capability modes information for 
tutorials and online help microsoft works for word processing 
spreadsheets databases and communications storage for the users 
own software and ibm dos the operating system with menudriven 
commands for functions such as copying and formatting 
users can pick from an array of online services including 
prodigy for shopping brokerage banking and travel ticketing the 
ps1 users club for online support information and a users 
electronic bulletin board operating through prodigy and 
promenade an education and entertainment online service with 
classes tutoring library and encyclopedia access and card and 
board games prodigy is ibms joint venture with sears 
scms machines are geared primarily to word processing with 
builtin printing systems though some of its models have separate 
printers and are set up with hayes compatible 1200 baud modems so 
owners can plug into online networks 
desktop publishing capability is offered through scms 
highspeed high resolution transfer printer hrt100 which can 
print with a variety of characters and typefaces via plugin 
cartridges the company also offers a letterquality daisywheel 
printer dwp i 
the portable laptop uses the latter it also has 50000 
characters of editable internal memory and a builtin disk drive 
with storage capacity of 100000 characters per disk its display 
is a 16line backlit lcd board that flips up and it can push 
optional spreadsheet programs 
the line features what scm calls an entrylevel word processor 
the pwp 1000 this portable machine comes an 8line lcd and 32000 
characters of internal memory it offers additional storage with an 
optional 32000 character datastore card the machine features a 
builtin address file and battery backup to hold records in case of 
a power failure 
full screen monitors are featured on topofthe line scm models 
such as the pwp 5100 with a boxlike monitor and printer combined 
the pwp 100c with a printertypewriter configuration and the pwp 
220 with separate keyboard monitor and printer

the telephone has come a long way since the day in 1876 in 
boston when alexander graham bell told his laboratory assistant 
over a primitive liquid transmitter mr watson come here i 
want you 
today that liquid transmitter has evolved into cordless phones 
tapeless digital answerphones speakerphones integrated telephone 
answering machines cellular phones phones with autodialer memory 
onhook dialing and voice dialing 
voicedialing phones use voice logic sensor technology to allow 
a user to dial any of 50 individual numbers by simply saying the 
name of the person or business being called the programmable phone 
stores a voice print of each partys name and number in its memory 
so that when a name is announced it automatically dials that 
number 
some models have a builtin answering machine that greets 
callers with a digitallysynthesized voice which asks them to dial 
in their number so the call can be returned 
recently introduced by atampt are the first answering machines 
that respond to rotary phones and voice responses the twoline 
models also are the first to answer calls on one line while taking 
a message on the other 
now answering machines can get their messages from virtually 
any phone anywhere in the world explains rob davis product 
manager for the companys answering machines 
for example people vacationing at a mountain cabin or a shore 
cottage with only a rotary telephone available wont have to jump 
in the car and drive to the nearest pay phone to get their 
messages 
another recently marketed telephone is a handsfree headset 
model which allows a person to listen to fm radio programs but to 
answer calls with the touch of a button when the radio reception is 
interrupted by an alerting tone 
digital technology has enabled engineers to do away with bulky 
telephone answering systems and create compact and tapeless digital 
answerphones designed for home use 
with the absence of tape cassettes the phones are approximately 
the size of a standard telephone and have fewer working parts than 
conventional answering machines 
digital recording puts an end to twisted tapes or overworked 
parts which break or wear out said a general electric spokesman 
describing one of the companys models with remote message play 
users can listen to their messages even when they are away from 
home 
the phone also features an led message counter to quickly 
display the number of calls received and has an autodisconnect 
function which automatically stops the outgoing message when any 
phone in the house is picked up 
and for the traveler who wants to dial up the latest stock 
prices or call for hotel and plane reservations the new york 
telephone company is testing new public computer terminals at new 
yorks john f kennedy international airport the company says 
customers can access some 150 different travel financial 
entertainment and information services available at the terminals 
which also are equipped for conference calling 
preliminary market studies tell us that many airline travelers 
especially business people would use these types of services 
frequently says robert bellhouse general managerpublic 
communications this sixmonth test will provide use with more 
definitive information on the level of market acceptance 
the access terminals include video displays keyboards and a 
telephone handset and keypad

songs 
the equipment lets the singer override the vocals on most cds 
and all karaoke discs and even lets him adjust the pitch 
home colorization you can enter the great colorization debate 
on your own by colorizing your videos with the video equalizer from 
videonics this machine includes a digital video enhancer digital 
video processor splitscreen fucntion and threechannel audio 
mixer the units digital paintbrush will let you change color 
of scene elements without affecting other colors or objects you 
also can sharpen images by removing noise or snow and you can 
add stereo music or voiceover narrations to the existing sound 
track 
for game addicts here comes something called uforce power 
games a fourgames cartridge to be used with the uforce 
handsfree controller for nintendo 
the system turns body motion into onscreen action without 
attaching the player to wires gloves helmets floor pads or 
joysticks games on the cartridge include power field bball where 
the player can dribble drive and shoot with natural movements 
just as though he were on a real basketball court hose em down 
which lets the player direct rescue operations of a burning

a stitch in time these days may well be powered by a 
microprocessor instead of a thimble 
true electronic sewing machines arent for everyone primarily 
because of price the occasional weekend sewer may find the 2500 
price tag on singers new quantum xl1 daunting 
but for those who sew a lot for family and home an old truism 
still holds any sewing machine will pay for itself many times over 
in savings realized in the family clothing or decorating budget 
and the cost may be justified for anyone who values time and 
versatility or hates sewing handwork 
the quantum with computercontrolled thread supply can thread 
itself and do three kinds of buttonholes keyhole and bartacks in 
two weights in onestep operations it has over 190 builtin 
stitches for construction embroidery and lacework these include 
automatic script and block alphabets for monogramming and 20 
embroidery design motifs singer says the machine will handle wider 
stitch widths than any other machine at a maximum 25 millimeters 
without attachments and like most modern machines it will baste 
hem and sew on buttons 
these functions are controlled by an lcd display that shows what 
stitch has been selected and the actual size of the pattern motif 
being used the touchsensitive display gives operating 
instructions and warns of problems a display board shows 
pictographs of all embroidery and monogram types similar graphics 
on the machine include the droll choice of tortoise or hare on the 
speed control switch 
the quantum is technically portable since it has a handle but 
the company says that most consumers with cabinetry for earlier 
singer models should be able to install the new machines in their 
existing furniture specifically cabinet models 621 and 385 or 
electric lift models 690 691 and 692 
this machine is the fifth generation of electronic machines 
produced by singer which marketed its first the athena in l975

scientific research is about to blow the lid 
off the mystery behind a common household horror why thick soups 
and stews explode and splatter the inside of microwave ovens 
its a consumer problem the housewife or kid comes back and 
heres lunch all over the inside of the microwave said david w 
cable a mechanical engineer at metricor inc in woodinville wash 
metricor a subsidiary of corning inc sells 12000 fiberoptic 
sensors that are being used by rutgers university scientists to 
measure temperatures and pressures of food as it is cooked in 
microwave ovens 
he said the researchers want to know why some microwaved foods 
splatter as they cook and how to prevent the messy problem 
cable who is metricors marketing and sales manager presented 
preliminary results of the study wednesday during the annual 
meeting of the institute of food technologists which drew more 
than 15000 food scientists to the anaheim convention center 
what causes cream of mushroom soup to attack the walls of a 
microwave oven while chicken bouillon remains cautiously in its 
bowl the institute asked in a news release scientists are 
coming close to an answer for that question 
cable said a food being cooked in a microwave oven is injected 
with microwave energy at a rate similar to lightning striking a 
tree the phenomenon is the same except for its magnitude 
as water and sap in a tree flash to steam the tree 
literally explodes this is what happens in the microwave to 
foods that are trapping the steam 
food scientists call the splattering phenomenon popping or 
bumping cable said 
some people have developed a sort of richter scale of these 
explosions he said 
cable and the institute said that so far the foodindustry 
sponsored study has provided the following solutions some of which 
may seem obvious 
foods should be centered in the microwave because heat is more 
evenly distributed there the edges contain hot spots that are more 
likely to make water in thick soups flash into exploding steam 
bubbles 
thicker soups are much more likely to splatter than thinner 
liquids because heat concentrates more easily in a viscous liquid 
allowing steam bubbles to expand until they are large and create a 
messy explosion 
cable suggested cooking thick soups or stews at lower power 
stirring them before putting them in the microwave oven and 
covering the cooking container with a paper towel to contain the 
splattering 
if a cooking container contains ridges or some other rough 
surface bubbles can form more easily and in greater numbers and 
lots of small bubbles distribute heat more evenly while a few 
large bubbles are more likely to send the soup flying 
the rutgers study may result in improvements in packaging for 
microwaveable foods allowing them to be cooked with less mess 
cable said 
cable acknowledged the research may seem silly but said 
consumers dont expect this nice clean package you put in your 
microwave to come apart and throw food all over the inside 
its a cleanup issue and were all tidy americans we dont 
like to be untidy

one of modern technologys more common items the smoke 
detector is being ignored by many owners often to their peril 
nonworking smoke detectors contribute to as many as 6000 
firerelated deaths and 130000 injuries each year according to 
change your clock change your battery a cooperative campaign 
sponsored by the international association of fire chiefs the 
american burn association and eveready battery company 
they hope that tying the ritual of time change on oct 28 with 
the routine of changing batteries will increase the number of 
working smoke alarms and emergency flashlights the group estimates 
that 50 percent of home smoke alarms now are useless because of old 
or missing batteries and without working flashlights the 
difficulty of locating safe swift exits in night fire situations 
increases 
a yearly smoke detector battery change is the single most easy 
and accessible way to make a difference in the number of 
firerelated deaths and injuries says dave hilton president of 
the iafc a working smoke detector can double the chances of 
surviving a fire 
besides this annual routine checking the batteries with the 
test button at least once a month is recommended

database then sends it back on a diskette to the customer with 
simple instructions for loading the program the file may also be 
downloaded by modem 
according to the company the idea was first used by companies 
which wanted their logotypes to appear on idle computer screens 
later images of family friends pets works of art vacation 
scenes fireplaces sunsets landscapes and ocean views began to be 
used 
a clean humidifier that eliminates bacteria and viruses from

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower 
monday on the chicago board of trade as heavy losses in other 
markets heavily influenced trading in the chicago pits 
the market looked at the outside markets and saw gold and 
silver down sharply and followed suit said mickey luth an 
analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in chicago 
fundamentally there was no reason for the soybeans to be down 
but last weeks rally made the market vulnerable to a selloff 
the weather also exerted pressure on soybean prices as hot and 
dry conditions prevailed in the midwest and raised expectations for 
higher yields 
soybean prices got some support from dryness in the mississippi 
delta with the crop expected to be hurt if conditions do not 
improve 
corn prices also were hurt by the weather as fridays 6 to 
10day forecast from the national weather service called for a 
warming trend in the midwest 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 281 cents a bushel corn 
was 3 cents to 6 cents lower with september at 252 a bushel 
oats were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with september at 113 cents

a jury on monday convicted four prominent 
professionals including the exhead of guinness plc for misconduct 
over the brewing giants multibilliondollar takeover of a scottish 
distiller four years ago 
the convictions capped a stunning chapter in what became known 
as the biggest whitecollar fraud in british history the seamy 
side of the countrys explosive financialmarket growth last decade 
it tainted some of the most respected names in british business 
and was described by investigators as a web of greed and deceit 
that in many respects mirrored wall streets insider trading 
scandal of the late 1980s 
after nearly a week of deliberations the jury at southwark 
crown court returned guilty verdicts on 19 of 20 counts against 
former guinness chairman and chief executive officer ernest 
saunders gerald ronson chairman of heron international plc 
former stockbroker anthony parnes and millionaire financier sir 
jack lyons 
four other men still face trial for their alleged involvement in 
the scheme to illegally arrange for the purchase of guinness stock 
during the takeover fight for distillers co a scotch whisky and 
gin maker in 1986 
saunders 54 was convicted of two charges of conspiracy to 
contravene the prevention of fraud investments act eight charges 
of false accounting and two charges of theft he was acquitted of 
illegally destroying documents 
ronson 50 was found guilty of conspiracy to contravene the 
prevention of fraud investments act two charges of false 
accounting and one of theft 
parnes 44 was found guilty of four charges of false accounting 
and two of theft 
the jury convicted lyons 74 on two charges of conspiracy 
three charges of false accounting and one of theft 
saunders who has maintained he is a scapegoat smiled wryly as 
the jury foreman read the verdicts afterwards as he was led away 
he waved to son james and daughter joanna in the courts public 
gallery 
we will never accept that our father has been dishonest his 
son said afterward we will continue the fight to help him clear 
his name 
judge denis henry said sentencing would take place tuesday for 
saunders ronson and parnes and on sept 25 for lyons who is to 
undergo surgery this week 
the four were accused of orchestrating an illegal operation to 
support guinness stock price through undisclosed purchases of 
guinness shares and thus make the brewers 518 billion offer of 
cash and stock more attractive than a rival bid from supermarket 
operator argyll group plc 
guinness succeeded in april 1986 in what was then britains 
largest takeover in december of that year the department of trade 
and industry announced it was investigating and saunders was 
arrested in may 1987 other arrests followed 
the judge ruled that because of the complexity of the case it 
should be split into two trials 
in the second trial expected to start in october saunders will 
be joined by roger seelig 44 former morgan grenfell and co ltd 
corporate finance director lord patrick spens 47 former director 
of corporate finance at the merchant bank henry ansbacher and 
corporate finance partner of the investment firm cazenove and co 
ltd and david mayhew 48 who continues as senior corporate 
finance partner of the investment firm cazenove and co 
the seven men have pleaded innocent to all the charges and until 
now each has been freed on about 850000 bail 
the eighth man is us lawyer thomas ward whom british police 
are seeking to have extradited from the united states ward has 
denied wrongdoing 
the case was brought to trial by britains serious fraud office 
set up two years ago to investigate and prosecute complex fraud 
cases 
former guinness director jonathan guinness said monday that 
while he felt sorry for saunders and his family i dont see how 
the jury could have come to any other verdict

the dollar dropped to a postwar low against the 
german mark monday while gold prices tumbled more than 25 an ounce 
amid selling sparked by a perception that tensions have eased in 
the middle east 
a slide in oil prices relieved some anxiety about the 
inflationary consequences of a prolonged persian gulf conflict and 
encouraged sales of gold and the dollar gold bullion often is 
bought as a hedge against inflation 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold for current delivery 
settled at 38830 a troy ounce down 2670 from fridays close 
later republic national bank quoted an ounce of gold at 389 25 
lower than the late bid friday 
currency trading was lighter than normal because markets in 
london were closed for a bank holiday

low of 15423 german marks in frankfurt west germany down from 
15575 marks late friday the previous lowest closing level for the

york 
the dollar traded as low as 15385 german marks during the day 
in frankfurt before recovering its previous intraday low was 
15400 marks on thursday 
when activity shifted later to north america the dollar lost 
ground in new york it fell to 15505 marks from 15605 marks late 
friday 
currency analysts said rising optimism about chances for a 
negotiated settlement to the conflict caused by iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait reduced demand for dollars investors typically 
buy dollars as a safe haven for their holdings during times of 
international turmoil 
worries about the flagging us economy temporarily put aside 
during a dollar buying binge that followed the iraqi invasion were 
given a higher priority in trading decisions 
speculation that us interest rates eventually will be nudged 
lower to foster an economic revival has weighed on the dollar if 
rates fall in the us while rising or remaining unchanged 
overseas returns on dollardenominated securities would be less 
appealing 
michael faust of mms international in new york said the japanese 
yen took center stage in north american currency trading 
buying interest in the yen coincided with the decline in world 
oil prices a welcome development for oil importdependent japan a 
rebound in the japanese stock market also helped restore faith in 
the yen 
oil prices were bid down on the assumption that many opec 
countries may boost output temporarily to compensate for the gap 
left by the international embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti petroleum 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries met informally in 
vienna austria to discuss a response to the persian gulf crisis 
a barrel of light sweet crude the benchmark grade of us crude

most commodity futures prices on the new york and chicago 
exchanges were battered monday as concerns about the possibility of 
war decreased with oil off sharply on reports opec oil ministers 
may soon decide to raise crude output 
precious metals futures fell grain and soybeans were down and 
livestock and pork futures gained 
the lack of military action in the persian gulf provided the 
bearish tone for energy futures on the new york mercantile exchange 
on the improved prospects for a diplomatic solution to the crisis 
triggered by iraqs occupation of kuwait 
the perceptions that the crisis may be resolved peacefully were 
prompted by the security councils weekend sanction of force 
against iraq other diplomatic activity suggested the iraqis were 
feeling acute isolation over their seizure of kuwait on aug 2 and 
were willing to talk an opec meeting in vienna also led traders to 
bid down the price of oil 
robert baker an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
in new york said it is likely the market will continue its 
downward trend tuesday 
despite the sharp drop in oil prices analysts said crude can 
move back up as easily as it moves down depending on whatever news 
comes from the middle east 
light sweet crude settled 2 to 401 lower with the contract 
for delivery in october at 2691 a barrel heating oil was 6 cents 
to 1286 cents lower with september at 7810 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 6 cents to 1710 cents lower with september 
at 8756 cents a gallon 
precious metals futures declined sharply on new yorks commodity 
exchange with an analyst saying the decline shows the precious 
metals market is fundamentally weak 
the movement upward was based on sharply higher oil prices and 
political factors said peter cardillo an analyst with jesup 
josephthal amp co in new york the market gave back a good portion 
of the gains of the past three weeks 
cardillo noted that the precious metals market was weak across 
the board with selling by banks speculators and funds he said it 
is likely the market will see more selling on tuesday before 
gaining some support 
gold was 2670 to 2890 lower with august at 38830 a troy 
ounce silver was 342 cents to 39 cents lower with august at 
4848 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures prices closed lower on the chicago 
board of trade 
the market looked at the outside markets and saw gold and 
silver down sharply and followed suit said mickey luth an 
analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in chicago 
fundamentally there was no reason for the soybeans to be down 
but last weeks rally made the market vulnerable to a selloff 
the weather also exerted pressure on soybean prices as hot and 
dry conditions prevailed in the midwest and raised expectations for 
higher yields 
soybean prices got some support from dryness in the mississippi 
delta with the crop expected to be hurt if conditions do not 
improve 
corn prices also were hurt by the weather as fridays 6 to 
10day forecast from the national weather service called for a 
warming trend in the midwest 
wheat settled 2 cents to 3 cents lower with september at 281 
cents a bushel corn was 3 cents to 6 cents lower with september 
at 252 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with 
september at 113 cents a bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 11 
cents lower with september at 619 a bushel 
livestock and pork futures were higher on the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
buying interest in livestock was spurred by a sharp rise in 
prices on the new york stock exchange and the declines in the oil 
and metals market traders said 
pork futures were boosted by fridays us agriculture 
department cold storage report which showed a greatedthanexpected 
drawdown of frozen bellies in july 
live cattle were 60 cent to 123 cents higher with october at 
7695 cents a pound feeder cattle were 53 cent to 145 cents 
higher with august at 8870 cents a pound hogs were 20 cent to 
78 cent higher with october at 4920 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 2 cents higher with february at 5437 cents a pound

an appeals court agreed monday to reconsider a 
decision overturning the conviction of a stockbroker charged with 
trading on inside information about the 1986 takeover of the 
waldbaum supermarket chain 
federal prosecutors had asked for the rehearing saying that the 
may 2 decision by a threejudge panel of the 2nd us circuit court 
of appeals threatened future insider trading prosecutions 
a full panel of the appeals court nov 9 will rehear the appeal 
of the stockbroker robert chestman of gruntal amp co 
in the may decision judges ruled 21 to vacate chestmans march 
1989 conviction on securities fraud mail fraud and perjury charges 
the conviction stemmed from trades he made after receiving 
information about aampps takeover of waldbaum inc from a client who 
was a waldbaum family member 
the court found there was no proof chestman knew the information 
was confidential when he received it from keith loeb a nephew by 
marriage to company founder ira waldbaum 
the judges also ruled there was no evidence that loeb who 
cooperated with authorities violated a breach of fiduciary duty in 
giving the information to chestman 
in court papers prosecutors said the decision was incorrect and 
would seriously impair the governments ability to bring future 
insider trading cases against tippees 
moreover the decision may well be viewed by the securities 
industry as providing a safe harbor within which to trade on inside 
information the government said 
chestmans attorney elkan abramowitz said he was not surprised 
the appeals court granted a rehearing but said he did not 
immediately want to respond to the governments arguments

oil prices fell by 4 a barrel monday the 
sharpest oneday decline traders could remember in a selloff that 
reflected easing fear of a war in the middle east 
the notion that there might not be any shooting in the nearly 
monthold conflict also punched down wholesale prices of unleaded 
gasoline and home heating oil 
the surprise in the market place may have been an improved 
outlook for a peaceful solution in the middle east said bob 
baker an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
traders were responding partly to news that un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar would meet thursday in 
jordan with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to discuss the crisis 
that began with iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
a lack of hostilities over the weekend and the likelihood of 
increased oil production by opec nations also helped push oil 
prices down analysts said 
in vienna sources said ministers from the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries appeared near agreement on an 
informal deal that would allow some countries to temporarily 
increase production in response to the persian gulf crisis 
light sweet crude the benchmark us blend fell 4 to 2691 
per barrel for october delivery on the new york mercantile 
exchange a key market for petroleum that snapped a streak of 
three days in which oil traded above 30 per barrel for the first 
time in nearly five years 
the merc doesnt keep records of petroleum price ranges but 
exchange officials and traders said they couldnt recall a bigger 
oneday drop 
crude oil fell 304 per barrel on the merc on april 24 1989 
following a sharp rise that occurred amid jitters caused by the 
exxon valdez accident and a gas leak and explosion on a major oil 
platform in the north sea said annlouise hittle a senior oil 
analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
there were a also couple of oneday drops exceeding 2 in 
december 1985 and january 1986 after opec nations announced 
pricing changes that sent oil into a long decline hittle said 
despite the recent wild swings in crude prices she said traders 
were caught off guard by the sharpness of mondays decline 
people were expecting a correction hittle said i dont 
think anyone thought it would be quite so steep 
unleaded gasoline also fell farther in one day than anyone at 
the exchange could remember dropping 1710 cents to 8756 cents 
per gallon for september delivery gasoline had risen above the 1 
mark for the first time last week as it went through seven straight 
days of record high closes but at one point monday it was down 
more than 20 cents per gallon 
crude oil at its lowest on monday traded 486 per barrel less 
than fridays closing price of 3091 
home heating oil plummeted 1286 cents to 7810 cents per gallon 
for september delivery natural gas dipped from 1525 to 1502 
per 1000 cubic feet on october contracts 
hittle said mondays downturn was accentuated by a british 
banking holiday which prompted traders in london to make oil deals 
elsewhere 
were getting european selling hittle said that can force 
us prices farther down if they are falling or farther up if they 
happen to be rising she said 
those who follow oil prices said there is no reliable way to 
predict where they will go because of the uncertainties in the 
persian gulf some said prices could easily shoot back up 
were not by any means to the point where were going to call 
a full turn here baker said tune in every morning to see what 
the newspapers say and what the radio bulletins are giving us we

thirdquarter profits plunged 78 percent in part because of a drop 
in summer moviegoers 
for the three months ended july 31 general cinema reported 
earnings of 57 million or 8 cents per share against earnings of 
256 million or 35 cents per share in the same 1989 period

1990 general cinema theaters had an operating loss of 17 
million compared to operating profits of 97 million in the same 
yearago period 
summer pictures this year did not attract the number of 
patrons which the industry had been anticipating resulting in 
attendance levels well below the record levels of the summer of 
1989 general cinema chairman richard a smith said in a 
statement 
the lower patronage combined with continuing higher film and 
occupancy costs resulted in the disappointing earnings 
performance he said

through the fiscal year during the quarter general cinema 
theaters opened 52 screens and closed 10 others bringing to 1488 
the number of screens at 314 theaters 
general cinemas income from interest and dividends dropped to 
223 million from 414 million a year ago reflecting payment of 
nearly 600 million of capital gains taxes in january related to 
the firms sale of its softdrink bottling business 
the sale reduced the amount of general cinemas investable funds 
to 11 billion from 17 billion a year ago 
general cinemas consolidated statements include operating 
results of neiman marcus group the companys 60percent owned 
retailing subsidiary with a lag of one quarter

contributed 28 million in earnings for the quarter compared to 
39 million a year ago 
the neiman marcus current year results are for the period 
through its third quarter ended may 5

consumer confidence in the us economy dropped 
this month to the lowest level since 1983 and raised the biggest 
threat of recession in many years the conference board 
organization said monday 
the new yorkbased business research group said its consumer 
confidence index a widely watched barometer of perceptions about 
the economy fell 18 points from the july level to 838 partly 
because of fears about the middle east 
that was the lowest level since 831 in april 1983 when the 
economy was emerging from a recession 
consumer confidence is considered a crucial element of economic 
forecasting because it indicates american willingness to borrow and 
spend consumerism accounts for a major portion of all us 
economic activity 
the findings substantiated the view of other economists who say 
consumers were increasingly worried even before the middle east 
crisis caused by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but the survey showed the invasion heightened those fears 
because of the rising price of oil resurrecting memories of the 
1970s oil shocks 
given the economic uncertainties generated by the middle east 
crisis a loss in the consumers sense of security is inevitable 
said fabian linden executive director of the groups consumer 
research center 
even before the kuwait invasion there were indications that 
the economy might be in trouble he said but if the present 
political crisis is not resolved quickly and people become more 
hesitant to spend the economy could soon move into recession 
recession is more likely now than it has been in many years 
the most notable elements of the conference board survey showed 
showed 20 percent of respondents felt conditions are good down 
from 23 percent in july the number who feel conditions are bad 
rose to 24 percent from 21 percent 
only 21 percent feel the number of jobs are plentiful down from 
nearly 26 percent in july and nearly 32 percent a year ago by 
contrast the number of respondents who feel jobs are difficult to 
find rose to nearly 26 percent vs 22 percent in july 
nearly 19 percent of survey respondents feel conditions will 
worsen in the next six months up from 12 percent in july less 
than 14 percent believe the situation will improve vs 17 percent 
in july 
the survey covering 5000 households nationwide calculates an

a federal judge on monday overturned a 1488 
million jury award to cigarette maker liggett group against brown amp 
williamson tobacco corp which had been found guilty of predatory 
pricing 
us district judge frank w bullock in greensboro nc said 
the jury had come to its decision in march using legally 
insufficient evidence he denied a motion for a retrial by liggett 
which had accused its larger rival of trying to put it out of 
business 
brown amp williamson is the nations third largest cigarette maker 
with brands including kool and viceroy liggett the nations 
smallest cigarette maker has the lampm lark and chesterfield brands 
bullock said liggett had failed to show that brown amp williamson 
had injured liggett in a dispute that centered on generic 
cigarettes which cost about one third less than the average pack 
price of 160 
alan hilburg a liggett spokesman said company lawyers were 
studying bullocks decision and had not decided whether to appeal 
in its lawsuit liggett argued that brown amp williamson in 1984 
and 1985 used volume discounts and rebates to wholesalers which 
forced liggett to match the incentives and reduced its profits 
liggetts market share was the industrys lowest before it entered 
the discount business 
liggett based in durham nc also charged that louisville 
kybased brown amp williamson had copied liggetts plain 
blackandwhite packaging in an attempt to confuse consumers 
after 115 days of testimony and nine days of deliberations a 
federal jury in greensboro awarded liggett 496 million in 
damages which automatically is tripled under the law 
the judges ruling underscores that what happened when brown amp 
williamson began selling generic cigarettes is exactly whats 
supposed to happen in a freeenterprise system brown amp 
williamson said in a statement 
industry figures show that liggett group had a 144 percent 
market share in discount cigarettes in 1989 down from 152 percent 
the previous year brown amp williamsons generic share was 233 
percent in 1989 up from 204 percent
