a federal judge has ruled that certain 
xrated sexually explicit videotapes might violate community 
standards in some small town elsewhere but not in los angeles 
there is stuff out there which is apparently accepted by the 
community which is far more morbid and shocking us district 
judge david kenyon said wednesday in acquitting a video salesman of 
racketeering charges 
federal prosecutors tried to prove that tapes such as prisoner 
of pleasure and kneel before me could by judged by los 
angeles standards as patently offensive 
the judge said that in a small community perhaps the videos 
could be deemed obscene but he added that the court cant say it 
in los angeles in this day and age 
attorneys on both sides said the ruling may change the 
governments courtroom tactics allowing films to stand on their 
own as evidence rather than calling in expert witnesses to testify 
about community standards 
its an important case and in any future case tried in federal 
court it will be cited said defense attorney stanley fleishman 
the case centered on interpretations of the us supreme courts 
1973 decision that found that to be obscene material must appeal 
to the prurient interest depict sexual conduct in a manner that 
would be patently offensive judged by the communitys standards 
and lack serious literary artistic political or scientific value 
rubin gottesman 56 owner of xcitement video inc and rg 
sales co still faces two charges of interstate transportation of 
child pornography and one charge of conspiracy for selling films 
starring porn star traci lords 
gottesman testified that he did not know miss lords was under 18 
years old when she made most of her films

former dictator hugo banzer has 
demonstrated a lasting broadly based popularity in his campaign to 
win election sunday to the presidency he once took by force 
the 62yearold retired army general is playing to enthusiastic 
audiences from all social levels of this poor largely indian 
nation of 6 million 
his popularity is a curious phenomenon at a time when 
dictatorsip is on the decline in latin america and democracy on the 
rise he explained it this way in a speech the people have an 
instinct that the political hacks have yet to discover the people 
remember the good things as well as the bad 
when banzer was in power from 1971 to 1978 prices for tin oil 
and other exports were high bolivia enjoyed economic growth and 
its people were working after his departure came slumping prices 
rising debt unemployment and rampant inflation 
during a tour of slums at santa cruz a tropical city that is 
bolivias second largest packs of ragged youngsters shouting 
viva banzer chased his open car through the unpaved streets 
he was dressed casually in a sport shirt and waved to cheering 
crowds mothers held up babies to be kissed 
the evening before he attended a crowded fundraising dinner in 
a la paz luxury hotel where an organization of doctors lawyers 
and other professionals gave the former general a gold medal 
designating him leader of bolivian democracy 
nearly every poll shows him leading the field of 10 candidates 
banzer finished first four years ago with 286 percent of the 
vote but lack of a majority left the decision to congress it 
chose victor paz estenssoro who was second with 264 percent 
no candidate is expected to get a majority this time either but 
banzer hopes to build a large enough plurality to make him the only 
possible choice for congress 
a great economic and social development occurred under his 
military government banzer says 
after he was forced out of office by popular pressure for a 
return to democracy an economic crisis descended on latin america 
and the good times ended 
inflation eventually soared to 20000 percent a year paz 
estenssoro had to adopt drastic austerity measures including the 
dismissal of 22000 employees of stateowned tin mines 
authorities say the austerity program is working restoring 
stability and allowing some real economic growth but it also has 
meant painfully hard times for many workingclass bolivians 
nationalist democratic action banzers party promises in its 
slogan a return to order peace and work 
opponents and some human rights groups dwell on the former 
dictators tactics while in power the bolivian permanent assembly 
for human rights says at least 33 people disappeared and hundreds 
were arrested tortured or forced into exile in a crackdown on 
leftists labor and dissident journalists 
banzer kept the people subjected violating the most basic 
human and civil rights rolando villena a roman catholic bishop 
and president of the assemblys executive committee said in an 
interview 
the people are losing their historical memory villena said 
of the public support the banzer slogan he said means order 
imposed from above on those below 
in campaign speeches banzer points out that he did not seize 
power from an elected government 
his coup in 1971 ousted a leftist military government that had 
installed a peoples assembly and planned other communiststyle 
changes many civilians including paz estenssoro supported the 
coup 
villena said banzer relinquished power only when forced to do so 
by popular resistance hunger strikes and labor actions 
democracy isnt a gift of this dictator he said it was 
won by the people against his wishes 
to such arguments banzer responds we arent trying to 
convince our adversaries of today who only want to listen to 
themselves that we are democrats we know that would be like 
plowing the sea 
banzer claims democratic credentials on the basis of peaceful 
participation in the process since forming his party a decade ago 
and his acceptance of the decision by congress to deny him the 
presidency in 1985 
his main opponents this time are gonzalo sanchez de losada of 
the governing revolutionary nationalist movement and jaime paz 
zamora of the movement of the revolutionary left 
he challenged both to pledge their support to the top 
votegetter whoever that is they refused saying congress must 
retain its constitutional authority 
a new congress also is to be elected sunday

the nations flu vaccine will have a new formula 
designed to better attack the flu strains expected to hit the 
united states next winter 
two of the three virus strains in the 198990 flu vaccine will 
be different from last years flu shot guarding against new 
strains of flu the national center for disease control said 
thursday the third ingredient remains the same 
the reason the three major types of flu virus show what 
researchers call drift from time to time changing into 
different forms that prompt the development of slightly different 
vaccines to maintain the effectiveness of the flu shot 
last years vaccine targeted the type ah3n2 strain known as the 
sichuan flu and the type b strain called the victoria flu next 
winters shot will go after two new variations the shanghai flu an 
the yamagata flu 
the third ingredient designed to stop the type b strain called 
the taiwan flu remains unchanged 
the prediction is that these strains look like the likely 
ones to circulate next year said dr margaret tipple a cdc flu 
specialist 
flu vaccine is especially recommended for people who are at high 
risk of serious problems if they get the flu including heart and 
lung patients and elderly people 
the cdcs immunization practices advisory committee also 
recommends flu shots for nursing home residents people with 
chronic diabetes or kidney disease people with suppressed immune 
systems and young people on aspirin therapy who might develop 
reyes syndrome after a flu infection 
the cdc further recommends flu shots for anyone who simply wants 
to lessen the chance of getting influenza 
flu season traditionally strikes during the cold weather months 
the strains being recommended for the 198990 vaccine started to 
appear in the united states late last winter and some are now 
being seen in the southern hemisphere where the seasons are 
reversed 
those are actually strains that just started to pop up at the 
end of the us flu season and are circulating now in other parts 
of the world tipple said

in the town of kimry soap rationing began in 
april limiting each man and woman to one bar of household soap and 
1 pounds of bath soap in local shops not each week or month but 
each year 
the residents of ufa a city of 1 million people in the urals 
are loading up on salt and matches due to rumors of pending 
shortages 
sugar rationing went into effect in moscow on may 1 for the 
first time since world war ii and even the soviet minister of 
trade kondrat terekh has been issued a card entitling him to 44 
pounds of sugar per month and no more 
those tales of consumer woe and more were cited in staterun 
newspapers thursday along with an anguished complaint in the 
weekly moscow news that the soviet retail trade system caught 
between president mikhail s gorbaches reforms and old ironfisted 
bureaucratic habits is literally breaking apart before our very 
eyes 
far from causing store shelves to brim with goods gorbachevs 
campaign for perestroika or economic and social renewal 
coincides with shortages in the consumer sector nationwide and 
some soviets say the reforms now in their fifth year are the 
direct cause others blame bureaucrats hostile to gorbachev and his 
reform drive 
the feeling is such that under cover of the words the 
inescapable difficulties of perestroika shortages are being 
created deliberately to indoctrinate this perestroika on the one 
hand brings glasnost which you cant put into tea and on the 
other hand a real worsening in the conditions of life wrote 
georgy afanasyev in this weeks moscow news 
in a word theyre telling us choose either the old order 
with tea and sugar or perestroika and just boiled water with 
glasnost afanasyev said he opted for water and glasnost saying 
the kremlins openness policy was a precondition for manufacturing 
enough tea sugar and everything else to meet demand 
in a speech last week to the communist partys policymaking 
central committee gorbachev acknowledged his reforms had failed to 
improve the average citizens economic lot and admitted what most 
shopgoers already know from bitter experience shortages of 
consumer goods are not shrinking under perestroika but growing 
the food problem is far from solved gorbachev said on april 
25 the housing problem is acute there is a dearth of consumer 
goods in the shops the list of shortages is growing the states 
financial position is grave 
the soviet leader blamed runaway government spending people who 
forgot how to work and top government and party organs 
including the ruling politburo which he heads for failing to 
keep up with the tasks confronting them 
gorbachev and other top officials have rejected calls to spend 
more dollars earned abroad through the sale of soviet oil and other 
exports to buy consumer goods saying the money should be spent to 
modernize soviet industry so more betterquality goods can be made 
locally 
but last month deputy trade minister suran sarukhanov told a 
soviet weekly that the equivalent of 8 billion had been added to a 
321 billion fund for imports of consumer goods and that the 
kremlin would buy 15 million pairs of shoes 300 million razor 
blades detergent soap and other goods abroad to parry chronc 
shortages 
pravda the communist party daily newspaper said the persistent 
deficits of consumer goods were why people in ufa believed rumors 
that salt would be in short supply in the resulting stampede to 
the stores salt purchases recently skyrocketed from the citys 
average of 10 tons per day to 250 tons in 36 hours the paper said 
a boom in the sale of matches drove daily demand from the 
customary 157000 boxes to as many as 2 million pravda said 
twentysix residents of the krasnoyarsk region of siberia who 
wrote pravda might well envy the people of ufa the siberians are 
forced to bring meat to their village store in exchange for goods 
they wrote and in such quantities that for a family of 34 
people to get shoes and clothe itself it needs to give 45 cows 
a sweatshirt costs 220 pounds of meat they said 
pravda said money originally earmarked for heavy industry 
traditionally the priority sector in the soviet economy should be 
diverted to help meet consumer demand and turn the wheel of 
economics towards the social sphere but a group of economists 
and journalists writing in moscow news said less government 
interference and not more was the right recipe 
the group called against inflation said the country was in 
the grip of an inflationary crisis economists have projected 
the soviet budget deficit acknowledged for the first time last 
fall after years of secrecy will reach 162 billion in 1989 
against inflation said government control over prices should 
be gradually lifted and the mechanism halted that provides 
automatic increases in pensions and subsidies as consumer goods 
become more expensive it also called the gosplan state planning 
agency and ministry of finance the greatest danger to gorbachevs 
reforms 
what awaits us if the present fiscal and economic policy will 
continue the group asked first of all a total rationing 
system for food already today trade is literally breaking apart 
under our very eyes

exhausted by cancer calamity 
and revolution president jose napoleon duarte struggles to survive 
and complete what may be his greatest victory peacefully handing 
power to an elected successor 
on june 1 duarte will hand the presidential sash to 
presidentelect alfredo cristiani of the rightwing republican 
nationalist alliance an adviser said the president feels 
ambivalent because he began by taking power away from the 
oligarchy and now it may seem hes handing it back 
although the transfer may be peaceful it will occur in an 
atmosphere of civil war killings by death squads and political 
assassinations 
duarte spent the past week in bed under an oxygen tent wasted 
by dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea caused by chemotherapy 
for terminal liver cancer he was strong enough thursday however 
to rise and receive the credentials of the new argentine ambassador 
the president appeared gaunt and stroked his aching throat 
repeatedly he spoke hoarsely but lucidly for 15 minutes 
occasionally sipping water because of mouth ulcers caused by the 
chemotherapy 
my government has laid the foundation for democracy in this 
country i have created here a new concept of politics duarte 
said and cited as his greatest disappointment not being able to 
leave the country in a process of peace 
he is given little chance of reaching his 64th birthday in 
november the former engineer probably will be remembered for a 
critical role in gradual and difficult transition from 
authoritarianism to democracy but he approaches the end of his 
term and life burdened by failures and compromises 
duarte feels he is largely responsible for conditions that make 
the peaceful succession possible and sees it as a crowning 
achievement he also considers cristianis party known as arena 
an authoritarian antidemocratic movement that may erode gains in 
human rights and civil liberties 
cristiani said in an interview with foreign correspondents 
one must acknowledge president duartes democratic vocation he 
has promoted democracy but i wouldnt go so far as to call him 
the father of salvadoran democracy 
since terminal cancer was diagnosed last june duarte has made 
periodic trips to walter reed army medical center in washington for 
treatment with rest and intravenous nourishment he has been able 
to overcome previous chemotherapy and return to government 
his doctor jose luis saca told the associated press the most 
recent treatments have been particularly devastating but he is 
optimistic duarte will recover sufficiently to take part in the 
june 1 ceremony 
during duartes fiveyear term freedom of expression and labor 
union pluralism have expanded politically motivated murder has 
declined and el salvador has held three nationwide elections judged 
free and fair by international observers 
his main goals of ending the war and reviving a moribund 
economy however remain as distant as when he took office 
leftist guerrillas have fought usbacked governments for nine 
years they continue to dominate much of the north and east despite 
more than 35 billion in economic and military aid from washington 
security forces outnumber the 7000 insurgents 81 but rebels 
have demonstrated the capacity to attack major garrisons and keep 
the army on the defensive in much of the country 
recently in addition to murders in deathsquad style the 
attorney general was assassinated and wholesale roundups of 
leftists have been conducted the home of the vice presidentelect 
was bombed 
attacks on prominent individuals appear designed to provoke or 
undermine cristiani 
arena and us officials blame the farabundo marti national 
liberation front the guerrilla alliance but the rebels have not 
made targets of high officials in the past they normally claim 
responsibility for attacks and have not done so in these cases 
el salvadors economy is a shambles and the country would be 
virtually bankrupt without aid private investment living 
standards and production of coffee sugar and cotton the main 
export crops have declined drastically 
health care potable water and primary education are little more 
than dreams to most rural people corruption and nepotism in 
duartes administration are described as widespread or rampant 
depending on who makes the assessment 
the judiciary is ineffective while deathsquad activity has 
declined political murder continues 
in his stateofthenation address last year duarte said the 
will of my people has caused me to navigate seas each day more 
stormy and more dangerous because of crosscurrents the absence of 
fair winds and persistent adversity all along the route have joined 
to prevent us from bringing about our high aims 
a ranking us diplomat said duarte didnt work miracles so 
he has taken a lot of knocks some fair and some not he merged 
the party and the government and surrounded himself with some 
unscrupulous people but he must be credited with instituting the 
democratic system itself his great legacy is this transition 
the rev ignacio ellacuria rector of central american 
university criticized duarte for presiding over a military junta 
in 198182 when death squads and the military were blamed killing 
up to 700 alleged leftists a month 
duarte accepted thousands of murders with the facile argument 
that if he were not on the junta there would be more 
ellacuria said 
he agreed that duarte had fostered formal democratic 
liberties but added 
he never realized what little real power he had hes not a 
false man but selfdeceived his hands were completely tied by 
the united states and the armed forces

his critics pictured surgeon general c 
everett koop as a national kook when he arrived in washington now 
as he prepares to leave he has a reputation as a national scold 
for seven years koop the stern family doctor with an amish 
farmers beard wagged a finger and preached good health practices 
in direct language that made people squirm 
he came to office under suspicion from liberals for his 
impassioned antiabortion views for calling women girls and 
for telling graduating high school seniors that motherhood 
completed the whole vocation of being a woman 
by the time he announced on thursday that he will retire this 
summer he had pacified liberals and gained a fresh set of critics 
among conservatives 
urvashi vaid a spokesman for the national gay and lesbian task 
force said koop helped educated the country by having carved out 
a moderate consensus position on aids 
but koops views antagonized such conservative activists as 
phyllis schlafly and march for life leader nellie gray 
mrs schlafly recoiled from koops ifyoumusthavesex 
usecondoms views on aids and concluded that koop had become 
indifferent to promiscuity 
liberal rep henry a waxman dcalif chairman of the house 
subcommittee on health and the environment said he had been dead 
wrong in 1981 when he said dr koop scares me he is a man of 
tremendous intolerance 
one of the great surprises of the last eight years is how 
wrong i was waxman said thursday if they could find a clone 
of koop they ought to appoint him as successor 
and sen edward m kennedy dmass a leader in the liberals 
unsuccessful ninemonth fight to block koops confirmation said 
koop had turned out to be perhaps the best surgeon general ever 
the office gives its occupant the right to wear a uniform as 
head of the 7200member commissioned corps of the public health 
services but not much statutory authority an ability to persuade 
is the chief source of his power 
at that the 72yearold koop with a squareshouldered 
presence and the voice of a prophet excelled he was frequently 
on television talk shows attaining celebrity status 
in office he 
issued a surgeon generals report that told smokers they were 
addicts as hooked on nicotine as dopeheads are on cocaine while 
drugs kill 12000 people a year and alcohol may lead to 125000 
deaths a year he said my enemy kills 350000 
wrote and mailed to every household in america a pamphlet on 
aids which described in frank terms how the disease is acquired but 
drew no moral conclusions mrs schlafly said koops report did not 
make enough of a distinction between the use of condoms and 
abstinence from outofwedlock sexual behavior william bennett 
then secretary of education took issue with koops recommendation 
that sex education and aids education start with young children 
jarred conservatives by refusing to issue a report requested by 
thenpresident reagan on abortions psychological effects on women 
he said the evidence was too sparse to reach scientifically sound 
conclusions abortion foes hoped such a report would help 
persuade the supreme court to overturn roe vs wade an irked 
nellie gray said it was time for koop to retire 
koops decisions surprised all sides in the abortion argument 
because he had come to washington as a passionate evangelical 
christian known for praying at the bedside of his young patients 
and for traveling the country denouncing abortion as the first step 
on a path to infanticide to passive euthanasia to active 
euthanasia indeed to the very beginnings of the political climate 
that led to auschwitz dachau and belsen 
koop had been a distinguised pioneer in pediatric surgery 
reversing the 95 percent mortality rate on many surgical 
proceredures performed on newborns 
in one celebrated case he supervised a 23member surgical team 
in an 11hour operation that successfully separated 13monthold 
siamese twin girls 
he also got rid of xray machines in shoe stores that used to 
measure childrens feet and expose them to harmful radiation

secretary of state james a baker iii 
offering the broadest view yet of how the bush administration will 
deal with the soviet union says the united states plans to test 
moscow again and again to see whether it will live up to its 
promises of reform 
by testing moscow across the board we can see whether the 
new thinking is real once we get beyond the slogans baker said 
in a speech on thursday to the center for strategic and 
international studies 
baker departs monday for his first round of talks with soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev and foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
in moscow 
at the may 1011 session they are expected to set a date for 
the resumption of negotiations to reduce longrange nuclear 
missiles and make preliminary arrangements for a summit between 
gorbachev and president bush 
the trip comes amid a dispute in the nato alliance as the united 
states struggles with its allies about forging a strategy to deal 
with gorbachevs arms control initiatives 
a senior administration official speaking with reporters about 
the speech on condition he not be identified said bakers speech 
thursday was intended as a conceptual framework for the 
superpower relationship 
baker said it isnt clear yet whether gorbachev will be 
successful with his perestroika or new thinking on matters 
of democratization and reform 
and he complained much of the soviet rhetoric doesnt match 
soviet deeds 
as an example he cited soviet actions in central america 
where the soviets sent over 500 million in aid to the 
sandinistas last year 
baker applauded moves such as the withdrawal of troops from 
afghanistan and the agreement banning all us and soviet 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles in europe but he complained 
about soviet shipments of longrange bombers to libyas moammar 
khadafy soviet military support of militant north korea and the 
soviet occupation of japans northern territories 
taking note of gorbachevs offers to make unilateral troop 
reductions and make cuts in his defense budget baker also said 
some 3500 new soviet tanks continue to roll off the production 
lines 
the secretary faulted the soviets for failing to publish a 
real defense budget one that would allow an independent 
evaluation of gorbachevs pledge to slash his military spending by 
14 percent 
he complained that while there has been talk of a common 
european home the berlin wall still stands and the brezhnev 
doctrine which affirms the right to send soviet troops into other 
east european countries has not been repealed 
the speech marked the most detailed exposition yet of the bush 
administrations emerging policy toward the soviets after a 
lengthy review that some critics say has stalled progress on arms 
negotiations bush who has defended the review as part of a 
prudent transition from the reagan administration plans to 
outline his views in a series of upcoming university commencement 
speeches the white house said this week 
baker said he intends to use the moscow visit to broaden the 
ussoviet agenda to include issues such as terrorism the 
environment and drug abuse 
our policy must be to press forward with our agenda to test 
the application of soviet new thinking again and again he said

welcome aboard metro sorry we dont serve 
coffee and doughnuts 
that cheery greeting from a metro subway operator booming from 
his trains public address speakers one recent monday morning drew 
rueful smiles from suburban commuters lurching shouldertoshoulder 
toward the start of another week in their downtown offices 
shove a microphone in front of some people and they cant resist 
hamming it up theres something about an open mike in the front 
cab of a commuter train pulling a captive audience of several 
hundred passengers that tempts subway operators to become amateur 
comedians and tour guides 
officials of washingtons 70mile metro subway system frown on 
this lighthearted adlibbing but most passengers seem to enjoy it 
welcome all firsttime riders and visitors to washington 
said one operator as his train swooped down from the virginia river 
bank toward the district of columbia you are now 35 feet below 
the potomac river so hold your breath 
another the next station is smithsonian home of the worlds 
largest flying dinosaur passengers laughed and applauded when 
another announced the trains approach to george washington 
university and his voice dropping to an ominous boris karloff 
bass foggy bottom 
one operator on the yellow line route heading south across the 
wide potomac notes that this is not the place where george 
washington threw the dollar across the river he points out the 
jefferson memorials cherry blossoms and the pentagon the 
worlds biggest office building and tells bad jokes all the way 
into suburban alexandria va 
when his train suddenly filled up with boisterous teenage 
tourists one operator made his customary announcement that the 
doors will openon the right at the next stations platform then 
he added for tourists the doors will open on the left 
metro spokeswoman mary bucklew says that among the transit 
systems 345 subway operators who haul passengers on more than 
500000 trips each day only a handful of those at the controls 
indulge in goodhumored patter 
they get a mixed reaction from passengers she said 
most complaints come from people who if theyve had a rough 
day or plan to have one a little humor might hit them the wrong 
way ms bucklew said 
its like art she said some people find it entertaining 
others find it irritating we ask the operators to stick to the 
script so to speak 
the 10week training course for new subway operators includes 
three days of special coaching with rehearsals using tape 
recorders on making a few standard announcements over their 
microphones 
these include identifying which line the train is traveling 
orange blue red or yellow and its final destination giving the 
correct name of each approaching station and noting whether the 
doors will open on the right or left plus occasional safety 
reminders 
we neither encourage nor condone going off on their own as 
comics or tour guides said jim winn metros acting general 
superintendent for rail operator training 
but operators arent reprimanded unless their offthecuff 
remarks are rude vulgar or inappropriate metro officials say many 
tourists appreciate being told which station is close to the sights 
they want to see 
only one operator accused of just being too exuberant has 
ever been admonished to tone down his act ms bucklew said 
hezekiah a briscoe an 11year metro veteran as subway operator 
and training supervisor says he plays the straight man while hes 
behind his trains controls but he doesnt mind when his 
colleagues try to lighten their passengers load 
sometimes a little humor goes a long way he said 
especially when its friday afternoon

six days after the letter to hamilton and a day before another

intelligence committee after the meeting thennational security 
adviser john poindexter sent him a note saying well done 
north said he told poindexter beforehand it would be unwise to meet 
with the committee but that poindexter insisted he do so

resolution of inquiry into the contra matter from passing in the 
house only sketchy notes were taken at the meeting in the white 
house and no transcript was kept the judge told the jury to note 
that there is conflicting evidence as to whether or not the 
resolution was or was not pending and that jurors had to decide

contained hawk missiles guilty 
the jury found north not guilty on the charge of obstruction of 
congress in this count but then found him guilty of the subsidiary 
charge of aiding and abetting that obstruction

november 1986 had been out of the government for a year for 
formulating the false chronology 
north also testified that poindexter and thencia director 
william casey knew that missiles were aboard the plane and that 
other top us officials knew because intelligence agencies tracked 
the shipment hourbyhour despite that he said poindexter and 
casey helped prepare false testimony for congress saying that no 
one in the government knew the true cargo until january 1986

story about the shipment in order to protect the lives of us 
hostages held in lebanon the iranians were not satisfied with the 
shipment and north said the us government needed to distance 
itself from the transaction

counts 78 obstructing a presidential inquiry making false 
statements not guilty on both counts 
when thenattorney general edwin meese iii at reagans request 
questioned north about the diversion of arms profits to the contras 
on nov 23 1986 north is accused of telling meese the nsc was not 
involved that the israelis determined the amount that went to the 
contras and that rebel leader adolfo calero had been ordered to 
open swiss bank accounts to receive arms profit money from israel 
meese testified north told him those untruths but under 
questioning by the defense he agreed he was conducting only an 
administrative inquiry and north was under no legal compulsion 
to answer the judges instructions to the jurors said that to 
convict north they would have to find that he had been correctly 
informed of the true nature of the proceeding and that his 
specific intent was to obstruct the inquiry 
north denied making untrue statements saying he readily 
admitted to the attorney general and his aides the diversion of 
iran arms proceeds to the contras 
the only written records of the attorney generals meeting with 
north are 29 pages of what north described as very cryptic 
notes taken by one of meeses aides

count 9 destroying altering or removing documents from the 
nsc guilty 
north said mcfarlane told him to alter five problem memos 
north wrote in 1985 to wipe out references of norths secret 
assistance to the contras and mcfarlanes knowledge of it north 
said he believed reagan wanted the documents changed because 
everything i had done that was described in the documents i had 
been told was at the direction of the president of the united 
states 
mcfarlane contradicted norths testimony saying it was north 
who suggested altering the memos in 1985 when congress first 
inquired about norths contra activities north directed his 
secretary fawn hall to make the alterations in november 1986 as 
the irancontra affair was about to be disclosed 
miss hall said she shredded the originals without instruction 
from north testifying that it seemed the logical thing to do 
to convict on that count the jury was told the defendant 
must have known his conduct was unlawful asked at the trial 
whether he knew that north replied no they were his 
mcfarlanes documents it never occurred to me that that would be 
unlawful

got a bill for it he said he didnt know secord had footed the 
bill although it was a meeting with secord and former cia employee 
glenn robinette that led to the installation after he was fired 
from the nsc north admitted he tried to conceal the fact he hadnt 
paid for the system by sending two backdated letters to robinette 
north said he had gotten the system installed after being 
targeted for assassination by terrorist abu nidal and just before 
north was scheduled to go to iran in an attempt to win release of 
us hostages held in lebanon north said he tried to get the 
government to protect his home but was turned down because he 
wasnt highranking enough

count 11 converting travelers checks to his own use not 
guilty 
contra leader calero testified he gave 90000 in travelers 
checks to north partly to help in securing release of american 
hostages in lebanon and partly for the contra aid effort north 
kept the money in his office safe the government charged north 
spent 4300 of it on personal expenses calero testified he didnt 
demand an accounting because i would trust him with my life 
north denied spending the money on himself saying he used it to 
reimburse himself for outofpocket expenses connected with his job 
the jury was told that to convict north it would have to find 
he used the checks in a manner not authorized in advance by the 
owner and for purposes other than the purpose under which the 
travelers checks came into his possession as a government 
employee 
in an attempt to bolster its charge the prosecution brought out 
that north had paid 8000 in cash in october 1985 for a family car 
and that until mid1985 he had complained repeatedly to an nsc 
employee about not having enough money to buy lunch and gasoline to 
get home north denied dipping into the officesafe fund for

a clearminded warrior a wearied desk jockey 
a bornagain moralist a teller of lies a patriot convicted of 
crimes against the united states 
a federal jury delivered that last cruelest cut of all thursday 
to the already fractured image of oliver l north pronouncing him 
both innocent and guilty at the same trial 
guilty of falsifying and destroying documents of abetting the 
obstruction of congress of accepting an illegal gratuity 
innocent of nine other felony charges linked to his role as 
action officer in the irancontra affair 
in reaching its verdict the jury had to consider whether this 
former lieutenant colonel and staff member of the national security 
council was true to his government and his mission or whether his 
deceits principally to congress were the designs of a rogue 
operating outside the law 
north left the courtroom just as he arrived eyes straight 
ahead shoulders squared no display of emotion save for a brief 
embrace with his wife 
later he would issue this statement as a marine i was taught 
to fight and fight hard for as long as it takes to prevail we 
will continue this battle and with the support and prayers of the 
american people i will be fully vindicated 
the central figure in the worst foreign policy debacle of ronald 
reagans presidency north came to run some of the administrations 
riskiest ventures from a cluttered room no 392 in the old 
executive office building next door to the white house 
congress tried for months to unravel the mysteries surrounding 
north but like the 1987 commission headed by former sen john 
tower congressional panels left many questions unanswered 
meanwhile in nationally televised hearings a defiant oliver north 
emerged from his shadowy world one of pseudonyms and codes and 
furtive border crossings to confront his tormentors 
ollie stood up there took the heat and the american people 
in every bar in chicago and every bowling alley in texas and every 
little home said hey this guy believes in something and i can 
identify with it said george bush last december 
norths bravado and his subsequent whirlwind of 25000 
speeches to cheering conservatives around the country revealed 
just one of his many sides 
he has always been ollie to his white house coworkers and 
the american right but to his brothers and sisters his 
highschool chums back in philmont ny he remains larry north 
to surviving members of his vietnam combat platoon he is blue 
leader of blues bastards in other travels he has been 
paul or mr goode or mr johns or steelhammer 
another code name may be most telling blank check that was 
the term assigned to the private interoffice computer 
communications network between north and his superior former 
national security adviser john m poindexter the tower commission 
found that the creation of blank check coincided with the 
initial shipment of antitank missiles to iran 14 months before 
the scheme blew up in the reagan administrations face in late 1986 
according to richard allen reagans first national security 
adviser north was brought to the nsc in 1981 to handle easels 
and carry the charts yet he became in a matter of months the 
nscs chief troubleshooter 
he was there for the invasion of grenada in 1983 initial arms 
shipments by the cia to the nicaraguan rebels also in 1983 the 
mining of three harbors in nicaragua in early 1984 a crackdown on 
the death squads in el salvador the interception of an egyptian 
airliner carrying the hijackers of the cruise ship achille lauro 
and the bombing raid on libya in 1986 
part of norths ascendancy no doubt can be attributed to his 
own fervor if there was a loose ball said retired maj gen 
john singlaub a key player in norths efforts to aid the contras 
oliver north would grab it and run with it 
as a youth he was kept on a tight leash his father oliver 
clay north an army colonel who won a silver star in world war ii 
worked long hours at a family wool mill before it fell victim to 
polyester and he switched to teaching history 
his mother ann would whistle for the kids to come in every 
evening at 5 pm for dinner family ritual included a discussion 
of world events before the table was cleared in school he ran 
track and was in the chorus chess drama and science clubs as well 
as the student council the girls voted him bestlooking 
he was a southpaw boxer at the naval academy making it into the 
intramural finals against a highly favored james webb later to 
become navy secretary north won again on points 
after his graduation a review board threatened to dismiss him 
because of injuries suffered earlier in a car wreck north made the 
board look at the film of his fight against webb he got his 
commission 
soon after north and betsy stuart were married north was 
shipped out to vietnam where he led the second platoon k company 
3rd battalion third marines once despite broken ribs and a 
punctured lung north rose up to kill an enemy gunner with a 
grenade that got him a bronze star 
but north in recounting his vietnam record has sometimes 
seemed to exaggerate he has testified that his decorations 
included several purple hearts military records show two he 
headed a platoon of 40 men but said in court that he was a company 
commander in the special operations force again no record of 
it he has said in court that he was in vietnam from 1968 through 
early 1970 and then again in 1971 but the corps says it has 
no record of an extended first tour or second tour 
after tours at quantico va and in okinawa north wound up 
with a desk at marine corps headquarters he worked 18 hours a day 
something finally snapped north wound up in bethesda naval 
hospital for 22 days diagnosed as suffering delayed battle 
stress once again he overcame his difficulties and was cleared 
for duty 
by 1980 he was off for a year of study at the naval war 
college a necessary ticket for a wouldbe star classmates 
remember he always sat in the front row always flattered his 
lecturers they didnt much like it but the brass including navy 
secretary john lehman was impressed 
when it came time to fill a deputys slot at the national 
security council north was the man 
one of his responsibilities was coordinating antiterrorism 
policies a license for him to roam the world it was not unusual 
for him to jet off at night to another country and be back for the 
nscs regular staff meeting at 745 am 
he flew on white house jets chartered jets and commercial 
airlines often using false names and oddball disguises richard 
allen called it a rinkydink habit 
but north did get things done his finest hour was the 
apprehension of the hijackers of the achille lauro the italian 
cruise liner seized by palestinians who killed an american 
passenger leon klinghofer with the help of israeli intelligence 
north determined that the perpetrators who had surrendered to 
egyptian authorities were to be flown to asylum in tunisia he 
mapped out a plan whereby navy fighter jets intercepted the plane 
and forced it to land at a nato base in southern italy 
norths response in that case triggered by the sickening 
wanton murder of the wheelchairridden klinghofer reflected an 
obsessive concern for innocent suffering he kept pictures of the 
american hostages in lebanon at his desk when he went to central 
america he would return with photos of women and children living 
in terrible conditions 
even his severest critics credit north with compassion noting 
he played a major role in convincing the administration to pressure 
el salvador to bridle rightwing death squads there 
his emotional commitment to his causes the long absences from 
his family and his marathon workdays continued to take their toll 
coworkers said he often looked like a ghost in the hallways 
former national security adviser robert mcfarlane said north broke 
down into tears on several occasions when his projects took a bad 
turn 
mcfarlane advised north to return to bethesda for a rest but 
the young colonel wouldnt relent 
north acknowledges some lapses of judgment including his hand 
in the phony documentation designed to cover up his acceptance of a 
free security system at his home but that he said was driven by 
his concern for family 
and i did not commit any crime by misleading congress about 
the secret attempts to bolster the contras he said on the day he 
was indicted in march of last year i can assure you i will 
never give up 
on that score nobody doubts that oliver north was telling the 
truth but his fate may rest ultimately on the shoulders of a man 
who takes a kind and gentle view of him 
asked if north will be remembered as a hero george bush said 
last year you know i think ollie will and you know why he will 
its not what went wrong he said he made mistakes ill say he 
made some mistakes but he believed passionately in something

consumer advocate rod leonard is still nipping 
at the agriculture department for operating a popular export 
subsidy program while the us wheat supply drains away 
leonard is executive director of the private nonprofit 
community nutrition institute which joined several other consumer 
groups last fall in seeking a suspension of the export program 
until 1989 harvest prospects became clearer 
but usda shrugged off the request and continued to operate the 
export enhancement program through the winter leonard repeated the 
request on april 3 in a letter to agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter 
leonard said thursday that he never did receive a direct reply 
from yeutter or anyone at usda but he did get a response of sorts 
when president bush announced this week that 15 million metric 
tons of wheat would be sold to the soviet union under the subsidy 
program 
it was one of those solomonlike decisions by bush to sell 
the soviets only half of the 3 million tons reportedly sought by 
moscow and endorsed by usda and lawmakers from wheat country he 
said in a telephone interview 
under eep as the program is called private exporters can sell 
wheat to a designated foreign country at prices lower than 
otherwise would be charged in order to make the sale exporters 
then collect a bonus or subsidy to make up the difference the 
subsidies are in the form of surplus commodities owned by the 
departments commodity credit corp 
what concerns leonard is the relatively scant supply of wheat 
held in us granaries that once bulged with surpluses 
some grain experts say there will be enough wheat that the new 
crop is almost ready for harvest in southern areas and that some 
reserves held by farmers soon will be available to the market 
leonard isnt so certain as it looks at the moment he says 
the 1989 wheat crop may be somewhat under 21 billion bushels 
and if current longrange weather forecasts are correct about 
belownormal rainfall in some areas in the next few months parts 
of the important springwheat region could be in trouble leonard 
said 
were not going to have enough wheat to meet the total 
consumption that weve been supporting the last two years 
leonard said were not going to have enough wheat to meet the 
export demands wed like to be able to supply 
last years wheat harvest lowered by drought and substantial 
acreage reductions imposed by usda programs was only 181 billion 
bushels according to usda figures including leftover grain from 
previous harvests the total us wheat supply in the 198889 
marketing year that began last june 1 was a bit less than 31 
billion bushels 
out of that supply for 198889 domestic use is expected to be 
around 105 billion bushels and exports 15 billion bushels making 
a total of about 255 billion bushels required to meet demands 
as a result of the demand exceeding last years harvest the 
wheat left over this june 1 is expected to be only about 549 
million bushels 
in leonards view this will not provide enough leeway for the 
united states to meet export requirements and still maintain 
adequate reserves during the 198990 marketing year by june 1 
1990 he said the wheat stockpile could be down to 300 million 
bushels or less the smallest carryover since 1952 when it was 256 
million bushels 
for years farm commodity groups and lawmakers have insisted 
that the united states be a reliable supplier of agricultural 
commodities recalling with scorn the partial embargo imposed on 
sales to the soviet union in 1980 by the carter administration to 
punish moscow for invading afghanistan 
the export subsidy program or eep has operated since 1985 to 
make us commodities competitive in targeted markets where foreign 
competitors notably the european economic community intrude 
with subsidized sales of their own about 65 countries have been 
designated for subsidized sales including the soviet union and 
china 
leonard says the wheat export level of the last two years 
about 15 billion bushels annually is seen by many as a benchmark 
for shipments in 198990 
the argument that we have to be a reliable supplier is a 
powerful force but were not going to be able to export 15 
billion bushels and if thats the mark of a reliable supplier 
were just not going to have it 
a wrangle involving usda and the office of management and budget 
was settled by bushs announcement that moscow could buy 15 
million tons of subsidized wheat thats about 55 million bushels 
allowing 367 bushels per ton 
the soviets have been getting us wheat since eep subsidies 
were made available four years ago with purchases totaling slight 
more than 4 million tons 147 million bushels since last oct 1 
the new eep authorization would push those sales to about 202 
million bushels 
china the biggest foreign buyer of us wheat this season has 
bought half again as much subsidized wheat as the soviet union 
with purchases totaling 827 million tons or 304 million bushels 
carl schwensen executive vice president of the national 
association of wheat growers said his group plans to continue 
pushing for use of the eep to the soviet union and other 
countries 
schwensen said he understood that as part of the arrangement the 
soviet union would buy an additional 15 million tons of wheat at 
nonsubsidized prices this summer making up the 3 million tons 
initially advocated 
asked about matching current export levels in the coming year 
schwensen said the united states should endeavor to reach that 
target and added that he thought there will be adequate 
supplies to service the domestic and export markets in 198990

the jury in oliver l norths irancontra 
trial drew a fine distinction between lies told to keep a covert 
operation secret and falsehoods offered when the mission was being 
publicly exposed 
the jury dealt a setback to irancontra prosecutors by clearing 
the former marine lieutenant colonel of all charges that he lied to 
congress when asked if he was secretly helping arm the nicaraguan 
rebels 
but the jury convicted north of helping prepare a false 
chronology of the irancontra affair and destroying key documents 
once the covert operations cover was blown by public disclosures 
lying was a major theme of the prosecutions case prosecutors 
argued from the start that deceiving congress damages democracy 
because government only functions properly when the truth is told 
the jury apparently accepted this argument with a caveat that 
deception to protect a covert operation might be justified jurors 
however did not fully accept norths argument that his actions 
were always justified because he had authority from superiors 
i think perhaps they drew a distinction between the potential 
for jeopardizing lives and assets while the mission was still 
secret and what occurred after public revelations said richard 
benveniste a washington criminal lawyer and former watergate 
prosecutor 
they quite clearly acquitted oliver north on those areas of 
criminal activity in which he was acting at the behest of the 
administration prior to the blowing of the cover on the entire 
operation in the fall of 1986 said harvard university law 
professor laurence tribe 
once the cover was blown his actions in aiding and abetting 
the obstruction of congress and in shredding documents were i 
think quite properly deemed criminal 
norths claim that the verdict is a partial vindication has 
some credibility 
the jury rejected independent counsel lawrence e walshs 
contention that north was a liar and a thief but found him guilty 
of other misdeeds accepting installation of a security system 
outside his home by an arms dealer and destroying official 
documents once the irancontra affair was publicly known in 
november 1986 
you cant say at this juncture that either side walked away 
with their theory intact said lawrence barcella a washington 
criminal lawyer and a former federal prosecutor 
lead prosecutor john keker noted that north was convicted of 
three serious felony charges insisting that the principle 
that no man is above the law has been vindicated 
there is something there for everyone benveniste said 
the jury appeared to have both accepted and rejected norths 
defense that he was only acting on orders from above depending 
upon the circumstances 
it cleared him of a charge of lying to house intelligence 
committee members in august 1986 apparently accepting norths 
explanation that he only met with lawmakers at the insistence of 
thennational security adviser john poindexter 
the jury however convicted north of aiding and abetting the 
obstruction of congress by helping poindexter and the late cia 
director william casey prepare a false chronology of the 
irancontra affair in november 1986 
it appears to be a very factbound decision barcella said 
the jury cleared north of a charge he pocketed 4300 of the 
90000 worth of travelers checks given to him by a contra leader 
to cover expenses 
yet it convicted the former presidential aide of illegally 
accepting installation of a security system outside his home by 
arms dealer richard v secord 
on this count jurors appeared to hold north accountable because 
he admitted trying to cover up the gift by fabricating evidence he 
paid for the 13800 security gate 
again the jury objected to a coverup not justified by national 
security considerations 
it really reflects much more the jurys probable dismay at the 
falsification of bills preparation of false letters again a 
coverup said tribe 
we have here an example of a very careful jury certainly not 
a hanging jury drawing a very careful distinctions he said 
the verdict he added undercuts the elitist assumption that 
some have made that a group of not very well educated people who 
were ignorant of the irancontra hearings somehow couldnt draw the 
lines required

50 miles offshore 
two ships were to start towing them this morning and they were 
expected to reach port by evening said rocky raab a spokesman for 
morton thiokol inc which makes the rockets 
the rockets were redesigned after the failure of a booster 
rocket part caused the explosion of challenger in january 1986 and 
the deaths of seven astronauts 
as planned the rockets separated from the winged orbiter just a 
little more than two minutes after thursdays launch five minutes 
after that they fell into the ocean

disclosure of silenceformoney deals 
between builders and workers at nuclear power plants has touched 
off a debate among federal regulators over whether to ban such 
agreements 
members of the nuclear regulatory commission acknowledged 
thursday that they could not agree on the legality of one such 
agreement which included restrictions on a nuclear plant workers 
right to testify at nrc licensing hearings 
the commission chairman lando w zech jr said he has 
instructed the agencys legal counsel to study the issue and 
recommend ways of clarifying nrc policy 
joseph j macktal a former electrician at the comanche peak 
nuclear plant in texas told a senate panel thursday he signed a 
labor settlement with the plants builder that rewarded him for not 
telling the nrc about alleged safety flaws 
macktal who is challenging the legality of the 1987 agreement 
said his former lawyers browbeat him into signing and that he 
was misled about its terms 
in sworn testimony to a senate environment and public works 
subcommittee macktal said he believed the agreement prevented me 
from talking to anybody about safety problems he said he observed 
during nearly 12 months work at the plant 
the subcommittee is investigating how many such secret deals 
have been made at the nations 110 licensed commercial nuclear 
power plants officials said earlier this week the panel knows of 
one other and is seeking details of a third 
louis austin jr president of brown amp root the company that 
built the comanche peak plant near glen rose texas told the 
subcommittee he believed the macktal deal was legal but he added 
that the company wished the law were more clear 
macktal signed the agreement to settle his complaint with the 
labor department that brown amp root had unfairly dismissed him as a 
result of his allegations about unsafe conditions he said the deal 
gave him 15000 and his lawyers got 20000 
zech said he personally believed that such deals are illegal but 
that some of the four other commissions disagreed 
something has to be done about it zech said adding that 
late last month he asked all nuclear utilities and vendors to 
report any such deals to the nrc by july 31 
james r curtiss a member of the commission told the 
subcommittee he was not convinced the macktal agreement was 
illegal he stressed that although it contained some restrictions 
on macktals right to testify before the commission it did not 
explicitly stop him from contacting the nrc staff about safety 
matters 
but sen alan simpson of wyoming the ranking republican on the 
subcommittee said the macktal deal contained so much restrictive 
and ambiguous language that it strains every bit of common sense 
in the world to believe macktal would feel free to pursue his 
safety allegations with members of the nrc staff 
this stinks simpson said

george f kennan the venerable retired 
american diplomat and sen sam nunn the influential chairman of 
the senate armed services committee are challenging president bush 
to do some new thinking about west germany 
kennan who played a leading role in the postworld war ii 
containment of the soviet union says in his gentle diplomatic 
way that us policy seems to be humming along without much 
recognition of recent changes in moscow 
nunn who is not a diplomat flatly accused the bush 
administration wednesday of having no vision and shooting itself 
in the foot by not seeking a compromise with a west german 
electorate concerned about shortrange nuclear weapons 
the rift with chancellor helmut kohl demanding us 
negotiations with the soviets and bush saying that would be a 
mistake is straining the north atlantic treaty organization 
if it is not healed soon the orchestration for a smooth bush 
summit meeting in brussels may 2930 with the leaders of the 15 
other nato countries could dissolve into dissonance 
most of the lance missiles which bush and british prime 
minister margaret thatcher want to make more powerful are in west 
germany as part of the 30yearold nato strategy of deterring 
soviet aggression with the threat of a nuclear response 
in 1987 all us and soviet intermediaterange nuclear rockets 
were banned that changed the strategic picture in europe somewhat 
but the lances which now have a range of about 70 miles are 
visible reminders to the west germans that the next war might very 
well be fought on their territory and it could be a nuclear war 
kennan writing for a johns hopkins university think tank before 
the dispute boiled over all but anticipated the problem 
he noted mediumrange nuclear missiles are coming out of 
europe the soviet union is taking more forthcoming positions in 
arms control negotiations president mikhail s gorbachev has 
announced unilateral tank and troop withdrawals from eastern europe 
all these could not fail to raise in west german minds the 
question of whether the soviet threat was still so serious as to 
warrant the indefinite continuation of the military burdens west 
germany has been asked to bear he wrote 
while west germans are divided on such questions kennan says 
many of them are looking for a fresh review of the dimensions of 
nato deployments in west germany and the stance nato is taking in 
negotiating over nonnuclear forces with the warsaw pact in vienna 
but the former us ambassador to moscow and policy planning 
chief at the state department says he has looked in vain for 
evidence that this view is accepted by us british and french 
officials 
no appreciable changes have been made or planned in the actual 
disposition of nato forces nor do there seem to have been any 
significant changes in the western stand on arms control problems 
recently under negotiation he said 
the west german government a coalition of conservatives headed 
by kohl and liberals led by foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher actually is united on the shortrange missiles and on 
demanding a change in washington and london 
the germans are saying they will not modernize the shortrange 
missiles and want to reduce and perhaps eliminate such weapons on 
both sides of the eastwest line 
the bush administration is saying no to all of the above and is 
prepared to air the dispute at the brussels summit meeting marlin 
fitzwater the white house spokesman said wednesday the western 
alliance is healthy enough to stand the disagreement that 
controversies are a sign of natos vitality 
nunn however is uncomfortable with the usgerman rift and 
with the administrations approach 
i dont see any strategy at all coming out of this nunn 
said i see both sides of this argument as having no vision

an agreement between the pentagon and the 
commerce department to review government computer security plans 
gives military intelligence too much influence over civilian 
technology and data critics of the plan say 
the agreement invites the national security agency to 
enter the offices of private information companies and government 
contractors to help deal with computer security problems said 
marc rotenberg of computer professionals for social responsibility 
a publicinterest group based in palo alto calif 
rotenberg was one of several witnesses to appear thursday before 
the house government operations subcommittee on legislation and 
national security which is reviewing the 1987 computer security 
act 
the hearing focused largely on a memorandum signed march 24 by 
officials of the nsa the pentagons intelligency agency and the 
nations largest and the national institute of standards and 
technology a research arm of the commerce department 
under prodding from congress the two agencies have started 
working closely together to review computer security plans 
submitted by offices throughout the government for protecting 
systems containing sensitive but unclassified data 
rep john conyers jr dmich chairman of the subcomittee 
said that under the 1987 legislation the relationship between 
nsa and commerce was clearly intended to be advisory only with nsa 
serving as a technical facilitator to the department of commerce 
he said however that he agreed with many people who have 
complained that the memorandum allows the security agency to 
encroach upon the central role given commerce under the statute 
conyers also chairman of the full government operations 
committee said any agreement that weakens civilian control in the 
computer security area will result in unwarranted personal 
intrusions and inhibitors to both domestic and international 
commerce 
also expressing concern over the interagency memorandum was 
albert r belisle a bank of boston executive who testified on 
behalf of the washingtonbased american bankers association 
banks need independently developed security technology that is 
not preempted by nsa control said belisle a bank of boston 
executive who was representing the american bankers association 
james j hearn nsas deputy director for information security 
called the memorandum of understanding a substantial achievement 
for both agencies 
he said that in negotiating the memorandum we have been able 
to develop a better understanding of each others mission and this 
in turn has led to renewed confidence and trust 
key senior officials in both agencies have worked hard to 
build on the ongoing technical cooperation he said 
also testifying in support of the mou was ray kammer acting 
director of nist which is located in suburban gaithersburg md 
the memorandum provides a number of benefits to nist and the 
department of commerce he said

a top federal drug official says international 
law enforcement teamwork to fight the war on drugs must be 
transparent to borders even when the partner is a country like 
panama 
the possibility that drug traffickers might gain access to 
detailed us information on investigations makes things 
complicated said david westrate the drug enforcement 
administrations chief of enforcement 
on the other hand we do accomplish things significant 
things he said thursday adding that like the investigation of 
the 1985 slaying of dea agent enrique camarena in mexico the 
united states can pursue dual probes one involving the foreign 
government and one on its own 
the dea he said maintains an extremely complicated 
relationship with panama where the government is virtually 
controlled by gen manuel antonio noriega 
while noriega has been indicted on drugtrafficking charges by 
federal grand juries in florida the dea finds it in the best 
interests of the united states to work with the panamanian 
government he said 
less than two weeks ago they assisted us in a convoy of 
cocaine from colombia on its way to new york he said there 
are a lot of examples like that 
westrate praised the increased cooperation by foreign 
governments in the war on drugs and attributed their interest to 
fears that they could become wracked by drugrelated violence as 
colombia has been 
he singled out the mexican government for praise saying that 
country is making good solid progress in the drug war 
the mexican governments increased interest in cracking down on 
the drug traffickers stems from successful efforts to curtail the 
flow of cocaine through the bahamas which has pushed traffickers 
to find other routes the routes they found run through mexico he 
said 
all of the cocaine entering the united states used to come 
through the caribbean to southern florida but now onethird of it 
comes through mexico he said 
that has driven a marriage between the traditional mexican 
trafficking groups and the colombian trafficking groups westrate 
said 
one reflection of mexicos increased concern is its arrest april 
8 of miguel angel felix gallardo 43 that countrys reputed drug 
kingpin and seizure of his assets 
some say that there is a potential behind this one trafficker 
to have that government seize up to 1 billion in trafficker 
assets westrate said thats one crook think about the 
enormous potential that that money brings in terms of power to 
corrupt establishments to buy businesses to buy real property to 
do just anything a person wants and that persons not unique 
westrate said international cooperation is one of the few 
hopeful signs in the drug war 
european countries are becoming more concerned about cocaine 
because theres a glut on the market here with kilos selling for 
as little as 9000 the same cocaine can bring 50000 to 60000 
in europe he said 
the seizure rate there is going off the scope westrate 
said adding that when europe establishes free and open borders 
between countries in 1992 the situation will get worse i think 
the picture for europe is grim 
as an example of international cooperation and the farflung 
activities of the dea westrate cited several major operations 
without giving specifics on their targets one involves five 
countries 28 dea offices 197 individual investigations and 20 
wiretaps 150 informants another involves 15 countries 51 dea 
offices 126 investigations 60 informants

a noted pediatrician says his patients will 
suffer and die because of attacks by a powerful congressman on the 
work of a nobel prizewinning researcher 
i can promise you that organizations of patients when made 
fully aware of what you are doing are going to fight this tooth 
and nail dr david nathan wrote to rep john dingell dmich 
nathan is physicianinchief at childrens hospital in boston 
and professor of pediatrics at the harvard medical school 
dingell chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the 
house energy and commerce committee spent most of thursday in a 
hearing room attacking the handling of a dispute over a research 
project led by david baltimore a molecular biologist at 
massachusetts institute of technology who won the nobel prize in 
1975 for his work on cancercausing viruses 
an attack on him is an attack on our patients the david 
baltimores of this world have made it possible for them to live it 
is as simple as that nathan wrote in his april 26 letter which 
was distributed at the hearing 
nathans letter appeared to be part of a growing effort by 
scientists to defend baltimore the journal science reported last 
week for example that major figures in science were in touch with 
minority republican members of the subcommittee 
a review committee is being reconstituted to look into new 
allegations of missing data raised by dr margot otoole said 
james wyngaarden director of the national institutes of health 
dr otooles dispatch of 17 pages of data to two nih staffers 
in 1986 started the long controversy over a paper in the scientific 
journal cell that year by baltimore dr thereza imanishikari of 
tufts university and four others 
dr otoole at the time working on other projects in dr 
imanishikaris lab said the 17 pages showed that conclusions of 
the paper were not supported by the original laboratory data 
reviews by mit and tufts determined that the conclusions 
dealing with the immune responses of mice bred with an extra immune 
system gene from another species were fully supported by some 
1000 data pages and no action was needed 
a review panel convened by nih the one now being resurrected 
said that although there was no fraud or misrepresentation errors 
had occurred that should be corrected baltimore has sent one 
correction letter to cell and is preparing a supplemental letter to 
deal with the latest accusation 
a report from secret service experts said at least five and 
possibly 25 pages in one of dr imanishikaris notebooks were 
filled in as much as two years after the dates on the page at 
least two dates were changed 
the two notebooks studied by the secret service had nothing to 
do with the cell article and showed only i am not a neat person 
very bad with dates she said 
she said she would often use the date on which data were taken 
perhaps logged by laboratory equipment when writing them on paper 
months later 
wyngaarden said he was establishing an office of scientific 
integrity to monitor and conduct investigations of possible 
scientific impropriety the health and human services department is 
establishing an office of scientific integrity review to establish 
policies to deal with scientific misconduct

a woman seeking to preserve a way of life that 
nourished some of the nations bestknown writers has asked a 
federal appeals court to prohibit the government from demolishing 
her rustic cape cod cottage 
grace e bessay said thursday that she is the last defendant 
remaining after nearly a quartercentury of litigation over a 
cluster of historic dune shacks in provincetown 
for more a century the primitive beach cabins have been used as 
creative retreats by artists poets writers and celebrated 
bohemians including jack kerouac and eugene oneill 
miss bessay said her cottage built around 1930 represents a 
piece of cape cod history and a way of life that should not yield 
to federal bulldozers 
the massachusetts historical commission has recommended that 
miss bessays shack on cape cod national seashore and 17 others 
belong on the national register of historic places 
the national park service which overseas the national seashore 
says it has identified shacks visited by notable artists and miss 
bessays cottage isnt among them 
it says cottages frequented by eugene oneill mabel dodge and 
edmund wilson are no longer standing and there is no proof that 
the likes of ee cummings kerouac and norman mailer spent time in 
the rickety buildings that still cling to the isolated dunes 
in a 1963 letter to one of miss bessays neighbors a copy of 
which was supplied to the associated press kerouac wrote yes 
residence on the dunes is uniquely sheltering and certainly 
stimulating to creative work its true that i was working on on 
the road there summer of 1950 
still the case before the us circuit court of appeals in 
boston appears to hinge not on its literary merits but on arcane 
matters of squatters rights the definition of a dwelling and 
tangled questions of title 
the government condemned the shack in 1967 but lawsuits 
prevented its demolition most neighbors meanwhile have settled 
their suits many under agreements that will allow their cottages 
to be demolished after their deaths 
the governments attorney david shilton told the three appeals 
court justices that miss bessay does not have clear title to her 
property which she inherited from a friend in 1981 
furthermore he said the shack does not have the modern 
electricity sewage lines or running water that would qualify it as 
the type of home that congress intended to preserve when it created 
the national seashore in 1961 
miss bessay said that is exactly why artists and naturelovers 
like it 
i dont want a generator banging away and making smells of 
gasoline she said living in a dune shack means getting your 
water by hand pumps which is a pleasure it isnt a burden its a 
pleasure and kerosene lamps for light that is also a pleasure 
miss bessay who winters in cambridge says she is in her 
mid60s but all the litigation has aged her 
some days i feel like im 110 she said

the state department will replace seven of the 
us diplomats expelled from nicaragua last year and allow the 
managua government to send seven new envoys to replace those 
expelled from the united states 
the upgrading of the respective embassy staffs does not reflect 
an improvement in relations between the two countries but rather a 
desire of both to be better represented in each others capital 
us officials said thursday 
last july the sandinista government ordered us ambassador 
richard melton and seven other envoys out of nicaragua on charges 
they were fomenting unrest 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said all seven slots 
below the ambassador level will be filled in addition four others 
in managua who are being reassigned will be replaced bringing to 
11 the number of new american diplomats being sent there

health and human services secretary louis w 
sullivan is proposing steps to reverse inequities in medicare 
reimbursements that have been blamed for the frail health of the 
nations rural hospitals 
senate leaders say they believe those disparities are largely 
responsible for a rural health care crisis that undermines the 
future of entire communities 
sullivan on thursday acknowledged the need to make medicares 
payment system fairer and proposed rural and large urban 
hospitals receive greater inflationbased medicare payment 
increases next fiscal year than urban hospitals in communities of 
less than 1 million population 
more rural hospitals would also be allowed to qualify as sole 
community hospitals entitling them to higher medicare payments 
while federal officials acknowledge sullivans recommendations 
will not keep all rural hospitals alive they say the move should 
help equalize profit margins between urban and rural hospitals

two west germans doing medical relief 
work in lebanon were freed early friday 10 hours after they were 
kidnapped in the southern port of sidon a moslem militia reported 
the sunni moslem nasserite militia in a statement said 
heinrich struebig 48 and petra schnitzler 26 were released 
without incident at 5 am 11 pm thursday edt and drove to 
their office at the palestinian refugee camp of ein elhilweh 
outside sidon 
the statement said joint efforts carried by its security 
apparatus and the mainstream shiite moslem amal militia resulted in 
locating the place where the two germans were held 
they were released at 5 am and crossed the sinique bridge to 
the sidon area they are currently at their office in ein 
elhilweh the statement said it did not disclose further 
details 
sinique bridge separates the sunni moslem port of sidon 25 
miles south of this warravaged capital from the predominantly 
shiite moslem sector of south lebanon under amals control 
the nasserite militia of mustafa saad a sunni group has been

the pentagon is weighing a temporary reprieve 
for the v22 osprey the marine corps aircraft that defense 
secretary dick cheney proposed terminating to meet a compromise 
fiscal 1990 budget agreement 
on thursday deputy defense secretary donald atwood jr told the 
senate appropriations defense subcommittee that the department is 
considering either continuing the osprey through a flight test 
program or a minimal effort of technology demonstration 
the decision is expected shortly with the department facing a 
threat by the contractors bell helicopter textron inc and boeing 
helicopter co to stop work on the project today 
what we have here is a game of highstakes chicken said 
pentagon spokesman dan howard who noted that cheney will not 
issue a stopwork order that we will continue to require the 
contractor to complete the testing program under the terms of the 
contract 
howard said the companies received 2458 million in march on 
their fiscal 1989 contract and the navy expects completion of the 
contract the companies have been using their own money because of 
27 million in cost overruns that could total as much as 150 
million by the end of fiscal 1989 
cheney forced to slash 10 billion from the fiscal 1990 defense 
budget to meet an agreement between the white house and 
congressional leaders eliminated the battlefield aircraft designed 
to take off like a helicopter but fly like an airplane 
the pentagon had planned to spend 259 billion on 663 ospreys 
including 13 billion in 1990 the department had already invested 
2 billion in the program over a nineyear period 
both the flight test program and the demonstration program would 
require reprogramming of money according to atwood who said a pot 
of 330 million exists for certain materials for production of 12 
aircraft the funds could be used if congress approved 
we hope to have a decision within a matter of a day or so 
atwood told the panel 
cheneys decision which he has described as his most difficult 
has met with considerable opposition on capitol hill where both 
republicans and democrats attacked the planned cancellation 
the defense department appears to be playing games with 
us sen ted stevens ralaska told atwood the defense 
department knows how strongly congress feels about it and intends 
to put it back in 
stevens threated not to vote for any defense authorization bill 
that leaves out funding for the osprey program 
sen arlen specter rpa who discussed the issue with atwood 
prior to the hearing said the department should explore the 
possibility of maintaining at least enough efforts to keep bell in 
operation to maintain the status quo while this matter is evaluated 
by the congress 
meanwhile the commandant of the marine corps cast doubt on the 
information cheney used in deciding to eliminate the osprey 
i do not agree with the cost advice that he got nor do i agree 
with the military operation use and conceptual framework of that 
but then im but one voice commandant alfred gray told the 
senate armed services committee 
do you believe secretary cheney made the best decision he 
could make based on faulty information said sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the armed services panel 
no responded gray but based on the information he was 
given by learned people who have their right to believe that 
theyre correct 
but you dont believe theyre correct nunn said 
no i dont but i had my day in court said gray who plans 
to submit to the committee his interpretation of the programs cost 
benefits

communist party chief zhao ziyang called for a 
dialogue with students in authorities first public comment 
following historic prodemocracy rallies in tiananmen square 
official media reported today 
students marched by the tens of thousands to occupy the square 
thursday and rally for more freedom some returned to class today 
to end a twoweek boycott but student leaders at beijing university 
refused to immediately call off the strike 
zhao in a speech made thursday but reported today in the party 
organ peoples daily said now we need broad consultations and 
dialogue dialogue with students dialogue with workers dialogue 
with intellectuals 
student activists want the government to open talks with them on 
demands for democracy freedom of the press and an end to official 
corruption zhao while saying talks were needed did not 
specifically promise any meeting 
the party leader acknowledged that great numbers of chinese are 
expressing anger toward official corruption and attributed the 
problem to a lack of openness and a faulty legal system 
zhao also seemed to tone down earlier official claims that 
students were being manipulated by people who wanted to see the 
country in turmoil such people are extremely few and we should 
maintain vigilance i think the vast majority of students 
understand this 
despite conciliatory official statements some students feel 
they must continue to pressure the government if concessions are 
ever to be made in communist china 
who announced the return to class can you face your 
conscience and compatriots at home and abroad who have cared for us 
and supported us one student scrawled furiously on a sheet of 
newspaper that he posted at beijing university 
said an economics student who was reading the poster if we go 
back to class now then theres no pressure on the government and it 
wont recognize our independent union 
student leaders at beijing university said they had not been 
notified by the united association of beijing universities the 
umbrella group that has led the protests of the decision to return 
to class a few classes were held at the university but most 
students stayed away 
some classes also were held at beijing normal college dozens of 
other students sat in classrooms studying on their own and said 
they expected to resume their normal schedules on monday 
the student march thursday was their sixth in defiance of police 
orders since april 17 and one of the largest 
about 100000 people half of them students converged on 
tiananmen square the symbolic seat of power to mark the 70th 
anniversary of chinas first student movement there they held a 
festive rally for greater freedom cleaner government a free press 
and official recognition of their united association 
we have to transform china said a 20yearold student from 
the political science and law college 
thousands of beijing residents lined the streets as the students 
passed and gave them applause free drinks and cash donations we 
strongly support the students said a man in grimy blue work 
clothes 
at a few intersections marchers had to shove their way through 
hundreds of unarmed police lined six deep but the government 
clearly wanted to avoid serious confrontation the security 
presence was smaller than a week earlier when about 150000 
students and supporters marched on tiananmen 
although authorities had ordered the square closed thursday the 
police who surrounded it offered no resistance and quickly left 
when the students arrived 
wuer kaixi one of the leaders of the united association said 
after the rally that the students struggle for democracy and 
reform has entered a new phase that will focus on spreading their 
message through pamphlets and setting up independent newspapers as 
an alternative voice to the official media 
several official newspapers today carried their fullest accounts 
yet of any student protest since the campaign for democracy began 
beijings temperature yesterday hit 30 degrees centigrade 86 
fahrenheit but students streaming with sweat held a march just as 
orderly as the last time china youth news reported 
it also reported smaller marches in more than 11 cities 
including shanghai xian nanjing chengdu and changsha where 
students had marched before in the past few weeks 
no violence was reported in any of the marches the legal daily 
said the xian students applied for and received police permission 
for their demonstration 
the demonstrations marked the may fourth movement of 1919 
chinas first student movement it began in opposition to 
concessions granted to the japanese government during world war i 
and developed into a movement calling for mr democracy and mr 
science to save china

a lottery millionaire from colorado has decided to 
ante up 25000 in back child support to avoid prosecution by 
massachusetts authorities according to his attorney 
albert tecci who won a 71 million lotto jackpot in colorado 
on april 22 failed to pay both courtordered and voluntary support 
for his children who live in the bluecollar town of revere just 
outside of boston state child support officials said the boys 
who turn 8 and 9 this month live with their mother on public 
assistance 
several hours after a felony fugitive arrest warrant was issued 
in chelsea district court on thursday state officials said they 
reached an agreement with teccis attorney in denver for him to 
send the 25000 in back child support and the warrant would be 
withdrawn 
state department of revenue spokeswoman karen schwartzman said 
the state will likely lift the criminal charges facing tecci once 
the money is received and a new child support order is instituted 
that will allow the children to get off public assistance and 
reflect teccis current standard of living 
state officials were tipped off to teccis lottery win last 
thursday by a local resident who read an account of the colorado 
drawing in a newspaper according to schwartzman 
the back support dated from 1981 schwartzman said tecci had 
agreed to voluntarily pay support until 1986 when he and his wife 
were divorced under the terms of the divorce tecci was ordered to 
pay regular support 
tecci faced penalties of up to a 10000 fine and five years in 
prison 
tecci and his fiancee cheryl penney who used some of their 
laundry money to buy the winning ticket stayed incommunicado for 
several days after the winning number was announced consulting 
with a lawyer and celebrating in grand style before stepping 
forward april 25 to claim the first installment of 134725 they 
will receive 25 annual installments 
tecci said while claiming the prize at a news conference that 
winning the lottery hadnt changed anything other than instead 
of buying 12 dinners we buy 1200 dinners 
the pair said they would use the money to open a restaurant 
tecci a freelance public relations and political consultant 
has been working for the street smart program designed to help 
innercity youth tecci has said some of the jackpot would go to 
benefit the program 
in a similar situation maryland authorities have seized all or 
part of the jackpots of 203 state lottery winners to pay overdue 
child support 
at least one winner lost a 10000 jackpot maryland department 
of human resouces spokesman jc shay said thursday in all 
226000 in delinquent child support has been collected by the 
department since the lottery interception program began six months 
ago 
a 1987 bill authorized the state to seize lottery prizes of 
winners who are 150 or more behind in child support payments

young women who take birth control pills for more 
than four years run a significantly higher risk of breast cancer 
according to a study published today in a prestigious british 
medical journal 
researchers were quoted in the lancet as saying that among women 
35 or younger they found a 43 percent increase in the risk of 
breast cancer after four years of pill use and a 74 percent 
increase after eight years 
they called on doctors to tell women about the possible risks of 
breast cancer before they prescribe contraceptive pills but they 
did not advocate avoiding oral contraceptives 
however clair chilvers of the institute of cancer research in 
london one of the authors of the study advised women to aim for 
the lowestdose pill available and stay on it for the shortest 
possible time 
women who are not having intercourse should stop taking it 
she said thursday at a london news conference 
the study is the most comprehensive look at the pill and breast 
cancer ever undertaken in britain and one of the largest in the 
world 
the researchers were quoted in the medical weekly as saying the 
risks of taking the pill had to be kept in perspective 
breast cancer is uncommon below age 36 the age group that was 
studied only one woman in 500 develops the disease before age 36 
so even a 70 percent increase in risk would only put the chances of 
developing breast cancer by this age up to about one in 300 the 
researchers said 
earlier studies on the relationship between the pill and breast 
cancer have conflicted last january a us food and drug 
administration committee of experts declared that recent research 
on possible links between the pill and breast cancer was 
inconclusive 
the british study involved 755 british women under age 36 who 
were diagnosed as having breast cancer between the beginning of 
1982 and the end of 1985 and an equal number of similar but 
cancerfree women 
the researchers from oxford university and two leading british 
cancer charities said they still could not answer the crucial 
question of whether the increased risk persisted after age 36 
they said they are undertaking a study on women ages 36 to 45 to 
help resolve this vital issue 
the most consistent interpretation of our results and those 
from previous studies is perhaps that the excess risk is transient 
and diminishes or disappears at older ages they said 
the researchers said their study included only those women with 
breast cancer who had the opportunity to use oral contraceptives 
from the start of their reproductive lives since the pill has been 
available in britain since the early 1960s they decided to include 
only women age 36 and under at the time their breast cancer was 
diagnosed 
the researchers said 91 percent of the women with breast cancer 
and 89 percent of the comparison group had used the pill at some 
time 
the relative risks were similar for women who used the pill 
before and after their first fullterm pregnancy the researchers 
said 
britains family planning association and national association 
of planning doctors said the new study does not clarify the 
continuing debate about the pill and breast cancer risks 
the two organizations said women now on the pill who are 
concerned about the findings should discuss their cases with their 
doctors they said the risks had to be balanced against the pills 
benefits in protecting women against ovarian and other types of 
cancer

seventeen years of study of rubella vaccinations 
on pregnant women show chances of fetal infection are small but 
health experts warn that women still should be vaccinated long 
before they get pregnant 
although rubella once known as german measles is mild in most 
cases congenital rubella syndrome rubella at birth can cause 
blindness retardation and heart defects 
since the rubella vaccine was licensed in 1969 the national 
centers for disease control have recommended against pregnant women 
getting the vaccine because of the possible risk of passing rubella 
on to their babies 
no cases of congenital rubella were detected in the children of 
305 women who participated in a study from 1971 to 1988 the cdc 
said the women were susceptible to rubella and received rubella 
vaccine within three months of conception 
the observed risk for crs following rubella vaccination 
continues to be zero the atlantabased cdc said adding that 
researchers in west germany and great britain also have found no 
vaccinerelated congenital rubella syndrome 
however the virus in rubella vaccine has been shown to cross 
the placenta and infect the fetus one study shows an infection 
rate of 3 percent 
thus because the theoretical risk to the fetus however 
small cannot be absolutely ruled out pregnancy remains a 
contraindication to rubella vaccination the cdc said 
the cdcs immunization practices advisory committee continues to 
recommend that while reasonable precautions should be taken not 
to vaccinate pregnant women inadvertent vaccination of a 
pregnant woman should not be a reason in itself to consider 
interruption of pregnancy 
nothing in the way of vaccinerelated crs has been observed 
but its still a theoretical concern and its been shown the virus 
can be transmitted through the placenta said dr paul 
stehrgreen a cdc immunization specialist so the conservative 
argument is that the contraindication is a reasonable precaution 
the cdc recommends rubella vaccinations for women who are 
potentially susceptible to the disease 
rubella a once common childhood disease was reported in only 
221 cases in the united states last year there was one case of 
congenital rubella syndrome in 1988

two months of fighting for the 
strategic city of jalalabad has demonstrated the unexpected 
tenacity of the afghan armed forces and exposed weaknesses in the 
divided guerrilla opposition 
each day the sovietbacked government holds the provincial 
capital the more confident it becomes it can withstand a guerrilla 
siege and force the insurgents and their western supporters to 
negotiate peace 
for nearly 10 years the guerrillas known as mujahedeen 
waged their holy war against the soviet army which entered 
afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the marxist government the enemy 
was an invading superpower to them and the battle lines were clear 
but now the soviets are gone and the guerrillas have come down 
from the mountains to the rocky plains of jalalabad they are 
trying to move from hitandrun attacks to fullscale conventional 
warfare in the largest and bloodiest offensive of the 11year civil 
war 
so far neither side is winning 
diplomats in kabul have said 7500 to 12500 insurgents and 
government soldiers have died or been wounded during the eightweek 
siege there are no estimates on casualties among jalalabads 
civilian population which once numbered about 64000 
the guerrillas have pounded the eastern city with as many as 
16000 rockets a day the forces of president najib have responded 
with longrange scud missiles and have dispatched mig21 and mig27 
jets to pound guerrilla camps 
jalalabad and its magnificent gardens and palaces has been 
virtually destroyed refugees are fleeing the carnage by foot and 
on flatbed trucks 
the mujahedeen are fighting as fiercely as ever but with little 
coordination or military discipline 
seven guerrilla factions set up a governmentinexile in 
pakistan in february but still do not have a cohesive ideology or 
consistent popular support 
meanwhile government forces have proved they can fight 
effectively without soviet troops to back them up the soldiers are 
driven in part by fear of death or torture if captured by the 
insurgents 
when the soviet army rolled into afghanistan in december 1979 
the united states took advantage of pakistans relationship with 
guerrillas who had taken refuge there 
washington sent weapons to pakistans military intelligence 
service the pakistanis delivered them to the guerrilla leaders 
who handed them out to their field commanders 
but the arrangements created rivalries among the insurgents and 
undermined efforts to unite the resistance 
until jalalabad few in the west listened to complaints about 
the resistance while the soviets were in afghanistan it didnt 
matter now it does said one diplomat with ties to both sides 
when the unsponsored accord calling for the soviet withdrawal 
was signed last year the lack of a coherent guerrilla 
governmentinexile became a prime concern and it was left to 
pakistani generals to shape one 
the soviets completed their withdrawal on feb 15 and the 
pakistani military began pushing the mujahedeen to attack jalalabad 
so they would have a place to set up their government 
diplomats in kabul say the siege was orchestrated primarily by 
pakistans military and based on the theory that the city would 
fall quickly and pave the way for the final push on kabul the 
capital 
several insurgent leaders boasted that jalalabad would be theirs 
within a day but their predictions proved wrong and their 
selfimposed deadline was pushed back to weeks then finally months 
some observers say it is time the united states changed 
strategies if it wants to lead in negotiating peace 
if the mujahedeen and the kabul government reach a compromise 
with washingtons help it will be a credit for the united 
states said another diplomat who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
but if the americans work through pakistan their policy will 
fail the afghans and the pakistanis have been enemies for a long 
time the pakistanis will just push on to fight and the afghan 
nation will be finished if that happens the united states will 
lose all the credit it has earned

criticizing the health care provisions in 
president bushs budget massachusetts gov michael dukakis renewed 
his call for universal health insurance while commemorating the 
125th anniversary of his alma mater 
dukakis who last spoke at swarthmore college while seeking the 
democratic presidential nomination told about 400 people mostly 
swarthmore students that plans to cut into medicare are 
unconscionable and unacceptable 
he said the budget would cut medicare by 27 billion 
these cuts if approved by the congress will continue to 
shift costs to private insurance plans a trend that is already 
raising the cost to employers who have to cut benefits increase 
copayments and deductibles and require larger employee 
contributions he said 
dukakis graduated in 1955 from swarthmore whose charter was 
approved by the pennsylvania legislature 125 years ago thursday 
the liberal arts college about 10 miles southwest of philadelphia 
has an enrollment of about 1320 
before his speech dukakis ate dinner with old classmates 
professors and students who campaigned for him 
my only regret is were not doing this on the east lawn of the 
white house he said

north americas longest rail tunnel a 
ninemile stretch under glacier national park has opened to link 
canadas coal and mineralproducing hinterland with the west coast 
and the pacific rim countries 
the tunnel was inaugurated thursday in a ceremony accented by 
the sound of bagpipes and attended by rail executives 
industrialists politicians and some of the 1100 railway workers 
who worked on the 422 million project 
the new route completed ahead of schedule and 84 million under 
budget ends the cumbersome practice of adding extra locomotives to 
trains that had to negotiate 4000foot rogers pass and should 
increase westbound capacity by as much as 60 per cent authorities 
say 
major improvements including the mount macdonald tunnel 
reduced the steepness so that pushers are no longer needed on the 
southeastern british columbia route 
this is the biggest thing the railway has done since the 
building of the transcontinental said barry scott chairman and 
chief executive officer of cp rail 
cp rail a subsidiary of canadian pacific ltd can now run 
fourlocomotive freight trains from calgary to vancouver and 
without the aid of the pusher trains increase the number of 
freights through rogers pass daily from 15 to 24 
after nearly 104 years of railroading in these selkirk 
mountains we have finally tamed the geography or at least as 
much as man is ever likely to do said scott 
the project involved doubletracking the cp rail main line 
through rogers pass it was the last of four doubletracking and 
gradereduction projects undertaken by the railway in british 
columbia and alberta 
lighter eastbound trains through rogers pass will use the old 
track and the connaught tunnel which opened in 1916 the new route 
also will be used by passenger trains 
cp rail officials say the project will have a significant impact 
on the ability to move export commodities such as grain coal 
sulphur and potash to the west coast and the pacific rim 
this was built for the future said barry scott a senior 
railway spokesman its solid advance planning 
cp rail hopes to pay for it over 20 to 30 years depending on 
revenues but will realize savings immediately from the elimination 
of about 20 pusher locomotives from service

progovernment candidate carlos duque 
urged 100000 followers to use their vote in the presidential 
election as a weapon to cut off the hands of those who sold 
panama for 10 million 
speaking thursday in may 5th plaza at his final major rally 
before sundays election duque said though that he was willing to 
resolve panamanian differences with the united states on a basis 
of respect and nonintervention 
duque has leaned heavily on allegations washington authorized 
10 million for the opposition and pointed to it as a us attempt 
to make panama just another star on the american flag 
duque faces opposition candidate guillermo endara in a race to 
succeed acting president manuel solis palma the balloting 
however is viewed as a referendum on strongman gen manuel antonio 
noriega the defense forces commander indicted in florida last year 
on drug trafficking charges 
international observers include two former us presidents who 
planned to monitor the balloting despite government insistence 
that voting will be free and fair the opposition and washington 
claim that the progovernment alliance will steal the election 
alleged american attempts to thwart panamanian dignity and 
independence have been rallying points of the progovernment 
coalition throughout the campaign 
panama cannot be bought for 10 million nor for all the gold 
in the world duque told a cheering crowd that waved colorful 
party flags and stood under banners reading among other 
thingsusa the world is watching you hands off panama 
duque said the eightparty national liberation alliance he 
represents is the only group that can guarantee stability bring 
together the panamanian people and deal effectively with other 
countries 
government employees who make up about 20 percent of the work 
force were given the afternoon off to attend the rally and 
thousands were trucked or bused to the capital from around panama 
panamanian law mandates all campaigning end tonight at midnight 
the democratic opposition alliance held its final rally 
wednesday saying sundays vote is the last peaceful opportunity 
for change and hinting they would take to the streets if the 
results appear rigged 
there is no official us observer delegation although former 
president gerald ford arrived thursday at howard air base near the 
capital former president jimmy carter and the rest of the 
delegation he heads under the auspices of the council of freely 
elected heads of governments were to due arrive today 
there were reports from washington that president bush would 
send a delegation despite panamanian statements that an official 
observer delegation would not be welcome 
panama has been under military rule since 1968 and has had only 
one presidential election since then in 1984 the opposition 
contends a return to democracy in panama is not possible with 
noriega as the head of the military 
noriega has denied the drug trafficking charges calling them an 
excuse to get rid of him in favor of someone more willing to 
respect american wishes especially regarding the panama canal 
under 1977 treaties signed by carter and the late panamanian 
dictator omar torrijos the canal is to be taken over by panama at 
the end of the century 
panamas government contends the opposition alliance will stop 
or delay the panamanian takeover of the waterway 
in february last year noriega allies in the national assembly 
ousted president eric delvalle who tried to fire noriega after the 
drug indictments washington still recognizes delvalle now in the 
united states as panamas legitimate ruler 
the united states imposed economic sanctions against panama last 
year to try to force noriega out 
the opposition press has been closed for more than a year in 
panama thursdays progovernment rally was widely broadcast while 
wednesdays opposition rally which drew a similar crowd was not

newspaper editorials across the nation today generally applauded 
oliver norths conviction as showing no one is above the law but 
some papers said the former national security aide was persecuted 
for political ends 
the verdict should remind future officials in the executive 
branch that they are not above the law however just they consider 
their cause and however much backing they enjoy from their 
superiors said the rocky mountain news in denver 
the star tribune in minneapolis minn said the jury rendered 
a service to common sense and common decency and the news amp 
observer of raleigh nc said norths conviction on three felony 
charges reaffirms the american principle that even high 
government officials are accountable to the law 
but some papers said north was a victim of political motivations 
the offenses north was found guilty of were woven of political 
gossamer and fashioned by a frustrated opposition said the 
indianapolis star north is guilty of one thing of 
overzealousness in the service of his country his president and 
liberty he should be pardoned 
north was found guilty of aiding and abetting an obstruction of 
congress as well as shredding and altering documents in november 
1986 and of accepting a 13800 home security system in mid1986 
from irancontra codefendant richard secord whom north had 
enlisted to run arms to the contras 
he was acquitted of nine other criminal charges 
many newspapers said north did not emerge from the trial as a 
villain but his conviction was a victory for the judicial system 
the verdict is satisfying not as a triumph for opponents of 
mr norths policies but as a vindication of law and orderly 
process that and a solemn judgment that the law however 
politically disagreeable must be respected by its servants said 
the new york times 
the dallas morning news said although north was found guilty on 
just three counts that was enough to make the allimportant 
constitutional point that even heroes must obey the law 
in one of the strongest editorials the atlanta constitution 
said north had a gift for appearing sincere and was a clever 
embroiderer of fictions in the surer light of the courtroom 
however he was less than convincing ollie north american hero 
is now a convicted felon 
other newspapers expressed a different viewpoint questioning in 
particular the expense to prosecute north 
given the multimilliondollar investigation and prosecution 
we would say that it is the taxpayers who are going to be paying 
for the zealotry of mr walsh and congressional liberals said 
the richmond va timesdispatch 
the boston herald said the trial proved that if you spend 13 
million to prosecute one man youre bound to get a conviction on 
something 
the daily news in new york said the verdict may have longterm 
consequences for the executive branch of government 
oliver norths shadow long will hang over the sort of 
freewheeling defiantly extralegal dealing that north engaged in 
proudly and that ultimately may be of far more consequence to 
the health of american democracy than any of the damage done by 
norths shallow indifference to the law 
whether the nation will ever learn the full story of the 
irancontra scandal is still in doubt according to the arizona 
republic in phoenix 
the north trial unfortunately cast little new light on the 
irancontra fiasco the misguided scheme to aid secretly and 
illegally the nicaraguan contras which turned into a scam to swap 
arms to iran for american hostages in beirut with the profits 
plowed back into the antisandinista cause remain a frustrating 
whodunit a pulp mystery with a convoluted plot and the last page 
torn out of the book

the mental condition of the central park jogger 
who was raped and beaten into a coma last month continues to 
improve but doctors say her recovery is threatened by a 106degree 
fever 
meanwhile police commissioner benjamin ward suggested thursday 
that cameras be placed in desolate areas of central park to alert 
police to the presence of roving gangs like the one that allegedly 
attacked the woman jogger 
at metropolitan hospital thursday doctors said the rape victim 
called her father dad for the first time since the attack 
we do feel mental statuswise that she is improving said 
dr robert s kurtz assistant chief of surgery on the other 
hand we are obviously concerned about the source of the fever 
the 28yearold woman who remained in a coma for two weeks 
after the april 19 attack regained consciousness tuesday speaking 
in a hoarse whisper to relatives and staff members her condition 
remained critical despite her progress kurtz said

a 13yearold with muscular dystrophy 
who was able to scream and push her attacker while she was raped 
wasnt physically helpless under law according to a court 
ruling that sets the man free 
the florida supreme court decided thursday that lee curtis 
davis whos serving a life sentence for the crime should not have 
been charged with rape against a physically helpless victim 
the 41 ruling upholds an appeals court decision that davis 
should go free because he was prosecuted under the wrong law 
although the girl who uses a wheelchair cannot move her legs 
testimony showed she screamed for help and tried to push the man 
away as he raped her twice in the 1985 attack by law the high 
court said she doesnt fit the definition of physically helpless 
davis 46 was sentenced in 1987 as a habitual offender and 
remains at the marion correctional institution court officials 
said he could be freed within 30 days 
he cannot be tried again for the crime because of the us 
constitutions provision against double jeopardy 
this was our court of last resort in this case the decision 
leaves us with the conviction overturned said assistant attorney 
general charles corces in tampa there can be no more appeals 
in february the 2nd district court of appeal in lakeland ruled 
that davis was tried under the wrong sexual battery law 
the victim was not physically helpless as defined in the 
rarely used law that davis was prosecuted under because she was not 
asleep unconscious or physically unable to communicate her 
unwillingness to the act the appeal court ruled 
the alleged rape occurred in davis lake alfred home where he 
was taking care of the girl 
ron toward the attorney who won davis appeal said thursday 
that he was happy for his client

soviet troops were involved in a coup in 
afghanistan before the new leader invited soviet soldiers to enter 
that country in 1979 a soviet historian said in the government 
newspaper izvestia 
i think the time has come to tell the whole truth however 
bitter it is historian yv gankovsky said thursday abroad 
books have been published on the subject silence from us only 
causes rumors and speculation 
western sources previously have reported that soviet forces 
moved into afghanistan before leader babrak karmal considered a 
soviet puppet issued his invitation 
but this is the first indication in a soviet publication that 
the soviet union may have engineered that invitation 
speaking of the attack on the presidents palace on dec 27 
1979 which killed hafizullah amin and led to karmals takeover 
gankovsky said from conversations with our officers i learned 
that our unit which was included in the limited soviet military 
contingent also took part in the operation 
the clash did not take long gankovsky added and with 
the exception of amins personal guards nobody even made an 
attempt to defend the regime he headed 
according to a book by western journalist jan goodwin caught 
in the crossfire amin had just rejected a soviet demand that he 
either resign or make a formal request for soviet troops to 
intervene in afghanistan 
the next day babrak karmal claimed power in a broadcast on 
kabul radio and asked for soviet political moral military and 
economic assistance a request repeatedly cited by the soviets as 
the reason for their intervention 
goodwin says karmal was actually in tashkent in the soviet union 
at the time and the broadcast was made using a prerecorded tape 
gankovsky also argued with reported statements by gen vi 
vanenikov that the intervention was necessary to protect the soviet 
union 
of course having a hostile government in power in a 
neighboring country could not be satisfying to us but it did not 
follow that we had to react to the situation the way we did in 
1979 he said 
political diplomatic steps could have been taken he said 
gankovsky also repeated earlier reports that the decision to 
send troops to afghanistan was taken by former president leonid 
brezhnev and a handful of others former soviet foreign minister 
andrei gromyko has said brezhnevs opposition to amin was partially 
motived by fury over the murder of amins precedessor marxist 
president nur mohammed taraki 
tarakis murder has to be taken into account when considering 
the steps taken by the soviet union in afghanistan gromyko told 
the london observer in a recent interview

tree top the nations largest apple 
processer says it will break contracts with apple growers who use 
the chemical alar on this seasons crops 
the growers cooperative in idaho oregon and washington said 
thursday the move was to allay consumer fears over reports that 
alar can cause cancer 
in the past tree top rejected apples that were treated with the 
chemical which makes apples redder and crisper 
under the expanded ban no apples will be accepted from any 
growers who uses alar on any of their apple trees even if the 
specific apples submitted to tree top arent treated with the 
chemical 
tree top is trying to step up the pressure to eliminate alar 
from the apple industry altogether said mark murray a spokesman 
for the selahbased growers cooperative 
tree top previously urged the us environmental protection 
agency to ban alar use altogether and it has requested the 
chemicals manufacturer uniroyal to stop its production 
the chemical is legal to use but it has become highly 
controversial since the natural resources defense council reported 
earlier this year that the chemical leads to cancer in children 
the report was challenged by the us food and drug 
administration and other federal health officials who said the 
alar present in some apples was not enough to endanger humans

growers are worried that theres too much 
sunshine visible through the sunshine states famed orange juice 
these days 
although floridas juice tastes as sweet as ever its gradually 
becoming paler according to many of floridas 12000 growers and 
more than 30 citrus processors 
this industry is running into real trouble said david o 
hamrick a veteran citrus grower and processor from bradenton 
the color issue is something we need to consider 
consumers apparently prefer darker orange juice and industry 
insiders fear todays florida orange juice which often is more 
yellow than orange could affect the states 4 billion a year 
industry 
color perception is very important to consumers but its only 
a perception said hamrick who retired last year as senior vice 
president of tropicana products inc and has served 16 years on 
the florida citrus commission 
the truth is dark juice can be less tasty depending on the 
variety hamrick said 
the problem is already acute warned john attaway director 
of scientific research for the state department of citrus in 
lakeland 
part of the problem has been the weather devastating freezes in 
1983 and 1985 destroyed about 200000 of floridas more than 
847000 acres of fruit trees 
today the state has about 700000 acres and in recent years 
growers have been planting at the rate of more than 50000 acres a 
year 
but growers seeking to harvest their fruit before the january 
and february freezes are planting oranges that mature early 
the main earlyseason juicefruit the hamlin orange ripens as 
early as october and produces a sweet juice 
unfortunately juice from hamlin oranges is far lighter in color 
than the lateseason valencia orange which matures from march 
through june 
processors seeking a product of uniform color often blend 
earlyand lateseason fruit and the color of a lot of florida 
orange juice is fading as an everhigher percentage of hamlins 
moves into the mixing vats 
the juice could become still paler in coming decades as newly 
planted hamlin trees reach their production peak

the verdict in oliver norths trial is not 
likely to end revelations still trickling out from the irancontra 
affair says one of the chief congressional investigators 
rep lee hamilton who was chairman of the house committee that 
delved into the affair in 1987 noted that more trials are yet to 
come and that the house and senate intelligence committees are 
looking into why some key documents that came out at norths trial 
were never turned over to congressional investigators 
we certainly didnt find out all the truth in the irancontra 
hearings said hamilton dind well be learning bits and 
pieces about irancontra for years to come and after the statute 
of limitations runs out well probably find more 
the north trial raised a number of questions that i think are 
still unanswered hamilton said this morning on nbctvs 
today show 
we still have many many unanswered questions about 
irancontra and those should be pursued and certainly important 
documents that came out in the north trial we should understand 
why we did not get those documents he added 
rep henry hyde rill said on abcs good morning america 
meantime i think what youll find when the investigation is 
complete no documents were withheld if there were it was 
inadvertant there was certainly no conspiracy 
the house intelligence committee moved thursday to begin a staff 
investigation into what key documents failed to reach congress and 
why those papers were not turned over by the white house the 
panels senate counterpart already had begun such a probe 
the documents are important and clearly were within the scope 
of the investigation hamilton said it is up to us to pursue 
the implications of those documents to their conclusion 
documents introduced in norths trial indicated that 
thenpresident reagan approved a deal in 1985 in which the united 
states would expedite economic and military aid to honduras in 
return for that countrys continued help for the contras who were 
encamped just inside honduras along the border with nicaragua 
official us aid to the contras was banned at the time 
the documents together with trial testimony suggested that 
senior officials up to and including former president reagan and 
thenvice president george bush were more involved in the affair 
than the congressional committees knew 
bush himself spoke out for the first time on the subject 
thursday giving reporters the word of the president of the 
united states that there was no quid pro quo he said he 
would turn over to congress records of his 1985 meeting with the 
honduran president 
one main document introduced at the trial a 42page admission 
of facts stipulated by the government said that reagan did approve 
a deal and that expedited aid did begin flowing to honduras 
rep david obey dwis chairman of the appropriations 
subcommittee that handles foreign aid said he would hold up all 
aid to central america until the contradictions are cleared up 
i simply feel we have an obligation to find out what the facts 
were obey said the sad truth is that congress apparently has 
been lied to for years 
the white house has offered to make available to congress former 
white house counsel arthur b culvahouse jr who oversaw the 
document search for the congressional irancontra committees and 
gave assurances that all relevant documents had been provided 
senate investigators already have identified at least six 
documents made public during norths trial which failed to come to 
light during the 1987 congressional probe most of them point to a 
deal with honduras to expedite us aid in return for help for the 
contras 
among them are a feb 19 1985 memo outlining such a plan and 
approved by reagan and a memo dated the following day making it 
clear that the administration knew it was forbidden to provide aid 
under those circumstances

a sharp drop in the number of central 
americans trying to enter the united states has prompted the border 
patrol to scale back extra forces detailed to the south texas 
border an official said 
immigration officials say the drop in apprehensions means 
gettough policies are discouraging central americans from coming 
here to file frivolous applications for political asylum 
central american apprehensions in south texas have fallen from 
200250 a day in early march to a current level of 5060 a day 
ej vickery assistant chief of the border patrols mcallen 
sector said thursday 
from january to march the border patrols mcallen sector added 
192 extra agents to stem a flood of otherthanmexican aliens 
entering the country illegally the bulk of the extra agents 
brought in from other parts of the country patrolled in the 
brownsville area the closest border crossing point to nicaragua 
el salvador honduras and guatemala 
the agency began detaining nearly all of those apprehended 
rather than releasing most on their own recognizance as it had 
been doing 
the crackdown accompanied an immigration and naturalization 
service policy that began feb 21 in which asylum applicants are 
processed in one day and immediately detained if their initial 
claims to refugee status are denied 
the number of extra border patrol agents in south texas has been 
cut to 102 and may be reduced further if apprehensions continue to 
drop said vickery there are 395 agents permanently stationed in 
the mcallen sector 
he said the word of a crackdown has reached central america 
if youre caught here you are detained then your case is 
heard immediately he said its not like it was before when 
they were released and traveled north never to be heard from 
again 
ins officials also say the number of people turning themselves 
in voluntarily to apply for political asylum has plummeted from 500 
a day in january to a current level of fewer than 10 daily in south 
texas 
in fact on tuesday of this week we didnt have any 
applicants said virginia kice spokeswoman for the ins 
harlingen district

a plumbers proposal to turn a 
southwest oregon county into an aids free zone has gotten a cold 
reception from authorities 
this is an invasion of the rights of citizens josephine 
county commissioner rebecca brown said it also reminds me of 
nazi germany this is much more frightening than any threat of the 
aids virus 
she was reacting to a ballot measure proposed wednesday by 
george heimos that would amend the county charter to require mass 
testing for the aids virus and possible expulsion for those who 
test positive 
i decided that this county has a high christian value to it 
and that aids would certainly wipe out a huge portion of the 
population should it start to spread very rapidly the grants 
pass resident said 
he must gather 1824 signatures to put the measure on the 
ballot the earliest election date available would be in may 1990 
heimos wants to administer widespread tests and publish the 
results 
those to be tested under the proposal include children in public 
schools public employees many jail inmates applicants for county 
permits or licences people known to have had extramarital affairs 
and those who engage in highrisk behavior 
the proposal calls for the county health department to 
quarantine those carrying the virus or expel them from the county

vice president dan quayle toured 
sludgefouled beaches on his return from a 12day pacific tour and 
said today exxon must do more to clean up the devastation wrought 
by the nations largest oil spill 
its going to be an enormous effort quayle said thursday as 
he looked at a beach on hardhit smith island an important haulout 
area for seals workers have been laboring for days to wash the 
beach clean 
then at a news conference early today quayle said it appears 
exxon believes its cleanup plan is adequate but i believe 
exxons going to have to do more than they think theyre going to 
have to do he said 
quayle accompanied by his wife marilyn and joined by coast 
guard commandant paul a yost jr and federal transportation 
secretary samuel skinner ended his pacific trip thursday with a 
sixhour wind and rainswept tour of the spill zone 
the vice presidents jet arrived from japan at the fishing town 
of cordova about 50 miles from the site of the march 24 spill 
which was caused when the tanker exxon valdez slammed into a 
charted reef outside shipping lanes and poured 101 million gallons 
of crude through its shattered hull 
oil from the slick has been spotted more than 520 miles 
southwest of valdez past the tiny village of chignik on the alaskan 
peninsula state environmental officials said thursday the oil is 
moving in some areas at the rate of 17 miles a day 
the ships skipper joseph hazelwood has pleaded innocent to 
operating the vessel while drunk and is being investigated by a 
grand jury for potential felony charges his trial is set to begin 
june 20 in valdez 
before the news conference quayle dressed in jeans and a 
flight jacket met with democratic gov steve cowper and more than 
a dozen mayors and leaders representing areas affected by the spill 
quayle told reporters that although president bush has not 
personally visited the spill site he has expressed his concern by 
sending top federal officials to alaska 
quayle earlier met with two dozen local officials at cordova 
who urged him to support the expansion of a local salmon research 
facility to study the effects of the spill you can count on 
it quayle told one resident 
he also agreed to serve alaskan salmon at the white house 
traveling in helicopters quayle and his entourage then went to 
the uss juneau the coast guards command center for the cleanup 
and to smith island 
oil from the spill has spread to the spectacular katmai national 
park a wildlife refuge exxon officials thursday proposed arming 
the guards of their workcrews with shotguns to protect them against 
the bears currently guards are carrying chemical sprays to fend 
off animals 
but state and federal environmental officials were concerned 
that inexperienced guards might shoot the bears needlessly 
exxon which is financing the cleanup has offered a plan to 
clean 364 miles of alaska coastline by midseptember but nearly 
200 of those miles would be left untouched by cleanup crews and 
allowed to be cleansed by natural wave wind and rain action 
the company also says it may require exemptions from alaskas 
strict environmental laws to dispose of the waste it collects 
either through burning burying or wastewater treatment 
the state responding to a request from yost to evaluate exxons 
revised cleanup plan was sharply critical of the proposal saying 
it was inadequate and didnt provide for enough personnel to do the 
job 
exxon president lee r raymond at a news conference in his new 
york city offices denied the company was trying to cut corners in 
the cleanup but he complained that as many as 14 government 
agencies may be involved in approving and carrying out the final 
plan 
i want one person in charge i dont care who it is because 
there has to be one person that finally says hey its midnight 
and weve got to do something raymond said anything 
reasonable anything that makes sense that they would say you ought 
to do in addition to what you have in the plan well do it

calls for a presidential pardon in the wake of 
three guilty verdicts against former marine lt col oliver l 
north are producing disagreement in congress but most of those 
commenting concur that north should spend little or no time in jail 
many conservatives called for a prompt pardon by president bush 
other members of congress including some conservatives said 
that would be premature at best and that the judicial process 
should be allowed to run its course 
former president gerald r ford whose pardon of expresident 
richard nixon caused a furor and may have cost ford reelection 
declined to give bush advice on the subject 
i have very strictly taken the position that it would be 
inappropriate for me to comment on that publicly its a very 
very personal decision to the presidnet as i found out from my 
own experience said ford on abcs good morning america 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house investigating 
committee said on today this morning that this is not an 
instance where a presidential pardon is appropriate nor is it an 
instance where he should have extended sentence 
hamilton said earlier that the fact that col north was in a 
difficult position does not absolve him of his responsibility but 
it may go toward mitigation of his punishment 
opinions varied widely on the federal jurys split decision 
convicting north on three charges acquitting him on nine others 
and on the ultimate meaning of his role at the heart of the mystery 
known as the irancontra affair 
rep barney frank dmass said on cbs this morning that 
while he opposes a pardon the commutation of a prison sentence 
would be totally appropriate 
i dont think there should be a prison sentence i dont think 
there ought to be any kind of a harsh sentence at all i do think 
it is important to establish for the future that theres no 
ambiguity that no matter what you think other people may have 
ordered you simply cant rip up documents and you cant mislead 
the congress as long as national security wasnt involved said 
frank 
i think hes a very tragic figure said sen warren rudman 
rnh vice chairman of the senate irancontra committee but i 
find no evidence of remorse on his part because he really believes 
he was doing what he was supposed to do 
i do not think oliver north understands to this day what the 
constitutional issues were all about rudman said 
daniel l casey president of the american conservative union 
called on bush to pardon north and richard a viguerie chairman of 
the united conservative union declared that oliver north 
deserves a medal not a prison sentence 
i predict there will be an avalanche of conservative outcry 
for president bush to pardon ollie viguerie said 
i think george bush should pardon him said sen orrin 
hatch rutah who was one of norths stoutest defenders in the 
irancontra probe 
but hatch and other senators said that step would almost 
certainly cause political problems for bush similar to those faced 
by ford when he pardoned nixon in the watergate scandal 
the presidents problem is that if he does pardon him there 
will be shouting and screaming from the same partisans who have 
been out to hang north from the beginning hatch said 
some of hatchs conservative colleagues disagreed on the pardon 
issue 
i do not want to see a pardon because i think the court system 
is working very well said sen larry pressler rsd 
sen gordon humphrey rnh also opposed a pardon saying 
the man was indicted and the jury decided that the facts upheld 
three of the indictments its obviously a tragedy for him and his 
family but no one is above the law 
as a former prosecutor i wasnt surprised at the verdict 
said sen patrick j leahy dvt what the jury is saying very 
clearly is that north shouldnt be taking the blame for the whole 
thing he shouldnt be a fall guy 
but leahy said a presidential pardon would make a mockery of 
the whole system 
sen joseph r biden ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee said a pardon would be outrageous 
i take the president at his word that there will be no 
pardon biden said and added it seems to me the jury came to 
the conclusion that you cannot lie and that you are not allowed to 
go ahead and shred documents that you are responsible for your 
actions that you still have to obey the law even though someone 
else told you to do it 
former president reagan on whose watch north took the actions 
that resulted in the irancontra scandal and his trial by jury 
declined to comment because north still faces a long process of 
court hearings and appeals 
but sen daniel k inouye dhawaii the chairman of the senate 
irancontra committee said the decision reaffirms the panels 
findings that north and the others involved in the irancontra 
affair showed disdain for our laws and constitutional system of 
government 
rep henry hyde rill who also served on the irancontra 
committee said he felt colonel north was left twisting in the 
wind by an administration he served with all his heart and soul

warsaw pact nations today pressured 
quarreling nato allies to open talks on reducing tactical nuclear 
weapons in europe and said such negotiations are tied to efforts to 
trim conventional forces 
soviet and east german diplomats used todays resumption of 
eastwest talks on conventional weapons to jump into the dispute 
within the nato alliance over reducing shortrange nuclear weapons 
west germany and some european nato members want superpower 
talks on reducing shortrange nuclear weapons but the united 
states and britain oppose them because of the soviet advantage in 
conventional weapons washington and london also want to modernize 
the shortrange missiles 
east german ambassador klausdieter ernst insisted at todays 
resumption of conventional arms talks that parallel talks on 
reducing shortrange nuclear weapons are vital to germans 
the shorter the range of the rockets the more dead germans 
he told a news conference referring to the fact that east and west 
germans are most threatened by the shortrange weapons 
the absence of parallel negotations on nuclear weapons would 
of course have negative effects on the vienna talks on 
conventional arms he added 
west german chancellor helmut kohl worried about the sliding 
popularity of his centerright government supports talks with the 
soviets on reducing shortrange nuclear weapons and wants to 
postpone a decision on modernizing the weapons until after next 
years elections 
the vienna talks opened march 9 with a mandate that specifically 
excluded nuclear rockets 
but ernst and soviet ambassador oleg a grinevsky said that the 
seven warsaw pact nations see talks on shortrange nuclear weapons 
and naval forces as part of overall efforts to reduce arms and 
increase security in europe 
us ambassador steven j ledogar said he was disappointed when 
every east bloc speaker at todays closeddoor talks mentioned the 
nuclear weapons even as they admitted they have no place in this 
negotiation 
i suspect that they know that theres a certain amount of 
discussion in the nato camp he told reporters referring to the 
internal nato rift 
ledogar stressed that nato squabbles over nuclear weapons will 
have no effect on nato unity at the vienna talks we are in 
complete unison he said 
grinevsky used todays session to outline a plan dividing the 
zone covered by the talks from the atlantic to the ural mountains 
deep inside the soviet union into smaller regions 
he said the two sides should work to agree on overall totals for 
the number of men and weapons each military bloc can possess but 
also agree on totals for each region 
the regions included a central european zone comprising west 
germany the netherlands belgium luxembourg and denmark on the 
nato side and poland east germany czechoslovakia and hungary for 
the warsaw pact it is in this area that most of the deadly 
weaponry of both military blocs is massed 
but grinevsky failed to provide any overall weapons ceilings or 
for the zones ledogar said such totals were vital for progress at 
the talks 
at the previous round of talks that ended march 22 the warsaw 
pact outlined plans for reducing troops and weapons 10 percent to 
15 percent below present levels by 1994 a further 25 percent by 
1997 and moving to completely defensive forces by the year 2000 
nato by contrast presented a more specific proposal for 
ceilings on tanks artillery and armored personnel carriers 
both sides declared their willingness to get down to specifics 
today but remained divided over which weapons categories they want 
to cut first 
nato estimates that the warsaw pact will have more than a 2to1 
edge in tanks and artillery in europe even after recently announced 
unilateral troop cuts are carried out in the soviet bloc 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev announced in december that 
50000 soviet troops and 5000 tanks would pull out of east 
germany hungary and czechoslovakia by 1991 the withdrawals began 
last week in hungary with the departure of 31 t64 tanks 
ernst said today that further unilateral cuts by the various 
warsaw pact allies mean that by 1991 the soviet bloc will cut its 
troops by 581300 men 12751 tanks 10030 artillery systems 
1010 combat aircraft 895 armored vehicles and 30 nuclear 
systems

government should allow certain levels of 
toxic pollution in the air and drop the current goal of a total 
ban says a draft developed by officials working on president 
bushs clean air package 
the zero tolerance level mandated under current law is 
suboptimal and if continued would be extremely costly politically 
difficult and would threaten the shutdown of many plants in several 
industries from court mandates says the document a copy of 
which was obtained thursday 
the draft document provides options for pollution control 
ranging from assessing health risks against industry costs to 
setting standards for 125 pollution categories to leaving the whole 
matter up to the states 
the drafts options on airborne toxins are to be reviewed by 
bushs domestic policy council before going to the president with a 
recommendation as part of his clean air act revision plan the plan 
also will include sections on acid rain and attainment of urban 
ozone standards 
some environmental activists who obtained the document denounced 
its proposals as too weak to protect the public against airborne 
poisons 
the draft deals with the attempt to arrest the 27 billion 
pounds of poisonous chemicals that the epa estimates are released 
into the atmosphere each year 
the epa is now required to assess the risk of each chemical and 
then develop a chemicalbychemical emissions standard designed to 
protect the public health within an ample margin of safety 
analysts from the environmentalist natural resources defense 
council on thursday attacked the draft proposals as a weak effort 
none of the options are going to protect the public from toxic 
air emissions said nrdc resource specialist debbie shieman the 
nrdc is a private nonprofit organization 
she criticized the principles listed in the document which 
stated only that reductions should be achieved as soon as 
possible and that reduction of health risk be balanced against 
economic and technical feasibility considerations 
clean air bills are already pending in congress and more are 
expected to be introduced bushs plan is expected to be ready 
within a month 
the draft lists three initial regulatory options for industrial 
polluters 
the first would set an unreasonable risk standard to balance 
the benefits of regulation against its cost this standard the 
document said could be coupled with a commitment to address a 
specific list of the industrial sources posing the greatest risk 
with a period of perhaps three to five years 
the document acknowledged that such an approach likely would 
be criticized as not protective of public health 
the second option would turn the standards question over to the 
states and have each state issue permits for individual industrial 
polluters specifying acceptable emission levels 
the third option would list about 125 industrial categories 
for control on schedules requiring controls by dates 5 to 12 years 
after promulgation 
this alternative would rely on polluters using maximum 
available control technology to control emissions 
newly constructed pollution sources would have to use the best 
achievable technology to cut pollution but the option said that 
must be done considering costs and technical feasibility 
existing polluters would use technology defined as the maximum 
achievable in common practice by the better performing 
sources 
it would also allow exemptions for several categories of 
polluters 
that common practice language said nrdc clean air 
specialist dick ayres is worrisome because common practice 
could be read as current procedures that do not necessarily employ 
the best technology 
one administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said it was unclear when the draft would be considered by bushs 
domestic policy council of advisers which includes cabinet members 
and key officials who advise bush on domestic matters 
airborne toxins are one part of the package which will also 
include smog and acid rain that the bush administration is 
preparing to propose as a new clean air act

prime minister yitzhak shamir visiting jewish 
victims of an arab stabbing attack said today that israeli 
citizens should make sure terrorists dont escape unscathed 
shamir visited a hospital where two survivors were recovering 
from wednesdays attack in which two elderly israelis were killed 
and three others wounded as they sat at a bus stop in jerusalem 
such incidents anger us and we have to act against this 
shamir said 
he noted that a large contingent of police reinforcements 
believed to number 3000 have been deployed in jerusalem to 
prevent further attacks during the eid al fitr holiday which marks 
the end of the moslems monthlong ramadan fast but he added that 
citizens also had to play a role 
i think the general public and the jewish public must do their 
utmost in order to defend themselves and in order to prevent 
murderers from doing their deeds and in order to prevent them from 
coming out unscathed if they succeed in doing something shamir 
said in remarks broadcast on israel radio 
parliament member haim oron of the socialist mapam party was 
quoted by israel radio as criticizing shamir for calling on the 
public to take the law into their own hands 
shamirs spokesman avi pazner said the premier meant to say 
citizens should help police in guarding against attacks and in 
apprehending perpetrators he said there was no intention to 
encourage vigilante actions 
after wednesdays attack israeli passersby chased caught and 
beat the arab attacker police intervened to rescue the man later 
reinforcements were called up to stop reprisal attacks on other 
arabs by angry israelis 
police arrested rabbi meir kahane leader of the antiarab kach 
party and seven of his followers for disturbing public order 
kahanes followers had tried to march to the old walled city where 
they said they would attack arabs 
kahane supporters today staged a protest demanding his release 
the palestinian who carried out wednesdays attack in jerusalem 
appeared before a judge who ordered him held for an additional two 
weeks 
the man 25yearold nidal abdel razik zaloum is from the west 
bank town of el bireh and told police he acted alone he had a 
bandage on his ear and bloodstains on his shirt israel radio said 
he asked for a lawyer so that his views would be clearly 
represented

organization and the islamic jihad in palestine or holy war 
group claimed responsibility in a statement issued in beirut 
in the occupied gaza strip today arab reports said five

scientists using a cameraequipped robot that 
scours the ocean floor have found the first known thermal vents in 
the mediterranean sea and they expect discoveries of exotic 
creatures to follow 
a leader of the undersea project by the woods hole oceanographic 
institution said thursdays finding will have broad implications 
for marine biology and geology 
marine biologists previously have discovered footlong clams 
12foot tube worms and other exotic animals living on the floor of 
the atlantic and pacific oceans near thermal vents which are deep 
cracks where hot minerals well up from the earths core 
the woods hole team said it expects that neverbeforeseen 
creatures also will be found near the mediterranean vents 
discovered about 120 miles from where a remotecontrolled 
submersible robot will explore a sunken roman ship in 2100 feet of 
water off the coast of italy 
each place where thermal vents have been found before weve 
come across new animals and each place theyve been different 
said shelley lauzon a spokeswoman for the oceanographic 
institution on cape cod 
the robot named jason will transmit live pictures of the roman 
trading ship and ocean floor to an estimated 250000 schoolchildren 
at 13 museums from british columbia to florida 
robert ballard the oceanographer in charge of the 7 million 
jason project found the first known undersea vents near the 
galapagos islands in the eastern pacific in 1976 since then 
researchers have found similar vents in the western pacific and 
midatlantic 
lauzon said all the vents have been surrounded by chemosynthetic 
bacteria unusual organisms living in darkness and feeding on 
chemicals that are toxic to virtually all other forms of life 
the bacteria in turn are believed to start the food chain that 
supports exotic animals found nowhere else including footlong 
clams and mussels in the eastern pacific and eyeless shrimp and 
hairy snails in the western pacific 
the fact that vents have now been found in the atlantic the 
pacific and the mediterranean indicates that they may well be in 
all of the worlds oceans which in turn implies that the 
diversity of deep sea life may be far greater than previously 
thought lauzon said 
some scientists also have said that the discovery of 
chemosynthetic bacteria and organisms that feed on them makes it 
more likely that life could exist on distant planets under extreme 
conditions 
david gallo jason project coordinator and assistant director of 
the center for marine exploration at woods hole said how the 
discovery of the vents was made was itself a significant 
technological advance 
in the past such explorations required scientists to spend a 
month or more at sea viewing videotapes of the ocean bottom that 
were taken by submersible vessels 
on thursday a satellite hookup enabled scientists at woods hole 
to see the ocean floor as jasons camera saw it and to summon 
colleagues who could look and offer their opinions gallo said 
this is remarkable that i could get an authority here in two 
or three minutes who didnt have to dedicate a whole month at sea 
to participate in this event he said

alexander mogilny regarded as one of 
the best young hockey players in the world defected to the west to 
play in the national hockey league according to soviet and swedish 
news reports 
mogilny 20 failed to show up thursday at stockholms airport 
to join the soviet national team on its return to moscow 
the national news agency tt reported that mogilny left this 
morning on a scandinavian airlines system plane to new york 
spokesmen for the nhl and the buffalo sabres who hold mogilnys 
rights said they knew nothing of the defection sabres spokesman 
budd bailey said thursday night that general manager gerry meehan 
left town wednesday and did not leave word where he could be 
reached 
but a gerry meehan was registered thursday at the sergel plaza 
hotel in stockholm where the soviets won the world hockey 
championships earlier this week meehan could not be immediately 
reached for comment 
soviet sources indicated in an interview with flt a swedish 
news agency that he was heading to the united states to join an 
nhl team 
soviet athletes are playing in the west in increasing numbers 
with one of molignys former teammates sergei priakin joining the 
calgary flames of the nhl in march and deals in the works to bring 
other top hockey players basketball players and boxers to the 
united states 
it was unclear what effect the defection might have on relations 
between the nhl and the soviets four soviet teams are scheduled to 
tour the nhl next season and the calgary flames and washington 
capitals are to visit the soviet union in september 
i cant answer for the soviets they have been known in the 
past to do things the way they choose flames general manager 
cliff fletcher said in calgary i hope our relationship is 
stronger than one hockey player 
fletcher said he did not anticipate any demand for the return of 
priakin 
we have a contract with them for the next two years i believe 
the soviets have a reputation of being solid businessmen and will 
stick to their agreement he said 
fletcher described mogilny as the best young player in the 
soviet union he was voted the worlds best junior player by nhl 
scouts in a poll organized by the hockey news 
viktor tikhonov the coach of the national team criticized 
mogilny 
this incident soured our joyful homecoming after winning the 
championships tikhonov told the soviet news agency tass he said 
he believed mogilny was lured by the promise of a big nhl contract 
however he described relations between the soviet sports 
committee and the nhl as stable 
tass said soviet sports authorities had planned to discuss 
allowing other soviet players to sign with nhl clubs after the team 
returned from the world championships 
in reporting the defection soviet television said national team 
officials and the soviet federation asked the soviet embassy to 
tell us and canadian embassies the consequences of this 
situation for the nhl would be most serious 
the owner of the stockholm hotel where the soviet team stayed 
during the world championships contacted team officials by phone at 
the airport and said he had received an anonymous phone call 
informing him of the defection 
mogilny a member of the soviet central red army team served a 
10game suspension earlier this season after a fight in a soviet 
league game against spartak moscow a swedish newspaper reported 
last week that he also was penalized a months salary 
mogilny a junior army lieutenant told the aftonbladet 
newspaper that he was not interested in a military career i want 
to do something else with my life the newspaper quoted him as

pope john paul ii appealed today for 
improved relations between roman catholics and moslems in this 
southern african nation which is experiencing a surge in islamic 
fundamentalism 
what is required is mutual respect as well as mutual 
recognition of those things that we share in common the pope 
said in a speech to catholic bishops on the last full day of his 
nineday african tour 
john paul repeated the statement he made to moslems during his 
trip to morocco in 1985 saying that christians and moslems have 
badly understood each other and that god invites us to change 
our old practices 
both among christians working for unity and among 
believers of different religions there is no place for aggressive 
proselytism which disturbs and hurts still less toward the use of 
unworthy methods john paul said 
there are about 25 million catholics and 1 million moslems in 
this nation of 8 million people anglicans protestants and 
animists make up most of the rest of the population 
since the early 1970s moslems have expanded their presence in 
malawi building hundreds of mosques across the country widely 
believed to have been financed by saudi dollars 
antagonism between moslems and catholics arose in 1983 and 1984 
when several churches in blantyre and mangochi and the cathedral in 
zomba were set on fire by moslem extremists 
in august several catholic youths and an elderly religious 
teacher were forcibly circumcised in a suburb of blantyre by moslem 
fundamentalists church officials said 
some moslem leaders said they were upset that the pope was 
visiting malawi during the period of ramadan 
vatican officials say the spread of islam is one of the churchs 
main challenges in africa 
a big question is whether africa will be a christian or moslem 
continent 25 years from now vatican spokesman joaquin navarro 
said today the church cannot compete with the billions of 
dollars that is financing islam in africa 
earlier today the pope celebrated mass for more than 100000 
people gathered on the sloping meadow of blantyres kwacha park 
in his homily the pope referred to aids for the second day in a 
row urging his flock to treat the victims of the disease as we 
would treat christ himself 
according to health officials here as many as 18 percent of 
newborn children are infected with the aids virus navarro said 
about 20 percent of prisoners and urban workers have the disease 
the pope also referred to the 640000 refugees who have fled to 
malawi to escape a civil war in neighboring mozambique urging his 
audience to show love and kindness toward them 
the ceremony was attended by malawis presidentforlife 
hastings kamuzu banda who arrived in a mercedes limousine 
surrounded by his troupe of women dancers and singers and sat on a 
stage decorated with two carved wooden lions 
the pope came to malawi after visits to madagascar reunion and 
zambia and returns to rome on saturday night

the study of an obscure wild brazilian 
tomato has led scientists to the discovery of a treatment that 
doubles the keeping time of some commerciallygrown tomatoes 
the nations 1 billion freshtomato industry could realize 
dramatic benefits from the new process said peter j davies a 
plant physiology professor at cornell university 
it gives shippers more time to get the fruit to market it 
gives supermarkets a longer period of time to sell the fruit and it 
will provide consumers with a bettertasting tomato particularly 
during the offseason said davies the project director 
the cornell treatment process increases the shelflife of 
vineripened tomatoes to 10 to 12 days said david m law a 
research associate on the project currently storebought tomatoes 
begin spoiling after 4 to 5 days 
the method involves increasing the level of a chemical compound 
called 14 butanediamine already found naturally in the tomato 
the process is now being tested by a food company to determine 
whether it is viable on a large scale 
we were studying a mutant tomato looking for a compound to 
induce ripening when we kind of came upon this said law 
researchers got the idea while studying the alcobaca tomato a 
nonedible variety that holds its ripeness for several weeks before 
spoiling cornell plant scientist martha mutschler found that once 
the tomato is picked the ripening process slows drastically said 
davies 
scientists eventually learned that the delay in the alcobacas 
ripening process was caused by an abundance of 14 butanediamine 
one of a group of chemicals known as polyamines found in all living 
things they also found several other natural polyamines that 
worked to retard ripening 
the cornell method calls for picking the fruit just after it 
begins to ripen on the vine and then infusing it with the 
polyamines 
we simply double the level of polyamines already in the fruit 
thus preventing the ripe fruit from becoming soft too quickly 
said davies 
most tomatoes available in stores during the offseason are 
picked while still green and are ripened with treatments of 
ethylene a naturally occurring hormone davies said 
green tomatoes never ripen properly and they never seem to 
taste like vineripened ones said davies

the united states which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the 
worlds total reported 2845 new victims between the end of 
february and midapril this brought the us total up to 89501 
cases 
france which ranks second only to the united states in the 
number of reported cases found 754 new sufferers in the first 
three months of the year raising its total to 6409 cases 
brazil registered 766 new cases for the first two months of 
1989 with a reported total of 5712 cases the country has the 
highest number of cases in latin america 
bermuda had the highest incidence rate in the american region 
with 491 per 100000 people compared with 105 in the united 
states 
in africa malawi had the highest rate 222 in europe 
switzerland topped the rate list with 59 per 100000

george bush is off to a surprisingly good 
start as president according to an unlikely supporter jimmy 
carter 
bush has done a fine job so far the former president said 
thursday my only concern is that his administration respond more 
vigorously to the chance to negotiate with the soviets on further 
arms control 
carter participating in the state university of buffalos 
power and the presidency lecture series told the audience of 
about 4000 that every president must be competent compassionate 
and always tell the truth and that bush seems to exhibit more of 
these qualities than his predecessor president reagan 
carter expressed similar sentiments at a meeting earlier 
thursday in atlanta with contributors to cable news networks 
world report 
carter said bush has done an extraordinarily good job in several 
areas including central america the administrations plan for 
reducing the debt of foreign nations and its relations with the 
palestine liberation organization 
in a meeting with reporters in buffalo before his talk carter 
said it was clear that oliver north was not acting alone when he 
misled congress on the reagan administrations involvement in the 
irancontra scandal 
i dont think theres any doubt about the fact president 
reagan knew what was going on and gave either direct or indirect 
approval he said 
north was convicted thursday on three of the 12 charges stemming 
from the scandal including one that he destroyed documents as part 
of a coverup 
carter said he didnt think the verdict would have a significant 
effect on the bush administration 
on another topic carter said he was glad that bush was moving 
away from the reagan administration policy of avoiding discussion 
of american hostages in lebanon 
ignoring them doesnt work he said 
carter revealed that he once called robert macfarlane reagans 
national security advisor and threatened to publicly denounce the 
administration if it did not resume private briefings for the 
families of hostage members on news concerning their loved ones 
carter was scheduled to leave for panama today as part of an 
international delegation that will monitor elections there sunday

iranian parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani said today that palestinians should kill americans and 
other westerners in retaliation for attacks by the israeli military 
in the occupied territories 
if in retaliation for every palestinian martyred in palestine 
they will kill and execute not inside palestine five americans or 
britons or frenchmen they israelis could not continue these 
wrongs rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the official islamic 
republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
it is not hard to kill americans or frenchman it is a bit 
difficult to kill israelis but there are so many americans and 
frenchman everywhere in the world he said 
at least 460 palestinians and 20 israelis have died in the 
17monthold palestinian uprising against israeli in the west bank 
and gaza strip which israel seized from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 middle east war 
irna said rafsanjani spoke at a prayer sermon today in tehran 
before huge rallies to mark the iranian holiday in support of the 
palestinian cause 
television showed pictures of thousands of demonstrators 
excerpts of the speech also were carried by tehran radio 
god knows there is a solution if you announce today that from 
now on you will threaten american interests throughout the world 
rafsanjani said 
irna said rafsanjani also encouraged palestinians to hijack 
planes to force israel to release prisoners and to blow up 
factories in western countries 
rafsanjani criticized plo leader yasser arafat for renouncing 
terrorism and recognizing israels right to exist 
he also brushed aside western reaction to his support for 
violence 
now they will start saying that so and so as a man in charge 
and as the speaker of parliament has officially called for acts of 
terror but let them say it arent they saying it now 
soon after coming to power in the 1979 islamic revolution 
irans leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini set aside may 5 as quds 
day referring to the arabic name for jerusalem he has called on 
islamic nations to free jerusalem islams third holiest city after 
mecca and medina from israeli rule 
those who give 10 billion a year to preserve israel and know 
what they are doing is their blood worth anything rafsanjani 
said 
his remarks appeared to be a further deepening of the iranian 
campaign against the west launched feb 14 by khomeini with a 
death sentence against british author salman rushdie for his book 
the satanic verses 
khomeini said rushdie blasphemed islam in the book and used his 
condemnation as a platform to attack slackening revolutionary zeal 
in iran 
western reaction to the death sentence including 14 countries 
that called home their top envoys from tehran led khomeini and 
other iranian leaders to say ties with the west are unnecessary 
diplomatic relations with britain were severed 
rafsanjani was the leader of pragmatists seeking western help to 
rebuild after the ruinous war with iraq that ended in a ceasefire 
last year 
but his recent pronouncements have been harsh toward the west 
including his statement last month that a spy ring that included 
iranian naval officers giving military and other secrets to the 
united states had been broken

the robot probe magellan streaked 
across the solar system today at 25000 mph on its way to venus 
and the astronauts who launched the spacecraft turned to more 
routine tasks aboard atlantis 
deployment of the probe from the shuttles cargo bay thursday 
night signaled a revival of an american planetaryscience program 
that has been dormant since 1978 
the spacecraft is performing just beautifully all systems are 
operational and nominal it couldnt be better john gerpheide 
magellan project manager said a few hours after the probe was 
launched 
atlantis fiery blastoff thursday afternoon followed a 
cliffhanging 59minute wait that ground controllers and the five 
astronauts endured because of the fickle florida weather with just 
five minutes left in the shuttles launch window controllers found 
a hole in the clouds and atlantis thundered into the sky at 247 
pm edt 
about six hours after the liftoff magellan was gently ejected 
from the shuttles cargo bay and the 550million interplanetary 
mission began 
at last check all systems were working exceptionally well on 
magellan mission control commentator jeffrey carr said early 
today 
the space shuttle also was performing well carr said 
mission control awoke the crew today at about 920 am edt with 
a rousing rendition of the theme music from the movie superman 
goodmorning and congratulations on a super day yesterday 
mission control told the crew 
good morning houston commander david walker replied 
were up and around everybodys feeling good trying to find our 
toothbrushes 
we thank you for that fine wakeup music walker said 
during the rest of the mission the astronauts will try to 
photograph lightning systems at night and attempt to grow crystals 
of indium by melting and then resolidying the material 
the crew members also will take other photographs of the earth 
as well as test various systems on the orbiter another planned 
project includes taking saliva samples during the flight to 
determine how an antimotion sickness drug is absorbed by the body 
in zero gravity 
atlantis in orbit 184 miles above the earth is scheduled to 
land monday afternoon at edwards air force base calif 
it was really a wonderful day for us the beginning of the 
rebirth of the planetary program gerpheide said its the 
beginning of a really grand set of missions which will last for 
quite a few years 
while its too early to tell about the major portion of 
magellans mission were pleased its gone so well so far 
walker said when told magellan had been launched on its journey 
magellan was the first planetary craft deployed from a space 
shuttle 
the magellan is moving at a rate of 25000 mph relative to 
earth meaning it travels about 416 miles in just sixty seconds at 
its current rate magellan could get from washington dc to new 
york in a minute and could fly coasttocoast in about seven 
minutes 
but it will take the spacecraft 15 months to travel to venus 
the cloudshrouded planet that is 158 million miles away the probe 
will loop 1 times around the sun and travel 806 million miles 
before reaching its destination in august 1990 
once in orbit above venus magellan is to use its radar system 
to map up to 90 percent of the planets surface the 
highresolution radar is expected to produce images of objects as 
small as a football field 10 times the clarity of any previous 
pictures of venus 
venus where the surface temperature is 900 degrees has long 
intrigued scientists because it is close in size to the earth but 
so different in many other ways the sun rises in the west because 
venus rotates the opposite direction of earth and its rotation is 
so slow that a day there lasts 243 earth days 
magellan named for the 16thcentury portuguese explorer needed 
to be launched by may 28 or it would have had to wait two years for 
earth and venus to again be in a favorable alignment 
nasa had tried to launch atlantis last friday but a flaw 
detected in a fuel pump halted the liftoff engineers later found 
what appeared to be a leak in a hydrogen fuel line and both parts 
were replaced before thursdays launch 
crew members on the mission the 29th shuttle flight and the 
fourth since the challenger disaster are walker pilot ronald 
grabe and mission specialists norman thagard mary cleave and mark 
lee 
magellans mission marks the beginning of a new era in solar 
system exploration that has been dormant since 1978 when the 
pioneervenus spacecraft was launched 
in october another atlantis crew is to start the galileo probe 
on its way to jupiter the hubble space telescope is scheduled for 
launch from a shuttle early next year ulysses is to orbit the sun 
in october 1990 and the mars observer spacecraft will be dispatched 
in 1992 on an unmanned rocket

four fraternity members have been 
charged in connection with the mock kidnapping of a student from a 
university classroom that a professor said looked terrifyingly real 
one of the four james e pennoyer iii the president of the 
lambda chi alpha fraternity said today the charges were totally 
ridiculous 
the student taken from the university of rhode island classroom 
in december was a sorority member who was to be held until she 
could raise her weight in food to be distributed to the poor 
the four students surrendered to police and were arraigned 
thursday in district court on charges of assault with a device 
designed to be substantially similar in appearance to a firearm 
all were released on personal recognizance 
the felony charge carries a potential prison term of three to 10 
years upon conviction 
professor margaret haggerty said she brought the charges because 
the universitys discipline against the four was too light court 
documents indicate they were placed on a years probation by 
university officials in march 
according to the court records the four burst into a classroom 
dec 7 wearing bandanas and carrying replicas of uzi submachine 
guns and a fake handgun 
haggerty said the four were dressed like terrorists and she had 
no idea the incident was part of a fundraiser i said get out 
of this room get out of this classroom i was more or less in 
shock 
she said one masked invader pointed the handgun at her and 
pulled the trigger as they left 
the prank was inappropriate for the class which explores the 
impact of death on behavior haggerty said about 40 students were 
watching a film on medical ethics at the time of the mock 
kidnapping she said 
a lot of students take that course because they recently 
experienced death she said 
it was a philanthropic event and this is a miscarriage of 
justice said pennoyer 21 of east providence we didnt do a 
thing to her haggerty we came in and took a student who knew we 
were coming its totally ridiculous 
also charged were david m jones 20 of east providence 
antonio dasilva 23 of pawtucket and michael i miga 19 of 
warwick

venus may be a terrible place to 
live but scientists believe the planets torrid temperatures 
incredible pressures and sulfuric acid rain may be a great place to 
learn about the solar systems evolution 
a robot craft called magellan the first american space probe in 
11 years is on its way to survey venus for clues to the forces 
that molded all the inner planets orbiting the sun 
the 550 million craft will use a powerful radar imaging system 
to map venus surface where scientists believe the geologic 
history of the planet is imprinted by studying that history 
scientists hope to learn whats contained in the the missing 
chapters of solar system evolution 
lennard fisk nasas chief scientist said venus is known as the 
earths sister planet because it is about the same size as earth 
and close to the same distance from the sun in astronomical terms 
venus the second planet from the sun is 67 million miles away 
while earth the third planet is 93 million miles out 
despite the similarities venus has evolved into a 
substantially different object fisk said 
it has an atmosphere that is 90 times that of the earth it 
has a runaway greenhouse effect it has a surface temperature of 
900 degrees and it rains sulfuric acid fisk said it would be 
a terrible place to live 
the earth and venus along with mercury and mars are known as 
the inner planets because of their grouping nearer to the sun 
than the outer planets such as jupiter saturn and uranus 
the family of inner planets are all thought to have accreted or 
formed 45 billion years ago in the beginning its believed 
venus and earth were neartwins in size and character 
but while the earth went on to become a lovely gentle world 
thriving with life venus became a hellhole so hot that lead 
melts on its surface 
youve got to ask yourself why fisk said youve got to 
ask yourself if our own environment is that fragile with only 
small changes could earth evolve into a different place 
magellan may help answer some of those questions 
the spacecraft is scheduled to slip into venus orbit in august 
1990 and spend the following 243 days mapping the planets surface 
with the most sophisticated radar ever sent to deep space 
radar signals are able to penetrate the dense cloud cover that 
conceals venus from telescopes on earth radar views from magellan 
will be enhanced by nasa computers to give clear pictures of 
powerful geologic forces at work on venus 
all the data could help experts ponder a fundamental question 
is the earth like venus fated to one day become a barren 
lifeless world backing in superheat and bathed by acids 
scientists expect to find thousands of volcanoes rising from the 
baked venusian plains venus also has vast mountain ranges with 
peaks towering higher than the earths mount everest 
most scientists believe the runaway greenhouse effect on venus 
caused by its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide long ago caused 
all water on the planet to boil away 
the experts also will look for indications of continental drift 
the force that causes rock plates to inch about the globe over 
millions of years 
if there is evidence of volcanism and crustal drift on venus it 
will prove that the planet retains enough internal heat to melt 
rock the internal heat machine is what creates the lava for 
volcanoes and drives the movement of continents 
meteors crashing into the shallow surface crust of the planet 
are expected to have left craters in every sector of venus fisk 
said these scars will be of particular interest to experts the age 
of a solid planet or moon he said can be calculated by the number 
and distribution of craters 
knowing whether earth is a fluke or just one of the natural 
consequences of the evolution of a generic solar system will help 
answer such questions said laurence soderblom of the us 
geological survey in flagstaff ariz 
he said magellan also may help scientists deduce the 
probability youre going to find earthlike planets and life 
somewhere else in the universe

two west germans reportedly abducted in 
south lebanon reappeared early today but a palestinian guerrilla 
said kidnappers were holding a third in connection with the case of 
a lebanese hijacker on trial in west germany 
there was no immmediate confirmation a third west german was 
being held and west german television said the bonn government was 
skeptical anyone was seized 
we are still trying to find the facts said west german 
ambassador wolfgang gottelman in west germany foreign ministry 
spokesman hanns schumacher said the two west german relief workers 
who reappeared disappeared for a certain period of time and then 
suddenly reappeared last year as well 
the sunni moslem nasserite militia said in a statement that 
heinrich struebig and petra schnitzler were released at 5 am 10 
hours after being abducted and drove to their office between the 
palestinian refugee camps of ein elhilweh and mieh mieh near the 
southern port of sidon 
a palestinian guerrilla officer in charge of security at the 
base where the two work said the west germans told me that the 
kidnappers are keeping their colleague marcus michael in 
connection with the case of mohammed ali hamadi 
there were three when they left yesterday evening only two of 
them returned today said the palestinian 1st lt maarouf who 
uses only one name 
hamadi is a lebanese shiite moslem on trial in frankfurt west 
germany on murder and air piracy charges in the 1985 hijacking of 
a twa jetliner in which a us navy diver was killed 
neither struebig a 48yearold administrator nor ms 
schnitzler a 26yearold nurse would speak to reporters after 
their arrival in sidon they hid their faces from photographers 
the commander of the plos military police in sidon lt col 
wajih abu ali said this was because they feared for their 
colleague 
the released two told me they are scared because the 
kidnappers have threatened to kill their third colleague if they 
revealed any information about their abduction said abu ali 
maarouf did not say if any demands had been made 
maarouf said he saw struebig ms schnitzler and michael leave 
in a car together thursday 
abu ali said that based on his investigation five gunmen in a 
car intercepted the relief workers van on the southern edge of 
sidon late thursday forced them into the car and sped away 
toward the south 
abu ali said struebig and ms schnitzler were released in the 
zahrani area six miles south of sidon he said they jumped into a 
taxi that drove them to their base 
in sidon the two met for 10 minutes with mustafa saad who 
heads the sunni moslem nasserite militia which is dominant in 
sidon after that they were whisked out to waiting cars reporters 
and photographers were not allowed into saads residence to cover 
the meeting 
earlier the militias press officer who identified himself 
only as ghassan said his militia and the mainstream shiite moslem 
amal militia carried out nightlong efforts to locate the kidnap 
victims this cooperation led to their quick release 
the syrianbacked amal militia led by nabih berri controls 
most of south lebanon ghassan refused to identify the alleged 
kidnappers 
in west germany the ard television network said the government 
believes it peculiar that on april 6 1988 the same two people 
disappeared under similar circumstances and reappeared a short time 
later 
at that time steubig and ms schnitzler were thought to have 
been kidnapped and held two days but the humanitarian group for 
which they work asmahumanitas denied they were taken hostage 
it said a proiranian shiite group involved with their 
disappearance apologized to the two after discovering their 
identities and sheltered them to protect them from fighting in the 
area 
the federal government obviously has doubts whether the two 
actually were victims of a kidnapping ard said after schumacher 
the foreign ministry spokesman noted the 1988 incident schumacher 
also said the government had no information about michael 
abu ali said michael 25 arrived in lebanon eight days ago he 
also works for asmahumanitas which has six employees in south 
lebanon 
there are 15 foreigners held hostage in lebanon including nine 
americans the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped 
march 16 1985 
in january 1987 two west germans rudolf cordes and alfred 
schmidt were kidnapped in moslem west beirut in an effort to win 
freedom for hamadi who had been arrested in frankfurt a short time 
earlier 
both were eventually released a proiranian group holy 
warriors for freedom claimed responsibility for the abductions and 
said the releases were a good will gesture to win a lenient 
sentence for hamadi who faces life in prison 
hamadis elder brother abbas hamadi was convicted in west 
germany of those kidnappings

margaret thatchers conservative party today lost 
a parliamentary seat it has held for 38 years suffering a sharp 
rebuff as she marked her 10th anniversary as prime minister 
in a huge 125 percent swing against the government the 
socialist labor party captured the vale of glamorgan a largely 
rural welsh district with a 6028vote majority that overturned 
the conservatives 6251vote majority in 1987 general elections 
this is what the new modern labor party can do mrs 
thatchers days are numbered declared victor john smith who won 
a house of commons seat left vacant by the death of a lawmaker 
defeated conservative rod richards acknowledged votes were lost 
over mrs thatchers plans to overhaul property taxes and the 
national health service and to sell off the national water and 
electricity utilities 
we have to win that debate in the country and it will take 
time because were changing something quite radically and people 
are naturally concerned as to how it will affect them he said 
smith retorted my conservative opponent had to defend the 
indefensible this was a test of mrs thatchers 10 years in office 
and the people of the vale of glamorgan made it absolutely clear 
that shes not wanted 
health secretary kenneth clarke dismissed the result as a minor 
midterm setback 
labor also scored heavily off the two divided center parties 
whose support collapsed 
smith polled 23342 votes to the tories 17314 the centrist 
social and liberal democratic party took only 2017 and the social 
democractic party its previous electoral ally got 1098 the 
welsh nationalist party plaid cymru also did badly with 1672 votes 
the election of the 38yearold business studies lecturer shaved 
mrs thatchers majority in the 650member house of commons to 101 
still ample to assure passage of her ambitious reforms 
the conservatives have 375 seats labor 228 the social and 
liberal democrats 19 and the social democratic party 3 minority 
regional parties hold the rest 
it is only the fourth time in 25 years that labor has snatched a 
seat from the conservatives in a byelection 
the centrist parties acknowledged they paid heavily for their 
split after the last general election in 1987 and the rivalries 
that have become known as the muddle in the middle 
mrs thatcher who celebrated her 10th anniversary by declaring 
she had transformed britain faced more problems on the industrial 
front 
she swept to power on a wave of antiunion sentiment may 4 
1979 after a winter of strikes in which garbage piled up across 
the country hospitals turned away the sick and the dead were left 
unburied 
but now strikes over pay or conditions loom on the state 
railroad in the docks the engineering industry the electricity 
supply service the firefighting service the london subway and 
among news staff at the british broadcasting corp 
londons liberal newspaper the guardian predicted today britain 
is heading for its worst industrial strife since a yearlong coal 
miners strike collapsed in 1985 
some conservative legislators claim the unrest may be an 
organized campaign this is beginning to look like a 
conspiracy said tory legislator harry greenway 
the institute of directors an employers organization 
meanwhile reported that confidence in the british economy among 
company directors has fallen the last two months it said those 
listed as more optimistic dropped from 29 percent to 19 
percent while more than half said they were less optimistic

the government is investigating trading 
practices of more than 50 dealers at four new york commodities 
markets in criminal and civil probes that follow a similar 
crackdown in chicago 
the criminal investigation at the sprawling new york trading 
pits at the world trade center reportedly focuses on a firm whose 
president was cited for regulatory violations in 1985 
about 16 agents from the us postal inspection service and the 
commodity futures trading commission on thursday subpoenaed the 
commodity exchange the coffee sugar and cocoa exchange the new 
york cotton exchange and the new york mercantile exchange no 
arrests were made or arrest warrants issued 
the cftc a federal regulatory agency is seeking information 
about trading practices by firms and individuals in a civil 
investigation the exchanges said in statements 
the manhattan us attorneys office is leading another criminal 
probe that involved seizing documents from two offices of a single 
firm which sources identified as mbf clearing corp 
the firm is run by mark bradley fisher a comex member who paid 
60000 to settle trading practice violations with the cftc in 1985 
us postal service inspector jack ellis said document searches 
authorized in two warrants were conducted at two different 
offices of the same individual rooms 992 and 9926 at 4 world 
trade center 
the national futures association in chicago lists the address of 
mbf clearing as room 992 of 4 world trade center a building 
directory also lists the firms mbf trading and dollar index 
services as operating from the office 
traders said at least three silver futures traders from one 
company were called off the the floor of the commodity exchange 
while an independent trader was called from the new york mercantile 
exchange 
all the subpoenaed exchanges said they would cooperate with the 
cftc which can bring civil charges the new york futures exchange 
was not a target of the probe officials said 
mercantile exchange president rosemary t mcfadden said the cftc 
subpoenaed the exchange for information from the last two years on 
20 present or former nymex members 
we do not know what the scope of their investigation is at the 
present time nor specifically what they are targeting in on 
mcfadden said 
the commodity exchange said it was ordered to produce documents 
on about 27 past and present exchange members by may 17 while six 
individual traders were subpoenaed directly the coffee sugar and 
cocoa exchange and the new york cotton exchange said they were 
subpoenaed about an unspecified number of members 
the exchanges trade commodities from oil to frozen orange juice 
the commodities are bought and sold on a sprawling floor by 
traders shouting orders in chaotic pits which are monitored by 
officials from the cftc and the individual exchanges 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy dvt said 
cftc and exchange officials will testify before the committee on 
may 17 at a hearing on floor trading practices at the nations 
exchanges the agriculture committee oversees the cftc which is up 
for congressional reauthorization this year 
leahy said the committee has been reviewing trading practices at 
the new york and chicago exchanges since midjanuary and the new 
york investigation would be addressed at the hearing 
chicago us attorney anton valukas refused to comment on the 
new york probe but a source in his office who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said it was unrelated to the justice department 
investigations at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile 
exchange 
no indictments have been announced but as many as 200 subpoenas 
reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at the chicago 
exchanges 
the new york times today quoted unnamed government officials as 
saying the new york probe focused on a number of issues including 
socalled tax trades in such deals which can be illegal 
prearranged trades are executed to include false losses and defer 
income

the communist party in the republic of estonia 
removed 22 party leaders in a sweep that gives greater strength to 
reformers officials and estonian reporters said today 
the 22 dropped from the central committee included former party 
chief karl g vaino said estonian foreign ministry spokesman valle 
feldman 
the party leaders were removed during a meeting thursday of the 
120member central committee the sweep strengthens newer party 
leaders who generally are more progressive and tend to support 
sovereignty for the tiny baltic republic 
estonian peoples front leader marju lauristen who spoke at 
thursdays meeting accused some of the retiring members of 
involvement in the exile of tens of thousands of estonians in the 
1940s and 1950s an estonian reporter said 
lauristen said several of the former central committee members 
were big bosses who participated in the deportations estonian 
radio reporter sulev hallik said in a telephone interview 
feldman said the communist partys declining popularity was a 
factor in thursdays action a recent public opinion poll in 
estonia found that more than 50 percent of residents support the 
peoples front a grassroots nationalist group while only 7 
percent back the communist party he said 
the estonian communist party must now take radical steps and 
quickly work out a program if it wants to hold its own among 
other political groups that are flourishing in estonia feldman 
said 
the 22 were removed according to their own request in a move 
similar to the housecleaning last week in moscow that dropped 110 
former officials from the national communist partys leadership he 
said 
they were to a great degree responsible for the sad position 
were in now so of course they should take the consequences for 
it feldman said 
vaino who served as estonian communist party chief for almost a 
decade was replaced in june 1988 after months of criticism for 
inaction on pollution and corruption 
his replacement vaino i vyalyas is a reformer supported by 
the popular front yet he mildly criticized the group during 
thursdays meeting for seeking to return estonia to the past 
before the soviets occupied it in 1940 feldman said 
vyalyas attacked several of estonias newspapers for supporting 
the radical estonian national independence party which seeks 
estonian secession from the soviet union said eve parnaste a 
leader of that group 
feldman said vyalyas also criticized interdvizhenie a largely 
russian group that objects to rising nationalism and political 
reform

officials at seaarama marineworld are 
mourning the sudden death of a pacific black whale that arrived at 
the galveston marine park only a month ago 
although the precise cause of death has not been determined an 
autopsy on the 13foot whale revealed tumors throughout the 
carcass cheryl snyder a caretaker at seaarama said thursday 
the whale called nami was one of two such whales to arrive 
april 2 caretakers were making regular checks on wednesday when 
they noticed the whale was having difficulty swimming and 
breathing although trainers swam with the whale and tried to keep 
it breathing it died within about 10 minutes 
we were right there with her the whole time and we still dont 
know what happened ms snyder said 
it was just very emotional for all of us because it was so 
unexpected she had shown no sign at all of being ill earlier in 
the day 
the second whale called tanoshi appears to be healthy she 
says 
the two whales were among four captured in december by 
commercial fishermen in japan the two others went to a zoo in

service for conspiring to conceal illegal political contributions 
from defense contractors 
us district judge claude hilton also gave robert d barrett 
55 a suspended threeyear prison sentence and two years probation 
barrett pleaded guilty jan 27 to conspiring to defraud the 
federal election commission and to causing the filing of false fec 
reports that concealed two 1000 donations to former rep william 
chappell jr dfla 
barrett admitted to a complicated scheme to funnel the 
contributions to chappells reelection campaign from companies 
that along with unisys provided technical services to the 
pentagon 
chappell who died last month denied knowing that his campaign 
had received the illegal corporate donations he was not charged in 
the case 
assistant us attorney joseph aronica told the judge that 
barretts cooperation with the operation illwind probe of 
pentagon procurement fraud had resulted in the rapid movement of 
the investigation and has opened up other areas of investigation 
aronica noted that barretts cooperation led to several other 
guilty pleas by unisys officials the company sells computer 
equipment and fire control devices to the defense department 
defense attorney james bensfield noted that barretts two 
convictions were for charges that are usually prosecuted 
administratively by the fec 
were not talking about bribes here were not talking about 
the misuse of sensitive procurment information bensfield said 
the fraud investigation has resulted in several convictions of 
defense consultants and contractors charged with paying bribes to 
obtain inside information on pentagon procurement plans 
bensfield said barrett was carrying out the orders of his only 
boss in the corporation when he arranged to funnel the illegal 
campaign conributions to chappells reelection fund 
barrett told the judge i made the mistake of trying to be a 
good soldier ive learned a lot this last year ill never make 
the same mistake again

drew rave reviews as the songbook made its formal debut at an 
international gathering of church leaders 
i think they have a good blend of the old and the new said 
jackie chrismon of hope mills her husband pete chrismon pastor 
of hope mills united methodist church said the inclusion of 
worship guides would aid churchgoers 
it looks like the hymns are very singable said curt kollar 
a member of benson memorial united methodist church in raleigh i 
like the fact that they dropped all those amens at the end 
at a service of thanksgiving and consecration thursday 
night an overflow crowd at edenton street united methodist church 
broke the paper seals around the updated hymnals then sang a 
rousing rendition of o for a thousand tongues to sing by 
charles wesley brother of methodist founder john wesley 
this is more than a collection of hymns it is the book of 
worship for our denomination bishop rueben job chairman of the 
hymnal revision committee told the congregation 
the denominations general conference decided in 1984 to update 
the hymnal and agreed on a final version last year according to 
thomas mcanally spokesman for the united methodist church 
but what church leaders thought would be a quiet process erupted 
into spirited protests with the suggestion that onward christian 
soldiers be eliminated because of its militaristic lyrics the 
hymn without modification is in the new hymnal 
little did we realize when we started to do a hymnal that it 
would have any interest beyond the denomination said mcanally 
noting the national attention the debate has received 
among the new inclusions are andre crouchs to god be the 
glory and bill gaithers he touched me mcanally said 
carlton young the books editor has observed that people 
take their hymns very seriously and take their hymn books very 
personally said mcanally its in their memory banks and they 
connect events in their lives happy and unhappy with hymns they 
have sung 
efforts to update hymns with more contemporary language and to 
make male metaphors more genderinclusive also drew long debate 
mcannally said 
for example good christian men rejoice became good 
christian friends rejoice in the wesley hymn christ the lord 
is risen today the line sons of men and angels say now reads 
earth and heaven and chorus say 
raleigh was chosen for the hymnals debut because it is the site 
of this weeks council of bishops a meeting of 100 united 
methodist bishops from the united states europe africa and the 
philippines

oliver north was a credible witness and warm 
person says one of the jurors who voted to convict the former 
white house aide after days of deliberations often filled with 
bickering and arguing 
but the juror earl f williams 65 also seems torn over 
whether north facing up to 10 years imprisonment should spend 
time behind bars 
i believed him williams said thursday after the jury found 
north guilty of three of 12 counts against him no i dont think 
he should go to jail colonel north i dont know if hes all that 
bad or all that good he made some mistakes 
but interviewed today on abctvs good morning america 
williams first equivocated and then appeared to change his mind 
do you think he should go to jail williams was asked 
well whether he should go to jail or not is not my is not 
for me to say he replied 
pressed for his opinion however williams said well 
personally i feel that if hes guilty he should go to jail which 
he is so you know 
williams a former security guard who had served with gen 
george pattons 3rd army in world war ii said the jury did not 
agree on the guilty counts until thursday the 12th day of 
deliberations although some of the acquittals had been decided 
earlier 
the last charge to be decided was whether north altered and 
shredded government documents the district of columbia resident 
said he said the question was over whether north had criminal 
intent 
north was also convicted of obstructing congress and accepting 
an illegal gratuity 
the jury was split a while on some of the counts and in a 
case such as this there is a lot of bickering and arguing he 
said but with gods help we prayed a lot and made a decision 
williams said the nine female jurors were really set in their 
ways but after prayer a little consideration and friendly talking 
they came right in with us but he did not say in what direction 
anyone had to be persuaded 
still there were no dominant characters on the jury williams 
said we were all pretty strong it was touch and go at 
one time this person might be a little strong and another time that 
person might be a little strong 
other jurors were too exhausted and ready to return to their 
families to say much about the deliberations 
calling the verdict the hardest decision she ever had to make 
justine newell parrish a 39yearold washington resident said 
that i just want to be with my family 
im going to take my shower and catch the next flight out of 
here to jamaica said juror jean johnson a 53yearold cashier 
in the district 
the husband of juror gina lynch 37 a lab technician from 
washington is hoping that life for the couple and their three 
children will be back to normal in a few days 
frank lynch a mental health counselor said his wife went into 
seclusion but not before taking their three children out for 
seafood 
im glad things will be back to normal lynch said because 
the kids missed her

a unsponsored conference today 
called for financial aid possibly including a new international 
fund to help developing countries phase out chemicals that damage 
the earths protective ozone shield 
the compromise proposal for a world climate fund was adopted 
after private consultations among delegates of nine industrial and 
third world countries 
mostafa k tolba head of the un environment program 
adjourned the meeting thursday to break a deadlock whether to have 
such a fund 
this is the decision in principle that i wanted tolba told 
reporterswhat remains is more difficult to make it concrete 
industrial countries objected to demands to a fund that they 
said could be expensive to set up and administer third world 
countries wanted to ensure that assistance would not be drawn from 
existing aid programs 
earlier the conference called for a worldwide ban by the year 
2000 on chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs which are used in 
refrigeration some plastics and insulation 
cfcs break down the ozone layer high above the earth that 
filters out ultraviolet radiation from the sun increasing the risk 
of skin cancer and eye disease 
the delegates agreed that developing countries needed assistance 
to replace the technologies and equipment they inherited from the 
industrial countries 
scientists said the threat of ozone depletion can be averted 
only if cfc emissions are stopped altogether 
the adopted resolution said the conference recognizes the 
urgent need to establish international financial and other 
mechanisms to help developing countries 
it set up an openended working group to develop modalities 
for such mechanisms that do not exclude the possibility of an 
international fund 
the working group is to report next year to a second followup 
conference of the 1987 montreal protocol which was the first 
treaty to establish controls on the production and use of cfcs 
us delegation leader eileen claussen said she is satisfied 
with the funding resolution which she said filled the obvious 
need for some financing on an international level 
the paper is fine said ms claussen deputy director of the 
environmental protection agency it was a good mood in the 
working group after all were all in this together trying to do 
the same thing 
finlands environment minister kaj barlund who championed the 
idea of a world climate fund said the resolution was close to 
what we wanted 
but he acknowledged that the vague wording may make it difficult 
to get the fund working 
the compromise was worked out among delegation heads from the 
united states soviet union japan mexico china senegal tobago 
malaysia and new zealand

a senior cabinet minister said 
today the government wants to bring the black majority into 
parliament and the executive branch but only if the white minority 
cannot be overruled 
security for the countrys 5 million whites can be ensured 
only in an environment of progress safety and justice for all 
the people of south africa constitutional development minister 
chris heunis said in a speech to parliament 
south africas 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs and no representation in parliament or the cabinet 
heunis speech was a relatively comprehensive summary of various 
proposals he and other government officials have mentioned in 
recent months heunis said details of a new constitutional system 
would have to be negotiated and thus he offered few specifics 
about the new role envisioned for blacks 
thus far no prominent black leaders have accepted the 
governments invitation to participate in constitutional 
negotiations militant blacks have rejected heunis plans while 
some moderate blacks have indicated they would negotiate if the 
government freed imprisoned black leaders such as nelson mandela 
and lifted bans on black opposition groups 
speculation the government may free mandela after general 
elections on sept 6 increased today when mandela was visited at a 
prison farm near cape town by harry gwala a terminally ill 
colleague freed from jail in november 
gwala who is suffering from a neurological disease refused to 
say who initiated the meeting both men are 70 and have been 
members of the african national congress since the 1940s until 
gwalas release both were serving life sentences for involvement 
with the outlawed guerrilla movement 
previous attempts to free mandela have been blocked by the 
nationalist leaders refusal to renounce violence in the fight for 
majority rule 
in parliament heunis rejected charges the governments 
proposals are vague and insincere 
everyone has to become participants in legislative executive 
and judicial institutions because fairness demands it and also 
because this will ensure progress safety and justice for the white 
man he said 
he said the governing national party wants a south africa in 
which the grievances of the past were dead and buried and in which 
all people could walk tall 
referring to policies which divide south africans by race 
heunis said the government remains committed to the protection of 
those groups wanting to be recognized as groups but he indicated 
the government is willing to negotiate possible changes in laws 
mandating racial classification 
government policies implied that all the political entities 
in south africa could have a role in electing a head of state 
serving on the cabinet and serving in parliament but he said the 
national party seeks a system in which numbers would not play a 
decisive role

the chief judge in the trial of 
twa hijacker mohammed ali hamadi said today the proceedings will 
not be influenced by the reported kidnapping of west germans in 
lebanon 
a palestinian guerrilla officer in south lebanon said three west 
german relief workers were seized in connection with the hamadi 
case he said two were freed today but that the third was still 
held 
there was no confirmation of the report 
it has already been said several times that the work of the 
court cannot be influenced by such events chief judge heiner 
mueckenberger said in a brief telephone interview 
hamadi is on trial in frankfurt in connection with the hijacking 
of twa flight 847 on june 14 1985 us navy diver robert stethem 
was killed and 39 americans were held hostage for 17 days hamadi 
admitted taking part in the kidnapping but denies killing stethem 
prosecutors have urged a murder conviction and life sentence 
and the judge has said a verdict could come this month 
shortly after hamadis arrest in january 1987 two west germans 
were seized in lebanon a proiranian group holy warriors for 
freedom claimed responsibility for the abductions and said their 
eventual releases were a goodwill gesture to win a lenient 
sentence for hamadi 
hamadis elder brother abbas was convicted in west germany of 
those kidnappings 
mueckenberger said he was not familiar with all the details of 
the latest incident in lebanon which apparently began thursday 
evening 
the sunni moslem nasserite militia in lebanon said heinrich 
struebig and petra schnitzler were released at 5 am today 1st 
lt maarouf a palestinian guerrilla officer in charge of security 
at the base where the two work said the west germans told me 
that the kidnappers are keeping their colleague marcus michael 
in connection with the case of mohammed ali hamadi 
a foreign ministry spokesman hanns schumacher said only that 
the trial could lead to a threat against germans that is clear 
but everything else is pure speculation 
he noted that struebig and ms schnitzler disappeared for a 
certain period of time and then suddenly reappeared in april 
1988 he said the government had no information about michael 
his comments prompted the ard television network to comment in 
its 1 pm newscast the federal government obviously has doubts 
whether the two actually were victims of a kidnapping 
ard claimed the government believes it is peculiar that in 
1988 the pair disappeared under similar circumstances and 
reappeared a short time later 
in 1988 steubig and ms schnitzler were thought to have been 
kidnapped and held two days but the humanitarian group for which 
they work asmahumanitas denied they were taken hostage 
it said a proiranian shiite group involved with their 
disappearance apologized after discovering their identities and 
sheltered them to protect them from fighting in the area 
another foreign ministry spokesman rainer mueller said 
officials had warned asmahumanitas workers many times about the 
dangers of working in lebanon 
there are 15 foreigners held hostage there including nine 
americans the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 
16 1985

a couple are anxiously awaiting 
the results of genetic tests to determine if a new york man who 
claims he was abducted when he was a child is their son 
joe and marjean hagans 3yearold son jonathan wandered away 
from them at jacksonville beach on june 11 1968 police speculated 
the boy had stumbled onto a nearby boat ramp or slipped into the 
ocean and drowned 
no trace of the boy was found 
mrs hagans however said she never believed her son was dead 
and launched her own search 
four months ago the couple contacted the florida department of 
law enforcement and asked that the investigation be reopened 
the state referred the case to jacksonville beach police chief 
paul brown who agreed as a courtesy basically to get the 
information on the national computer again brown as a young 
police sergeant had investigated the boys disappearnce in 1968 
meanwhile david bonnabel of buffalo ny was pursuing his 
belief that he was abducted as a toddler and raised in isolation by 
a widow who lived in a camper somewhere near lafayette la he said 
he was abused and kept from attending school 
bonnabel said he ran away when he was 15 and supported himself 
by working odd jobs he now runs an interior decorating business 
and has invested thousands of dollars trying to locate his family 
at the same time the hagans got the case of their son reopened 
in florida an associate of bonnabel was checking with florida 
authorities for records of disappearances similar to bonnabels 
account 
an investigator who worked with bonnabel saw similarities in his 
case and jonathan hagans disappearance and passed the information 
on to him 
mrs hagans said she was overwhelmed when she met bonnabel 
i want to smother him with love im a mother and i guess i 
want to pile up all those years and just put them together she 
said 
but bonnabel added about the genetics tests being run by the 
fbi we wont be sure for two to six weeks we want to keep a low 
profile

abbie hoffman gave away hundreds of 
thousands of dollars during his lifetime but left an estate worth 
only about 2000 according to his attorney 
its not that he didnt take in a lot of money its just that 
he didnt keep it gerald lefcourt said thursday 
hoffman 52 who committed suicide april 12 in his apartment 
near new hope named johanna lawrenson as sole beneficiary in his 
will which was filed wednesday in bucks county 
ms lawrenson and hoffman had lived together for several years 
the 1983 will was accompanied by a death certificate listing his 
full name as abbott howard hoffman and his selfdescribed 
occupation as jewish road warrior 
he left instructions in the will for ms lawrenson to choose a 
final resting place for his ashes and said disposal shall be as 
inexpensive as possible 
hoffman had several hundred dollars in the bank a small 
retirement account and personal effects of an undetermined value 
lefcourt said a 10000 bank loan was covered by an insurance 
policy 
the 2000 figure is just an approximate value of his 
estate lefcourt said im not sure if its realistic 
hoffman gave away hundreds of thousands of dollars maybe 
millions he had earned through his books magazine articles and 
speaking engagements lefcourt said 
in 1970 hoffman received a check for about 40000 after

a 60yearold socialist woman could become japans 
prime minister an event that would turn this conservative 
maledominated country on its ear 
takako doi a veteran of 20 years in parliament is chairwoman 
of the japan socialist party the largest opposition party she is 
pressing oppositions case now that the governing liberal 
democratic party is mired in scandal 
the former law professor has not directly expressed an ambition 
to be prime minister but she would probably have the first shot if 
the liberal democrats fail badly in a general election and the 
socialists win more seats than the other smaller parties 
prime minister noboru takeshita said april 25 that he will step 
down soon to take responsibility for a loss of public trust because 
of an influencepeddling scandal his conservative party in power 
since it was formed in 1955 has yet to decide on a successor and 
many party leaders are ruled out because of their links to the 
scandal 
the liberal democrats are expected to put forward a 
secondranking figure as a sort of interim prime minister and try 
to regain the publics trust before a general election that would 
give the socialists a chance to oust the longgoverning party 
this is a golden opportunity for opposition parties to take 
over the governing power from the hands of the liberal democratic 
party ms doi told reporters this week 
if we fail to take advantage of this situation we may as well 
remain minority oppositionists eternally 
the liberal democrats have ignored her calls to let the 
opposition form a minority government in the diet or parliament 
so the only alternative for the socialists is to prevent the ruling 
party from winning the next election for the lower house where the 
liberal democrats hold 297 of the 512 seats 
a lower house election must be held by next summer but before 
then the electorate will vote this summer for half the seats in the 
upper house where the liberal democrats hold 143 of the 252 seats 
analysts question whether the opposition has much of a chance 
given its lack of unity the opposition includes the socialist 
party 85 lower house seats buddhistbased komeito 56 seats 
democratic socialists 29 seats marxistleninist commmunists 27 
seats and a scattering of independents 
but analysts agree that it is a onceinalifetime opportunity 
for ms doi and the socialists who havent tasted power since a 
few months in the late 1940s 
in 1986 ms doi became the first woman to head a political 
party in japan her predecessor resigned over the socialists 
election defeat to the popular former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone 
ms doi is one of only 27 women against 737 men in both houses 
and her voice often is heard at public events she also appears on 
television shows not only to debate politics but to take part in 
game programs she is from kobe where her father was a doctor 
she is a regular in the parliamentarians annual singing 
contest performing the japanese version of my way and she 
claims expertise in pachinko the equivalent of western pinball 
generally associated with students and working class people 
analysts say ms doi a former professor of law at doshisha 
university in kyoto helped the socialists dramatically improve 
their dry image of a bluecollar party heavily dependent on labor 
unions 
now the party has a wider range of support from womens 
organizations most of which had primarily supported the 
communists as well as from environmental civil rights and peace 
groups 
among disagreements between opposition parties is defense the 
socialists call for japan to become a neutral and unarmed nation by 
shifting the usjapan security treaty into more of a friendship 
treaty with no military provisions the two middleoftheroad 
parties komeito and democratic socialists insist the security 
treaty is indispensable

britain expelled three south african diplomats 
today because of their countrys reputed role in a plot to sell 
arms to northern ireland extremists in exchange for britishmade 
missile parts 
the foreign office said undersecretary patrick wright summoned 
south african ambassador rae killen and told him the three must 
leave the country within a week 
we noted their expression of regret a statement quoted 
wright as telling killen however the south african government 
should be under no illusions about the grave concern with which her 
majestys government viewed the involvement by south african 
officials in this affair 
because of the gravity of this affair her majestys 
government has decided that the south african government should be 
requested to withdraw three members of the south african embassy 
the statement said 
the move came two weeks after authorities in paris arrested a 
south african diplomat an american arms dealer and three members 
of an extreme protestant organization in northern ireland 
the northern irelanders allegedly were handing over parts of a 
blowpipe a sophisticated shoulderfired antiaircraft missile 
manufactured in belfast 
the british government expressed grave concern over allegations 
the south africans were supplying weapons to the protestants in 
exchange for the missile parts 
the south african identified by french sources as daniel storm 
was released after he claimed diplomatic immunity a week later 
the french government expelled three south african officials 
implicated in the affair 
the foreign office spokesman said the three who were requested 
to withdraw are first secretary for information jan hp 
castelyn counselor jonathan fourie and staff sgt mark brunner 
who works for the defense attaches office the statement contained 
no hint that they were involved in the alleged plot 
during the 15minute meeting wright said we had considered 
carefully the south african response particularly a statement by 
gen magnus malan south africas defense minister to his 
countrys parliment on may 3 
at that time malan said an official inquiry into the affair had 
shown that storm had acted without government approval he said he 
regretted the embarrassment caused to the british french and irish 
governments and would act to ensure it would not happen again 
but he also acknowledged on april 24 that south africa sometimes 
uses unconventional methods to get around an international arms 
embargo against his country 
the irish government which has no diplomatic relations with 
pretoria delivered a formal protest to south africa 
according to the foreign office statement wright noted that 
south africa is under a united nations arms embargo and pointed to 
the security situation in northern ireland where the lives of 
innocent people are at risk 
he also warned the south africans that any retaliation would 
be entirely unjustified 
the roman catholic irish republican army is fighting to push the 
british out of protestantdominated northern ireland join it with 
the republic of ireland and set up an allireland socialist state 
protestant radicals are fighting the ira effort 
the three irishmen and one american douglas bernhart arrested 
with storm were being held on gunrunning and conspiracy charges 
on april 25 federal prosecutors in bern switzerland opened an 
inquiry into possible swiss connections into the affair saying 
bernhart had an office in geneva 
in belfast security sources said one of the three arrested was 
a warrants officer in the territorial army a volunteer reserve 
force as a noncommissioned officer samuel quinn 42 was thought 
to have instructed territorial army officers in the use of the 
blowpipe 
the other protestants were not named

blasting prosecutors and vowing to fight 
hard for as long as it takes oliver north says his conviction 
on three felonies in the irancontra affair will eventually be 
overturned 
the first person to go on trial in the scandal that rocked the 
last two years of the reagan administration north lost his 
23100ayear marine pension as soon as the jury delivered its 
verdict thursday 
expresident reagan who successfully resisted a defense 
subpoena to testify at the trial declined to comment after the man 
he once called a national hero was found guilty 
north was acquitted of nine of the 12 criminal charges against 
him and prosecutor john keker appeared less than satisfied with the 
decision 
still keker said colonel north has been convicted of three 
very serious charges the jury has spoken north called it a 
partial vindication 
north to be sentenced june 23 by us district judge gerhard a 
gesell faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and 750000 in 
fines as a firsttime offender with an exemplary 20year military 
career north almost certainly will get penalties far less severe 
than that court appeals could take years 
the national security councils former action officer on 
central america counterattacked less than two hours after walking 
out of the federal courthouse he defiantly criticized the cost of 
pursuing him through the legal system and suggested the prosecution 
had overstepped the bounds of fairness 
after more than two and a half years and over 40 million of 
our taxpayers money spent on investigations congressional 
inquisitions and now a special prosecutor who has likened me to 
adolf hitler we now face many months and perhaps years of fighting 
the remaining charges north said reading from a statement 
as a marine i was taught to fight and fight hard for as long 
as it takes to prevail he added we will continue this battle 
and with the support and prayers of the american people we will be 
fully vindicated 
in closing arguments last month keker said north and his former 
boss national security adviser robert mcfarlane are following 
adolf hitlers old strategy the victor will never be asked if he 
told the truth 
north got an endorsement of sorts from one of the jurors 
65yearold earl williams who served in pattons 3rd army in world 
war ii 
he made some mistakes you know but i dont think he should 
go to jail for it a hero like he was williams told cbs news 
following deliberations that totaled 64 hours over 12 days 
williams had an apparent change of heart overnight however in 
an interview today on abcs good morning america he said of 
north well personally i feel that if hes guilty he should go 
to jail which he is so you know 
north wont get his military pension back unless his conviction 
for altering and shredding sensitive nsc documents is overturned on 
appeal 
once the conviction goes into effect whatever time that is 
he loses his retired pay said pentagon spokeswoman linda 
dumoulin the conviction is legally effective as soon as the 
secretary of the navy is formally notified and the paperwork 
completed 
for north intensely proud of his marine career the pain of 
that punishment is likely to be more in its symbolism than its 
financial cost conservative groups have been willing to pay him as 
much as 20000 in speaking fees for a single appearance and just 
a few hours after his conviction two more speaking engagements 
were announced in cleveland for may 11 
in seeking to overturn the convictions norths lawyers will 
first file posttrial motions with gesell on the question of 
whether norths case was tainted by his and other witnesses 
nationally televised immunized congressional testimony in 1987 
that could mean delving further into the knowledge of jurors the 
grand jurors who indicted north and prosecutors in the office of 
independent counsel lawrence walsh gesell set a deadline of 10 
days for the defense to announce its intentions 
north was found innocent of charges that focused on lying and 
obstructing congress in 1985 and 1986 by denying he was assisting 
the contras at the time his superiors had passed along an order 
from reagan to see to the needs of the rebels and to do so 
secretly during a congressional ban on military aid according to 
trial testimony 
but north was found guilty of aiding and abetting an obstruction 
of congress as well as shredding and altering documents in november 
1986 crimes that occurred after the iran arms sales had been 
publicly disclosed north also was found guilty of accepting a 
13800 home security system in mid1986 from irancontra 
codefendant richard secord whom north had enlisted to run arms to 
the contras 
president bush used the occasion of the verdict to speak out on 
a major question raised by evidence in the trial whether as vice 
president he helped circumvent the ban on us aid to the contras 
bush who previously had declined to comment because of the 
ongoing trial proceedings declared thursday that he never told 
honduras president that us aid would be linked to that countrys 
support for the nicaraguan rebels 
bush declared firmly that there was no deal no quid pro quo 
some conservatives meanwhile clamored for a presidential 
pardon of north richard a viguerie chairman of the united 
conservative union declared that oliver north deserves a medal 
not a prison sentence 
but on capitol hill conservative sen gordon humphrey rnh 
opposed a pardon saying the man was indicted and the jury 
decided that the facts upheld three of the indictments its 
obviously a tragedy for him and his family but no one is above the 
law

vigil trustees voted to close the college june 30 1990 
in middlebury vt several hundred students protested tuition 
increases at middlebury college but the schools president said 
the demonstration was unlikely to stop plans to increase tuition to 
19000 a year from 17000 this year 
students carried placards and chanted slogans on thursday to 
protest the increase which includes tuition room and board 
this is not just a middlebury college problem said david 
milner a junior and one of the protest organizers he said 
students at other private schools are facing average 7 percent 
increases

administration and staff that would advise the president on budget 
matters

campuses in the system gov mario cuomo vetoed tuition hikes 
earlier this week but did not boost funding and school officials 
warn as many as 350 positions could be cut

top us officials had highly reliable 
intelligence throughout 1986 about the exorbitant prices oliver 
north and richard secord were charging for arms sold to iran 
according to a document released today as the result of a lawsuit 
filed by 10 news organizations 
the newly declassified threepage stipulation summarizing the 
intelligence was released in censored form under an agreement 
reached between the justice department and the associated press 
along with nine other news organizations 
the intelligence provides information regarding the 
pricing and delivery of missiles and military material sold to iran 
and the release of american hostages held in lebanon says the 
stipulation 
stillclassified reports on the intelligence were gathered by 
various methods of surveillance and show individuals 
involved including general secord the stipulation adds the 
reports contained information about pricing of this material and 
those recipients of the reports at the central intelligence agency 
national security council and department of defense who knew the 
actual cost of this material to the dod could have known the 
iranians were being significantly overcharged 
north enlisted secord to run arms to the contras and also had 
the former air force major general turned businessman assist arms 
shipments to iran for the reagan administration 
north and secord diverted profits from the iran arms sales into 
bank accounts controlled by secord and some of the diverted money 
was funneled to the contras for their fight to oust the sandinista 
government in nicaragua 
the intelligence reports on which the stipulation is based 
generally range from two to several pages and are in 
chronological order commencing on september 1985 and ending in 
december 1986 the newly released document says 
the intelligence reports were sent to 17 people the stipulation 
says including secretary of defense caspar weinberger cia 
director william casey and national security advisers robert 
mcfarlane and john poindexter 
the news organizations went to court april 21 seeking disclosure 
of the stipulation which was given to the north jury during 
deliberations but not released to the public 
the stipulation underscores testimony at norths trial that top 
administration officials were given information about the prices of 
weapons being sold to iran marine lt col robert earl testified 
that in computing a markup on one proposed shipment in the spring 
of 1986 he multiplied the cost of military spare parts by a factor 
of 37 earl was an aide to north on the national security council 
the national security agency had insisted that the uncensored 
version of the stipulation submitted to the north jury be kept out 
of the public record the highly secretive agency gathers 
intelligence through a worldwide communications network 
us district judge gerhard a gesell rejected the news medias 
motion to release the stipulation saying the document was 
classified today gesell signed an order authorizing the justice 
department to release the censored version 
the sanitized version of the stipulation deletes solely 
information that would disclose methods of intelligence 
collection according to a joint court filing by lawyers for the 
news organizations and the justice department the deleted 
information also includes data as to the precise time at which 
information was received 
it does not delete the names or titles of any government 
officials who received the information and whose names already have 
been released in the public record said the court filing 
norths lawyers referred to the stipulation in closing arguments 
at his trial to show that casey and poindexter knew that hawk 
missiles were aboard a november 1985 shipment from israel to iran 
assisted by the cia north was found guilty thursday of aiding and 
abetting the preparation of a false chronology for congress stating 
that no one in the government knew until january 1986 that hawk 
missiles were aboard the november 1985 shipment the conviction 
also covers shredding of documents in connection with the 
chronology norths defense on the charge was that casey and 
poindexter knew at the time what was in the shipment but arranged 
to cover up that fact from congress 
the other media organizations involved were cable news network

chinas leaders responded to massive 
prodemocracy student demonstrations with conciliatory speeches 
acknowledging protesters grievances and promising further 
dialogue state media reported friday 
exhausted university students began returning to classrooms 
friday after staging several marches during a twoweek school 
boycott and campus activists plotted their next steps for the 
fledgling democracy movement 
official newspapers prominently displayed a speech by communist 
party chief zhao ziyang that he delivered thursday when tens of 
thousands of students occupied tiananmen square to demand freedom 
and honest government 
zhao called for talks with the students although he did not 
promise any meetings with representatives of the prodemocracy 
movement premier li peng in a speech friday also said the 
dialogue between the government and the students will continue 
he did not elaborate 
while li expressed disapproval of some actions of some 
students he said many of their demands were in line with 
government aims such as bringing an end to corruption the 
official xinhua news agency reported 
zhao said the protesters absolutely dont want to oppose our 
basic system but demand that we fix maladies in our work 
he also seemed to tone down earlier official claims that 
students were being manipulated by people and wanted to see the 
country in turmoil he said such people were unavoidable but few in 
number and said vigilance against them must be maintained i 
think the vast majority of students understand this 
one student leader at beijing normal college acknowledged the 
softening of the authorities attitude but claimed zhao was taking 
a page from traditional chinese shadow boxing by turning 
flexibility into strength 
the state media friday also gave their fullest accounts yet of 
any student protest since the prodemocracy movement began april 
15 several newspapers quoted onlookers as saying they supported 
the marchers they used stories filed by their reporters instead of 
xinhua which has provided only skimpy and understated coverage of 
the student movement 
press freedom has been a major demand pushed by the students 
and among the demonstrators thursday were scores of journalists who 
voiced support for a media free from official control 
after a nearly twoweek boycott by students at beijing 
universities students returned to class friday others weary from 
successive marches said they would wait until next week 
a poster put up by the new student union at peoples university 
said our efforts of half a month or not wasted our class 
boycott had definite results returning to class does not mean we 
have ceased our diligence for democracy and for a dialogue with 
the government 
the union said it chose to end the boycott to seek a form of 
dialogue that is reasonable and practicle and acceptable to both 
sides 
xinhua reported more than half the capitals university students 
returned to class friday 
opposition to ending the boycott surfaced at beijing university 
where activists hesitated to order students back to class and a few 
wall posters appeared urging the strike to continue 
i think we should boycott a while longer said an economics 
student if we go back to class now then theres no pressure on 
the government and it wont recognize our independent union 
but there were indications democracy movement leaders were 
turning to new activities in their young campaign at peoples 
university the new student group put up a poster requesting the 
return of bullhorns issued for the demonstrations 
hard at work in a fourthfloor beijing normal dormitory room was 
a student activist reviewing possible new directions for the 
movement to take such as setting up an independent newspaper 
forming culture circles to hear prominent speakers conducting 
surveys and studying the chinese constitution 
we still have plenty of work to do he said 
the student movement began after the death april 15 of hu 
yaobang a reformer who lost his job as party chairman in 1987 when 
he failed to suppress prodemocracy student demonstrations 
about 100000 people mostly students occupied tiananmen square 
on thursday after a march through the capitals streets to mark the 
70th anniversary of chinas first student movement and give 
momentum to the current wave of prodemocracy activity 
students participating in that protest and a similar 
demonstration a week earlier were eagerly supported by tens of 
thousands of workers who cheered the marchers and donated money to 
the cause

president bush has not discussed the question 
of whether to pardon oliver north bushs spokesman said today a 
day after the former white house aide was convicted on felony 
counts in connection with the irancontra case 
he said i havent discussed it with anybody white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters recounting the 
presidents reply when fitzwater asked him about a pardon on 
thursday 
fitzwater refused any further comment on the north verdict or 
trial documents that appeared to indicate bush was involved in a 
reagan administration plan to make a quid pro quo arrangement with 
honduras in return for its assistance to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
fitzwater said the appropriate congressional committees would be 
briefed on confidential cables that described bushs activities in 
that regard 
bush said thursday he never told honduras president that us 
aid would be linked to that countrys support for the nicaraguan 
rebels and he dared skeptics to prove him wrong 
confronting a pivotal irancontra question headon thursday 
bush declared firmly there was no deal no quid pro quo 
bush who had refused to address the issue for weeks did so 
moments before a federal jury announced it had convicted former 
white house aide oliver north on three of 12 charges relating to 
the armsandmoney affair 
the president cited the ongoing north trial recently in refusing 
to talk about suggestions he played an intermediarys role as vice 
president in a purported reagan administration plan to tie american 
assistance to the willingness of latin american countries to help 
the contras 
but on thursday he was eager to take the question 
speaking of a meeting he had with thenhonduran president 
roberto suazo in early 1985 bush said the records of the 
meeting demonstrate there was no quid pro quo 
the word of the president of the united states george bush 
is there was no quid pro quo no implication no quid pro quo 
direct or indirect from me to the president of honduras on that 
visit 
and for those who suggest there was the onus is on them 
thank you for asking that question 
neither bush nor white house aides would say whether he might 
grant north a pardon nor would the white house comment on the 
verdict 
bush said on april 24 that he had not talked with anyone about 
whether he would pardon north and said any suggestions about what 
he would do were stupid and idiotic in the past he had 
called north a hero and said he hoped the former marine officer 
would be acquitted 
the question of bushs role in a possible reagan administration 
deal with honduras was raised in documents presented at the north 
trial the documents placed him at a meeting with suazo in honduras 
at a time when internal reagan administration memos suggested a 
plan in which continuing us aid to latin american countries would 
be linked to assistance for the rebels 
the government admitted for purposes of this trial the facts 
in a main document the 42page stipulation introduced at the 
trial although a state department official subsquently said it 
presented a distorted picture of us policy and actions in 1985 
and 1986 the us government was barred from directly or 
indirectly aiding the rebels during that time 
the document never asserted that bush discussed a quid pro quo 
arrangement with suazo but it said he explained to the hondurans 
that they were to receive a great deal more us economic and other 
aid aid that the document said was part of a deal approved by 
thenpresident reagan 
bush complained that there has been much needless mindless 
speculation about my word of honor and ive answered it now 
definitively 
bush had said last week that he had had no discussions with 
anyone about a possible pardon for north on thursday deputy press 
secretary stephen hart said only we wont have any comment on 
norths conviction 
last year bush called north a national hero but later 
refined that to say he was alluding to norths record of heroism in 
military combat 
bush said in the aftermath of the north trial he would insist 
that the congressional committees be briefed thoroughly on the 
confidential cables describing the meeting with suazo 
white house press secretary fitzwater said that bush is willing 
to have members of congressional committees briefed by state 
department officials regarding any questions they might have about 
the suazo meeting 
he said bush would not submit to questions from lawmakers 
although he reiterated that the white house position is to help 
in any way we can

the state has approved a privately funded 
historical marker to be erected near the site of the 1964 murders 
of three civil rights workers whose deaths were depicted in the 
movie mississippi burning 
herb anderson program director at wkxiam a blackoriented 
station in jackson launched efforts in february to raise money for 
the marker the station so far has raised about 1000 
elbert r hilliard executive director of the state department 
of archives and history confirmed in a letter received by the 
station friday that the marker had been approved but he said no 
decision had been made on the location the ideal spot would be 
along a state highway hilliard said 
anderson said the marker may be located along mississippi 21 
near the earthen dam where the bodies of the three men were found 
archives officials have said that no state historical marker was 
erected because public money has not been appropriated for such 
markers since 1980 hilliard had said that private groups may 
purchase state historical markers for 925 but the department must 
approve the marker and the text on them 
it is certainly fitting that historic sites in mississippi can 
be designated with appropriate markers so that mississippis 
citizens and outofstate visitors can study and enjoy the 
interesting heritage of our state hilliard said in his letter to 
anderson 
anderson began his fundraising drive about the time 
mississippi burning was first shown in the state 
the movie is a fictionalized account of the federal 
investigation of the murders of andrew goodman james earl chaney 
and michael schwerner in neshoba county in 1964 their bodies were 
found near the town of philadelphia six weeks after their deaths on 
june 21 1964

president bush and west german chancellor 
helmut kohl today discussed by telephone the rift in nato over 
eastwest negotiations on shortrange missiles but the united 
states remains firmly opposed to such talks bushs spokesman said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the phone 
conversation initiated by kohl lasted for about 20 minutes 
he declined to characterize the substance of the conversation 
but said bush has not changed his opposition to early talks with 
the soviets on eliminating battlefield nuclear weapons from western 
europe 
we still believe early talks would be a mistake fitzwater 
said discussions that would lead to a denuclearization of 
europe would not be welcome 
kohl responding to public opinion in west germany where the 
presence of the american nuclear weapons is being strongly 
challenged has called for such talks with the soviets 
the issue threatens to disrupt a north atlantic treaty 
organization summit late this month 
i want the nato meeting to be a success bush said thursday 
after meeting with canadian prime minister brian mulroney and 
one way you guarantee success is not to go out and finetune nuance 
differences that may exist between various staunch allies 
today fitzwater accused the soviets of assiduously seeking 
to drive a wedge among nato allies over elimination of the 
shortrange missiles 
he said kohl called because he wanted to be sure he understood 
president bushs position 
asked whether the united states and west germany were any closer 
to smoothing over their differences on the issue as a result of the 
phone call between the two leaders the spokesman said i would 
not characterize it as moving the situation one way or the other 
on thursday bush had voiced the administrations willingness to 
negotiate with other nato allies on the dispute 
but he added were not going to go for any third zero the 
elimination of the shortrange weapons or getting snf another 
term for the weapons out of whack in terms of negotiations so 
lets get clear on that 
asked today at what point the president might be willing to 
enter into such negotiations fitzwater replied its impossible 
to define that point 
instead of curbing nuclear weapons bush said thursday nato 
should put its emphasis on trying to get the soviet union to reduce 
its overwhelming superiority in conventional weapons 
resolving the nato dispute should be done privately among 
members of the 16member alliance bush said 
the disagreement has clouded an upcoming may 2930 nato summit 
called to celebrate the alliances 40th anniversary 
referring to his guest bush praised mulroney for giving him 
constructive suggestions on the matter 
the canadian leader did not detail those suggestions other to 
say he told bush nato was founded on two concepts first 
solidarity and secondly the american leadership of the western 
alliance and we have to stick together on all of these fundamental 
issues and we will 
canada has suggested a compromise in which nato would agree in 
principle to talks with the soviets on abolishing the shortrange 
nuclear weapons while talks to erase the warsaw pacts edge in 
conventional weapons proceed 
bush said the united states had made some proposals to west 
germany and i expect well be hearing from them soon 
white house officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
bush was not referring to any new proposal to deal with the problem 
posed by west germanys demands 
instead he was referring to a monthsold us proposal for an 
overall approach for natos defense the officials said 
on other matters bush said his administration is in the final 
stages of work on new cleanair legislation that will propose 
tougher standards on industrial emissions that cause acid rain a 
crucial issue in uscanadian relations 
mulroney said i applaud the leadership the president is 
giving to the environment particularly to the question of acid 
rain 
bush also said he will meet in the next few days with his 
science adviser physicist d allan bromley about claims by 
scientists that they have produced nuclear fusion at room 
temperature and he voiced enthusiastic backing to demands by 
chinese students who have staged huge prodemocracy demonstrations

a federal judge today ordered changes in 
the way the fbi promotes its minority agents calling the present 
promotional method unsystematic and excessively subjective 
the order by us district judge lucius bunton stops the fbi 
from arbitrarily deciding whom to promote bunton called the 
bureaus system under which supervisors may disregard the 
recommendation of a career review board an anathema to nearly 
every reform advanced by the bureau 
he ordered the agency to improve the fairness and 
reviewability of its promotional process 
last september following a twoweek nonjury trial bunton had 
ruled that the fbi had discriminated against hispanic agents in 
promotions discipline and assignments it was a major 
embarrassment for the fbi which investigates civil rights 
violations 
in february and march bunton heard arguments from both sides on 
how the fbi should change and whether hispanic agents should be 
compensated 
hispanic agents had asked for back pay but bunton declined to 
order any monetary damages in todays ruling however he ordered 
the appointment of a threemember panel to examine on an individual 
basis the plaintiff agents request for promotions they claim they 
have been denied as a result of discrimination 
bunton ordered that original plaintiff bernardo m mat perez 
be promoted to the next job level in the bureau within 45 days and 
that the bureau must make available to perez responsibilities 
commensurate with his experience and training 
also fbi director williams s sessions must report to the court 
every 90 days regarding promotional decisions about perez until he 
becomes a special agent in charge or attains a similar position of 
responsibility 
bunton praised the efforts made by the fbi since his initial 
ruling in september 
the bureau has taken significant steps since the date of the 
trial to correct the disparate conditions of employment bunton 
said in the opinion but he stressed that reforms made thus far do 
not go far enough 
officials have said buntons decision could have a ripple effect 
on how other us law enforcement agencies award promotions and 
hand out assignments hispanic agents of the us border patrol and 
customs service have discussed filing suits similar to the fbi case 
the classaction lawsuit was filed in january 1987 by perez 
then the no 2 agent in el paso and the fbis highestranking 
hispanic agent eventually 310 of the fbis approximately 400 
hispanic agents joined perez in the suit the fbi has about 9000 
agents

cracks appeared friday in chinas tightly 
controlled media as newspapers gave unprecedented and even 
sympathetic coverage to a huge student demonstration for democracy 
and freedom 
the development was significant because one of the main student 
demands has been for a free press marches in the last three weeks 
had received scant attention by the staterun media 
about 300 journalists also joined thursdays march of thousands 
adding their voice to the growing call for a freer and more 
democratic china our mouths cannot say what we want to read 
one of their banners 
still it was uncertain whether fridays reporting on the march 
would filter into other areas such as corruption mismanagement 
and the incompetence of bureaucrats 
major newspapers used stories from their own journalists a 
change from the protest of april 27 when 150000 students and their 
supporters also marched to tiananmen the next day all of the 
papers used a report from the official xinhua news agency chinas 
most conservative media outlet 
unlike previous reports several newspapers quoted bystanders as 
saying they supported the march 
the science and technology daily quoted an old woman with tears 
coming down her face as saying the students were speaking on behalf 
of the people 
the quote was an important one because in china the ruling 
communist party is supposed to speak for the people 
the article also used quotes to challenge the xinhua report 
which said only 20000 students from 30 schools took part in the 
march 
more than 100000 must be here one person told the 
newspaper 
there must be more than 70 schools said another 
science and technology a paper for intellectuals has been at 
the forefront of reporting about the movement but it hasnt been 
easy 
its april 23 edition devoted to a demonstration during which 
tens of thousands of students spent the night at tiananmen square 
came out only after its reporters threatened to quit ultimately 
they had to deliver the paper themselves 
fridays xinhua story didnt include veiled criticism of the 
movement 
the report also mentioned the protest put on by 300 journalists 
saying simply that more than 200 young reporters also 
demonstrated 
the peoples daily implicitly acknowledged the widespread public 
support for the marchers saying tens of thousands of onlookers 
stood by and many of them actively donated drinks and food 
the paper also reported that after the protesters left tiananmen 
square some passed by its offices where they yelled slogans 
the paper the organ of the communist party has been subject to 
heavy criticism by the students because it published an editorial 
april 26 accusing them of trying to overthrow the state 
the china youth news a relatively liberal paper praised the 
students for conducting an orderly march 
it reported a large group of students are not satisfied with 
talks held between the government and the students however the 
article did not explain that students want the government to 
conduct talks with their independent student association and not 
with officiallyappointed student representatives 
it also said protests occurred in at least 11 other cities 
the legal daily reported that one protest in xian was actually 
legal it said the northwest polytechnical institute had applied 
for permission to demonstrate on may 4 the 70th anniversary of 
chinas first student movement and the public security bureau had 
agreed 
the chinese constitution guarantees the right to demonstrate but 
most cities have laws saying demonstrators must apply for a permit 
technically all of the protests in beijing have been illegal 
because students did not apply for permits 
a senior editor at one major newspaper said the reports friday 
came out because of the pressure many journalists put on their 
newspapers to publish 
but behind this there is no move to change the structure of 
the media in china we are still owned and run by the state she 
said until that changes i see no possibility for real 
progress

the government said friday it had 
advance warning that moslem guerrillas would attack jalalabad 
which the insurgents predicted would fall in days but instead has 
been under bloody siege for two months 
estimates of total casualties range from 7000 to more than 
12500 
najmuddin kawyani a member of the communist party politburo and 
secretary of the central committee said the government received a 
tip about the offensive on march 5 two days before it began he 
did not say who gave the warning 
no one could believe they were to launch an attack kawyani 
said in an interview 
the guerrillas armed and supported by neighboring pakistan and 
the united states predicted they would capture the eastern city 
within three days kawyani said friday they were enslaved by 
their own slogans 
guerrilla leader gulbuddin hekmatyar has said he would pray in 
jalalabad at the close of ramadan the moslem holy month just 
ending 
i have never seen such a big liar kawyani said perhaps 
he didnt mean this year 
commanders chose jalalabad as the first major guerrilla target 
after soviet military forces completed their withdrawal feb 15 
ending more than nine years of participation in a civil war that 
has cost more than 1 million lives 
in the early days the guerrillas captured army outposts around 
the city which is near the khyber pass 75 miles east of kabul and 
45 miles from pakistan then the conscript afghan army rallied and 
the campaign settled into stalemate 
insurgents launch rockets into the city and government forces 
respond with artillery fire and bombing raids guerrilla units 
advance on government positions and are driven back 
the presence of the soviets had ill effects kawyani said 
afghan soldiers were relying on the soviets to do it all now 
their morale has changed considerably you cant compare it with 
three months ago 
shortly after the soviet withdrawal the alliance of insurgent 
groups formed an interim government in pakistan kawyani said the 
government was imaginary born in a dead body 
he said the civil war will continue for years unless a political 
settlement is reached 
president najib has offered a coalition government and other 
compromises but all have been rejected by the guerrillas who 
began fighting after a communist coup in april 1978 
najib also has called for direct talks with the united states 
washington has refused 
kawyani said friday we have one hope that the americans will 
reverse the position the past three months have shown that no 
military solution is possible compromises are needed and we are 
ready 
the americans should accept this in principle later on we 
can talk about details

pope john paul ii reflecting the 
churchs concern about the spread of islamic fundamentalism in 
africa urged roman catholics and moslems on friday to avoid 
aggressive tactics in the battle for converts 
in a speech to malawis catholic bishops on the last full day of 
his nineday african tour the pope raised the issue of the 
churchs tense relations with moslems in this southern african 
nation 
what is required is mutual respect as well as mutual 
recognition of those things that we share in common the pope 
said 
both among christians working for unity in obedience to christ 
and among believers of different religions there is no place for 
aggressive proselytism which disturbs and hurts still less for the 
use of unworthy methods he added 
the pope quoted from his speech to moslems in morocco in 1985 
christians and moslems have badly understood each other 
and sometimes in the past have opposed and even exhausted each in 
polemics and in wars i believe that today god invites us to change 
our old practices 
there are 25 million catholics and 1 million moslems in this 
country of 8 million people the rest of the population is made up 
mostly of anglicans protestants and animists 
islam has been growing rapidly in malawi since the early 1970s 
financed in part by arab petrodollars moslems have built hundreds 
of mosques across the country 
tensions grew after moslem extremists set fire to several 
catholic churches in malawi in 198384 last august several 
catholic youths and an elderly religion teacher were forcibly 
circumcised in a suburb of blantyre by moslem fundamentalists 
church officials said 
some moslem leaders here have said they are upset that the 
popes visit to malawi came during the moslem holy period of 
ramadan 
the issue has significance for all of africa church officials 
have expressed concern about the spread of moslem fundamentalism in 
nigeria sudan and other african countries the vatican in february 
criticized the imposition of islamic law on nonmoslems 
vatican officials say the competition for converts in africa is 
crucial 
a big question is whether africa will be a christian or a 
moslem continent 25 years from now said vatican spokesman 
joaquin navarro the church cannot compete with the billions of 
dollars that is financing islam in africa 
the pope also celebrated a morning mass for more than 100000 
people at blantyres kwacha freedom park addressed at least 
60000 youths at the kamuzu sports stadium and met with the 
catholic laity and representatives of other christian faiths and 
other religions 
in his homily he urged his flock to treat victims of aids as 
we would treat christ himself 
malawi has one of the highest rates of aids in africa according 
to local health officials as many as 20 percent of newborn 
children are infected with the aids virus 
at the stadium ceremony school children wearing colorful 
uniforms danced and sang to gospelrock music as the pope arrived 
in a glassenclosed vehicle young boys dressed in grass skirts 
faces striped with red paint danced a vigorous traditional dance 
in a circle screaming and stamping their feet 
in his address to the lay people he briefly expressed concern 
for the first time on his trip about polygamy which is common in 
africa 
the pope travels saturday to lilongwe malawis administrative 
capital to celebrate the final mass of his voyage before returning 
to rome he has visited madagascar reunion and zambia

senate and house leaders say they expect 
speedy completion of a compromise federal budget now that both 
chambers have passed mirrorimage 12 trillion spending plans that 
cause little political pain 
lawmakers on both sides of the capitol approved fiscal 1990 
budgets on thursday obediently consenting to proposals whose 
foundations were laid in talks last month between congressional 
leaders and bush administration officials with bipartisan amity 
that has been glaringly absent in most budget debates the senate 
adopted its plan 6831 while the house signed off 263157 
we are pleased that the process is moving forward and in a 
quicker manner than in past years white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said today we will continue to work with the congress 
on the budget and we find these resolutions provide a very 
optimistic prospect for reaching agreement 
supporters said the budgets were the best available solutions to 
the gridlock created by president bushs no new taxes pledge 
and democratic reluctance to slash domestic programs yet they 
conceded that their talks with the white house which lasted about 
as long as the biblical flood had not yielded a perfect instrument 
we didnt produce what noah did said sen pete domenici of 
new mexico ranking republican on the senate budget committee 
some even think we barely produced a rowboat 
there are few significant differences between the two plans 
mainly because overall totals for revenues deficit reduction and 
defense domestic and foreign aid spending were cemented in the 
white housecongressional budget pact 
housesenate negotiators will have to settle relatively minor 
differences in how the two chambers would distribute money among 
education science criminal justice and other domestic programs 
congressional leaders have said their goal is to complete work 
on a compromise budget by midmay which if accomplished would be 
the earliest date of completion in 11 years that bargaining should 
begin next week 
we should be able to resolve our differences quickly said 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
both houses budgets claim to chop the 163 billion deficit 
expected in fiscal 1989 which ends sept 30 to just over 99 
billion next year the plans have been criticized however for 
relying largely on overly optimistic economic projections 
accounting gimmicks and onetime savings therefore doing little 
to truly ease the governments longrange deficit ills 
so the heck with the next generation and whoopee for the next 
election said sen ernest hollings dsc a hollings amendment 
that would have forced 32 billion in savings by holding most 
spending at this years levels was rejected 8218 
democratic and republican leaders in both chambers flexed their 
legislative muscles all day thursday quashing a slew of amendments 
aimed at scuttling the budgets taxing and spending formulas 
among the defeated proposals were a house amendment by the 
congressional black caucus that would have cut defense spending 
raised taxes on the wealthy and beefed up domestic programs and a 
motion by sen herbert kohl dwis that would have given the 
senate budget committee three days to produce deeper cuts 
under both the house and senate proposals federal receipts 
would rise by 142 billion next year 53 billion in unspecified 
taxes 57 billion in unnamed sales of federal assets 27 
billion in higher fees for government services and 500 million by 
boosting the internal revenue services ability to collect levies 
defense spending would reach 2992 billion about 47 billion 
below the amount president bush sought when he presented his 
original budget proposal to congress in february foreign aid would 
receive 167 billion enough to compensate for inflation over the 
last year 
on the domestic side 23 billion in savings would come from 
restraining medicare payments to doctors and hospitals 
another 6 billion would come from reductions in other programs 
the law says must be financed including 11 billion in 
yetundecided reforms in the postal service and federal pension 
programs critics have said some of these savings are of 
questionable validity such as 17 billion by moving the postal 
service offbudget and 477 million by claiming savings from 
unused food stamps 
recipients of benefit programs such as social security would 
receive their regularly scheduled annual costofliving increases 
programs for lowincome people such as handicapped education and 
employment for the elderly would receive high enough increases over 
this year to cover the bite of inflation programs for children 
such as head start and child care would be boosted by even more 
federal assistance would also be signficantly beefed up for 
antidrug programs aids research and treatment space science 
aviation and the homeless 
the budget resolution once the two chambers complete a 
compromise is used as a guide by congress when it writes its 
spending and tax legislation

celebrating the huge 12 percent swing against the government 
mrs thatchers energy secretary cecil parkinson said labors 
win is a warning to the government it is not as popular as it 
would like to be 
but it is not in any way depressing or intimidating 
parkinson added 
defeated conservative candidate rod richards acknowledged voter 
hostility to the health service program and other reforms mrs 
thatcher is pursuing in her third term they include a new property 
tax and selling off the national water and electricity utilities 
we have to win that debate in the country and it will take 
time because we are changing things quite radically richards 
said 
labor also was boosted by the collapse of support for britains 
squabbling center parties which split after the 1987 general 
election and adopted rivalries now ridiculed as the muddle in the 
middle 
labor polled 23342 votes to the tories 17314 the centrist 
social and liberal democratic party took only 2017 and the social 
democractic party its previous electoral ally got 1098 the 
welsh nationalist party plaid cymru also did badly with 1672 votes 
the vale of glamorgan where the previous legislator died this 
year was only the fourth district in 25 years that labor has 
snatched from the conservatives in a byelection 
polling was thursday the 10th anniversary of mrs thatchers 
accession to the premiership now in her third fiveyear term she 
must call the next election by mid1992 
until then she still commands a huge majority of 101 seats in 
the 650member house of commons conservatives have 375 seats 
labor 228 the social and liberal democrats 19 and the social 
democratic party 3 minority regional parties hold the rest 
earlier the conservatives and laborites did well in county 
council elections in england and wales making substantial gains at 
the expense of the center parties 
tory and labor leaders said that british politics is back in the 
traditional twoparty mold which was upset by the formation of a 
burgeoning centrist alliance in 1981 
in 1983 and 1987 general elections the centrists took nearly 
onefourth of the vote although they won few seats and often 
helped a conservative to victory by splitting the antithatcher 
vote 
in thursdays elections for 47 county councils the 
conservatives finished with overall control of 19 up from 12 and 
labor with 13 up from nine 
the social and liberal democrats kept control of their sole 
county council the isle of wight but lost seats across the 
country independents had control of two county councils and no 
party had overall control in the other 12 
adding to mrs thatchers problems is a resurgence in inflation 
now at 79 percent and among the highest in industrialized 
countries and a hefty balance of payments deficit that topped 28 
billion in march 
in addition labor unions are flexing their muscles after years 
of defeats 
railmen dockers engineers firefighters electricians london 
subway drivers and bbc journalists and production staff all are 
threatening strikes 
some conservative claim the unrest may be organized this is 
beginning to look like a conspiracy said tory legislator harry 
greenway 
nevertheless the conservative party remains ahead in national 
opinion polls three points ahead of labor with 42percent support 
matching that of 1987

taiwan and us officials ended five days 
of trade talks friday without reaching any agreement and the 
united states urged taiwan to further liberalize its trade 
practices 
during fridays session taiwan officials provided full details 
of the governments plan to cut its trade surplus to the us 
delegation headed by deputy assistant us trade representative 
mark orr 
in many areas the plan has made a positive contribution 
orr said but in other areas the plan is not as ambitious as it 
could be 
taiwan presented outlines of the fouryear plan to washington in 
march to try to avoid possible trade retaliation by the united 
states 
under the plan taiwan is to liberalize its financial and trade 
markets to reduce this islands trade imbalance by at least 10 
percent each year and gradually cut import tariffs until they 
average 7 percent in 1992 
last year taiwan registered a trade surplus of 104 billion 
with the united states 
however the us delegation said the plan still allows taiwan 
to maintain high tariffs on agricultural products the united 
states also called for the lifting the ban on taiwans imports of 
several agricultural products 
taiwans import tariffs for agricutural items currently average 
2599 percent and will be lowered to 1982 percent in 1992 under 
the action plan 
officials here argued that the government can only agree to 
smaller tariff cuts in agricultural items to protect the interests 
of local farmers 
donald bishop spokesman for the american delegation said the 
us side recognized taiwans efforts in the direction of 
liberalization but taiwan is still encouraged to do more 
he said taiwan was also urged to open more access to the united 
states to set up bank branches insurance companies and security 
firms here 
last week taiwan was cited in a report by the office of the 
us trade representative as one of 34 countries which allegedly 
impose unfair barriers in trade with the unied states 
the us trade representative is expected to select nations by 
may 30 for possible sanctions for unfair trade practices under the 
super 301 provision of the us omnibus trade act many believe 
taiwan which ranked fourth among the 34 countries may be placed on 
the priority list 
the united states accuses taiwan of maintaining barriers through 
import licensing limits on access to the insurance market 
agricultural export susidies ineffective intellectualproperty 
protection and monopoly practices

here is a sampling of editorial opinions on the verdicts reached 
in the oliver north trial 
from new york newsday 
the lasting historical significance of the conviction of oliver 
north is that in this country not even a man labeled a national 
hero is above the law in the end 12 citizens after 12 days of 
deliberation found that north no matter what his position no 
matter what his mission no matter what the president called him 
was guilty they found that he obstructed a congressional inquiry 
into the irancontra affair shredded official us documents and 
illegally accepted a 14000 gratuity this national hero is now a 
convicted felon

we hear a lot about this contemporary times lack of heroes one 
reason we lack them is that we tear down the ones we otherwise 
might have for instance oliver north who would want to be a 
hero and endure what he has endured 
here is a man who has laid down his life for others in 
vietnam in central america there are many who owe in both 
places their lives to his he has been called a hero by two 
presidents a leader of the contras testified we are going to 
erect a monument to colonel north once we free nicaragua 
yet he has been run down by the very government for which he 
toiled the president who could have saved him did not the jury 
tried but came up short and now the legalistic hounding will 
continue of colonel north and others with all the consequent 
anguish and cost

north is no national hero but he is certainly not totally to

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from the evening sun in baltimore 
from the time oliver north first came to public attention in the 
midst of the irancontra affair he has been a riveting and 
controversial figure many americans followed the lead of president 
reagan who pronounced north a national hero despite the fact 
that he had just fired him others saw him more clearly as a 
complicated man whose energy epitomized the cando spirit americans 
thrive on but one whose zeal overcame his judgment 
now in a trial remarkable for its fairness under the glare of 
publicity and controversy a jury has concluded that in three 
specific cases north did indeed step over the line that should have 
separated vigorous pursuit of his duty from criminal acts 
americans can admire commitment and zeal they can admire many 
of the qualities oliver north has long sought to exemplify but 
zeal and commitment must be tempered by judgment thats one 
function of law to establish boundaries that impose good judgment 
on excessive zeal north and his supporters are claiming a victory 
in the fact that his was acquitted on nine other counts but those 
acquittals do not erase the seriousness of the charges for which he 
was found guilty

from the los angeles daily news 
norths trial shares similaries with that of daniel ellsberg and 
anthony russo who leaked the pentagon papers in the 1973 
ellsbergrusso case which ended in a mistrial the defense argued 
not that ellsberg and russo were not involved in the leak of the 
pentagon papers but that those papers never should have been 
classified norths defense also was based on a disagreement with 
the law most of his actions were predicated on a belief that the 
president not congress should run foreign policy 
in light of thursdays verdict the spending of over 12 million 
by special prosecutor lawrence walsh to build a case against north 
has to be considered overkill the good news is that while the 
prosecution against north was politically motivated the jurys 
verdict was fair and balanced 
if punishment goes so far say as to end the muchdecorated 
veterans military pension president bush should pardon north who 
has paid greatly for his mistakes as it is

it so happened that the passions aroused by the irancontra 
scandal came to focus on oliver norths trial and that partisans 
of both sides sought vindication in the verdict but in this 
country trials arent staged for political vindication theyre 
held to decide the guilt or innocence of the accused

from the boston globe 
no man the jurors found stands above the law once again 
reaffirming the most basic tenet in the american legal system 
the rules of law hold even if the wrongdoing conceded by north 
was performed under the direction of president reagan as north 
contended 
openly enthusiastic about his covert assignment to arm and 
otherwise assist the nicaraguan contras at a time when such aid had 
been banned by congress north undoubtedly believed he was acting 
with the understanding and support of his superiors in the national 
security council and the white house 
nor is there reason to doubt that those superiors shared his 
conviction under almost any other circumstances they would have 
been charged in some way along with north instead they left him 
to face trial alone whch may have persuaded the jury to dismiss 
other counts against him 
his defense that he was led to believe that everything he did 
was done at the direction of the president does not excuse him 
the trial was thorough the law has been upheld

from the washington post 
if the jurors had bought mr norths whole defense they would 
have sent a message that any subterfuge any ignoring of a 
congressional mandate any covert and illegal act in the 
furtherance of what a small group inside the government believes to 
be in the best interests of the country is justifiable they 
didnt do that the verdict is a statement that such acts are wrong 
and punishable even if the defendant believed he was acting on the 
orders of his superiors 
these jurors were not charged with deciding what other officials 
were involved in this deception and coverup but in their long 
deliberations and mixed verdict they have indicated that they 
dont believe mr north was the sole or even the principal 
offender

from the albany ny times union 
for many who viewed former lt col oliver north as a hero 
thursdays verdict will be hard to accept facing 12 counts in 
connection with the irancontra scandal he was acquitted of nine 
but convicted of three was that justice for a loyal marine who 
thought he was serving his country and assumed tacit approval by 
his commander in chief 
it was if the verdict is seen in the proper light irancontra 
was not about one marines loyalty or naivete it was about a 
government within a government a secret operation that generated 
funds by selling arms at a profit and used the profits to carry 
out foreign policy all of it outside the parameters of 
constitutional government 
if col north inspires sympathy even now its no doubt 
because he was used by those higherups the late cia director 
william casey and two former nation security advisors robert 
macfarlane and admiral john poindexter 
used or not col north was responsible for obeying the law 
 
the jury understood now the american public must understand 
as well even those who still admire the man more than the verdict

airline lufthansa was attacked by an unidentified group of people 
while it was closed friday for the moslem weekend irans news 
agency reported 
the office sustained some damage said the official islamic 
republic news agency it gave no details 
the incident followed calls in iranian newspapers for expulsion 
of west german diplomats from tehran reflecting an antiwestern 
trend that is being fueled by a fundamentalist revival 
the farsilanguage kayhan daily said last month that west german 
diplomats in iran were spies disguised as diplomats 
iranian prime minister hussein musavi said a few days earlier 
that west germany was implicated in a cia spy network allegedly 
uncovered by iranian intelligence 
he said that a network of iranian agents working for the us 
central intelligence agency had been exposed many of whom were 
communicating with the agency through west german embassies in 
europe 
intelligence minister mohammad mohammadireyshahri later said 
the spies were linked with the american military base in wiesbaden 
west germany where many had received training 
iran also has accused west germany of supplying its enemy iraq 
with technology to build longrange missiles and chemical weapons 
before relations deteriorated west germany was favored by 
tehran to assist in ambitious reconstruction efforts planned after 
the aug 20 ceasefire in the eightyear iraniraq war 
west germany joined the other european economic community 
nations in temporarily recalling its ambassador from tehran to

while president bush had reason to feel last 
election day that the american people had delivered their verdict 
on his role in the irancontra affair much to his annoyance 
questions persist 
but there is a widespread feeling that the demand for answers 
diminishes rapidly the farther one is from capitol hill 
the thing has been around so long its kind of old news 
said mike hamby executive director of the florida democratic party 
with a slight nod toward partisanship hamby quickly added that 
if theres any curiosity out there it concerns bushs role in 
the reagan administration deliberations on arms sales to iran and 
the diversion of funds to the contras bush has said he knew about 
the iran arms sales but has denied any knowledge of the diversion 
i dont think theres any outcry of any kind across this 
country for any questions about this issue said eddie mahe a 
republican consultant this issue ceased to exist for the 
american people a long time ago 
the fact is that neither the foreign policy scandal nor the 
persona of oliver l north quite lived up to the expectations of 
partisans on both sides 
democrats saw the irancontra affair as an issue that would 
cripple republican chances to hold the white house in the 1988 
election 
conservatives saw north the marine lieutenant colonel with a 
chest full of medals as a symbol who would rally voters to reject 
his democratic tormentors 
for a while both had reason for high hopes 
where was george shouted exuberant democrats at their 1988 
nominating convention and at later rallies for nominee michael 
dukakis it sounded and looked like a great way to focus attention 
on the unanswered questions about bushs role in the affair 
but voters seemed to care more about willie horton than ollie 
north and were more disturbed about the massachusetts prison 
furlough program than the irancontra scandal 
at the same time north never emerged as the national hero 
conservatives sought 
americans responded with a flood of pronorth letters and 
telegrams after his televised appearance before congressional 
investigators in july 1987 an outpouring that generated a quick 
flurry of what was dubbed olliemania complete with tshirts and 
appeals that he run for public office 
north still commands speaking fees of up to 25000 an 
appearance but his presence no longer makes politicians 
particularly democrats uneasy 
if anyone is uneasy these days it might be white house aides as 
they watch conservatives try to generate pressure on the president 
to pardon the former national security council aide 
he was never as hot as he was that week in july 1987 said 
democratic pollster peter hart it was that one period of time 
it was a very short tshirt sale period 
as the jury in the oliver l north trial was preparing to 
announce its verdict thursday bush welcomed the question about his 
role in the irancontra affair as if he thought one more answer 
would put an end to the inquiries 
it didnt and now he might want to take his press secretarys 
advice and leave the questions to the historians 
bush invoked the prestige of his office in trying once and for 
all to deal with questions about his meeting with the president of 
honduras in 1985 at issue is whether the thenvice president knew 
the reagan administration was expecting honduras to aid the contras 
in return for american aid 
the word of the president of the united states george bush 
is there was no quid pro quo responded bush 
there has been much needless mindless speculation about my 
word of honor and ive answered it now definitively said an 
obviously annoyed president 
but as bush must know such questions never can be answered 
definitively 
details about the bush trip to honduras were disclosed in a memo 
placed in evidence at the north trial the documents suggested bush 
had a greater role than acknowledged in us efforts to keep the 
contras in business congressional investigators never got that 
information and they now want to know why 
the north trial raised a number of questions that i think are 
still unanswered said rep lee hamilton dind who chaired the 
house investigation of the irancontra affair 
we still have many many unanswered questions about 
irancontra and those should be pursued he said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said he would 
advise the president to refuse to answer further questions 
if there are unanswered questions my vote would be to leave 
them to the historians and others who want to delve into this he 
said

iran on friday called for a worldwide 
campaign of terror against americans and urged palestinians to kill 
five westerners for every arab slain in the israelioccupied lands 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani shown on iranian tv 
leaning on an ak47 assault rifle urged palestinians to declare 
open war on american interests throughout the world 
why dont you hijack planes in order to swap prisoners in 
israeli hands or blow up factories in western countries he said 
in a sermon during the weekly shiite moslem prayer session at 
tehran university 
rafsanjani whose emotional speech was broadcast on tehran radio 
and monitored in nicosia was interrupted by thousands of shiite 
worshipers who chanted death to israel 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
rafsanjanis comments were appalling and another step 
backwards for iran from the community of civilized nations 
it is an exhortation for palestinians to commit terrorism and 
only serves to confirm that terrorism remains an integral feature 
of ayatollah khomeinis regime he said 
fitzwater said the united states would hold iran responsible for 
any attacks on american interests or citizens 
he compared the comments to irans threats against british 
author salman rushdie author of the book the satanic verses 
many moslems say the book blasphemes islam and ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini has called for the author to be killed 
after rafsanjanis remarks the official islamic republic news 
agency reported that the tehran office of the west german airline 
lufthansa was attacked friday while it was closed for the moslem 
weekend 
the agency monitored in nicosia gave no details but said the 
office sustained some damage 
in his remarks rafsanjani stressed that the united states 
should be singled out as israels main backer but that britons and 
frenchmen also should be targets 
if for every palestinian martyred in palestine the 
palestinians kill five americans britons or frenchmen outside 
the zionists would not dare continue these wrongs rafsanjani 
said 
it isnt so hard to kill americans or frenchmen because 
theyre all over the globe its a bit difficult to kill israelis 
because there arent as many of them around in other parts of the 
world he said 
at least 460 palestinians and 20 israelis have died in the 
17monthold palestinian uprising against israeli in the west bank 
and gaza strip which israel seized from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 middle east war 
rafsanjani denounced palestine liberation organization leader 
yasser arafats peace initiative in which he has renounced 
terrorism and recognized israels right to exist 
the speaker said israel and its allies will never allow the 
formation of a palestinian state it is impossible 
the extremist remarks by rafsanjani which came on the last 
friday of the moslem fasting month of ramadan underlined a new and 
growing antiwestern trend in iran that is part of a radical 
resurgence 
khomeini soon after coming to power in the 1979 islamic 
revolution set aside may 5 as qods day the arabic name for 
jerusalem he has called on islamic nations to free jerusalem 
islams third holiest city after mecca and medina from israeli 
rule 
as rafsanjani spoke irans official islamic republic news 
agency reported that millions of iranians took to the streets in 
tehran and other cities to pledge support for the palestinians 
chanting death to israel death to america 
rafsanjani who also is irans acting commanderinchief said 
the west would now say he was officially called for acts of 
terror 
he declared let them say it arent they already saying it 
they commit atrocities under the guise of human rights we 
will do the same rafsanjani said we too will strive in the 
name of our rights to defend our people

catherine watkins told her husband she 
loved him but it took 45 years for arthur watkins to get the 
message 
the couple were bowling in mansfield a couple weeks ago when 
lester crumb of mansfield appeared with five vmail letters 
mrs watkins had written to her husband while he fought in europe 
during the waning days of world war ii 
that was the first time watkins had seen the letters 
crumb said he found the mail in some boxes he bought for 40 
during an auction of the edward russell jr estate in mansfield on 
april 22 he said russell probably inherited the letters from his 
father 
but how did letters mailed to an army unit in europe end up in 
russells hands 
the letters spanned the period from december 1944 the month 
watkins was taken prisoner by german forces during the battle of 
the bulge in belgium to march 4 1945 
mrs watkins continued to write after she learned on jan 3 
1945 that her husband was missing in action and before she found 
out four months later that he was still alive 
and therein may lie an explanation for what happened to the 
letters 
the postmaster knew my wifes father said watkins maybe 
he thought the letters coming back might upset her and gave them to 
russell 
in any event something told me he was coming back mrs 
watkins said 
the longlost letters will be kept in a secure place 
i ought to have them laminated mrs watkins said

college geology departments across the 
nation have been threatened with extinction because of declining 
enrollment but theyre on the rebound because of a totally extinct 
subject says a researcher 
brisk sales of dinosaur cereal noodles toys and books have 
inspired educators to use dinosaurs in the classroom said bruce 
macfadden a natural science curator at the florida museum of 
natural history who surveyed 50 colleges and universities 
nationwide 
high unemployment in the oil and mining industries and changing 
academic requirements had discouraged enrollment until dinosaurs 
were emphasized he said 
people have always been fascinated by dinosaurs but theyre 
enjoying renewed interest because of revolutionary new theories 
about these giant prehistoric creatures he said 
enrollment in most dinosaur courses far exceeds other new 
courses sometimes by twice as much said macfadden whose 
research appears in the may issue of geotimes magazine

house speaker jim wright argued friday that 
his decades of public service outweigh any personal ethical 
shortcomings and suggested that political attacks against him are 
far more unethical than any failure of his own 
because i hold passionately to certain political beliefs i 
have made formidable political opponents in 40 years of active 
public life wright said in a law day speech on ethics to a 
hometown crowd in fort worth 
but i have never sought to destroy another mans character 
nor to deprive him of his dignity in these 40 years of public 
life the most unethical behavior i have witnessed is that of those 
who for their own ravening ambitions attempt to destroy the 
personal reputations of political opponents 
wrights leadership post has been threatened because of a house 
ethics committee probe that has alleged wright broke house rules 69 
times in his personal financial dealings 
by turns combative and contrite wright sought in his remarks to 
refocus the debate on his ethics to public policy rather than 
personal finances a text of his speech was released by his 
washington office 
the chairman of the house ethics committee rep julian dixon 
dcalif said he had read a copy of the speech everyones 
entitled to their own opinion i didnt think it addressed the 
issues that were discussing here nor do i think he should be 
dixon said i think he should wait and present that testimony 
before the committee 
as wright spoke the ethics panel continued for the third 
straight day to interview participants in a 1988 texas gasdrilling 
venture that has raised suspicions that wright was steered into the 
lucrative deal as a gift to buy favor with a powerful legislator 
the panel questioned doug jaffe who arranged for mallightco 
an investment partnership involving wright fort worth developer 
george mallick and their wives to buy into the gas well venture 
in january 1988 five months later the 9120 investment was sold 
for a 340000 profit 
wright had placed his interest in mallightco in a blind trust in 
1987 and instructed the trustee to sell that interest in a way that 
would earn him enough to pay off a 100000 loan he had taken out 
four years earlier to invest in a nursing home business 
the nursing home investment went sour and wright lost most of 
his money but he did receive better treatment than other 
investors collecting some 22000 in dividends that others were 
denied the new york times reported friday 
committee chairman dixon dcalif said that investment and 
the debt it left for wright were relevant to the panels probe of 
the gas drilling deal the profits from the gas deal were used last 
june to pay off the loan wright obtained to invest in the nursing 
home 
certainly it will be a point of discussion with the committee 
and i think relatively soon meaning next week he said 
dixon said he and the committees senior republican rep john 
t myers of indiana also would discuss at that time whether 
further investigation into the gas well deal is needed the 
committee still must decide whether to add any charges from the gas 
deal to the 69 violations already alleged 
wright is expected to go before the ethics committee late this 
month for a disciplinary hearing a triallike proceeding in which 
evidence is presented to determine whether the charges can be 
proven 
in fort worth the speaker listed the values he said he shares 
with most americans to tell the truth to keep your word to pay 
your debts to treat other people as youd have them treat you to 
protect those who are weaker and help those who are more needy than 
yourself to give something of yourself to be there when your 
country needs you 
he said he has sought to carry out those values in my own 
flawed fashion and pointed to his public policy positions 
favoring aid for the homeless education and creation of jobs 
these are some of the things which preoccupy me when i think 
of what is moral and what is ethical for a great nation he said 
he repeated contentions that his problems stem primarily not 
from anything he has done but from his highprofile political 
position 
it is a sad and sickening thing to see the political life of 
our nation become increasingly dominated by the tactics of negative 
campaigning wright said it contaminates the atmosphere of 
political dialogue and poisons the well of creative political 
thought 
and he continued to criticize the ethics committees special 
outside counsel richard phelan for overzealousness an 
aggressive chicago law firm armed with the power of subpoena has 
spent 10 months and almost 2 million of the taxpayers money 
probing my public and private affairs looking for things to 
criticize he said that fact in itself is a commentary of one 
sort or another

the estimated cost of next years national 
census was challenged as too low and the census likely effect on 
congress was criticized as unfair thursday in testimony before a 
senate subcommittee 
census bureau estimates of a 26 billion pricetag for the 
national head count were questioned as probably too low by the 
office of management and budget 
and a university of maryland scholar asserted that the method 
used to reapportion the house of representatives once census counts 
are finished is unfair to the larger states 
peyton young a professor of public policy said in testimony 
presented to the subcommittee on governmental information and 
regulation that he is not sure the current apportionment method 
meets the one person one vote standard 
following each census the seats in the house are redistributed 
among the states using a complex formula adopted in 1941 known as 
the method of equal proportions 
several other methods have been used in the nations history 
each with some problem or other 
at the heart of the dispute is the fact that the house has 
limited itself to 435 members each state gets one and the 
remaining 385 are then divided according to population thats when 
the trouble starts 
because congressional districts cannot cross state lines no 
matter what number of people constitute an average district they 
are never divided equally into every state population the 
leftovers cause the problems and have led to long political fights 
according to youngs calculations the current system gives 
states with fewer people about a 3 percent advantage over larger 
states a difference he considers unfair 
meanwhile government officials disagreed before the 
subcommittee about the cost of collecting the data to divide up 
those seats 
c louis kincannon deputy director of the census bureau said 
the agency plans to spend 26 billion and can conduct a high 
quality census on that amount of money 
gene l dodaro of the office of management and budget however 
said the bureau has not planned for all contingencies dodaro 
estimated that the 1990 count will cost as much as 3 billion 
before it is completed 
dodaro also urged census officials to begin work immediately on 
planning for a census in the year 2000 so they can use lessons 
learned in 1990 to make that subsequent count easier and more 
accurate

the bush administration on friday named south 
korea west germany and japan as countries that need to do more to 
reduce the huge trade surpluses they are running with the united 
states 
the administrations assessment delivered by treasury secretary 
nicholas brady and undersecretarydesignate david mulford was 
particularly critical of west germany and south korea 
the officials testifying before the senate banking committee 
indicated those two countries needed significant changes in policy 
to promote reductions in global trade imbalances 
mulford said pointedly that discussions with south korean 
officials had at times been quite frustrating while some 
progress has been made in getting the government to allow its 
currency to strengthen in relation to the us dollar mulford said 
more needed to be done in this area to make us goods cheaper in 
korea 
earlier this week south korean deputy prime minister soon cho 
met with administration officials in washington to discuss trade 
cho indicated to reporters that he was resisting pressure to allow 
the korean currency to appreciate further against the dollar 
in his testimony mulford said that negotiations with south 
korea were continuing and he said he hoped to be able to report 
progress by oct 15 when the law requires the next report on 
currency negotiations to be presented to congress 
mulford said that the requirement in last years trade law for 
the administration to target countries unfairly manipulating their 
currencies to boost their trade surpluses had been helpful in the 
ongoing negotiations with south korea and taiwan 
brady said that taiwan had made more progress in the currency 
area he said that taiwans currency may now be at the proper 
level given the fact that it has risen 12 percent against the 
dollar just since last october 
mulford indicated that the administration was satisfied with the 
dollars current level against most major currencies such as the 
japanese yen and the west german mark he repeated a commitment by 
the seven major industrial nations on april 2 that they would work 
to keep the dollar from rising further or dropping too sharply 
in his prepared testimony brady said that international efforts 
to coordinate trade and economic policies were showing results but 
that more progress was needed 
brady noted that the us merchandise trade deficit narrowed by 
21 percent last year after hitting a record 152 billion in 1987 
and predicted further improvement although at a slower pace in 
1989 
but brady said the japanese need to do more to open their 
markets to foreign goods especially in view of the fact that 
japans trade surplus fell only modestly in 1988 and is expected to 
be little changed this year the united states ran a trade deficit 
of 52 billion with japan last year the largest with any nation 
in discussing west germany brady was even more critical 
stating that progress made by that nation in reducing its trade 
surpluses has been less satisfactory than in japan 
he said germanys trade surplus rose to record levels in 1988 
and is expected to climb even higher in 1989 
brady said in the united states hitting the grammrudman 
federal deficit target of 100 billion for next year would be the 
most important thing america could do to lower the deficit 
sen donald riegle dmich and chairman of the banking 
committee said he feared that the big improvement in the trade 
deficit registered in 1988 had already stalled out and the deficit 
could begin rising again 
he said such a development would have ominous consequences for 
americas efforts to reduce its dependence on foreign investment

arts council which distributes government money for the arts to 
reduce the subsidy

had 6 million visitors because entry to parts of it is free and 
anyone can use the catering facilities

secretary of state james a baker iii in a 
move to accelerate arabisraeli negotiations will send a top aide 
to the middle east next week to test support for us peace 
efforts it was announced friday 
dennis ross who heads the state departments policy planning 
staff and counsels baker on events in the region will hold talks 
in israel and egypt the state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said 
ross will be accompanied by daniel kurtzer a specialist on the 
middle east who is on his staff and hold talks in jordan as well 
said another us offical who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
ross will go to the middle east from moscow after participating 
in talks baker will hold with soviet leaders the search for a 
negotiating formula is one of the the major regional issues baker 
intends to discuss with president mikhail s gorbachev 
ms tutwiler said ross would provide a briefing on the moscow 
talks and also look into the next steps in the peace process 
baker has endorsed a proposal by israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir for elections among palestinian arabs on the west bank and 
in gaza the winners would negotiate with israel arrangements for 
temporary selfrule israel egypt jordan and the palestinians 
then would negotiate an overall settlement 
the arab league and the palestine liberation organization have 
rejected the proposal while egypt and jordan have taken ambiguous 
positions baker has asked all sides to withhold final judgments 
until the details are worked out 
his approach to the soviets another us official said will be 
to ask their support for direct israelipalestinian negotiations 
this would mean a shift away from moscows persistent call for an 
international peace conference 
the united states is lukewarm to a conference unless it is no 
more than a device to further direct negotiations since the 
soviets would be one of the sponsors a conference could provide an 
opportunity for them to wield their influence on the outcome

britain ousted three south african diplomats 
friday over their countrys alleged role in a deal with northern 
ireland extremists to swap guns for british missile technology 
although the south african government denied involvement the 
foreign office appeared to implicate pretoria when it spoke of 
the grave concern with which her majestys government viewed the 
involvement by south african officials in this affair 
it gave the south africans one week to withdraw first secretary 
for information jan hp castelyn counselor jonathan fourie and 
staff sgt mark brunner who works in the defense attaches office 
while there was no suggestion they were implicated in the 
affair their expulsion is a rebuff at a time when pretorias 
relations with britain seemed to be warming 
it came two weeks after french police raided a paris address and 
arrested a south african diplomat an american arms dealer and 
three militant protestants from northern ireland 
the northern irelanders one a warrant officer in the provinces 
territorial army allegedly were handing over parts of a blowpipe 
a shoulderfired antiaircraft missile manufactured in belfast 
british officials say they are gravely concerned by charges the 
south africans were supplying weapons to the protestants in 
exchange for the missile parts 
the arrested south african identified by french sources as 
daniel storm was released after claiming diplomatic immunity a 
week later the french government expelled three south african 
officials implicated in the affair 
the three irishmen and american douglas bernhart are being held 
in france on gunrunning and conspiracy charges 
prime minister margaret thatcher took the lead in ordering the 
expulsions angered that she should be repaid in such a manner for 
defending south africa against a world drive for economic 
sanctions said the domestic press association news agency 
the foreign office said permanent undersecretary sir patrick 
wright summoned south african ambassador rae killen and informed 
him of the expulsions 
wright warned that south africans should be under no 
illusions about how gravely london views the affair 
he reminded that south africa is under a un arms embargo and 
that the lives of innocent people are at risk in northern 
ireland 
british press reports say the south africans are even more 
interested in the blowpipes sophisticated successor the 
starstreak this week newspapers reported that two technicians 
from shorts the stateowned manufacturer of blowpipe and 
starstreak have been hired at four times their salaries to work 
for the south african arms industry 
south african defense minister gen magnus malan acknowledged on 
april 24 that south africa sometimes uses unconventional 
methods to get around the arms embargo 
president pw botha called the blowpipe affair a 
transgression he regretted while malan said an official 
inquiry showed storm acted without government approval 
malan said he regretted the embarrassment caused to the british 
french and irish governments and would make sure it did not happen 
again

the estonian communist party has removed 22 
officials in a bid to halt its own waning popularity officials and 
journalists said friday 
the housecleaning strengthens newcomers to estonian party 
leadership who are generally more progressive and tend to support 
the tiny baltic republics declaration of sovereignty 
the 22 dropped from the central committee on thursday already 
had either left the republic or retired said estonian foreign 
ministry spokesman valle feldman the group included former party 
chief karl g vaino feldman said 
estonian peoples front leader marju lauristen who spoke at 
thursdays party meeting accused some of the retiring members of 
involvement in the deportation of tens of thousands of estonians to 
siberia and the far north in the 1940s and 1950s 
lauristen also a communist party member said several of the 
retirees were big bosses who participated in the deportations 
estonian radio reporter sulev halek said in a telephone interview 
feldman said the communist partys declining popularity was a 
factor in thursdays action a recent public opinion poll in 
estonia found that more than 50 percent of residents support the 
peoples front a grassroots nationalist group while only 7 
percent back the communist party he said 
the estonian communist party must now take radical steps and 
quickly work out a program if it wants to hold its own among 
other political groups that are flourishing in estonia feldman 
said 
the 22 were removed according to their own request in a move 
similar to the housecleaning last week in moscow that dropped 110 
former officials from the national communist partys leadership he 
said 
they were to a great degree responsible for the sad position 
were in now so of course they should take the consequences for 
it feldman said 
vaino who served as estonian communist party chief for almost a 
decade was replaced in june 1988 after months of criticism for 
inaction on pollution and corruption 
his replacement vaino i vyalyas is a reformer supported by 
the popular front 
in a speech thursday vyalyas attacked several newspapers for 
supporting the radical estonian national independence party which 
seeks estonian secession from the soviet union said eve parnaste 
a leader of that group 
feldman said vyalyas also criticized interdvizhenie a largely 
russian group that objects to rising nationalism and political 
reform 
in neighboring latvia the republics parliament on friday 
adopted a law opposed by interdvizhenie declaring latvian the 
official language of the republic according to residents and the 
official tass news agency 
the latvian communist party leadership on thursday approved the 
draft law in the republics capital of riga despite opposition from 
many nonlatvian residents said latvian foreign ministry official 
albert liepa 
liepa said the law was proposed because in many ways the 
latvian language has taken second place to russian in much of the 
republic 
lithuania and estonia adopted similar language laws last year

a memorial for sen joseph r mccarthy 
held yearly with little fanfare has gained attention with a 
lawsuit against talk show host morton downey jr and the relocation 
of the john birch society to this city 
it will certainly make appleton a hotspot for conservatism 
although i dont think they want to be milwaukee lawyer thomas 
bergen said friday he joined mccarthys anticommunist efforts 
after the two met in 1934 at marquette university law school 
for each of the 32 years since mccarthy died bergens sen 
joseph r mccarthy education foundation inc has honored the 
republican senator with a ceremony at mccarthys grave at st 
marys cemetery this years ceremony is sunday 
mccarthy a native of nearby grand chute led a crusade in the 
early 1950s alleging communist influence in government 
entertainment and other areas of us society 
his methods led to his censure by the senate in 1954 he died in 
1957 
the new exposure has not been accepted well by all officials in 
the city of 65000 located on the banks of the fox river in eastern 
wisconsin 
i cannot help where mccarthy was born in fact i can remember 
the mccarthy hearings but i dont feel i have to comment about 
it mccarthy is dead and gone said mayor dorothy johnson 
birch society head g allen bubolz who political organization 
emphasizes fighting communism and reducing the size of the us 
government said his group decided to relocate in appleton for 
convenience it was just a bit of wonderful irony that it would 
be in mccarthys hometown he said 
bergens lawsuit against downey directly involves sundays 
ceremony and comes at a time when downey is a focus of national 
controversy about freespeech rights 
a fullpage advertisement that ran friday in usa today reads 
burn mort why not just burn the constitution we believe in mort 
we believe in freedom it is signed by 25 people from a range 
of professions including real estate developer donald trump 
entertainer robert goulet harvard law professor allen dershowitz 
the suit filed this week in outagamie county circuit court seeks 
110000 claiming downey promised jan 16 to be a guest speaker at 
the ceremony and then withdrew in april 
downey said friday he talked with bergen in january and told him 
he would speak at the mccarthy ceremony only if he did not have a 
schedule conflict 
what do they have to do sue people to get people to come 
there downey asked during a phone interview from his new york 
office 
i made an oral agreement with mr bergen that i would 
appear if the dates did not conflict and the dates conflict he 
added as much as i would like to be there i cannot because i 
have contracts written contracts now mr bergen being a lawyer 
should understand that 
bergen said downeys oral contract constituted the same binding 
agreement as a written contract under wisconsin law 
bergen also said downeys office had told him it would send a 
videotape of the talk show host to use at the ceremony but it was 
not received 
michael obrien a history professor at university of wisconsin 
fox valley center in menasha and author of a book on mccarthyism 
dismissed renewed interest in mccarthy and the birch society as 
fleeting 
i dont think there is a rebirth of mccarthyism i think its 
a pretty shallow thing on the whole he said 
it was more of an accident that joe mccarthy was born here and 
more of an accident that the john birch society is moving here 
obrien said

president bushs spokesman accused the soviet 
union of working assiduously to divide nato partners on friday 
as bush and west german chancellor helmut kohl conferred without 
apparent progress in a dispute over shortrange missiles in europe 
the two leaders 20minute phone call did little to settle 
differences concerning kohls support for eastwest talks on 
eliminating battlefield nuclear weapons from western europe said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
the united states posture has not changed fitzwater said 
he said kohl initiated the phone call 
discussions that would lead to a denuclearization of 
europe would not be welcome fitzwater added 
the spokesman voiced sharp skepticism toward peace initiatives 
by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and suggested the soviets 
are seeking to exploit the current nato rift 
the soviets have worked assiduously to try to divide the 
alliance general secretrary gorbachev has made any number of 
proposals trying to convince people that there is no longer a 
threat from the soviet union and we are very wary of that 
approach fitzwater said 
in vienna soviet and east german diplomats used fridays 
resumption of eastwest talks on conventional weapons to emphasize 
warsaw pact support for parallel talks on reducing shortrange 
nuclear weapons 
east german ambassador klausdieter ernst insisted such 
negotiations are vital to germans telling a news conference the 
shorter the range of the rockets the more dead germans 
west germany and some european nato members want superpower 
talks on reducing tactical nuclear weapons but the united states 
and britain oppose such talks at least until the soviet superiority 
in conventional weapons is erased 
the bush administration also wants to modernize the aging 
arsenal of lance missiles clustered in western europe many of them 
in west germany 
fitzwater said friday that while the united states is open to 
talks within nato on resolving the rift it does not appear a 
basis for agreement is there 
of fridays bushkohl phone conversation fitzwater said i 
would not characterize it as moving the situation one way or 
another 
the flap threatens to disrupt a north atlantic treaty 
organization summit late this month called to celebrate the 
alliances 40th anniversary 
but norwegian prime minister gro harlem brundtland who met with 
bush this week predicted a solution would be found at the summit 
based on a linkage between cuts in conventional and shortrange 
nuclear arms agreed on by the allies last year 
speaking at the national press club brundtland said friday 
we can negotiate for lower levels both in conventional and 
shortrange weapons and i do think it is possible to reach 
common ground on that basis

a court friday convicted a 
gynecologist of violating laws restricting abortions and sentenced 
him to 2 years in prison and banned him from practicing medicine 
for three years 
the verdict drew protests from womens groups and the political 
opposition which demanded that abortion laws be relaxed 
a bomb threat forced evacuation of the court in the bavarian 
village of memmingen and caused a 90minute delay in announcing a 
verdict no bomb was found 
dr horst theissen was accused of providing abortions to scores 
of women in violation of regulations imposed in 1976 three years 
after the operation was legalized 
abortion is legal during the first three months of pregnancy if 
the mothers health is at risk in cases of rape of incest or if 
there is proof the birth would cause extraordinary hardship 
in addition women must have two doctors confirm they fulfill 
legal requirements for abortion and also must show proof they 
received counseling on adoption as an alternative 
the case against theissen 50 began in 1986 with an anonymous 
tip 
authorities raided his practice and impounded 1390 patients 
records hundreds of his patients were ordered to fill out detailed 
questionnaires about their sexual behavior and personal finances or 
face prosecution themselves 
the investigation resulted in indictments against theissen and 
against 156 women who prosecutors said had undergone abortions 
without documenting the counseling and examination requirements 
most of the women were fined up to 1600 
the chief judge in theissens eightmonth trial albert barner 
said the gynecologist deliberately went against the law which 
stresses the protection of the fetus over a womans freedom of 
choice 
theissen was found guilty on 36 counts of performing abortions 
without establishing that the women would suffer hardship because 
of childbirth 39 counts of giving abortions without seeking a 
second opinion or the mandatory counseling and four counts of 
attempted abortion 
theissens defense lawyers said they would appeal 
a small group of proabortion activists demonstrated outside the 
court and many women in the courtroom shed tears when the verdict 
was announced 
the leftist greens party said the verdict was a catastrophe 
for women 
ingrid wettingdanmeilmeier chief of the womens section of the 
opposition social democratic party called the countrys abortion 
law one of the most backward in europe

kandia kouyate in flowing sequined gown and 
matching turban glides onstage singing tales of her west african 
people 
coming to the stage of bostons opera house after pygmy dancers 
nigerian horn players and pende dancers from zaire kouyate is the 
diva of africa oye a presentation of traditional and modern 
african music that launched a 10week us tour thursday night 
she sings in her own language of the centuriesold history of 
the mandingue people a technique of oral history that makes her a 
virtual walking library 
dont even try to pierce the mystery that the mandingue hides 
dont disturb the spirits at their eternal rest 
dont enter dead cities to question the past reads a 
translation of her song provided by the shows producers 
although the sellout crowd of 2600 may not understand the 
words her rich high voice brings it to its feet 
after five concerts in boston the tour goes on to new york 
baltimore washington san antonio and los angeles 
for the performers it is an odyssey as much as a tour since 
many are seeing skyscrapers elevators and superhighways for the 
first time 
in my country the dancers and musicians are repressed because 
it is thought to be primitive said botika ekalaka a member of 
the batwaekonda pygmy performers speaking in french through an 
interpreter its quite extraordinary to find it appreciated 
here 
ekalaka said of the evenings performance that he had never seen 
so many people together in one place 
for some participants africa oye is not the first time 
theyve appeared on stage pop singer papa wemba has toured the 
world with his ninepiece band playing a blend of african rhythms 
and western instruments 
kouyate has been broadcast across africa and performed on 
television 
the show more than two years in the making is no mere 
collection of african music its producers say they scoured remote 
regions of africa for the masters of various traditional and more 
modern musical techniques among the 52 participants in nine groups 
are artists from zaire senegal mali guinea and niger 
the key to this is the variety the musical sophistication and 
the raw power said mel howard producer of the american tour 
african art is very direct it doesnt go to the mind for 
analysis it goes directly to the emotions 
some of the performers began their pieces on the stage and in 
the audience creating a thunderous stereo effect 
one of our tests is to keep the audience where they are 
because there is a tendency for an audience to join in said 
jeremy alliger head of an avantgarde performance group called the 
dance umbrella which is presenting the boston shows

workers protesting an ailing economy 
and the militarys role in the government staged a general strike 
friday shutting down schools businesses and mass transit 
no violence was reported but streets in paramaribo the 
capital were crowded with private cars and pedestrians curious 
about the success of the strike 
employees reported for work at the staterun suriname aluminum 
corp the former dutch colonys main source of foreign revenue 
and at the government power company police and firefighters were 
exempt from the strike 
the 24hour general strike called by four labor federations 
closed about 80 percent of businesses schools and government 
offices public transportation including buses and river ferries 
was halted 
the strike was called to show discontent with the government of 
president ramsewak shankar who took office in january 1988 after 
almost eight years of military dictatorship 
labor leaders said they called the strike to protest the 
deteriorating economy which includes 60 percent inflation and 
growing drug trafficking 
union leaders also want shankar to rein in the politically 
powerful 3000man army civilian leaders have little control over 
the military and army critics and human rights leaders are often 
arrested by military police 
another aim of the strike was to press the netherlands to renew 
a 15 billion aid program begun in 1975 when suriname gained 
independence 
the hague suspended aid after the military killed opposition 
leaders in late 1982 negotiations over renewal have stalled with 
suriname objecting to the netherlands demand for more control over 
how the money is spent

president bush over panamanian objections 
will send a 14person commission to observe what he predicts will 
be fraudulent elections in the central american nation sunday the 
white house said friday 
the observers led by rep john murtha dpa will leave 
saturday and fly to a us air base in panama to avoid that 
nations visa requirements said white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater 
naming the observer panel is part of the bush administraions 
strategy to focus world attention on the election in panama where 
the united states has tried unsuccessfully for more than a year to 
get gen manuel antonio noriega to relinquish power as the 
countrys de facto ruler 
panamanian officials have made it clear the offical us 
observer team would not be welcome 
one us official noted that if panama blocks the us observers 
from visiting polling places the action would serve the 
administrations purposes of casting noriega in a bad light 
bush and administration officials have predicted noriega will 
steal the election for his presidential candidate carlos duque 
they cite numerous instances of registration and ballot 
improprieties in the election preparations 
fitzwater said us officials have informed the appropriate 
authorities in panama about the teams arrival however he said 
he did not know how the panamanians had responded 
were sending them in without visas they probably wont have 
to have them fitzwater said 
but reports from panama have quoted officials as saying the 
observers would not be welcome and that only those invited by the 
government will be allowed to observe the balloting 
that in itself would be a comment on the free and open 
nature of their elections fitzwater said when asked about 
panamanian objections to a us team 
we would expect this delegation to be able to observe many 
aspects of the election we expect they will have access to a 
number of opportunities to view the polling places fitzwater 
said 
we have every reason to believe theyll be able to carry those 
out 
private observer teams also have been organized one headed by 
former presidents carter and ford under the auspices of the 
nonprofit national democratic institute for international affairs 
and the national republican institute for international affairs 
other members of the official us observer team are reps larry 
smith dfla lawrence coughlin rpa alan mollohan dwva 
dan glickman dkan and robert lagomarsino rcalif plus sens 
john mccain rariz bob graham dfla and connie mack rfla 
also in the delegatin are miami mayor javier suarez former 
ambassador to panama jack vaughn former sen richard stone of 
florida andrew gibson of the panama canal commission and michael 
kozak acting assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
governments electoral tribunal has released figures showing that 
more than 118 million panamanians are registered to vote in 
sundays elections an unbelievable increase of over 160 per cent 
of the total numnber of votes cast in the 1984 elections 
under questioning she said any increase of such magnitude would 
indicate the figures are falsified 
she also said that socalled dignity battalions in panama 
are being armed to intimidate the opposition and to discourage all 
thoughts of organized protest after the election

randy hikes her black spandex 
miniskirt up a little further before stepping away from the doorway 
and into the thick springtime rain falling on purchase street 
no customers in sight 
gray and empty its a slow afternoon along the sixblock 
stretch of rundown storefronts and restaurants known as weld 
square a section of this old whaling port where the easy money is 
in sex and drugs 
the lure is strong enough to draw women like randy onto the 
streets even as police continue a wellpublicized hunt for a 
serial killer who has found them such easy marks that he has 
murdered at least nine in the past year many of them single 
mothers with drug habits two more women are missing 
the girls are getting killed because theyre easy to grab and 
easy to lure into a car said mary a former prostitute 
struggling with a recent relapse into heroin addiction and even 
though they try to keep an eye on each other theres no real 
protection 
bigcity prostitution in crowded areas like new yorks times 
square offers protection thats missing in new bedford 
there are few pimps and no local bythehour hotels the streets 
are not busy with pedestrians 
in new bedford prostitution is a business conducted away from 
people often in cars parked under railroad trestles or in shadowy 
alleys 
city clerk janis davidian likened the weld square strip to a 
shopping mall where any stranger can take a highway off ramp to 
easy sex 
its a smalltown kind of prostitution not sophisticated 
she said but anyone who is required by their job to get into 
cars with strangers is certainly vulnerable 
recent affidavits filed in a case against a new bedfordarea man 
charged with several assaults paint a vivid picture of the dangers 
the women face 
twelve prostitutes interviewed by state police provided 
strikingly similar portraits of violence against them by the 
26yearold man who appeared friday in district court 
they said he would pick them up in his truck and promise drugs 
or money he would take them to a cemetery and force them into sex 
he didnt pay and to protect their business the women didnt 
complain to authorities until state police sought them out as part 
of the serial killings investigation 
their relationship to drugs is what ties these women together 
men turn to crime and women turn to prositution said debra 
robbin director of the new bedford womens center its a 
survival tactic borne out of desperation its not a career 
choice 
norman a general contractor and longtime resident of weld 
square says he has never been a customer but has watched his 
sisterinlaw and other friends turn to prostitution as they 
wrestle powerful addictions to heroin and cocaine you start out 
selling a little and then you sell a little more said norman 
who like most other residents interviewed asked that his last name 
not be used then all of a sudden all youve got left to sell is 
yourself thats when they become backalley girls if you can give 
them 15 minutes and 20 then youve got a deal and theyve got a 
fix 
mary who said she straightened out six years ago after deciding 
to go back to school and get a teaching degree said drugs are what 
push scores of prostitutes to endure constant threats and repeated 
assaults 
when somebody is sick from needing a fix they are in a 
tremendously vulnerable position she said all they need is 
someone i dont care who it is to offer them a little bit of 
dope just a little bit

the parents of a 6weekold girl whose body 
was found in a trash barrel in missouri are suspects in the death 
investigators said today 
robert and paula sims had told authorities the baby was abducted 
much like another infant daughter three years ago who also was 
found dead 
the focus of the investigation is now leading to the 
parents said detective sgt rick mccain of the alton police 
department an arrest is forthcoming 
but mccain did not say when an arrest might be made 
he said the parents had never been ruled out as suspects because 
of the similarities between heathers disappearance and that of 
their firstborn daughter loralei in 1986 
a thorough search late thursday of the couples home and two 
vehicles and the home of mrs sims mother produced valuable 
evidence mccain said 
authorities broke windows to get into the sims home in this town 
several hours after an autopsy across the mississippi river in west 
alton mo confirmed the identity of the body found there 
the simses were not at home but went to the alton police 
station to answer questions later thursday said west alton sgt 
rick mccain 
police refused to say what they were looking for at the home 
dr mary case the st charles county medical examiner would 
not comment on heathers cause of death but said it was a homicide 
at the old lock and dam a popular spot for fishing and boating 
30 miles north of st louis at least two dozen federal state and 
local investigators assisted by dogs searched for evidence where 
heathers body was found 
we really want to solve this case thats all were worried 
about right now said a sheriffs officer who helped seal off the 
area and did not want to be identified weve got a whole bunch 
of people here because solving this case is our top priority 
a fisherman found the babys body wednesday night he searched 
the barrel and found the body in a plastic bag after he saw someone 
acting suspiciously said st charles county sheriff ed uebinger 
uebinger refused to say whether the fisherman had been able to 
describe the person seen near the barrel 
the couple told police that a masked man approached mrs sims 
while she was taking out trash saturday night and that the gunman 
forced her back into the home knocked her unconscious and took the 
infant sims said he was at work at the time 
in june 1986 the simses who then lived in brighton ill 
reported to police that an armed intruder barged into their home 
again while robert sims was at work and took their 13dayold 
baby loralei 
loraleis remains were discovered a week later near the couples 
home the cause of death never was determined and no one was 
charged investigators have said the simses were suspects although 
the couple denied any involvement in the babys disappearance 
the couple has a 15monthold son

japanese coproduction of americandesigned 
jet engines is a viable alternative for the fsx fighter plane 
but the issue remains to be firmly resolved pentagon officials 
told congress friday 
the officials sought to assure a house panel however that 
manufacturing technologies for critical engine components would not 
be provided to japan 
under the 7 billion fsx deal st louisbased general dynamics 
and japans mitsubishi heavy industry are to jointly codevelop and 
coproduce a new fighter based on the us f16 for deployment by 
japan in the late 1990s 
congressional critics have charged that the agreement amounts to 
a giveaway of valuable advanced technology that may be used by 
japan to propel its own aircraft industry into headtohead 
competition with the united states they say japan instead should 
buy americanmade f16s and help reduce the 55 billion trade 
deficit with japan 
resolutions of disapproval to try to stop the deal have been 
introduced in the house and senate even if the resolutions were 
passed however it would require a twothirds vote of both houses 
to override a likely veto by president bush 
the engine issue arose at a hearing before the house banking 
subcommittee on economic stabilization chaired by rep mary rose 
oakar dohio 
glenn a rudd deputy director of the pentagons defense 
security assistance agency said jet engines for six fsx prototype 
planes to be built under the development phase of the project would 
be provided a us manufacturer either pratt amp whitney or general 
electric 
oakar asked if the real goal of the japanese was to 
manufacture as many of the engines as possible in japan when the 
fsx goes into production about five years from now current plans 
call for 130 aircraft to be built 
rudd replied i think the japanese certainly would have an 
interest in licensed coproduction under the production phase of 
the project he added we have agreed with the japanese orally 
that that is a viable alternative 
the engine question will not be firmly decided rudd said until 
a separate usjapan memorandum of understanding is negotiated 
covering the production phase 
another defense department official air force lt gen ronald 
yates said that if coproduction of the engines is undertaken the 
united states does not intend to transfer to japan proprietary 
manufacturing processes used for critical components 
asked whether the japanese could simply copy the american 
manufacturing technologies yates said the metallurgy is in fact 
not something that you can reverseengineer 
in another development sen john c danforth rmo renewed 
his criticism of the pentagons role in negotiating the fsx deal 
during the reagan administration without consulting the commerce 
department 
after the bush administration took office commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher expressed concern over economic implications of 
the agreement prompting bush to send the deal back to tokyo for 
clarifications on the us share in the project and technology 
transfer questions 
danforth said one thing in this whole mess is abundantly 
clear we must never go through such a flawed process again my 
concern is that we have zero assurance that this wont happen 
again 
danforth and sen robert c byrd dwva have introduced 
legislation to require the commerce department to be an equal 
partner in all agreements with other countries on the research 
development and production of defense equipment 
in testimony wednesday before the house foreign affairs 
committee mosbacher said he is now satisfied with terms of the fsx 
deal

the international committee of the red cross is 
sending doctors to soviet georgia to treat victims of a powerful 
gas used against proindependence demonstrators last month a 
newspaper said friday 
the foreign doctors are being brought in because soviet doctors 
have been unable to determine effective treatment for the patients 
injured in an april 9 clash 
at least 19 people were killed when troops stormed the 
demonstration with gas shovels and armored personnel carriers a 
20th victim died when he was shot for violating a curfew imposed to 
curb the unrest 
izvestia the government daily said the red cross delegation 
was expected to arrive in the georgian capital tbilisi on friday 
to work with georgian doctors at a hospital where the injured 
demonstrators are being treated 
but activist sergei dandurov said in a telephone interview from 
tbilisi that the delegation had not yet arrived 
soviet authorities have said a gas known in the west as cs was 
used in the demonstration it is an incapacitating agent whose 
effects are similar to a nerve toxin 
dozens of people suffering problems with their nervous system 
vision respiration and internal organs are still hospitalized and 
some have begun a hunger strike to press authorities to reveal more 
about the effects of the gas and appropriate treatment 
human rights campaigner andrei d sakharov traveled to tbilisi 
on thursday and told reporters he supports red cross help 
according to dandurov 
sakharov is part of a team of newly elected members of the new 
soviet parliament who are investigating the april 9 violence he 
historian dmitry likhachev and space scientist roald sagdeyev 
belong to an independent investigating commission 
izvestia said sakharov and other commission members met thursday 
with georgias health minister and dandurov said they visited the 
injured in a hospital on friday 
it is the second factfinding trip sakharov has made to a 
nationalist hot spot in the soviet union last year he visited 
yerevan armenia to help mediate a dispute over nagornokarabakh 
a part of neighboring azerbaijan that armenians claim is theirs 
in another development about 1000 georgian women gathered 
friday night outside government house the site of the bloody april 
9 demonstration to demand that authorities take stronger action to 
treat gas poisoning victims dandurov said they also demanded that 
authorities free four georgian activists arrested on charges of 
organizing the protest 
georgian party chief givi gumbaridze told the protesters the 
courts would decide the fate of the arrested activists according 
to dandurov 
the women demonstrators then marched to a hospital where the 
victims are being treated and raised nationalist flags on the 
buildings balconies he said

accompanied on his tour by transportation secretary samuel skinner 
and adm paul yost commandant of the coast guard 
exxon corp owner of the exxon valdez the tanker that ran 
aground on march 24 dumping 11 million gallons of crude into the

respond fast enough to help in the crisis the federal government 
is now coordinating the cleanup effort which is being paid for by 
exxon

going to have to do more 
quayle said that his trip to australia indonesia thailand and 
singapore his second foreign excursion since he became vice

austrian chancellor franz vranitzky said 
friday that president bushs planned trip to poland and hungary was 
a promising undertaking that could help efforts to dismantle 
communism in eastern europe 
vranitzky said bush had quizzed him about recent economic and 
political reforms in eastern europe at a 45minute white house 
meeting the president took a good deal of interest in our 
assessment he told reporters 
vranitzky said he and bush agreed on the necessity that the 
west should in a careful approach lend a helping hand to promote 
the success of the eastern european reforms 
bush intends to visit austrias neighbor hungary as well as 
poland in july to underscore us support for the reforms 
on april 17 bush announced economic incentives to reward poland 
for steps taken toward democracy and to encourage further political 
and economic reforms the package included asking congress to lower 
tariffs on certain polish imports and seeking congressional 
approval of usguaranteed loans to stimulate private investment 
in poland 
austria a neutral nation bordering the soviet bloc has been at 
the forefront of encouraging reform in eastern europe bushs 
visit vranitzky said is a promising undertaking if this visit 
could lead to a deeper conviction on both sides that ending 
communism should be a goal to be strived for it is very 
welcome from our point of view 
the chancellor who heads austrias socialist party and the 
countrys coalition government said the removal this week of a 
barbed wire fence on the austrianhungarian border was a very 
significant step signaling hungarys intention to remove all 
barriers between it and the west 
vranitzky said he had assured bush that although austria was 
considering joining the 12nation european economic community this 
will not dilute her position of neutrality 
under the 1955 state treaty approved by the soviet union the 
united states britain and france austria vowed to maintain 
neutrality to win the withdrawal of the allied forces which 
occupied the country because of its association with nazi germany 
in world war ii 
the chancellor told reporters that the necessary austrian 
political decisions will be made soon so that the eec application 
can be made in the course of this year probably

delegates from 81 countries closed a 
un conference friday with a pledge to end by the year 2000 the 
production and use of chemicals that are rapidly destroying the 
earths ozone layer 
the helsinki delegates who represented most of the worlds 
population also agreed to set up a system to help third world 
countries pay to replace equipment or westernimported consumer 
products that emit the chemicals but they left open how much aid 
will be involved how the industrial countries will finance it and 
who will control it 
scientists at the fourday meeting said ozone was being lost 
much more quickly than envisioned in 1987 when leading producers 
of ozonedepleting chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs agreed in montreal 
to cut emissions in half by 1999 
however mostafa k tolba director of the un environment 
program told delegates in helsinki that the situation represents 
an environmental timebomb 
cfcs are most commonly used in refrigerators air conditioners 
aerosols and cleaning materials for the metal and electronics 
industries 
when they rise into the atmosphere they damage the ozone layer 
15 to 25 miles up that blocks some of the suns ultaviolet rays 
scientists say the extra radiation increases cases of skin cancer 
and eye disease and damages smaller plants and animals crucial to 
the natural food chain 
delegates in helsinki unanimously adopted their declaration to 
phase out the production and consumption of cfcs worldwide by the 
year 2000 
included in the accord was the united states the worlds 
largest producer of cfcs it makes nearly 40 percent of the 
chemicals and consumes about 30 percent 
the delegates also said they would phase out halons which are 
ozonedestroying gases used in sprinkler systems and fire 
extinguishers they gave no target date 
tolba told a news conference friday that the helsinki meeting 
exceeded all expectations and succeeded in a translation of 
words into actions 
but the helsinki declaration does not become legally binding 
unless it as adopted as an addendum to the montreal protocol a 
followup meeting is scheduled in london next spring 
the delegates in helsinki energetically debated proposals to set 
up the fund to help the developing countries conform to treaty 
requirements 
industrial countries argued that setting up a bureaucracy to 
oversee the fund could waste money better spent on aid 
developing countries said they wanted assurances that the fund 
would not take money from other aid projects like housing 
environmental groups which were among more than 100 observers 
at the closed meetings charged that the declaration was 
purposely kept vague on all major points 
representatives of greenpeace said other hazardous chemicals 
should have been added to five cfcs and three halons to be cut in 
half under the montreal pact 
scientists from industrial countries joined greenpeace in 
arguing that carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform which are 
used in solvents should be blacklisted they said the chemicals 
have a much greater ozonedepleting potential than cfcs 
methyl chloroform is used in typewriter correction fluid 
the two chemicals escaped the original ban because they are 
shortlived once released into the air cfcs have an atmospheric 
life of up to 100 years

services spotted owl habitat management plan 
environmentalist charge the plan fails to set aside enough of 
the regions oldgrowth forests to ensure the survival of the owl 
and the timber industry has said that plan closes too many acres to 
logging 
dwyers injunction covered more than 140 sales representing 
about onefifth of the agencys planned sales program for this 
fiscal year 
the judge has set a trial for june 13 
about 2000 breeding pairs of owls are thought to live almost 
exclusively in the oldgrowth forests of oregon washington and 
northern california their fate has touched off a raging dispute 
between environmentalists and the regions timber industry 
the us fish and wildlife service last week proposed protecting 
the owl as a threatened species

indian activist eddie hatchers attorney 
said friday that his client stands no chance of a fair trial if he 
is extradited to north carolina to faces charges of kidnapping 14 
people at a newspaper office 
charles garry told a news conference at the hall of justice that 
he will fight efforts by robeson county authorities to try hatcher 
on state charges of kidnapping garry said racism is rampant in the 
mostly rural north carolina county which has roughly equal numbers 
of whites blacks and indians 
hatcher 31 appeared briefly in san francisco municipal court 
but was ordered to return may 23 after garry has a chance to review 
case documents and decide whether to pursue an appellate court stay 
of hatchers extradition or request a full hearing before 
california gov george deukmejian garry officially joined the case 
friday morning 
hatcher and fellow tuscarora indian timothy jacobs were accused 
of holding hostages for 10 hours in the offices of the robesonian 
newspaper in lumberton nc in february 1988 they said they were 
trying to draw attention to involvement by local law enforcement 
officials in drug trafficking 
the two were tried and acquitted on federal charges but later 
charged by the state garry said the state charges constitute 
double jeopardy 
jacobs pleaded guilty thursday to all 14 charges he was 
sentenced to six years in prison followed by a sixyear suspended 
sentence and up to five years of probation 
hatcher was arrested in san francisco march 10 after 
unsuccessfully seeking asylum at the soviet consulate his bail has 
been set at 1 million 
garry who defended black panthers bobby seal and huey newton 
and wrote the book streetfighter in the courtroom said he 
would appeal to the governors compassionate side and see if it 
works as well as his armenian sense of justice 
the latter was a reference to armenias history of genocide and 
racism at the hands of greater powers deukmejian is of armenian 
descent and garry was born in massachusetts to armenian immigrants 
named garabedian 
the attorney said he would present ample reliable evidence 
of the alleged racism in robeson county 
the governor of california could do us a great justice by 
keeping eddie hatcher here said the rev leon white of north 
carolina as he flanked garry 
hatchers mother thelma clark of pembroke nc attended the 
hearing and news conference wearing a gray suit and white banner 
with red letters that read eddie hatcher is my son 
if the governor of california sends my son back he might as 
well hold a gun to his head and pull the trigger she said 
the rev ben chavis a san francisco state university professor 
and executive director of the united church of christ commission 
for racial justice in washington dc said the commission will 
lobby with the public on hatchers behalf

a federal judge on friday ordered the fbi 
to reorganize what he called an excessively subjective 
promotion system that resulted in discrimination against hispanic 
agents 
but us district judge lucius bunton refused to make the agency 
adopt ethnic promotion quotas saying the fbi can take other steps 
to make sure hispanics get the experience they need for career 
advancement 
the imposition of quotas or preferential promotion are drastic 
remedies which should be ordered only upon a showing that the 
discriminating employer has resisted less intrusive reforms 
bunton said ruling on a discrimination suit brought by 311 
hispanic agents 
up to 200 hispanic agents could be eligible for promotion under 
the ordered reforms and federal officials have said buntons order 
could affect how other us law enforcement agencies promote and 
assign employees 
the judge also reinforced the power of the fbis national career 
board and stripped local fbi agentsincharge of the power to 
override board decisions 
bernardo m mat perez of el paso who filed the lawsuit in 
1987 hailed buntons order as the end of an arbitrary and unfair 
system of promotion 
we have cracked the case said perez the fbis 
highestranking hispanic agent we have broken the good old boy 
network today it a fairer system is going to start 
bunton rejected the agents request for back pay and extra 
compensation for tedious duties they do disproportionately such as 
listening to spanishlanguage wiretaps 
however plaintiffs attorney antonio silva stressed that the 
plaintiffs werent after money 
all of the agents have told me that if it was one cent or 10 
million they would trade it all to stop discrimination within the 
fbi silva said what we were after in this case was the 
rightful place of these agents and to eradicate discrimination and 
we believe the judge has done that 
what the judge has done is change the bureau in a way that 
will benefit all agents it makes the bureau a better place for 
everyone male female regardless of ethnicity 
we are looking with care at judge buntons ruling with an eye 
toward building further on the many improvements already undertaken 
in the fbis personnel practices fbi director william s 
sessions said in a statement 
the judge acknowledged that the fbi has taken significant 
steps to curb discrimination since his initial ruling against it 
in september but said they were not enough 
among the reforms bunton ordered is appointment of a 
threemember panel to review plaintiffs claims that they were 
denied promotions because of discrimination 
of the agents who joined the suit 200 are eligible for the 
special promotion review based on thir seniority and career 
status hispanics make up less than 5 percent of the fbis 9000 
agents 
the fbi also must record and transcribe proceedings of its 
career board a standing body that evaluates promotions 
in stripping fbi agentsincharge of the ability to disregard 
career board recommendations the judge called the practice an 
anathema to nearly every reform advanced by the bureau 
the agency must improve the fairness and reviewability of an 
excessively subjective promotional process he said 
perez filed the suit after a series of demotions dropped him 
from agentincharge in san juan puerto rico to the no 2 spot in 
el paso he claimed the demotions were based on his ethnic 
heritage while the fbi cited investigative and administrative 
problems 
bunton ordered perez promoted to the next job level in the 
bureau within 45 days and said sessions must report to the court 
every 90 days on promotional decisions regarding perez until the 
agent becomes an agentincharge or is named to a job with similar 
responsibilities

americans took out 537 billion more in 
consumer debt than they paid off in march roughly matching 
februarys rate of growth despite a big dropoff in borrowing for 
cars the government reported friday 
the federal reserve board said consumer credit increased at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 94 percent in march off 
slightly from the revised 95 percent pace of advance in february 
for all of 1988 consumer credit increased 85 percent 
consumer spending is closely monitored as a gauge of the 
economys health because it represents twothirds of all economic 
activity the economy has showed signs of slowing in recent months 
in response to a campaign by the federal reserve board to restrain 
growth and ease inflationary pressures by pushing up interest rates 
economist cynthia latta of data resources inc in lexington 
mass said the strong credit figures were at odds with a stream of 
government reports pointing toward a slowdown and didnt 
accurately reflect the health of economy 
car loans heavily affected by rising interest rates grew by 
953 million in march a 4 percent annual rate of growth that was 
down sharply from growth of 239 billion in february when the 
annual growth rate was 10 percent 
auto sales have been weak this year as business dropped off 
under the weight of higher interest rates and slackening demand 
after earlier strong sales automakers in recent weeks have 
launched a new round of incentives in hopes of luring customers 
back into showrooms for the crucial spring selling season 
the category of debt that includes credit cards surged by 43 
billion in march a strong 289 percent annual rate of increase up 
from a 126 percent pace in the previous month ms latta said the 
figure was not to be trusted given another government report 
showing retail sales rose just 01 percent in march and other signs 
that consumer spending is slowing down 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by 
178 billion in march an 11 percent rate of growth up from a 73 
percent rate of advance in february 
mobile home debts meanwhile dropped 167 billion a huge 769 
percent annual rate of decline analysts said the decrease 
reflected a shift of debt into the category of bank loans rather 
than an actual dropoff in borrowing for mobile homes 
the various changes left total consumer debt at a seasonally 
adjusted 69277 billion in march

president bush is standing by his appointments 
of donald gregg and john negroponte to key ambassadorships despite 
congressional roadblocks over questions about their roles in the 
irancontra affair the white house said friday 
the president feels both of those nominations are very 
important to carrying out the policies of the government in the 
areas in which he has asked them to serve he is very proud of both 
appointments and thinks they are outstanding men who should be 
confirmed said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
gregg who was bushs national security adviser when bush was 
vice president has been nominated as ambassador to south korea 
negroponte honduran ambassador when bush was vice president has 
been tapped as the bush administrations emissary to mexico 
negroponte attended a white house celebration of cinco de mayo 
a mexican holiday and was warmly introduced by the president as 
the next ambassador 
fitzwater also told reporters the president has not discussed 
the question of whether to pardon oliver north after the former 
white house aides conviction thursday on three felony counts in 
connection with the irancontra case 
in the past bush has called north a hero and said he hoped the 
former marine officer would be acquitted 
fitzwater refused any further comment on the north verdict or 
trial documents that suggested bush was involved in a reagan 
administration plan to make a quidproquo arrangement with 
honduras in return for its assistance to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
but when asked if trial documents which have caused some 
lawmakers to express reservations about negroponte and gregg might 
influence bush to back away from the nominations fitzwater 
indicated that would not be the case 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the senate foreign 
relations asia subcommittee is said to have asked secretary of 
state james a baker iii to reconsider greggs nomination because 
trial materials raised doubts about greggs past assertions that he 
did nothing illegal or improper in his contacts with north and 
other irancontra figures 
greggs relationship with felix rodriguez a key figure in 
norths private aid network to help the contras during the 
congressional ban on aid was a controversial topic throughout the 
irancontra investigations gregg has repeatedly bolstered bushs 
assertion that as vice president he did not know the extent of 
norths clandestine efforts 
greggs confirmation hearing is scheduled for next week 
the foreign relations committee delayed a vote on negropontes 
nomination last month after some democratic senators requested more 
time to review whether as ambassador to honduras he was involved in 
a quid pro quo arrangement to entice honduras to help the rebels 
john sununu bushs chief of staff has cited a cable from 
negroponte as proof that bush did not engage in a discussion of 
such arrangements for the contras when he met with honduran 
president roberto suazo in early 1985 
fitzwater said the appropriate congressional committees would be 
briefed on confidential cables that described bushs activities in 
that regard 
bush on thursday denied being involved in any quid pro quo 
arrangement nd denied knowing of any such effort by others in the 
administration 
documents from the north trial had bush and suazo meeting at a 
time when internal reagan administration memos suggested a plan in 
which continuing us aid to latin american countries would be 
linked to assistance for the rebels 
the document never asserted that bush discussed a quid pro quo 
arrangement with suazo but it said he explained to the hondurans 
that they were to receive a great deal more us economic and other 
aid aid that the document said was part of a deal approved by 
thenpresident reagan

the investigation of new yorks commodity 
exchanges is narrower than a probe of chicago futures markets but 
focuses on fundamental trading practices common to both operations 
officials said friday 
federal agents raided the headquarters of four futures markets 
in lower manhattan on thursday seizing documents from at least one 
firm subpoenaing traders and sending shudders through the frenetic 
trading pits 
but officials close to the investigations by the commodity 
futures trading commission and manhattan us attorneys office said 
they were focusing on allegations of price fixing and other 
practices by a few individual traders and not the exchanges at 
large 
they said the fbi was not involved unlike a separate twoyear 
undercover probe in chicago where agents infiltrated commodities 
pits and secretly taperecorded traders 
its not something that hits out at you and goes boom boom 
boom one market official who asked not to be named said of the 
trading practices being studied in new york 
the cftc which regulates us commodity markets subpoenaed 
trading and broker records from the new york commodity exchange 
the coffee sugar and cocoa exchange the new york mercantile 
exchange and the new york cotton exchange plus at least six 
individual traders 
the cftcs civil probe is examining activities of more than 50 
traders over the past two years an official said the subpoenas 
request information detailing disciplinary action personal bank 
accounts and about leasing expensive and hardtoget memberships to 
nonmembers 
the us postal service executed two criminal search warrants at 
the offices of mbf clearing corp headed by mark b fisher a 
prominent trader on all four exchanges who was disciplined in 1985 
for trading violations 
id say he fisher is one of the focuses of it were 
certainly not limiting the case to just him said postal service 
inspector jack ellis 
melvin a brosterman fishers attorney said his client was 
cooperating with the government and had done nothing wrong 
officials confirmed reports that the scrutiny included 
prearranged trading in which dealers agree to fix prices 
beforehand and trades conducted to skirt tax losses or defer 
income 
critics consider the futures markets prone to fraudulent 
activity partly because of the volatile splitsecond atmosphere in 
which trading is conducted screaming traders wearing brightly 
colored coats use hand signals and shouts to coordinate buying and 
selling of futures contracts on commodities from oil to orange 
juice dealers and investors make money by speculating on the 
future prices of the commodities 
other violations may have occurred in a practice known as 
frontrunning whereby traders execute trades for their own 
accounts before those of customers 
traders legally are allowed to trade for both themselves and 
their customers but that practice known as dual trading has been 
widely criticized as a possible source of abuses 
while no indictments have been announced the criminal probe of 
the chicago markets which are the nations largest reportedly has 
involved more than 200 subpoenas and threats of racketeering 
prosecutions 
in new york meanwhile exchange seats were selling for about 
335000 friday on the merc after plunging from 350000 to as 
little as 285000 thursday after the probe was disclosed analysts 
said a similar pattern followed news in january of the chicago 
probe and seats there now are selling at record highs

west germany opposes a plan that would 
require nato to decide soon whether to modernize tactical nuclear 
weapons in europe foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said 
friday 
the plan by the canadian government is a compromise aimed at 
breaking a nato deadlock that has pitted west germany against the 
united states and britain 
chancellor helmut kohl whose support at home is rapidly 
eroding is insisting that the superpowers hold talks soon on 
reducing shortrange nuclear weapons in europe most of which are 
based in west germany 
west germany also wants nato to postpone until 1992 whether to 
modernize the missile fleet to give the rockets greater range 
kohl had a 30minute telephone conversation with president bush 
on friday the two leaders discussed the nato rift but us 
opposition to early talks on the missiles remains firm white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
we still believe early talks would be a mistake fitzwater 
said discussions that would lead to a denuclearization of 
europe would not be welcome 
fitzwater said the telephone conversation was initiated by kohl 
he would not give further details 
canada has proposed that west germany agree to the modernization 
and that washington in turn show its willingness to take up 
negotiations on shortrange weapons with the soviet union 
genscher asked his view of that idea during an interview with 
deutschlandfunk radio said west germanys position is that a 
decision not be moved up on whether or not we need a replacement 
for the missiles but that it be made at the right point in time 
namely 1992 
a government official insisted that genscher did not mean west 
germany was rejecting any proposed solutions to the nato feud 
this has been stated before that we dont think there should 
be a decision on replacing the missiles before it is necessary 
said the official who spoke on the condition of anonyity 
he said the government would not be giving its official position 
on any suggested compromises but they would be discussed privately 
among the nato partners 
discussions are already under way within nato and every 
proposal will be examined anything is possible said the 
official 
the united states and britain say taking up negotiations on 
shortrange nuclear weapons now could leave the west vulnerable to 
the superior conventional forces of the warsaw pact 
both nations say they want to see more progress on reducing 
conventional weapons during talks being held in vienna 
west germany says nato should not pass up opportunities to hold 
talks with the warsaw pact bloc on any weapons systems and that 
the time is right to begin negotiations on shortrange nuclear 
weapons 
the west germans also say no decision is necessary on replacing 
the lance missiles until 1992 because the rockets are not yet out 
of date 
most of natos 88 lance missile launchers are based in west 
germany and genscher has repeatedly stressed that his country 
should have a special weight in alliance discussions about the 
future of those arsenals 
in rome meanwhile the cabinet of premier ciriaco de mita on 
friday endorsed the governments support for negotiations on 
shortrange nuclear weapons if there is significant progress in 
eastwest talks on conventional forces 
italy generally sides with west germany in the nato dispute 
giving its qualified support for talks to reduce the weapons and 
saying it does not believe there is an urgent need to modernize the 
weapons west germany says nearly half of the 16 nato members 
support its position 
kohl and de mita met wednesday in rome to discuss the issue

nelson mandela urged south 
africans to work for peace among themselves said a colleague who 
was allowed to visit the imprisoned black leader for five hours 
friday 
harry gwala terminally ill with a neurological disease was 
accompanied by his lawyer and a friend to see mandela at the victor 
verster prison farm outside cape town he would not reveal who 
initiated the meeting or give details but he said part of the 
conversation was about violence in natal province 
a senior cabinet minister said friday the government wants to 
bring south africas black majority into parliament and the 
executive branch but on condition that the white minority cannot 
be overruled 
security for the 5 million whites can be ensured only in an 
environment of progress safety and justice for all the people of 
south africa chris heunis constitutional development minister 
said in a speech to parliament 
south africas 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs 
gwala who lives in natal said mandela gave him a message 
saying south africans should try and strive for peace among 
themselves and to keep up their determination to bring about a new 
south africa 
he and mandela both 70 have been members of the african 
national congress since the 1940s until gwalas release in 
november both were serving life sentences on convictions stemming 
from their involvement with the outlawed guerrilla movement 
fridays meeting was their first since 1982 when mandela was 
moved from robben island prison to the pollsmoor penitentiary 
gwala told journalists he had not expected to see mandela again 
because we were doing life we only had hope that we would see 
each other in a free country 
mandela apparently does not entertain hopes of beeing released 
soon gwala said but he seemed in good health from what we had 
heard he was very much improved he said mandela wore civilian 
clothes and no guards observed their meeting 
the heunis speech in parliament was a summary of proposals he 
and other government officials have mentioned in recent months he 
said details of a new constitutional system must be negotiated and 
offered few specifics of the new role envisioned for blacks 
no black leaders have accepted the governments invitation to 
constitutional negotiations militant blacks have rejected plans 
put forth by heunis but some moderates have indicated they would 
negotiate if the government freed mandela among others and lifted 
bans on black opposition groups 
speculation that mandela would be freed after the sept 6 
general elections increased with the gwala visit previous efforts 
to win his release have been blocked by the nationalist leaders 
refusal to renounce violence in the campaign for majority rule

pakistan accused afghanistan of 
hitting it with a missile and the communist kabul government 
countercharged on friday that islamabad and washington were 
preparing a chemical attack on an afghan city 
the official newspaper the pakistan times said friday that the 
foreign ministry summoned the afghan charge daffaires to protest 
that a sovietmade ss1 scud missile hit a refugee camp inside 
pakistan on thursday killing two people and wounding 14 
however local officials and witnesses said the blast was caused 
by a bomb dropped by one of two afghan warplanes that flew about 70 
miles into pakistans north west frontier province 
no explanation was made for the discrepancy 
pakistan and the united states are major backers of afghan 
moslem rebels who for the past 11 years have fought to topple the 
sovietbacked kabul regime and establish an islamic government 
in kabul the government denied the allegation and called it a 
plot by pakistan to divert attention from the military aggression 
and internal interference in afghanistan 
an afghan foreign ministry spokesman deflected us and rebel 
charges that communist troops were getting ready to use chemical 
weapons against guerrillas besieging the eastern city of jalalabad 
he said in a statement broadcast over official radio kabul that 
instead the united states and pakistan were giving such 
internationally outlawed weapons to the guerrillas 
the statement said kabul was ready to welcome united nations 
experts in order to assess these baseless allegations the 
republic of afghanistan has acquired no chemical weapons of any 
type whatsoever it does not and will not seek to obtain such 
weapons the use of which it considers a crime against humanity 
rebel commanders and some us officials in washington have 
reported that troops defending jalalabad recently received gas 
masks and protective garb in preparation for the use of chemical 
weapons against the insurgents 
the guerrillas have been attacking jalalabad 42 miles from the 
pakistan border since march 6 
soviet forces ended nine years of military intervention on the 
kabul side on feb 15 
the guerrillas reportedly are preparing new offensives around 
afghanistan after ramadan the moslem holy month of fasting which 
ends next week

malaysian coast on april 16 according to the only known survivor 
who was piced up by another refugee boat after he floated for 29 
hours 
it is one of the worst incidents of piracy we have heard of 
said jean marie fakhouri the un high commissioner for refugees 
in kuala lumpur

number and viciousness recently two attacks in march left more 
than 100 people missing and presumed dead

hammers stormed the refugees boat raped several women and 
attacked people said the un official in a telephone interview

130 refugees including 20 children said a statement issued by the 
commission 
pirates from two boats boarded the refugee boat shot and killed 
the vessels two pilots and its mechanic and raped some if not 
all of the 1520 women and girls as young as 12 the statement 
said 
then the pirates set the boat ablaze in the ensuing panic 
many refugees grabbed buoys and jerrycans and floats and plunged 
into the sea 
the pirates used sticks to prevent refugees from clinging on 
floating objects those who resisted were shot at 
pham swam away from his boat followed by another refugee who 
later lagged behind according to the statement about four hours 
later pham was swept back toward the refugee boat by ocean 
currents it said 
he met a woman who was holding on to two dead bodies in order 
to keep afloat they then tied three dead bodies together with 
clothing to make a raft it said the woman held on to the raft 
while the witness clung to another dead body they spent the night 
in this manner while the two pirate boats were still in close 
vicinity 
the pair reportedly heard shouts around them during the night 
but could not locate other survivors the next morning they 
spotted a boy 12 or 13 years old clinging to a jerrycan 
his jerrycan was later snatched away by another adult 
refugee phams account said the witness passed a floating 
dead body to the boy to help him float but the boy died of 
exhaustion 10 minutes later

decided to swim away but the woman was too exhausted and fell 
behind

japans foreign minister ended talks with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other officials friday without 
making any progress on a bitter dispute over the kuril islands 
the northern territories have always belonged to japan 
alone foreign minister sosuke uno told a news conference 
russians are entitled to believe they are entirely russian 
said soviet deputy foreign minister igor rogachev who addressed 
reporters after uno 
completion of a peace treaty formally ending world war ii 
hostilities between the two countries and a visit by gorbachev to 
japan both depend on resolution of the crisis 
the soviet union occupied the islands north of hokkaido after 
the end of fighting in 1945 and have rejected japanese demands to 
give them back both sides claim the islands belong to them 
historically and culturally 
gorbachev told uno that japan was using a double standard in 
pressing for the islands in remarks carried by the tass news 
agency the kremlin chief asked why japan doesnt consider that its 
similar claims to china and south korea are obstacles to fullscale 
relations with those countries 
there must be no room for a lopsided attitude to sovereign 
interests of states and the existing views of a people on some or 
other aspects of its relations with other peoples gorbachev 
said mutually observed balancing of interests is very important 
in bilateral relations and it is also important to avoid 
ultimatums in posing some or other questions 
the soviet union is improving relations with china opening 
avenues to south korea and seeking to boost its trade with the 
booming economies of the pacific rim many japanese companies have 
operated for years in the soviet union 
the soviets have pledged to remove 200000 soldiers from the 
pacific region as part of an overall reduction of their military 
force worldwide 
gorbachev also blasted japan for building up its military 
potential at a time when the soviet union is pursuing disarmament 
officials in japan are pressing for a gorbachev visit after the 
kuril islands issue is settled but rogachev said the soviets 
insist there must be no preconditions on either side 
the visit of mikhail gorbachev is on the political agenda and 
it will all depend on how we advance in our preparatory work 
rogachev said 
the soviet president in the remarks carried by tass said a 
visit to japan should be discussed early next year 
gorbachevs schedule this year is full with a trip to peking 
for the first sovietchinese summit in 30 years scheduled next 
week a trip to west germany in june to france in july and to 
finland and italy in fall 
uno said he would meet once again with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze at the united nations in september and that 
he was confident the two sides eventually could work out an 
agreement 
but he acknowledged that besides stepping up the work of a joint 
commission on the problem neither side had tabled any compromise 
proposals during his visit to the soviet union which began april 
30 
rogachev said the soviets were disappointed in unos reaction to 
their proposal to begin sovietusjapanese talks on disarmament 
in the pacific region 
he said his country views such talks as a starting point for a 
broader disarmament discussion such as the one encompassing the 
nato and warsaw pact countries in europe 
but uno said modernization and increases in soviet military 
forces makes us very apprehensive and that us forces exist 
as a means of contributing to the stability of the region

a juror in the oliver north trial said friday 
she had been using cocaine until three or four months before 
the trial but she said it did not affect her work as a juror 
that was months ago months before i got on this trial said

she first commented on her past drug use in an interview on wjla 
television in washington 
they asked me about it and i told the truth said miss king 
she told the ap she had used cocaine about once a week but never 
had a drug habit and had never been arrested for drug use or taken 
any treatment for it she said that she did not use any illegal 
drugs during the trial and that her former drug use had no impact 
on her during jury deliberations 
miss king said she did not tell the trial judge gerhard a 
gesell about her previous use of drugs because he didnt ask 
me 
that had nothing to do with me going to jury duty she said 
asked during the television interview how she was able to stop 
using drugs she said i said my prayers to the good lord

president bushs spokesman turned away 
questions friday about a pardon for oliver north as jurors began to 
recount their thoughts after convicting north on three of 12 
irancontra felony charges 
of four jurors who commented publicly three said north should 
go to prison for the crimes one said thats not for me to say 
jury foreman denise anderson said she believed north got a fair 
trial but she also said former president reagan should have been 
down there to testify because he knew a lot about what was 
going on 
asked if bush should have been compelled to testify she added 
yes im not leaving him out 
norths lawyers unsuccessfully sought subpoenas for both reagan 
and for bush who was vice president at the time of the events 
covered in the trial 
us district judge gerhard gesell will sentence north on june 
23 with maximum possible penalties of 10 years in prison and 
750000 in fines 
bush spokesman marlin fitzwater responding to questions on the 
subject of a pardon said he had asked the president about it on 
thursday 
he said i havent discussed it with anybody the white 
house press secretary said 
pressed by reporters fitzwater said we dont want to 
speculate either way theres been no discussion of a pardon 
whatsoever 
bush had in the past said that north a decorated vietnam 
veteran was a hero and had said he hoped the former white house 
aide would be acquitted but the president has repeatedly said he 
has not discussed the possibility of a pardon and he showed 
irritation recently at a published report speculating on what he 
might do 
fitzwater also said bush preferred not to have any comment at 
this time on the verdicts 
documents in the trial suggested a bigger role for bush than 
earlier revealed concerning the solicitation of other countries 
support for the contras but bush who visited honduras president 
in early 1985 declared thursday the meeting had not been part of 
any deal to provide honduras with expedited us aid in return for 
help for the rebels 
north out of the public eye on friday said thursday he would 
appeal and was confident of eventual vindication 
meanwhile most of the jurors rested in private after the 
threemonth trial and 12 days of deliberations but four commented 
ms anderson the 34yearold foreman said she saw the 
irancontra issue as a political dispute a war between the 
democrats and the republicans and when asked if north had 
taken the heat for higherups she said thats my 
impression but when asked if north should go to prison she 
said i think he should do some time 
she said she was glad for norths sake that in court he got up 
there and said something for himself but she said he didnt 
really impress me that much and she said she found the testimony 
of norths former secretary fawn hall phony i just did not 
appreciate her crying the way it seemed she had everything set 
up 
earl f williams 65 who served with general george pattons 
3rd army during world war ii expressed sympathy for north a 
former marine who served on the national security council staff in 
the reagan white house i think in my heart that he thought he 
was doing the right thing williams said and i think there 
were people higher who gave him authority to do a lot of things and 
then when he got caught out there high and dry no one came to help 
him 
at first he said it was not for me to say if north should go 
to prison but when pressed he said i feel that if hes guilty 
he should go to jail which he is so 
tara king 35 said she helped persuade fellow jurors who 
wanted to acquit north on all counts that they could not find him 
innocent of actions he had admitted you got it from word of 
mouth that he knew it was against the law she said and she said 
he should serve time in prison 
yet when asked if she considered north a hero miss king said 
yes in some sense he fought in the war he tried to save 
hostages he put himself out there 
later friday she said that she had been using cocaine until 
three or four months before the trial but that it did not 
affect her work as a juror that was months ago months before i 
got on this trial she said in a telephone interview after first 
discussing her past drug use on wjla television in washington 
ernest nelson 29 an electronics technician said he doubted 
that all the facts in the irancontra affair would ever come out 
and because a lot of lives were involved in some cases its 
probably best that it is kept that way 
asked if north should go to prison he said thats not for me 
to say 
ms anderson miss king and williams spoke at their homes ms 
anderson also was interviewed by cnn as was nelson 
the jury found north guilty of accepting a 13800 home security 
system from retired maj gen richard secord a codefendant whom 
north had hired to run arms to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
in addition the jurors convicted north of destroying altering 
or removing documents from the nsc north said former national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane told him to alter memos but 
mcfarlane testified that north suggested the alteration 
the jurors also found north guilty of aiding and abetting 
obstruction of congress in november 1986 through the preparation of 
a false chronology regarding the arms shipments to iran that 
engulfed the white house in controversy during former president 
reagans second term

president bush has decided to name everett 
ellis briggs now us ambassador to honduras as the senior 
national security council aide for latin america an administration 
source said friday 
in the job briggs who has held several foreign postings would 
be the chief white house official on a number of key foreign policy 
issues including the contra question in nicaragua us relations 
with panama and military support for latin democracies such as el 
salvador and guatemala 
the nsc position with the title of senior director does not 
require congressional confirmation briggs appointment was 
confirmed by a source who declined to be identified 
briggs has been ambassador to panama from 1982 to 1986 and was 
the deputy assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
from 1981 to 1982 in that state department post he had a hand in 
shaping the reagan administrations central america policies 
he has also held diplomatic posts in bolivia west germany 
portugal angola paraguay and colombia 
in his early days in panama briggs was embroiled in controversy 
when he accused by the national guard commander of using his 
diplomatic assignment to conduct spying activities and of 
interfering with the countrys internal affairs us officials 
denied those charges 
briggs was appointed by thenpresident reagan to the honduras 
post in the fall of 1986 serving there during the time when 
disclosures came out about the reagan administrations clandestine 
efforts to aid the contra rebels during the congressional ban on 
aid 
relations with the hondurans were a key factor in the private 
contra aid operation with the contras using honduras as a base of 
operations 
the bush administration has adopted a nonmilitary approach to 
the contra issue giving the rebel forces nonlethal aid until next 
february when elections will be held in nicaragua 
the contra army is encamped in honduras near the nicaraguan 
border and the us aid is to be released also for repatriation for 
those who want to return to their homeland

the military said friday that it 
seized communist rebel documents apparently calling for more 
killings of us military officials starting in june the staterun 
philippines news agency reported 
the rebels killed us army col james nick rowe on april 21 
as he was riding to work at the headquarters of the joint us 
military assistance group 
the new peoples army said it carried out the attack because of 
purported us involvement in president corazon aquinos 
counterinsurgency campaign 
the commander of us forces in the pacific adm huntington 
hardisty said friday that us troops will defend themselves if 
attacked but will avoid taking action that will put them in direct 
conflict with the rebels 
certainly if we are under attack or if your life is 
threatened youre going to take appropriate action hardisty 
commander in chief of the us pacific command told reporters at a 
breakfast meeting 
but i will only think that would be the bottom line in any 
involvement we certainly would not put ourselves nor our 
commanders allowing our forces to be put in a situation where 
there would be confrontation with the rebels 
the philippines news agency said the documents were seized 
thursday it quoted police officials outside the usrun clark air 
base 50 miles north of manila as saying the attacks on americans 
are intended to create a propaganda impact for the rebels 
hardisty said rowes death and threats against americans were 
rebel attempts to grab headlines but would not deter us support 
for the aquino administration 
we will not be intimidated by new peoples army terror 
tactics he said 
us ambassador nicholas platt meanwhile welcomed mrs aquinos 
announcement that the philippines will begin discussions with us 
officials before yearend on whether to extend the us bases lease 
here which expires in 1991

insurance company officials freed by a 
state supreme court ruling from the prospect of mandatory rate 
rollbacks said friday they could adapt to the rest of an insurance 
initiative passed by voters last fall 
the courts ruling thursday upheld most of proposition 103 a 
consumersponsored initiative that gives the state greater control 
over insurers 
but the court rejected parts of the initiative that called for 
mandatory rollbacks and a oneyear freeze of auto property and 
liability rates at 20 percent below november 1987 levels 
a lot of industry fears have been relieved because it appears 
the court understands what constitutes a reasonable return on 
investment said scott carpenter spokesman for the western 
insurance information service an industry group 
we think we can live with it said state farm insurance 
spokesman ron arnold 
many of the same companies had theatened to quit the lucrative 
california market after passage of proposition 103 the 
farthestreaching of five insurancerelated initiatives on last 
novembers ballot 
state insurance commissioner roxani gillespie blocked companies 
from leaving in the immediate aftermath of the referendum citing 
proposition 103s ban on arbitrarily refusing to renew auto 
insurance policies and a state law requiring a withdrawing insurer 
to arrange substitute coverage 
thursdays ruling broadens insurers exemptions from the 
proposed rate rollback and appears to allow current ratesetting 
practices to continue through november unless the insurance 
commissioner intervenes 
the conservative court ruled that the proposition 103 was too 
narrow in excusing insurers from the rollback and freeze only if 
they could prove a substantial threat of insolvency 
constitutional guarantees of property rights require a fair 
rate of return the justices said in addition insurers who 
apply for exemptions from the rollback can continue to set their 
own rates subject to a later decision by gillespie on whether the 
amounts are more than necessary for a fair return 
starting in november any rate increase will need advance 
approval from the insurance commissioner who is currently 
appointed by the governor but under proposition 103 will become an

nicaragua and cuba have 
provided more than twothirds of the arms used by the countrys 
leftist guerrillas who would wither as a fighting force without 
such support the military said friday 
col rene emilio ponce the head of the joint chiefs of staff 
called for linking the issues of cutting off arms to the salvadoran 
insurgents and demobilizing usbacked nicaraguan rebels known as 
contras 
this would make the pacification process truly regional he 
said in an interview 
a regional peace process began in august 1987 when five central 
american presidents signed a peace accord known as esquipulas ii 
that called for ending civil wars in nicaragua el salvador and 
guatemala 
as it is now it appears the only objective of esquipulas ii 
is to dismantle the contras and consolidate the sandinista 
government in nicaragua ponce said 
el salvadors rightist presidentelect alfredo cristiani 
echoed ponces claims friday during a news conference in costa 
rica he said the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front 
recently received new arms from cuba and nicaragua and i dont 
think this indicates the sandinista government wants peace he 
said 
cristiani who takes over june 1 as head of this countrys 
usbacked government said nicaragua is the main obstacle to 
regional peace 
he was in costa rica to discuss the next regional summit with 
president oscar arias who won the 1987 nobel peace prize for his 
efforts toward regional peace 
in san salvador ponce spoke in the joint chiefs briefing room 
next to an array of 30 sovietbloc weapons ak47 assault rifles 
dragunov sniper rifles rocketpropelled grenade launchers and 
submachine guns 
ponce said the weapons were among 60 eastbloc arms captured 
from insurgent forces this year 
he said 70 percent of rebel weapons come from cuba and nicaragua 
ponce said arms shipments to rebel forces increased beginning 
last september army intelligence now figures 1000 aks have 
entered the country in recent months 
the rebels says they capture the vast majority of their arms and 
munitions from government soldiers 
they maintain offices in managua but deny receiving anything but 
moral and diplomatic support from nicaragua 
rebel leaders interviewed in their northern strongholds say they 
have bought sovietbloc weapons including several hundred ak47s 
since late last year they say the weapons came from contra rebel 
camps in honduras 
some contras may have sold their weapons on the black market 
and the salvadoran subversives may have obtained some of them 
that way but not 1000 ponce said 
he said nicaragua sends arms to salvadoran rebels by land and 
sea in shipments of about 50 rifles at a time the land routes 
include a stretch through honduran territory along the mountainous 
border with el salvador 
ponce said that without outside support the rebels would lose 
their military strength and would have to resort to terrorism 
he said small nicaraguan vessels ostensibly fishing craft 
deliver arms to guerrillas at several points along el salvadors 
pacific coast 
but he acknowledged that no vessel has been caught transporting 
such weapons 
more than 65000 salvadorans mostly civilians have been killed 
in the countrys eightyear civil war

the robot magellan probe streaked on 
a nearperfect path toward venus on friday while atlantis 
astronauts melted metal and did other routine tests in orbit 
the astronauts work load was light because the heavy weight of 
magellan and its rocket booster totaling 45000 pounds had 
restricted the amount of experiments they could carry for the 
fourday mission 
conversation from the astronauts also was light as they 
methodically went about their work talking only sparingly with 
controllers on the ground 
the 7600pound magellan launched late thursday was more than 
175000 miles from the shuttle by late friday afternoon and zipping 
deeper into space its systems operating perfectly officials said 
it still had about 158 million miles to go 
barreling along initially at 25000 mph the craft slowed 
gradually to a cruising speed of about 7000 mph when it reaches 
its target in august 1990 the tug of venusian gravity will have 
increased the speed again to about 25000 mph 
the spacecraft was in excellent condition and on a course that 
was only 5 of a degree off normal magellan officials said such a 
deviation was expected they said and on may 21 a ground station 
will send a signal to trigger a small motor firing to adjust the 
path 
the spacecraft is performing just beautifully all systems are 
operational and nominal it couldnt be better john gerpheide 
magellan project manager said a few hours after the probe was 
launched it was really a wonderful day for us the beginning of 
the rebirth of the planetary program 
magellan is the first us planetary mission in 11 years and the 
first ever launched from a space shuttle 
mission control in houston awakened the astronauts friday for 
their first full day in space with the theme music from the movie 
superman 
good morning and congratulations on a super day yesterday 
said mission control communicator ken cameron 
good morning houston commander david walker replied 
were up and around everybodys feeling good trying to find our 
toothbrushes 
afterward the astronauts worked with a 128pound 
metalsprocessing furnace the size of a small microwave oven they 
also brought along medical experiments and several cameras for 
photographing the earth and night lightning strikes in the clouds 
below 
the crew was melting and resolidifying small samples of indium 
and selenium in the furnace to see how they react in 
weightlessness potential applications for such spacemade 
materials include advanced electronic and optical devices 
the astronauts reported one melting indium sample may have been 
affected by vibrations when walker briefly fired the shuttles 
steering thrusters in a test for the strategic defensive 
initiative the socalled star wars plan to build a missile defense 
system tracking devices in hawaii recorded the firings to help sdi 
engineers better understand the characteristics of ignitions in 
space 
flight director ron dittemore said in houston it was not certain 
the sample was bothered by the vibrations 
he reported atlantis systems were in excellent condition and 
the only problems were just annoyances he said a facsimile 
machine being tested for sending documents to the shuttle was shut 
down when its paper jammed and that a machine for measuring blood 
pressure in the jugular system failed 
mission specialists mary cleave and mark lee released magellan 
from the cargo bay by remote control late thursday slightly more 
than six hours after atlantis blasted into orbit from kennedy space 
center 
an hour later two bursts from an onboard rocket propelled the 
robot on the start of the 550 million mission to map the surface 
of cloudshrouded venus with a high resolution radar system 
venus is 158 million miles from earth but magellan looping 1 
times around the sun will travel 806 million miles to reach its 
destination 
the probes radar is to map up to 90 percent of the venusian 
surface during a 243day orbital period the images enhanced by 
computers are expected to show features as small as a football 
field that would be 10 times clearer than pictures obtained by 
earlier spacecraft 
the pictures could tell scientists much about the history of 
venus and how it evolved so differently from earth although both 
were believed to be nearly identical at the beginning of the solar 
system 46 billion years ago 
atlantis is to return to earth on monday landing at edwards air 
force base calif at 1243 pm pdt the other crew members are 
pilot ron grabe and mission specialist norman thagard

communist party leaders announced friday 
that private farming will be expanded and land will be leased to 
farmers for up to 50 years the official news agency bta reported 
it said the measures were in a politburo report presented by 
party chief todor zhivkov at a twoday central committee on 
agricultural policy that ended friday 
the agency also indicated there was disagreement over policy on 
food prices bta quoted stoyan ovcharov the economics and planning 
minister as telling the committee a new pricing system is needed 
to stimulate production but said nothing of agreement on such a 
policy 
as in the soviet union which recently adopted similar farming 
reforms orthodox communists worry that food prices might climb 
rapidly if government purchase prices are raised and private 
farmers produce more food 
privately cultivated plots account for only 13 percent of the 
land farmed in bulgaria but yields almost onethird of total milk 
production about 40 percent of meat and 50 percent of the eggs 
produced 
economic reformers argue that agriculture should be allowed 
freer rein to develop

the new incarnation of the loneliest 
repairman in town introduced himself to maytag co workers 
friday when officials marked 40 years of making washing machines 
and other appliances at their plant here 
gordon jump an actor best known for his portrayal of the 
bumbling station manager arthur carlson in the defunct television 
series wkrp in cincinnati is the new ol lonely repairman 
in maytag commercials 
i have a maytag washer and dryer in our home i could not be 
more proud to represent any product or group of people jump told 
workers at maytags plant no 2 
jump 56 succeeded actor jess white in march as the lonely 
repairman in march white spent 21 years as the character devised 
to promote a product the company said was so dependable the service 
department rarely was called he is now a maytag consultant 
plant no 2 started production on april 4 1949 since then its 
workforce has grown from about 450 employees to about 2500 and it 
has produced about 42 million automatic washing machines and other 
appliances said ron krajnovich maytag cos public relations 
director 
maytag one of the units of the more than 3 billion maytag 
corp also employs an additional 1000 people in another newton 
location 
before plant no 2 and its automatic products maytag had been 
making wringer washing machines and other appliances for about 40 
years 
i remember when most of the plant was just dirt floor the 
construction people actually outnumbered the maytag employees 
said bob lister who joined the company in march 1949 
we had hopes it would continue to expand but none of us could 
foresee this kind of growth said paul provin an engineer who 
joined maytag in january 1942 and will retire in december its 
been a super good place to work

warsaw pact nations opened negotiations 
on conventional weapons friday by pressing for superpower talks on 
nuclear arms jumping into a dispute that has split the nato 
alliance 
east german ambassador klausdietrich ernst warned that failure 
to hold talks on shortrange nuclear weapons could have negative 
effects on the vienna negotiations 
he said negotiations on tactical nuclear rockets are vital for 
east and west germans 
the way these weapons are stationed today it would be above 
all the citizens of both german states who would be the victim of 
their use he said 
us ambassador steven j ledogar said all the east bloc 
diplomats who addressed fridays meeting insisted that a set of 
parallel negotiations be held on reducing shortrange nuclear 
weapons 
ledogar suggested the sovietled alliance was using the vienna 
talks which are to focus strictly on nonnuclear weapons to play 
upon natos internal bickering over the nuclear issue 
i suspect that they know that theres a certain amount of 
discussion in the nato camp he said 
west german chancellor helmut kohl whose popularity is 
crumbling at home has insisted that superpower talks begin soon on 
shortrange nuclear weapons he also has asked nato to delay a 
decision on whether to modernize the missiles until after elections 
are held next year 
the united states and britain want the weapons upgraded quickly 
and reject talks with the soviets on reducing shortrange missiles 
they argue that the missiles are necessary because of soviet 
superiority in conventional forces 
in washington president bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
that work on conventional force reductions is complex but the 
united states and its allies are however encouraged by the 
seriousness with which the soviet union and its allies have entered 
into this negotiation 
what is needed now is for them to join nato in exchanges that 
are frank and constructive and enhance the chances for success 
fitzwater said in a statement 
ernst and soviet ambassador oleg a grinevsky said that the 
seven warsaw pact nations see talks on shortrange nuclear weapons 
and naval forces as part of overall efforts to reduce arms and 
increase security in europe 
the issue is sensitive in western europe where many are 
attracted to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs conciliatory 
gestures to the west but especially so in west germany where most 
of the missiles are based 
but ledogar said all parties agreed that the current round of 
vienna talks a resumption of negotiations that began march 9 are 
to focus solely on conventional weapons 
nato estimates the warsaw pact has more than a 21 advantage in 
artillery and tanks in europe and far more troops than the west 
washington argues that even unilateral cuts announced by 
gorbachev last year will not alter the balance significantly 
gorbachev announced in december that 50000 soviet troops and 5000 
tanks would pull out of east germany hungary and czechoslovakia by 
1991 the withdrawals began last week in hungary with the departure 
of 31 t64 tanks 
ernst said that further unilateral cuts by the various warsaw 
pact allies mean that by 1991 the soviet bloc will cut its troops 
by 581300 men 12751 tanks 10030 artillery systems 1010 
combat aircraft 895 armored vehicles and 30 nuclear systems 
grinevsky used fridays session to outline a plan dividing the 
zone covered by the talks from the atlantic to the ural mountains 
deep inside the soviet union into smaller regions 
he said the sides should work to agree on overall totals for the 
number of men and weapons each military bloc can possess but also 
agree on totals for each region 
but grinevsky failed to provide any weapons ceilings ledogar 
said such totals were vital for progress at the talks 
at the previous round of talks that ended march 22 the warsaw 
pact outlined plans for reducing troops and weapons 10 percent to 
15 percent below present levels by 1994 a further 25 percent by 
1997 and moving to completely defensive forces by the year 2000 
nato presented a more specific proposal for ceilings on tanks 
artillery and armored personnel carriers

floridas new abortion consent law for 
single girls under 18 has been declared unconstitutional by a judge 
who asked a higher court to clarify the statute 
judge jerry lockett said the law was so vague he was unable to 
hold a proper hearing on a petition by a 15yearold girl who is 11 
weeks pregnant and wants an abortion without her parents consent 
before the new law was passed last year unmarried girls under 
18 could obtain abortions without consent from parents or the 
courts the new law requires them to obtain permission from a 
parent or guardian if they are unwilling to approach them they 
may file a petition in circuit court 
but the new law and rules of procedure adopted early this year 
force judges to rubber stamp teenagers claims lockett said 
thursday 
the law requires judges to rule within 48 hours after a girl 
files a petition if a judge does not rule by then the girl is 
free to proceed with the abortion the matter has to be secret and 
neither the judge nor the state is allowed to call in testimony 
from anyone other than the girl 
a judge must grant the request if any one of these conditions 
are met 
the girl is sufficiently mature to make the decision 
consent for the abortion is being unreasonably withheld by 
the parents or guardian 
the girl has presented facts that justify the fear of 
physical or emotional abuse if she requests help from her parents 
or guardians 
any other good cause is presented 
the law is too vague the judge said i want the court to 
tell me how to determine if a girl is mature enough to make this 
decision 
the case was sent to the 5th district court of appeal in daytona 
beach if that court does not act in 10 days the girl can proceed 
with an abortion 
lockett said the law and the rules do not give the court or 
anyone who wants to intervene the right or the time to hold a 
proper hearing on the claims in the petition 
in this case the judge appointed attorney red boylston as a 
onetime guardian for the fetus and allowed him to argue the 
constitutionality of the statute and the rules boylston refused to 
comment except to say he agrees that the law needs to be more 
detailed 
the girl was represented by jerry blair who said she would 
prefer to have more specific rules she could use in petition 
hearings 
the judge said the higher court or the legislature should revise 
the law to assist judges 
even if it was some sort of a checklist something that says 
you have to find this and this and this that would be better than 
what we have lockett said

a university of rhode island professor 
filed criminal charges against four fraternity students who dressed 
as terrorists and staged a mock kidnapping in her classroom 
margaret haggerty said friday she brought the felony charges 
because she felt the universitys decision to put the lambda chi 
alpha fraternity on probation for at least one year was too light 
my goal wasnt to put these kids in prison haggerty said in 
a telephone interview my goal is to give them a sense of 
accountability and acceptable behavior and hope it would never 
ever happen again in a classroom 
haggerty was teaching a nursing class on death and dying dec 7 
when four men dressed as terrorists and carrying toy assault 
weapons and a toy handgun allegedly burst into the room and 
kidnapped a sorority president 
the young woman willingly went with them after the fraternity 
members spoke to her in greek said lt james mcdonald of the 
campus police 
as they were leaving the man with the handgun turned around 
about 10 feet from the instructor and pulled the trigger he 
said it made a popping sound 
for at least a decade sorority presidents have been kidnapped 
and ransomed for food which is donated to a local charity said 
thomas dougan assistant vice president for campus life 
it was a philanthropic event and this is a miscarriage of 
justice said one of the students arrested james e pennoyer 
iii who is the current fraternity president we didnt do a 
thing to her haggerty we came in and took a student who knew we 
were coming its totally ridiculous 
the teacher filed a complaint with campus police march 2 after 
the university reported its disciplinary decision the four 
students pennoyer 21 and david m jones 20 both of east 
providence antonio dasilva 23 pawtucket and michael i miga 
19 warwick were arrested and arraigned thursday on charges of 
felony assault by use of devices similar in appearance to a firearm 
the charge carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison in 
this case since no serious injury occurred 
the students were released on personal recognizance a felony 
screening date of june 7 was set at which time the campus police 
will turn the matter over to the attorney generals office the 
state office has not decided whether to pursue the charges said 
spokesman tom connell 
haggerty an associate professor of nursing said the four were

kidnappers freed two west germans on 
friday after holding them overnight but were holding a third 
hostage in connection with the trial of a lebanese hijacker in 
frankfurt palestinian guerrillas said 
there was no independent confirmation of the reported 
abductions and the guerrillas did not identify the alleged 
kidnappers 
in bonn west german foreign ministry spokesman hans schumacher 
noted that two of the alleged victims also disappeared briefly in 
lebanon a year ago he said he found their latest 10hour 
disappearance a bit strange 
lt col wajih abu ali the commander of the plos military 
police in sidon said heinrich struebig 48 petra schnitzler 26 
and markus michael 25 were abducted thursday evening by five 
gunmen outside sidon 
all three work for the asmehumanitas relief agency from an 
office near the southern port city 
the sunni moslem nasserite militia which controls the area 
around sidon said struebig an administrator at asmehumanitas 
and ms schnitzler a nurse were freed at 5 am 
the two met briefly with the militias leader mustafa saad at 
his office in sidon reporters were kept out of the meeting and 
were not allowed to speak to either of the west germans they hid 
their faces from photographers 
later struebig and ms schnitzler were driven to an 
asmehumanitas base it was closed to reporters 
the released two told me they are scared because the 
kidnappers have threatened to kill their colleague if they revealed 
any information about their abduction abu ali told reporters 
in west germany asmehumanitas spokeswoman dagmar nackunstz 
said the group could not confirm the abductions had taken place 
she confirmed struegib and ms schnitzler work for the organization 
and said the group has a worker with the first name of markus in 
lebanon but she refused to give any other details 
a palestinian officer in charge of security at the office where 
they work quoted struebig and schnitzler as saying michael was 
being held in connection with the case of mohammed ali hamadi a 
shiite moslem on trial for murder and air piracy in frankfurt 
the officer lt maarouf who uses just one name did not say if 
any demands had been made 
zdf a west german television network said the kidnappers 
apparently gave the freed histages a statement with their 
demands which included a light sentence for hamadi it 
identified the man still held as markus quint 24 who joined the 
relief team in south lebanon only 10 days ago 
hamadi faces life in prison if convicted in the june 1985 
hijacking of a twa jetliner and the murder of us navy diver 
robert stethem a passenger he admitted taking part in the 
hijacking but denies killing stethem 
in january 1987 shortly after hamadis arrest in frankfurt 
west germans rudolf cordes and alfred schmidt were kidnapped in 
lebanon they were eventually freed and a group that claimed 
responsibility for the abductions said the releases were a gesture 
aimed at winning a lenient sentence for hamadi 
the chief judge in hamadis trial heiner mueckenberger said 
the proceedings would not be influenced by any kidnapping 
abu ali told reporters five gunmen in a bmw stopped the 
humanitarian workers van and pointed automatic rifles at them 
and ordered the three to come out of the van quickly and lie down 
spreadeagled 
the gunmen bundled struebig in the trunk and forced the others 
to sit on their laps on the back seat of the bmw and sped away 
toward the south he added 
abu ali said nasserite militiamen manning a checkpoint on 
sidons southern edge fired at the car because the driver did not 
stop the vehicles leftside mirror was hit but the driver 
continued 
he said struebig and schnitzler were released outside sidon and 
took a cab to their base 
abu ali said plo chief yasser arafat was in constant contact 
with us by telephone to inquire about efforts to resolve the 
kidnapping issue he did not elaborate 
fifteen foreigners are held hostage in lebanon including nine 
americans the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
hamadis elder brother abdulhadi heads the security apparatus 
for the iranianbacked extremist group hezbollah the umbrella for 
underground proiranian factions holding most of the captives 
another hamadi brother abbas was convicted in west germany in 
the kidnappings of cordes and schmidt 
in april 1988 steubig and ms schnitzler were thought to have 
been kidnapped after they disappeared in lebanon for two days 
asmahumanitas later said they had not been taken hostage it 
said a proiranian shiite group involved with their disappearance 
apologized to the two after discovering their identities and 
sheltered them to protect them from fighting in the area

jimmy carter joined fellow former 
president gerald ford on friday to help monitor the presidential 
election which the opposition is proclaiming will be a fraud 
the opposition also complained that the government controlled by 
gen antonio manuel noriega closed an oppositionowned radio 
station friday 
ricardo arias calderon nominee for first vice president for the 
threeparty opposition coalition said proofs of government intent 
to steal sundays election are mounting daily 
it is our duty as panamanians to publicly denounce this to the 
world and especially to nations where there is true justice 
liberty and democracy that the dictatorial regime has been 
systematically excercising the biggest and most baldfaced fraud in 
our history arias calderon told a news conference 
polls give the opposition ticket headed by guillermo endara a 
big edge the opposition has hinted it may call supporters into the 
streets or call a general strike if evidence of fraud surfaces 
after the elections 
we havent the slightest faith in the electoral tribunal 
endara said 
carter said at a news conference friday the process of 
democratization of panama has been very slow and that is one of 
the reasons we decided to come here to monitor the elections 
carter and former panamanian strongman gen omar torrijos in 
1977 signed the panama canal treaties which give full control of 
the canal to panama on dec 31 1999 
ford arrived thursday night as part of an invited delegation 
headed by carter under the auspices of the council of freely 
elected heads of government carter is chairman of the private 
council 
no immediate government reaction came to fridays announcement 
in washington that president bush was sending an official 
delegation of 14 us observers headed by rep john murtha dpa 
to monitor the elections 
panama invited delegations from the european parliament and a 
number of latin and caribbean countries and said other delegations 
would not be welcome 
the official us delegation is to arrive saturday at us 
howard air force base thereby avoiding panamas requirement for 
entrance visas 
at another news conference government candidate carlos duque 
denied that fraud was planned 
the united states should say how this fraud will take place 
before the eyes of the world the observers will recognize our 
triumph duque said 
we do not seek a confrontation with the united states we 
think the us government has fallen for disinformation 
disinformation lead by the us embassy which has played an 
unfortunate role 
duque said noriega should continue in command of the defense 
forces but that this was up to the institution of the defense 
forces itself 
gen noriega has never violated the law and has always acted 
within the institutional framework of his command said duque 
as armed forces chief noriega is the de facto leader of panama 
the bush administration has predicted the elections will be 
blatantly fraudulent and accused noriega of rigging the balloting 
for duque 
arias calderon said the voting process is riddled with 
irregularities 
the opposition says an abnormal increase in the number of 
registered voters indicates double registration and shows that 
bogus voting cards are being distributed to progovernment voters 
a spokesman for endara luis martinz said radio suave owned by 
opposition legislative candidate carlos fabrega was closed friday 
but said he did not know why 
these days we dont ask those things here he told the 
associated press 
the opposition press has been closed in panama for 15 months 
but the opposition has had access to some radio stations 
duque handpicked by noriega has contended that the opposition 
is in league with the united states to cancel or delay the delivery 
of the panama canal to panama at the end of the century 
the duque campaign has made heavy use of news reports that the 
us government authorized 10 million for the opposition campaign 
to bolster its claim that the united states wants to manage 
panamas internal affairs opposition leaders deny seeking or 
accepting any foreign contributions 
the united states has sought noriegas departure since two 
federal grand juries in florida indicted him on drug trafficking 
charges in february 1988 
noriega denies the charges calling them a ploy to get rid of 
him in favor of someone more willing to follow washingtons wishes 
while noriega is not a candidate his rule is considered very 
much an issue in the campaign 
in february 1988 president eric delvalle tried to fire noriega 
following the drug indictments noriega who has held de facto 
power since he became defense forces chief in 1983 orchestrated 
delvalles removal 
delvalle was replaced by education minister manuel solis palma 
whom the united states does not recognize as acting president

the american bar association wont be allowed 
to screen federal judicial nominees unless it stops considering a 
candidates political and ideological beliefs the justice 
department said friday 
attorney general dick thornburgh said he intended to hold the 
aba to an agreement he says it made to revert to old language in 
its guidelines that doesnt specifically provide for any 
consideration of such views 
one of thornburghs top aides david runkel said that unless 
the aba accepts the agreement i dont think they will be 
involved in screening judicial candidates 
the abas standing committee on federal judiciary will be able 
to resume its participation in screening professional 
qualifications of prospective nominees as soon as it accepts the 
agreement as described by the attorney general runkel said 
the dispute broke out tuesday when aba leaders disavowed a 
statement thornburgh made to the house judiciary committee that 
they had agreed to stop considering political and ideological 
philosophy 
and that position was reiterated friday night by aba president 
robert raven who said in a statement the bar group does not 
examine and make value judgments about candidates political or 
ideological views 
problems of wording and problems of perception are curable 
raven said we look forward to working out mutually acceptable 
language with the attorney general 
they got our language go back to what it was in 1979 
thornburgh said in reply thats what they agreed to and we 
expect them to honor it 
concern among conservatives over the aba guideline surfaced 
after the senates 1987 vote against confirming robert bork to the 
supreme court thornburgh told the house judiciary committee on 
tuesday he shared the concern 
the bush administration is preparing to fill some 50 vacancies 
on federal district and appellate courts traditionally the aba 
has confidentially canvassed a candidates peers to assess 
professional abilities at the request of the administration 
it advises the president of its findings and delivers a rating 
to the senate judiciary committee during the confirmation process 
the issue is particularly sensitive because robert b fiske jr 
thornburghs choice to be his deputy attorney general has been 
criticized by conservatives for the way he conducted the screening 
process when he chaired the aba panel in the early 1980s 
sen gordon humphrey rnh has charged that fiske improperly 
told a liberal activist group the names of judicial nominees under 
review 
humphrey said fiske was guilty of leaking information which 
was provided to the aba in confidence to groups that use that 
information to mount campaigns against persons who are not yet 
nominated 
at tuesdays hearing thornburgh credited fiske with obtaining 
the agreement from the aba 
runkel said the attorney general stated what he believed was 
an agreement and prior to that and subsequent to that thats our 
understanding 
during his congressional testimony thornburgh said we are 
pleased that the american bar association standing committee has 
seen fit to withdraw from an area not only contentious but in my 
view improper for their consideration that is to say the 
political and ideological views of the prospective nominees 
but raven and harold r tyler jr chairman of the standing 
committee denied that the aba had ever considered political views 
except to assess whether they affected a persons professional 
qualifications 
in his statement friday night raven said if a candidates 
personal philosophy however incorporates racially prejudiced 
views for example we woud not agree that the candidate has the 
openmindedness and freedom from bias requisite for a position on 
the bench 
our practice in this regard has remained unchanged he said 
tyler acknowledged only that the aba had expressed a 
willingness to delete a sentence from the latest version of the 
backgrounder it publishes to describe the screening process 
the sentence that has raised the ire of conservatives reads 
political or ideological philosophy are not considered except to 
the extent they may bear upon the other factors 
runkel released copies of letters exchanged between tyler and 
thornburgh last month that he said had formed the basis of the 
agreement the agreement was sealed in a telephone call from tyler 
to the attorney generals executive assistant robert ross runkel 
said 
in an april 21 letter to the attorney general tyler wrote that 
the sentence has generated confusion and charges that the panel 
considers political or ideological beliefs 
this committee does not believe that that is the case tyler 
added nevertheless to make that as clear as possible we 
certainly are prepared to accept your suggestion of abandoning the 
language 
in sum tyler concluded be assured that to track the 
earlier language this committee does not investigate a prospective 
nominees political or ideological philosophy except to the extent 
that extreme views on such matters might bear upon judicial 
temperament or integrity 
in an april 27 reply thornburgh said i am concerned about the 
final sentence of your letter 
the attorney general wrote that in his meetings with raven and 
tyler i thought i had expressed clearly my view that the 
standing committee should in fact revert to its policy statement in 
effect prior to 1980 which excluded any consideration of a 
prospective nominees political or ideological philosophy 
i would hope we are in agreement on this point thornburgh 
said

with about 2200 people on death row and 
polls showing support for the death penalty at an alltime high 
several hundred opponents are meeting here this weekend to try to 
turn the political tide 
one reason for the change in public attitudes is irresponsible 
leadership by our politicians said max stern a leading boston 
defense attorney and organizer of the meeting of the national 
coalition to abolish the death penalty 
the regional conference begins friday night at harvard law 
school 
on saturday the coalition plans to honor gov michael dukakis 
for his refusal to abandon his longtime opposition to the death 
penalty for political gain stern said 
dukakis presidential campaign last year was deeply wounded by 
charges that he was soft on crime 
a gallup poll in december one month after the election found 
that 79 percent of the american public favored the death penalty 
for murderers that was 9 percent more than in 1986 and the highest 
percentage since pollsters began asking the question in 1936 a 
gallup spokeswoman said 
the poll also showed a dramatic shift since 1966 when 47 
percent of those polled by gallup opposed the death penalty and 
only 42 percent supported it 
stern and other abolitionists said the 1988 presidential 
campaign which made murderer willie horton a household name has 
left politicians across america afraid to buck public opinion 
its an expedient political tactic to take a very repressive 
view on the death penalty and then attack ones opponent by 
associating him with heinous criminals stern said thats the 
willie horton tactic 
although the tactic was used very effectively by president 
bushs campaign against dukakis stern predicted it will soon lose 
its potency 
horton fled from massachusetts during a prison furlough in 1987 
and later brutally attacked a couple in maryland where he is now 
serving a lengthy prison sentence the case was the subject of bush 
campaign ads attacking dukakis and supporting the death penalty 
the governor will receive the herbert and sara ehrmann award 
named after one of the lawyers who defended sacco and vanzetti and 
his wife who fought against their execution 
nicola sacco and bartolomeo vanzetti both anarchists were put 
to death in massachusetts in 1927 for the murder of a paymaster and 
his guard during a robbery 
four people have been executed in america so far this year 
including serial killer ted bundy said karima wicks research 
director with the naacp legal defense fund in new york 
she said abolitionists plan to stress the racist nature of the 
death penalty which studies have shown is disproportionately 
applied to blacks hispanics the poor and the indigent 
the supreme court has rejected a bid to overturn the death 
penalty on those grounds

ciudad nuestra senora la reina de los angeles de porciuncula 
ap americans wrapped themselves in the red white and green 
friday as they embraced the mexican holiday of cinco de mayo at 
fiestas and toasted a 127yearold victory over colonialism with 
cervezas and margaritas 
schoolchildren celebrated in the plaza at el pueblo de los 
angeles where a fiesta will bring at least 25000 people a day 
through the weekend 
theres lots of margaritas to be had said bartender tom 
madruga mixing the icy tequila concoctions at the mexican cafe in 
san diegos old town where the battle of puebla will be reenacted 
over the weekend 
similar festivities got under way elsewhere in southern 
california and across the southwest even on the east coast 
people are getting used to the idea we run some flyers so 
that everybody remembers may 5th said banquet manager rosalinda 
arrieta at an el torito restaurant in secaucus nj that planned 
pinata madness 
ms arrieta judge of a contest to see how many fiery jalapeno 
peppers customers could consume said guessing how many margaritas 
would be served during cinco de mayo would be very hard 
cinco de mayo marks the stand of an outnumbered mexican force 
against a superior french army at puebla in 1862 although the 
french emperor napoleon iii eventually withdrew his invading army 
from mexico for reasons other than the puebla setback it is a 
proud date in mexican history 
its a celebration of the underdog said actress carmen 
zapata who believes that nonmexican americans have adopted cinco 
de mayo because they can identify with that spirit through american 
history 
miss zapata is a founder of the bilingual foundation of the 
arts which named actors edward james olmos and jorge rivero to 
receive its el angel awards for contributions to hispanic arts 
at a dinner friday night 
i think that we are beginning to take our place in society 
here said miss zapata before the annual banquet ole salsa 
at the biltmore hotel 
i feel that we have and will have a tremendous impact on the 
american culture in the years to come 
but cinco de mayo wasnt just fun and food the nation also 
sought to deal with obligations to the burgeoning hispanic 
population 
in los angeles a considerably shortened version of the name 
originally bestowed in 1769 county supervisor kenneth hahn 
repeated his call for adding two seats to the board of supervisors 
to boost ethnic representation all five seats are now held by 
anglos 
hispanics comprise approximately 35 percent of the population 
in los angeles county but there is only a handful of hispanic 
elected officials to represent their interests this is unfair and 
unjust and the situation must change hahn said 
immigration and naturalization service officials observed cinco 
de mayo with festivities at a hollywood legalization office to urge 
temporary residents to file immediately for permanent status under 
the amnesty law enacted two years ago 
about 250000 temporary residents have signed up for permanent 
residency in the western region consisting of california 
arizona nevada hawaii and guam out of 18 million eligible 
applicants he said

leon as saying the fire damaged at least 40 percent of the palace 
at least 160 firefighters worked for more than an hour to bring it

nelson mandela urged south 
africans to work for peace among themselves said a colleague who 
was allowed to visit the imprisoned black leader for five hours 
friday 
harry gwala terminally ill with a neurological disease was 
accompanied by his lawyer and a friend to see mandela at the victor 
verster prison farm outside cape town he would not reveal who 
initiated the meeting or give details but he said part of the 
conversation was about violence in natal province 
a senior cabinet minister said friday the government wants to 
bring south africas black majority into parliament and the 
executive branch but on condition that the white minority cannot 
be overruled 
security for the 5 million whites can be ensured only in an 
environment of progress safety and justice for all the people of 
south africa chris heunis constitutional development minister 
said in a speech to parliament 
south africas 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs 
gwala who lives in natal said mandela gave him a message 
saying south africans should try and strive for peace among 
themselves and to keep up their determination to bring about a new 
south africa 
he and mandela both 70 have been members of the african 
national congress since the 1940s until gwalas release in 
november both were serving life sentences on convictions stemming 
from their involvement with the outlawed guerrilla movement 
fridays meeting was their first since 1982 when mandela was 
moved from robben island prison to the pollsmoor penitentiary 
gwala told journalists he had not expected to see mandela again 
because we were doing life we only had hope that we would see 
each other in a free country 
mandela apparently does not entertain hopes of beeing released 
soon gwala said but he seemed in good health from what we had 
heard he was very much improved he said mandela wore civilian 
clothes and no guards observed their meeting 
the heunis speech in parliament was a summary of proposals he 
and other government officials have mentioned in recent months he 
said details of a new constitutional system must be negotiated and 
offered few specifics of the new role envisioned for blacks 
no black leaders have accepted the governments invitation to 
constitutional negotiations militant blacks have rejected plans 
put forth by heunis but some moderates have indicated they would 
negotiate if the government freed mandela among others and lifted 
bans on black opposition groups 
speculation that mandela would be freed after the sept 6 
general elections increased with the gwala visit previous efforts 
to win his release have been blocked by the nationalist leaders 
refusal to renounce violence in the campaign for majority rule

coast guard commandant paul a yost in 
charge of cleaning up the nations largest oil spill on friday 
told exxon to put more crews to work and do whatever it takes 
to clean alaskas fouled beaches 
what i said to exxon this morning is that they are going to 
have to produce a significantly greater effort the admiral said 
that means an increase in the work unit productivity in 
exxons revised proposal for cleanup operations this summer yost 
must approve exxons cleanup plan before it goes into effect but 
said he has not yet made a decision 
earlier this week yost criticized the plan as poorly drafted 
and lacking in specifics the state also has criticized it and 
urged extensive changes but on friday he called the plan 
workable but it needs expansion 
yost was chosen by president bush to supervise the cleanup of 
the march 24 spill when the tanker exxon valdez slammed into a 
reef and poured more than 10 million gallons of alaska crude into 
prince william sound 
some of the cleanup is difficult to the point that one wonders 
if restoration will ever be possible yost said 
restoration will probably be done by the lord in the next few 
years i dont think restoration is going to be done by exxon in 
the next few months on all of the beaches its not possible 
a state official said that half of the oil in alaskan waters has 
dissipated and much of whats left has been churned into a 
taffylike goo and tossed up on beaches 
exactly how thats going to be dealt with i dont know said 
bill lamoreaux an environmentalist with the alaska department of 
environmental conservation a lot of it is tar balls the cleanup 
procedures are going to have to be tailored 
after a wind and rainswept sixhour tour of the area late 
thursday vice president dan quayle said he believes exxons 
going to have to do more than they think theyre going to have to 
do 
quayle returning from a 12day pacific tour met with a group 
of cordova residents before heading to the uss juneau a navy ship 
used as a base of operations for part of the spill cleanup and to 
smith island 
accompanied by his wife marilyn and joined by yost and us 
transportation secretary samuel skinner quayle abandoned a wooden 
platform built specially for his visit and tried his hand at 
hosing some of the oil off a rocky beach 
its going to be an enormous effort he said after looking 
at the blackened island an important resting and birthing area for 
seals 
the tanker exxon valdez slammed into a reef in prince william 
sound on march 24 causing the nations largest oil spill and 
sullying hundreds of miles of alaska coastline 
under exxons proposal 364 miles of coastline will be cleansed 
by sept 15 although nearly 200 of those miles may be left 
untouched to be scoured by wind and wave action 
the plan also seeks to dispose of waste by burying it burning 
it or discharging it through a wastewater treatment plant in 
valdez the company has asked for permission to bypass some 
environmental laws in order to dispose of the wastes 
in other developments friday 
the lawyer for joseph hazelwood said the fired tanker captain 
was not drunk when he left the vessel in command of his third mate 
prior to the shipwreck 
hazelwood left the bridge to do paperwork in his cabin below 
which was part of his normal routine attorney michael chalos told 
reporters after a brief court proceeding at suffolk county court in 
new york 
chalos asserted the accident could have been prevented had the 
coast guard been monitoring the vessel as was its responsibility 
hazelwood 42 of huntington ny surrendered to alaskan 
authorities this week on three misdemeanor charges of operating a 
vessel while intoxicated reckless endangerment and negligent 
discharge of oil 
his attorneys were in court to formally request that the 
fugitive from justice warrant issued last month be canceled judge 
edward green granted the request 
the alyeska pipeline service co in valdez which pipes oil to 
tankers from the transalaska pipeline said it will require that 
tankers leaving valdez be escorted by special 200footlong 
spillrecovery boats 
under the new plan every tanker leaving port valdez will be 
escorted by a tug and a large emergency response vessel loaded with 
oil containment and recovery equipment said george m nelson 
president of the company

potential sources of this fever has turned out to be exceedingly 
dangerous said dr robert kurtz director of the surgical 
intensive care unit 
the patients temperature dropped from 1001 to 998 on friday

neurological progress although she tired easily had a short 
attention span and was disoriented kurtz said in a statement

a winery worker accused of killing his 
wife two of their daughters and four other people in a bloody 
rampage pleaded innocent friday to charges that could send him to 
the gas chamber 
ramon salcido 28 looked glum and unkempt as he entered the 
innocent pleas to seven counts of murder and three counts of 
attempted murder in connection with an april 14 crime spree through 
the wine country north of san francisco 
and an expression of sympathy for a victim of that spree emerged 
from an unlikely place with hundreds of prisoners at the sonoma 
county jail collecting 900 during two days of peace for 
salcidos 3yearold daughter carmina who survived a cut throat 
allegedly inflicted by her father 
ive had enough of violence and what was done to her was pure 
evil said gabriel menjou 42 serving time at the jail on a 
forgery conviction 
i wanted her to know that men dont have to be mean and cruel 
but to know that they can be loving kind and caring said menjou 
salcido in an isolation cell at the jail charged with killing 
carminas mother and two sisters his motherinlaw and her two 
young daughters and a winery worker he told detectives he believed 
was having an affair with his wife 
he also is charged with the attempted murder of carmina whose 
throat was cut and trying to shoot to death two other people 
in court friday about 20 sheriffs deputies stood guard inside 
and outside the courtroom searching bags and passing metal 
detectors over spectators as they came in 
salcido listened to the proceedings through a courtprovided 
spanish interpreter but answered the judge in english saying 
yes your honor in a barely audible voice 
in addition to pleading innocent to all the charges salcido 
denied an allegation of multiple murder a special circumstance 
that if proved could result in a sentence of death or life in 
prison without possibility of parole 
municipal court judge knoel owen set a date of sept 11 for a 
preliminary hearing and refused to lift a gag order he imposed 
earlier in the case 
the fund raising for carmina was the idea of an inmate 
counseling group run by the rev bob gutleben the jails 
unofficial chaplain he had noted that inmates often have an 
unwritten code calling for the maiming or murder of pedophiles and 
child murderers 
in trying to help inmates deal with some of the really heavy 
hatred theyve directed at ramon we posed the question thinking 
about carmina what would be most helpful to assure her you as 
inmates would kill her daddy or something else said gutleben 
we asked them instead to give the gift that killers would not 
give the gift of nonviolence he added 
gutleben said he was shocked by the inmates outpouring of 
concern for the child numerous prisoners who have only 150 in 
their jail accounts gave 1 to the fund and several gave the full 
amount 
those who donated gave an average of half their savings he 
estimated 
these guys dug down to every cent they literally had in their 
pockets they are going to go without cigarettes and other basic 
necessities because they want to reach out of their anger and 
despair and direct something positive to carmina gutleben said 
gutleben who runs sebastopolbased covenant connection a 
nondenominational ministry to inmates and exconvicts said 90 
percent of the jails 690 prisoners participated in the collection 
drive and the twoday pledge of nonviolence 
sheriffs deputies have been concerned about the safety of 
28yearold salcido since he was captured in mexico april 19 he 
was brought to the county jail the next night where a furious 
crowd of 200 people shouted kill him 
weather stripping was added to his cell door to prevent inmates 
from slipping anything harmful inside authorities also put up a 
large metal plate to keep inmates from looking into salcidos cell 
through a window 
whenever he is moved from this thirdfloor cell for showers 
exercise or court appointments all of the 50 to 60 inmates on the 
floor are confined to their cells salcido also is accompanied by 
three guards 
twentyfour hour supervision which also serves as a suicide 
watch is provided by an officer watching salcido through a window 
in the wall of his cell 
carmina has been showered by hundreds of gifts at petaluma 
valley hospital and donations have poured into a trust fund set up 
for her carminas grandfather who has applied for custody has 
not disclosed how much has been raised

alexander mogilny the first member of the 
soviet national team to defect to the west arrived friday night in 
buffalo where he hopes to continue his hockey career with the 
nhls buffalo sabres 
sabres general manager gerry meehan accompanied mogilny from 
stockholm sweden after the budding soviet star decided to defect 
following the world hockey championships which ended earlier this 
week 
mogilny regarded as one of the soviets future stars was 
supposed to appear at a news conference called by the sabres but 
meehan said the 20yearold winger was tired from the trip and 
interviews with immigration officials 
his day has been so tiring we didnt want to put him through 
another exhausting round of exposure said meehan who declined 
to say where mogilny was staying 
meehan also denied an accusation by the official soviet news 
agency tass that the sabres were guilty of piracy in bringing 
mogilny to the united states 
the buffalo sabres were totally open and aboveboard in 
dealing with mogilny he said the sabres began talks with mogilny 
at the specific request of the player meehan said it was a 
voluntary departure 
meehan would not say whether mogilny had signed a contract and 
also declined comment on published reports that indicated a 
romantic relationship with an american woman may have been involved 
in the defection 
meehan admitted there are potential problems with international 
ice hockey officials the nhl and american immigration officials 
that could keep mogilny from playing for buffalo 
i wouldnt say they his chances of playing with buffalo are 
pretty good or pretty bad he said there are hurdles that have 
to be resolved 
soviet coach viktor tikhonov said the defection cast a shadow 
over attempts by other soviet players to sign with nhl teams 
soviet coach viktor tikhonov said he was disgusted by the 
defection and said it cast a shadow over attempts by other soviet 
hockey players to sign with nhl teams 
vyacheslav koloskov head of the soccer and hockey department of 
the state sports committee said in an interview published friday 
in the government daily izvestia he expected no serious 
repercussions in sovietnhl relations 
mogilny was accompanied on the flight from stockholm by meehan 
and don luce the sabres director of amateur development 
upon his arrival mogilny who was a member of the central red 
army team was interviewed at the airport by the fbi they do 
that with all defectors said tom middlemiss of the port 
authority of new york amp new jersey 
meehan said mogilny first contacted the sabres by phone on 
tuesday then met with meehan and luce in sweden the following day 
i had no idea he wanted to come on tuesday it happened very 
fortuitively he said he said the sabres did not contact the nhl 
before meeting with mogilny 
meehan said many details including presumbly mogilnys status 
as a soviet defector had to be worked out but he said there was 
plenty of time since the start of the next nhl season is five 
months away 
we hope hell be able to play next yearhe said 
meehan refused to discuss any details about a contract or 
mogilnys status with immigration or whether he had been granted 
asylum 
a us embassy spokesman said mogilny who helped the soviet 
union to its 21st world hockey title last week was granted a us 
visa on thursday 
mogilny was in his third year with the red army team and played 
11 international matches with the soviet national team before this 
season he was voted the worlds best junior player by nhl scouts 
in a poll organized by the hockey news 
but the right wing had his troubles with soviet hockey 
authorities he was suspended for 10 days before the world 
championships after a fight in a soviet league game 
a swedish newspaper reported last week that mogilny had a 
months salary withdrawn and lost his master of sports order 
he was also quoted by aftonbladet newspaper as saying he was not 
interested in a military career i want to do something else with 
my life he was quoted as saying 
mogilnys role as a junior lieutenant in the soviet army added a 
further diplomatic complication soviet authorities could view the 
incident as desertion

tina howes approaching zanzibar which 
opened thursday at offbroadways second stage is a lifeaffirming 
meditation on death 
if that sounds a bit contradictory so is miss howes sad funny 
and beautifully written new play in it the playwright chronicles 
the 2000mile journey by a suburban new york family to the new 
mexico bedside of a dying aunt 
but their trip is not the shortest distance between two points 
the play tells the story of their automobile trip but it also 
involves circuitous flights of fancy that might make more 
literalminded members of the audience scratch their heads 
approaching zanzibar represents a change for miss howe from 
her more naturalistic straightforward dramas such as painting 
churches and coastal disturbances 
like painting churches the play celebrates family and not 
just the husband wife son and daughter who make the journey but 
everyone they meet along the way including a man and his newborn 
son a grandmother and her deaf grandson and the wifes brother and 
his pregnant wife they all seem to be related in a mystical 
otherworldly way 
the husband harris yulin is a composer stymied by creative 
block his wife jane alexander faces the end of her childbearing 
years between hot flashes she hears the cries of a lost baby 
perhaps a child she now will never have their son is a classical 
guitar prodigy and the boys younger sister is a precocious 
9yearold who becomes the familys link to the old aunt 
miss howe has an odd quirky style that constantly surprises 
but she also has an ear for the mundane conversation of family 
life she perfectly captures the squabbling between husband and 
wife brother and sister and parents and children in one 
hilarious topsyturvy scene the playwright has the children 
playing their parents while the parents are the children the 
actors handle their role reversals with astonishing ease 
the author also brings to life the special relationships between 
these people theres a magical moment at the end of act 1 when 
brother and sister left alone at a campsite are afraid but 
gradually their sense of wonder takes over as the boy plays his 
guitar the girl waves a brightly colored circus light and they 
both gaze at the stars 
the same delight in life occurs near the end of the play when 
the young girl and her dying aunt a painter who resembles georgia 
okeeffe reach an understanding they trade information on their 
favorite color animal and lucky number the old woman dreamily 
recalls a romantic trip she made from paris to zanzibar 
its these memories of past good times that pervade the play 
but they are not maudlin miss howe is not afraid to laugh in the 
face of death and her characters have a good time as they make 
their way across the country to pay tribute to the dying woman 
miss alexander and yulin capture the anxiety of middle age as 
one parent discovers his career at a dead end and the other finds 
her job becoming obsolete director carole rothman coaxes 
unmannered performances from the two children clayton barclay 
jones as the son and angela goethals as the daughter they are 
exasperating lovable mean perceptive funny and just about 
perfect in their portrayals 
most of the other acting is adequate although bethel leslie 
seems too young and healthy to play the grievously ill 81yearold 
aunt 
miss rothman has given the play an inventive production nine 
scenes that take place in wildly divergent settings they include a 
sailboat racing across an oklahoma lake and a mountain stream in 
north carolina where father and son fish set designer heidi 
landesman has no trouble conjuring up both on the theaters tiny 
stage 
near the end of the play the wife ruminates about life and 
pretty much sums up what the playwright is trying to say 
you dance through childhood race through the teenage years 
fall in love a few million times bear some delicious bald babies 
and then whhhstt its all over she opines 
approaching zanzibar makes that journey an exhilarating and 
at times poignant ride

the rich infectious singing style of 
thokoza may have an exotic name ingomesbusku but the south 
african harmonies are familiar to american music lovers 
the four women who make up thokoza zulu for happiness are 
accompanied by traditional drums and the band bayeza they are 
coming which recreates the bouncy guitardriven sound of south 
africas black townships 
the result punctuated by distinctly african ululations and the 
click sounds of the zulu language hints of the 
callandresponse style of american gospel the emotion of 
blues and the energy of jazz improvisation 
the group once shared the bill with a gospel quartet led by a 
staid 78yearold minister who at first looked askance at thokozas 
brightly colored african costumes recalled thuli dumakude the 
groups lead singer 
after we sang the reverend came and said wow was that 
gospel i couldnt tell because of the language but he heard the 
spirit she said the music broke the ice we started relating 
to each other 
ingomesbusku night music is gaining a new international 
audience thanks in part to grammywinning ladysmith black mambazo 
the south african group that recorded the graceland lp with 
paul simon 
at a recent concert in newark the singers wore black dresses 
with splashes of brightly patterned cloth tied around their waists 
and hair and white canvas shoes that flashed like semaphore as 
they moved in quick high steps 
south african dancing is more like the sound of the drum 
said dumakude the footwork is just complementing the drums 
dumakude whose quiet speaking voice contrasts with her soaring 
emotional singing is the only thokoza member born in south africa 
linda carter is from orange nj amma oloriwaa and ghanneiyya 
green were born in new york 
south africans will come backstage to talk to the performers 
they ask which part of home are you from and the people say 
im from brooklyn said welcome msomi dumakudes husband and 
thokozas producer 
there are some of us who only came in 1979 and there are 
others who have been here for hundreds of years but still we are 
africans said msomi who occasionally adds a bass line to 
thokoza and writes some of its songs 
even though we cant trace our roots maybe by singing we can 
hear where we came from oloriwaa said if you have a deep 
guttural gospel sound then maybe your people came from south 
africa if its high maybe its west africa 
thokozas repertoire includes traditional african songs as well 
as original pieces that often call for social and political change 
in racially torn south africa 
the group recently completed several concerts on the east coast 
including performances at new yorks town hall and atlantas 
symphony hall with a gambian balladeer a gospel choir and puerto 
rican plena and bomba band in a show called the african heritage 
tour thokoza also performed at 25 elementary and high schools in 
the new york area last year and on college campuses in missouri 
illinois and california 
the group grew from the theater that dumakude and msomi founded 
in 1979 in the largely black bedfordstuyvesant section of 
brooklyn msomi started the original izulu theater in 1965 in 
durban south africa in 1977 the royal shakespeare company 
brought izulu to london to stage umbatah which msomi describes 
as a zulu version of shakespeares macbeth 
umbatah later played at the spoleto festival in charleston 
sc where it was seen by producers who offered to stage it in new 
york 
when the show closed in new york i made up my mind that i 
was going to start up a branch of the theater in the united 
states msomi said i love the challenge 
msmoi and dumakude began with zulu dance and language classes 
nurturing an interest in african culture among us blacks that 
allowed the south african couple to build a company the plays they 
produced often included song and dance 
as we were growing people began demanding to hear more of the 
music msomi said then when paul simon came out with 
graceland people started to discover south african music people 
started to demand south african music then thokoza started to 
develop 
graceland was named album of the year in 1986 and ladysmith 
black mambazo went on to capture its own grammy for best 
traditional folk album shaka zulu a year later 
dumakude had at first planned to find other south africans for 
thokoza in south africa she had been taught that blacks in the 
united states were not african and she had found that many black 
americans were unaware of or unwilling to acknowledge their ties 
to her home 
it has always been a plan to divide us she said i was 
looking for someone who would say i am an africanamerican 
msomi believes blacks in the united states have been influenced 
by negative media images of africa through the music we can 
also educate other people we are the ones to bring out the truth

pat taylor isnt a texan anymore but some 
traits remain the boots the hat the tendency to do everything 
in a big way 
the oilman began footing college bills for individual students 
some time back a year ago he told a couple hundred underachieving 
seventh and eighthgraders hed see to it they could go to college 
if they kept up their grades now he wants everybody in louisiana 
who makes the grades to be able to go 
we have taxsupported colleges in this state that everyone 
pays for but they are just for those families who can afford 
tuition room and board said taylor nothing is as bizarre in 
this day and time as to turn a kid who is qualified for college 
away just because he doesnt have a few thousand dollars to pay for 
it 
a selfmade millionaire who left home at 16 and worked his way 
through louisiana state university taylor believes the opportunity 
to go to college is the key to solving a lot of the nations 
problems 
it would cut the number of people in prison the number on 
welfare the number selling and using drugs people would see a 
chance at a future and they wouldnt waste it you cant expect 
kids to do well in school if they feel they have nowhere to go 
he said 
i used to believe ours is an equal opportunity society and 
that we are the only truly classless society in the world now i 
know that isnt true we have two classes in this country those 
with a chance and those without 
taylor a horatio alger award recipient frequently gave 
motivational speeches about his rise from poverty he was asked to 
talk to the livingston middle school on march 16 1988 and thought 
hed give the same talk 
my staff told me that wouldnt work these were kids who had 
failed two or three years and were going to drop out of school 
he said 
they said they were in a salvage operation and i was supposed 
to try to convince them to stay in school and graduate 
what taylor saw at the school were young men and women who were 
totally tuned out but he got their attention 
i laid it on pretty thick i went in my full regalia rolex 
and all i talked about my racing boats and ranches and i told them 
how i got it through hard work and a college education i told 
them i had one advantage they didnt i was white and in east texas 
when i was young that was important i also told them it doesnt 
make that much difference now 
taylor also told them that if they would make a b or better 
in high school he would pay for their college education it was 
the first time i realized that they didnt have that opportunity 
before i gave it to them i had always thought anyone who had the 
grades could go to college i was wrong 
one of the students in that group was eric fisher i didnt 
think he could do it at first thats a lot of money my folks were 
in shock too there are five of us kids and when mr taylor said 
hed pay for my college they were some happy said fisher who 
hopes to become a political cartoonist 
my attitude has really changed said clenard pruitt another 
of the students used to be i didnt study that much now i have 
a plan to go to college and then go into real estate thats where 
the money is 
the taylor plan that grew out of taylors revelation would 
let louisiana students attend college based solely on ability to 
learn it would require fouryear colleges to adopt minimum 
admission standards each qualified student whose family income is 
less than 30000 a year would be guaranteed a college education 
with tuition fees room and board costs all waived 
taylor put the cost of the program at 20 million the first 
year and believes the savings it would generate would pay for it 
simply eliminating remedial courses at fouryear schools because of 
the admission standards would save millions he said 
the louisiana board of regents which oversees nine regional 
colleges and the louisiana state university board have accepted 
the plan it officially goes into effect in 1993 but both boards 
have said any student meeting the academic requirements this fall 
will have fees and tuition waived at 13 colleges those costs will 
be absorbed by the colleges 
a bill is pending in the legislature to cover those costs and 
room and board when the program officially begins officials like 
taylor believe that the program will be selfsustaining 
as proof of what his plan can do taylor points to the 172 who 
took him up on his college offer at livingston middle school last 
year a year later none have dropped out or gotten into drugs 
theres been one pregnancy and one arrest and the rest are all 
maintaining a b average or better 
the biggest thing the program has done is keep these kids in 
school most of them would have dropped out by now if mr taylor 
hadnt stepped in said marie carter who supervises the program 
these are kids who had failed at least twice maybe three times 
they came from broken homes had behavior problems attitude 
problems many of them just werent wanted by anyone 
it means a lot to me taylor said i know what its like 
to be poor and be afraid you wont be able to get the education i 
know the fear of thinking you might miss the chance to be all you 
can be 
can you think of anything worse than to be bright and be 
condemned to a life of menial work

will pke become the mtm of the future 
the new production venture is a product of the unlikely 
partnership of tom patchett creator of nbcs wisecracking puppet 
star alf and ken kaufman producer of such serious 
madefortelevision fare as the attic the hiding of anne frank 
and in the line of duty the fbi murders 
the pke in pke productions stands for patchettkaufman 
entertainment 
mtm productions named for cofounder mary tyler moore is the 
company that became legendary for such highquality hits as the 
mary tyler moore show hill street blues and st 
elsewhere patchett worked there with partner jay tarses on 
several series including the bob newhart show 
patchett and kaufman met when they teamed up a few years ago on 
washingtoon a shortlived politicalsatire cable series they 
remained in touch though their paths diverged kaufman recalled 
that on the day he got approval for anastasia a twopart movie 
for nbc patchett got the goahead for alf 
patchett has independently produced alf since its premiere 
three seasons ago but with success under his belt he began to 
think big 
i asked ken how do you run a company patchett said in an 
interview in kaufmans office at their new company headquarters in 
suburban culver city the best company i ever worked for was mtm 
when grant tinker was there and we just had a wonderful creative 
bunch of people and there were five six shows going at one time 
and it was really wonderful but youve got to be a manager to do 
that at the top someplace i knew ken could run a company and i 
asked him for his advice and sort of couched in that was the 
invitation to sort of go in together 
in march pke was still a chain of sparsely furnished offices in 
a nondescript building 
when i came in here jan 3 there was me and the answering 
machine kaufman said on the answering machine it said 
hello this is patchettkaufman entertainment were not here 
right now could you please leave a message and the first message 
i got was him patchett calling saying hello kaufmans not 
there well im patchett and im not there you guys must be 
doing very well 
but kaufman proudly showed off the stadiumsized warehouse soon 
to be filled with soundstages and dressing rooms and the bustle of 
work on new projects ranging from a factbased movie about the 
howard beach ny racial attack to working girl a new nbc 
sitcom based on the hit movie of the same name 
kaufman who recently moved to los angeles from new york had 
made a name producing importantwithacapitali movies with his 
late partner michael lepiner 
patchett had a string of critical if not ratings successes with 
tarses including nbcs buffalo bill the strain of the series 
split up the partnership 
tarses went on to create the offbeat dramedies the days and 
nights of molly dodd and the slap maxwell story patchett 
went on to alf his first bona fide ratings hit the show has 
spawned an industry of stuffed toys lunch boxes and other alf 
paraphernalia 
no one apparently was more surprised by its almost 
instantaneous success than was patchett 
the scary part is the responsibility that comes with a hit 
like that when you get phone calls that you know a husband 
is dying and hes in a coma and the only thing he responds to is 
alf and somebody dies and they bury the kid with an alf doll or 
cap you gotta be careful its very you begin to feel what 
humanity is all about because you have such power 
pkes logo is a house which kaufman describes as symbolizing a 
protective roof over the heads of the creative types he and 
patchett hope to attract its to some extent the house that 
alf built 
alf is affording this venture said patchett its not 
bankrolling it but its certainly made it possible for me to do 
something that i hadnt thought of being able to do before

val kilmer is well aware that hes part of a 
long line of actors who have played the legendary outlaw billy the 
kid 
i think even james cagney played him said kilmer 
actually cagney is one of the few who never played billy the 
kid cagney was in the oklahoma kid the frisco kid and 
the st louis kid but he never played billy the kid 
kilmer bestknown for his roles as madmartigan in the george 
lucas mythfantasy willow and as the hotshot pilot iceman in 
the tom cruise hit top gun turns in an intriguing performance 
as william h bonney in the new turner network telvision cable 
movie gore vidals billy the kid premiering wednesday 
this latest retelling of the events of the lincoln county war in 
the new mexico territory and billys slaying at the age of 21 by 
sheriff pat garrett in 1881 is vidals attempt to make good on the 
skewed vision of bonney contained in the 1958 film the left 
handed gun based on a teleplay by vidal it starred paul newman 
others who have played billy the kid include johnny mack brown 
roy rogers robert taylor audie murphy bob steele buster crabbe 
kris kristofferson and jack buetel in the outlaw which 
shocked in 1943 because of jane russells cleavage most recently 
bonney was played by emilio estevez in young guns 
most writers find their finds in other mythical renditions of 
the subject said kilmer gore is quite passionate about this 
he got squeezed out as producer of the left handed gun actually 
billy used both hands 
i have a special interest too because my grandfather came 
from tennessee to mine gold in new mexico when lincoln county was 
still wild once five men rode up to their mine and my 
grandfathers friends opened fire and killed them all 
if the new film doesnt beatify billy it does portray him as 
immensely sympathetic his story has been open to many 
interpretations bonneys legend began when he was still alive and 
was idolized as the epitome of the western hero others considered 
him a common cattle thief and psychopathic killer 
canadian duncan regehr plays pat garrett the movie also stars 
wilford brimley as new mexicos territorial governor lew wallace 
ned vaughn and patrick massett as billys young gang members julie 
carmen as his love interest and michael parks as a corrupt 
prosecutor rene auberjonois benson has an offbeat role as a 
poetdrunkard who shows up occasionally to comment on the tragedy 
of billys life 
what billy represented and the reason for gores passion for 
the character is that he had a force and a spirit that articulated 
very dramatically that part of our history said kilmer the 
view of billy as a psychopath is a prejudicial account based on pat 
garretts book 
billy was intelligent he read history his myth was very 
powerful during his own life youd have to look at todays rock 
stars for a comparison to the idolization he enjoyed pat garrett 
represented progress billy didnt want things to change but he 
did stand for something he only became an outlaw because they 
tricked him into believing he would get amnesty for the revenge 
killing of a sheriff from gov wallace billy had a legitimate 
cause 
kilmer said he prayed real hard for the role having been 
disappointed when he missed out on the part in young guns 
billy represents one man fighting alone he was passionately 
loyal to his friends and unrelenting against his enemies he said 
kilmer is currently filming kill me again in nevada with his 
wife joanne whalleykilmer who plays christine keeler in 
scandal 
like his cousin the late joyce kilmer famous for the poem 
trees kilmer also writes poetry 
i had a book of poetry published last year he said i 
have a laptop computer and i was compiling it and writing it in my 
trailer during willow id write while i was in my muddy armor

firsttime homebuyers often are appalled by the 
number of fees and charges such as for credit checks appraisals 
and pest inspections that must be paid at the closing 
watch out say some mortgage bankers lest your real estate 
agent slip in still another a referral fee or a charge for having 
steered you to the lender who agrees to finance the purchase 
that issue has set off a conflict in an industry where builders 
sellers and lenders often see eye to eye often taking the same 
stand on legislative and other matters in which they have a mutual 
interest 
they dont agree on referral fees or the practice of sales 
agents using their influence with lenders to obtain mortgages and 
then charging homebuyers a fee for the service 
you should be aware of them says willard gourley jr 
president of the mortgage bankers association of america they 
are fees you dont need to pay for services you dont need to 
have 
that isnt quite the way the national association of realtors 
sees things 
we are opposed to naked referrals says lois clinton 
explaining that such a referral is one in which the realtor does 
little more than supply a name but when the realtor does something 
more she said a fee is justified 
we believe our position is forthright and honest its not 
something unethical as the mortgage bankers seem to imply she 
said with changing technology she explained agents are more 
involved in the mortgage origination process 
increasingly real estate agents offer a computerized service in 
which the homebuyer without leaving the real estate office may 
obtain a review of the loan offerings and interest rates of 
mortgage providers active in the area 
is that a naked referral its hard to say to simply 
provide the name of a bank active in mortgage lending is naked but 
any activity beyond that is a cloudy area one that appears to 
involve a matter of judgment 
says gourley lenders have special deals with certain real 
estate agents meaning the real estate agent has a special interest 
in not only completing the home sale but in where the borrower 
gets a loan 
as he sees it and has so stated in material prepared for the 
media and distributed as a pamphlet real estate agents can make 
extra income by using certain lenders even though that lenders 
mortgage rates may be higher 
its not just the free market at work he says homebuyers may 
pay an additional fee to the real estate agent of up to 1000 on a 
100000 mortgage for no service just for referring the 
borrower to a lender 
theres more to it than that says gourley not only does the 
borrower pay a fee but theres a chance the borrower might also 
pay a half percentage point over market because the lender must 
recover money paid to the agent 
he calls some referral programs blatant and illegal kickbacks 
to real estate agents and he fears that in a competitive 
marketplace they will flourish with one agency or lender copying 
the other 
according to gourley who also is vice chairman of barclays 
american mortgage corp charlotte nc one lenders printed 
promotional flyer offers real estate agents as much as 120000 a 
year for referrals other programs he says offer luxury trips to 
exotic sites 
he calls for the department of housing and urban development or 
congress to act quickly to end referral practices otherwise he 
says the integrity of the mortgage market will be damaged

japanese companies are using third countries as 
channels to reduce direct imports from south africa and avert 
criticism that japans trade supports the apartheid system trade 
experts and antiapartheid activists say 
japanese imports from south africa fell only because it 
japan imported south african gold and platinum indirectly through 
third countries such as switzerland britain and france said 
jerry matsila a tokyo representative of the african national 
congress a group seeking to overthrow the pretoria government 
foreign ministry officials have emphasized the government 
opposes the apartheid system of racial segregation but said there 
was no legal way to prevent companies from using third countries as 
conduits for south african products 
in 1987 japan was pretorias no 1 trading partner surpassing 
the united states and west germany as a result the japanese came 
under heavy criticism for giving economic support to apartheid 
in june last year japan was singled out in a united nations 
resolution criticizing its increased trade with south africa 
the government in early 1988 asked trading companies to practice 
selfrestraint in trade with south africa and then was pleased 
when trade figures announced in january showed japan was no longer 
south africas biggest trading partner having fallen behind west 
germany 
japans twoway trade with south africa in 1988 declined 35 
percent from 1987 to 398 billion 
but detailed official statistics show the drop in overall trade 
was largely due to a drastic decline in imports of precious metals 
from south africa 
although exports to south africa grew 98 percent in 1988 from 
the previous year imports from south africa fell 145 percent due 
to a 407 percent decline in the dollar value of platinum imports 
and an 843 percent drop in the dollar value of gold imports 
critics and scholars closely following the controversy say that 
japan only shifted its source of platinum and gold from south 
africa to third countries many of which import these precious 
metals from south africa 
customs clearance statistics show japans imports of gold and 
platinum from britain switzerland france west germany and the 
united states jumped dramatically 
by weight gold imports from britain in 1988 jumped 809 percent 
from the previous year while gold from switzerland increased by 
198 percent 
platinum imports from britain more than doubled those from west 
germany were up more than 700 percent and those from france were 
27 times higher than the previous year 
it is common knowledge that neither britain nor switzerland 
produces gold or platinum said yoko kitazawa an author who has 
also researched japanese uranium purchases from southern africa 
it is obvious that japan is changing labels of south african gold 
and platinum to those of britain and switzerland when those 
precious metals go to exchanges in zurich and london and 
registering them as british and swiss gold and platinum 
foreign ministry officials said japanese companies may have used 
third countries to produce lower figures for imports from south 
africa 
but you cant really prove how much of the imports from 
third countries are south african products said yasufumi kotake 
who works on one of the ministrys africa desks 
i am not sure if we can single out japanese companies and 
blame them for switching the sources of imports he said 
legally there is not really any way to prevent japanese 
companies from importing south african products from third 
countries 
kotake stressed that japan is doing what she can do and we 
need cooperation from other european countries and the united 
states to make it a concerted effort 
but matsila the african national congress representative 
charged that what japan is doing is hiding the origin of its 
imports what it eventually got out of south africa in 1988 was 
considerably more than that of 1987 if you include those indirectly 
imported products 
government statistics show japans twoway trade with south 
africa in 1988 excluding gold and platinum actually increased 81 
percent from the previous year 
most japanese firms involved in gold and platinum trading 
declined to comment but one official of tanaka precious metal co 
japans largest platinum supplier said we have been only using 
nonsouth african platinum such as from the soviet union for years 
we are not prepared to discuss the matter right now 
an expert on the precious metals market requesting anonymity 
said japan has grown into the worlds largest platinum market 
because of its growing demand for jewelry and as a means of 
investment as well as for industrial use only south african 
platinum can fulfill japans large demands 
statistics show japan imported about 70 percent of the worlds 
total platinum output in 1988 while south africa produced about 80 
percent of the total output the soviet union and canada produce 
the remaining 20 percent

maurice utrillo the prolific painter who 
immortalized peaceful montmartre street scenes was plagued by 
counterfeiters first in life and now in death his widows sole 
heir says 
jean fabris 58 is waging war against the alleged fakes 
accusing art dealers auctioneers and experts of putting profit 
before art critics of his efforts claim hes the one who is after 
money 
he disrupted auction sales in april at both christies and 
sothebys in london crying fake fake he was removed from the 
auction houses and the sales of the 17 contested utrillos went 
ahead his campaign scored a tentative victory in paris when he 
persuaded a criminal court judge to confiscate seven alleged 
utrillo paintings valued at more than 1 million from wellknown 
paris auctioneer guy loudmer 
verification of the disputed paintings will be handled by a 
courtappointed panel of experts a final decision is not expected 
until early summer 
fabris has also challenged the new york market he has written 
to sothebys and christies threatening court action if they do not 
withdraw nine utrillos to be sold by sothebys on may 10 and six 
more by christies on may 11 
were not surprised to learn that he is once again attempting 
to promote unfounded allegations in the press said diana levitt 
a vice president and director of corporate affairs for sothebys in 
new york 
as we previously stated and as the courts in france have also 
found mr fabris is not a recognized expert in utrillos works we 
have notified him that we stand by our authentication of the works 
in our sale and that we intend to offer them for sale on the date 
scheduled and that if he interferes in our sale we will take 
whatever action we think approbriate to protect sothebys and our 
consignors rights 
the seven utrillos in the april 4 london sale fetched over 1 
million pounds 168 million 
utrillos naive street scenes with their fine sense of 
atmosphere and composition have become synonymous with paris and 
especially with artists haunts in montmartre such as the famed old 
music hall le lapin agile 
utrillo who died in 1955 at the age of 72 was known to have 
been copied widely during his lifetime locked into an unusually 
tight agreement to sell his work solely through his dealer he 
reportedly sold paintings on the sly to support his increasingly 
debilitating alcohol habit 
later when the paintings would surface he would simply say 
they were fakes loudmer said in an interview that was his way 
of getting extra money 
fabris who was called a longtime devoted friend by 
utrillos wife lucie valore when she amended her will to leave 
everything to him claims that in addition to the 35004000 
original utrillo paintings in museums and private collections at 
least 3500 fakes are circulating worldwide 
technically it would have been impossible for utrillo to 
paint more than the paintings which have been cataloged he said 
in an interview 
fabris said some of the contested paintings were probably the 
work of valore also an artist but less gifted than her husband 
utrillo didnt paint much during the last 10 years of his 
life he said she would paint he would sign and that way 
madame could have her jewels her hairdresser and they could keep 
up their high living 
the disputed works in the paris court case are montmartre 
la chaumiere dhenri iv a montmartre rue saintrustique et 
le sacre coeur la rue cortot a montmartre le moulin de la 
galette and two works entitled le lapin agile 
fabris says he determined they were fakes after studying 
enlargements of details from reproductions printed in the sales 
catalog 
the signatures are not normal the letters are hesitating and 
overdone sure signs that theyre fakes when you know that utrillo 
signed his name automatically in a single gesture he said 
montmartre never looked like the painting entitled la rue 
cortot it may be a street in sainttropez but its not the 
montmartre that utrillo loved to paint 
fabris said he can only guess why utrillo was copied so much 
more extensively than his contemporaries georges seurat maurice 
de vlaminck georges braque and marc chagall who also lived and 
worked in montmartre in the early 1900s 
thats part of the utrillo mystery he painted authentic 
street scenes that captured local people in their daily life they 
became stereotypes symbolizing paris and montmartre especially for 
foreigners he said it was a curse in life and now a curse in 
death 
loudmer and other auctioneers claim fabris has hurt the future 
sale of utrillos in france where the market already is struggling 
to compete with other european capitals where sales taxes are lower 
and regulations on export licenses less restrictive 
people will take their utrillos elsewhere loudmer said 
adding that british auction houses sell 200 million to 300 
million in french paintings each year 
guillaume duhamel a spokesman for christies in paris said two 
utrillos were withdrawn from a may 3 sale in monaco at the request 
of the owners christies however stood by its judgment that they 
were authentic 
loudmer and other art world insiders accuse fabris of trying to 
replace the existing catalog documenting the painters complete 
works paul petrides utrillos dealer and long considered among 
the worlds most reliable experts compiled it 
fabris wants the last word he wants authentication to go 
through him and for a price loudmer said mr fabris is 
simply trying to get a piece of the utrillo cake which is quite 
extensive 
i have no doubt whatsover on the attribution of these seven 
paintings all of which have been examined closely by numerous 
experts 
but fabris who says he has spent 15 years sifting through some 
50000 catalogs tracking down original utrillo works says he is 
sure the works are fakes 
the police laboratory analyses will vindicate me and this 
will turn out to be the biggest art scandal of the century he 
said french experts are a joke experts dealers auctioneers 
are all in it together the paris art market needs to be purged

move over grover its a squirt ernie and 
bert hear the word big bird 
sesame street is having a baby after 20 years of 
entertaining preschoolers the public television show is creating 
one of its own the peewee set is all aquiver no television birth 
has been more eagerly awaited since ricky jr was born to lucy and 
ricky ricardo in 1953 
two of the shows characters luis and maria married at the end 
of last season on friday in this seasons finale their baby will 
be born and introduced to the neighbors and the world 
details of the blessed event are closely guarded those who know 
the childs sex are sworn to secrecy wild cookie monsters could 
not drag the information from this reporter and even the 
circumstances of the couples trip to the hospital are not being 
divulged 
everybodys at their wits end and they cant get there 
oscar the grouch goes through some changes said sonia manzano 
who plays maria 
young viewers will not see the actual delivery obviously you 
cant show something like this its too scary ms manzano said 
few subjects are too scary for sesame street one of the 
shows original cast members will lee died in 1983 rather than 
allowing lees character kindly mr hooper to retire in florida 
the shows writers chose to have him die and use his demise as a 
way of discussing death 
but in the early years of the show we were advised that we 
should not have a child born on sesame street said producer 
dulcy singer the concept was too complicated and would interfere 
with the mission of teaching the alphabet and numbers the shows 
advisers said 
in its 18th year the show broached the subject when characters 
gordon and susan adopted a child miles then when ms manzano 
married in real life she discussed with ms singer the possibility 
of her becoming pregnant while appearing on the show 
ms monzano did have a baby 13 months ago her pregnancy 
inspired the sesame street storyline she wrote many of the 
episodes involving pregnancy and childbirth using her experience 
as a guide 
she was aided by the legendary sesame street research team 
which surveyed 60 preschoolers to find out what they knew about 
pregnancy 
the answer said research director valeria lovelace was not 
much 
to start they did not understand the word pregnancy and 
explained lovelace we wanted to define pregnancy as when a woman 
has a baby growing in her body 
but where the children did not understand the word womb it 
sounded like room and tummy was inaccurate in the end 
maria described the babys location as a special place and she 
pointed to it 
unsurprisingly the children did not know how women became 
pregnant ultimately luis explained that when he and maria got 
married they decided to have a family and start a baby growing in 
marias body 
we dont get into sex education thats something we leave to 
the parents said ms singer 
most preschoolers knew that only women have children and that 
pregnant women should eat good food to nourish their baby most 
didnt mention milk so a point was made of having maria drink milk 
often 
most knew that the baby moved inside its mother although one 
3yearold asserted that the fetus dances 
but most didnt realize that women went to the doctor regularly 
throughout their pregnancies this gave sesame street an 
opportunity to plug prenatal care throughout marias pregnancy 
if nothing else we get little nags into the home ms 
lovelace said 
in one episode big bird accompanied maria to the obstetrician 
the expectant mothers and their doctor seemed unfazed by the 
presence of an eightfoottall yellow fowl in the office 
who is this a friend or a relative the doctor asked 
when maria complains she is tired big bird says he too tires 
sometimes and asks if that means he is pregnant only ladies get 
pregnant he is told i knew that he replies when the doctor 
amplifies the fetal heartbeat big bird is exultant 
big bird sort of represents our audience said ms singer 
when a test group of toddlers screened the heartbeat episode they 
watched in awe 
ms manzano who has been on the show 17 years looks forward to 
next year in addition to forays into geography and ecology 
sesame street will use marias baby to discuss the care and 
feeding of an infant 
at first a newborn will play the role but eventually marias 
baby will be played by ms manzanos baby thus solving ms 
manzanos childcare worries 
its a wonderful situation to be in but i never thought my 
own child would upstage me ms manzano said with a laugh

the hopeful the desperate the 
adventurers have come in hordes swamping this tiny community on 
the shores of prince william sound 
wearylooking women and men with workscarred hands loiter near 
job agencies waiting for the miracle a 1667anhour 
backbreaking job sopping up the nations worst oil spill 
in a few weeks they have doubled the population of this town 
and still they come 
its not often you can go out and make good money says 
patty west a homesteader from near tok she has been living in an 
old van covered by a plastic tarp to keep out the rain there are 
just so many people you have to wait your turn 
city officials and others wonder how long the city can handle 
the crush 
before the exxon valdez rammed bligh reef on march 24 and dumped 
almost 11 million gallons of crude oil into the sound valdez 
counted about 3500 residents now the number is about 7000 and 
climbing daily 
the impact is severe 
businesses cannot find or keep help as workers seek 
betterpaying exxon jobs hotels are jammed additional housing in 
nonexistent and parks are being cleared of snow to open early for 
camping 
garbage collections have doubled water consumption has 
increased by 1 million gallons a day as scores of cleanup vessels 
tap the city supply its going to get worse says public works 
director lee schlitz 
burger king has wheeled in a portable fastfood restaurant 
complete with roped off drivein lane city licensing officials say 
it may not be the last such portable unit 
the copper valley telephone cooperative has added 108 
longdistance lines to keep up its been tough says dean 
moore the utilitys general manager weve had to meet growth in 
the last 30 days that wasnt even anticipated over five years 
arrests last month jumped by 500 percent over april 1988 and 
police are working overtime says joe michaud the citys chief of 
emergency services 
were running them ragged we had 25000 budgeted for 
overtime for the year we used that up the first week he says 
our bar fights domestic disturbances street fights theyre way 
up arrests for drunken driving haved quadrupled over the same 
period last year 
ambulance calls have increased 100 percent michaud says 
the statistics instead of improving are getting a little worse 
each week he adds that has us worried 
prostitution seems unable to get a foothold although two new 
prostitutes arrived after the spill to set up shop michaud says 
most of the people coming here are not working and dont have 
much money business apparently was not that good and they left on 
their own 
the impact also has been felt at valdez community hospital 
where emergency room activity has increased at least 100 percent 
says administrator joy keating 
she says she has lost her two lab technicians because of the 
spill and cannot find replacements one quit to work with oiled 
otters the other was dissatisfied with postspill valdez she says 
a lot of people just dont like this town anymore keating 
says 
at the citys bustling waterfront harbor officials can barely 
keep up 
general confusion is the best way to put it says 
harbormaster tim lopez the spill has increased harbor use by 
cleanup vessels support boats and floatplanes he says 
its going to get a lot worse than this lopez says the 
recreational fleet hasnt even put into the water yet and the 
commercial fleet will be coming 
mayor john devens says valdez has started to feel the effect on 
its 32 million annual budget but he says there are other problems 
i think people are getting uncomfortable he says the 
quality of life is certainly not as good as in normal times 
the city gets most of its income from taxes on oil industry 
facilities devens says valdez has been struggling for the last few 
years to face the fact that north slope oil is not inexhaustible 
officials and business leaders have put money and effort into 
diversifying the citys economy and the spill may damage that 
effort he says 
were not sure what the effect will be this is not good for 
tourism not good for fishing not good for our port we have not 
gotten much sympathy from exxon 
devens says the citys relationship with oil companies may cool 
because of the spill 
theyve never given scholarships never built any city parks 
they really havent done much except provide a tax base theyve 
done that not because of generosity but because its the law 
the slate is getting kind of balanced

new york city without ed koch 
for some especially koch the opinionated mayor of the past 11 
years its hard to picture for others including at least six 
who want the job its easy and polls and pundits seem to agree 
mayor edward i koch is in trouble 
after four years of scandals homelessness aids crack crime 
and crumbling bridges many new yorkers think their no 1 loudmouth 
has gone from lovable to laughable to loseable 
koch 64 acknowledges hes not the same man who went from 
congress to gracie mansion the mayors residence in 1977 im 
not any smarter im wiser i hope im more beaten up im just 
as resilient in terms of coming off the mat and fighting back 
for much of the country koch is the bookwriting donald 
trumptaunting jesse jacksonjeering embodiment of the essential 
new yorker obstinate obnoxious smart and sort of entertaining 
talks too much 
at home polls show his democratic voter support straining to 
reach 30 percent half of the voters disapprove of his performance 
hed lose a fourway race for the democratic nomination the polls 
say and even if he won he would be defeated by a republican 
former us attorney rudolph giuliani 
but those are just scientific newspaper polls koch said his own 
showofhands polls at his public appearances indicate otherwise 
i think there is a reservoir of great goodwill out there and 
appreciation for what ive done 
others might disagree koch is on the ropes wall street 
journal and his third term a shambles vanity fair partly 
because of his meanspirited gratuitous bullying 
egocentricity new york magazine 
and those were relatively evenhanded articles 
in the bookstores is city for sale 466 pages dense with 
details of the corruption scandals that tainted everyone from 
borough presidents to the gracie mansion chef who used city 
equipment for his catering business 
newspapers offer daily doses of criticism koch says hes the 
whipping post for about six or eight columnists and a black 
newspaper the amsterdam news has called for his resignation on 
its front page for more than 160 weeks 
koch however is planning to become the citys first fourterm 
mayor the primary election is sept 12 
now i dont expect to get the 78 percent majority i got in 
1985 that was unique the highest in the history of the city but 
all i need is 51 and i hope to get even better than that koch 
said 
his main challenger for the democratic nomination is manhattan 
borough president david dinkins who leads the polls and would be 
the first black mayor two other democrats expected to run are city 
comptroller harrison j goldin and richard ravitch a builder who 
has headed the state urban development corp and the metropolitan 
transportation authority 
waiting to take on the survivor is giuliani who earned a 
crimebusting aura by prosecuting mobsters wall streeters and 
corrupt officials giuliani is faced by ronald lauder an heir to 
the estee lauder cosmetics fortune who was ambassador to austria 
during the reagan administration 
im the underdog and im not saying that to get sympathy all 
the polls show it koch said what they really show he feels is 
vague dissatisfaction and annoyance with the guy whos been on the 
television for 12 years 
my friends and supporters have said listen one of the 
things that people say they dont like in the sense that they 
once did is your feistiness so tune it down he said im 
trying youll notice my voice is two octaves lower im 
practicing and i speak slow 
the problem for koch said former senate candidate mark 
green is that many of his opponents embody a compelling 
rationale against him 
dinkins can credibly argue that he is a quiet healer not a 
nasty loudmouth dividing our city giuliani can credibly argue that 
he is a fresh face who will clean up the city unlike the mayor who 
looked the other way 
goldin is a koch without the sleaze or the shtick hes smart 
experienced and nervy ravitch can persuasively argue that hes an 
experienced builder who can run without the baggage of being a 
clubhouse politician 
none has to defend an administration in which six officials 
appointed by the mayor have gone to jail or been indicted and 200 
lowlevel officials have been charged with wrongdoing 
i accept full responsibility for everything good and bad in 
my administration koch said and i say to people when you 
judge me judge me on what you would have done before and what you 
would have done after and did i do what makes common sense 
koch speaks with pride of his administrations accomplishments 
hundreds of millions spent on the homeless a 51 billion program 
to create 53000 new and rehabilitated apartments by 1993 millions 
being spent on tactical narcotics teams of police officers who 
focus on drugridden neighborhoods 
no city does what we do we get no credit for it there is a 
gap between substance and what people perceive he said 
admitting however that the perception is distorted by his combative 
nature and sarcasm 
it may be that people have come to the conclusion that people 
dont want that sense of humor and other personality aspects 
koch said 
time for a change is the no 1 cardinal slogan when you have 
someone whos been there for two terms ive been there for three 
terms that doesnt mean i shouldnt be there for a fourth term

flagship kenmore label sears sales of home electronics and 
appliances rose by doubledigit percentages in april 
jeffrey edelman a retail industry analyst at drexel burnham 
lambert inc said the april numbers looked good overall partly 
because they were being compared with last years depressed 
tallies still he said april represented a significant 
improvement from marchs very sluggish volumes 
this in an indication that the consumer is not dead spending 
is just slowing down edelman said 
expenditures on things that are typically financed with bank 
loans have been curbed a bit by increases in interest rates this 
year 
jeffrey feiner an analyst with merrill lynch amp co said sales 
industrywide this year have barely outpaced the inflation rate 
indicating that consumer spending a key element in economic 
growth is easing 
feiner has scaled down his forecast for average 1989 retail 
sales growth to 55 percent from 6 percent based on sales results 
so far this year 
thomas tashjian an analyst with seidler amdec securities inc 
in los angeles said one of the positive factors in this years 
retail equation is that big chains have refrained from slashing 
prices to clear out slowmoving goods this combined with tight 
inventory management will help preserve profitability in the 
retail business 
the results thursday were from some of the biggest general 
merchandise chains in the united states including purveyors of 
special apparel lines and accessories monthly retail sales figures 
from the government are more comprehensive and include the take at 
other types of establishments such as auto dealerships 
supermarkets and restaurants 
here are some of the figures 
chicagobased sears said its sales rose 92 percent in the four 
weeks ended april 29 from the comparable 1988 period and sales at 
stores open at least a year called same or comparable store sales 
rose 68 percent 
retailers and industry analysts consider samestore sales a more 
accurate indication of a companys performance than totals that 
include sales at newly opened stores not every retailer reports 
samestore sales 
k mart said its sales in the four weeks to april 26 were up 23 
percent but on a samestore basis sales fell 1 percent 
the thirdlargest retailer walmart stores inc said its april 
sales rose 25 percent while its samestore sales gained 11 percent 
the fastgrowing discounter based in bentonville ark routinely 
reports doubledigit samestore sales growth

exxon corp president lee r raymond says too 
much bureaucracy could hinder the mopup of the nations worst oil 
spill and denied the company was trying to cut corners in the 
cleanup 
at a news conference thursday in his new york office raymond 
said that as many as 14 government agencies may be involved in 
approving and carrying out exxons final cleanup plan 
i want some one person in charge i dont care who it is 
because there has to be one person that finally says hey its 
midnight and we gotta do something and heres what were going to 
do 
raymond said exxon was continuing to operate under a plan 
approved april 17 by the us coast guard until a revised plan is 
given the goahead exxon submitted the latest proposal to the 
coast guard on monday after portions of the current plan were 
criticized as inadequate 
the oil tanker exxon valdez crashed into a reef march 24 
spilling more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into price 
william sound exxon accepted responsibility for the spill but has 
been criticized for dragging its feet in its initial response to 
the disaster 
raymond defended the latest proposal which he said was 
formulated with the help of state and federal environmental 
officials despite ongoing criticism by some state regulators the 
proposal calls for cleaning up 364 miles of shoreline by sept 15 
he also rejected reports alleging that exxon was attempting to 
bypass environmental regulations to dispose of waste accumulated 
from the spill 
the first page of exxons new waste disposal plan calls for use 
of existing treatment and disposal facilities at the alyeska valdez 
terminal use of the alyeska facilities will also require 
cooperation from the regulatory agencies to rapidly issue letters 
of nonobjection waivers or permit modifications as required 
the plan says 
raymond said however that the wording was misinterpreted and 
that everything can be accomplished within environmental laws 
raymond also said exxon would do anything reasonable to 
cleanse alaskas soiled waters and beaches and that it placed the 
cleanup of 191 miles of lightly oil beaches last on the list of 
priorities after consultations with environmental officials he 
said exxon would clean even those areas except in cases 
particularly wildlife habitats judged better left untouched 
anything that makes sense that they would say you ought to do 
in addition to what you have in the plan well do it raymond 
said

commodities exchanges give speculators the opportunity to bet 
millions of dollars on the future prices of goods ranging from gold 
to treasury bills to frozen orange juice 
the purpose of the futures exchanges is to transfer the risk of 
price fluctuations from people who dont want the risk such as 
farmers or metals processors to speculators who are willing to 
gamble on making big profits 
futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods 
at a specified price at a certain time in the future options 
which also are widely traded on the exchanges give purchasers the 
right but not the obligation to buy or sell something at a certain 
price within a specified period 
commodities traders standing in recessed pits and dressed 
in brightly colored jackets shout orders and wave hand signals to 
each other in a free forall auction of contracts 
in a typical transaction on a commodities exchange a farmer who 
wants to lock in a guaranteed price to minimize risk will promise 
to deliver 20000 pounds of live beef cattle at a specified future 
date at a specified price 
assuming the price rises the speculator who buys the contract 
could later take the cattle from the farmer and resell them to 
someone else at the higher prevailing market price pocketing the 
profit 
but if the price goes down the speculator would lose money by 
having to pay the farmer the agreedupon price and then resell the 
cattle at the lower market price 
in practice speculators rarely end up with mountains of tin or 
pork bellies they sell their positions at a profit or loss before 
the delivery date the ultimate buyer is a customer who actually 
needs the commodity 
although the exchanges began with agricultural products they 
have rapidly expanded into financial products for example the 
chicago board of trade does most of its business in contracts based 
on the value of the standard amp poors 100stock and 500stock 
indexes 
other major exchanges include the chicago mercantile exchange 
the new york mercantile exchange the commodity exchange in new 
york the new york cotton exchange the coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange

the union that represents oil workers nationwide 
has announced its opposition to drilling in the coastal plains of 
alaskas arctic national wildlife refuge 
the oil chemical and atomic workers union says a moratorium on 
drilling in the environmentally sensitive refuge is not 
antithetical to its members need to work 
im for drilling but there has to be some sanity to the 
process and there doesnt seem to be any ocaw vice president 
robert wages said in a recent interview 
saying you shouldnt drill in the arctic national wildlife 
refuge ought not be viewed as religious heresy by the industry 
wages said 
he said union leaders are on the stump to rally support for a 
cohesive national energy policy 
previously the union was neutral on coastal drilling although 
the membership had passed several resolutions asking its leadership 
to be sensitive to both jobs and the environment 
but when the exxon valdez ran aground march 24 and spilled 
250000 gallons of crude oil into alaskas prince edward sound 
union opposition galvanized 
the stance is certainly not jobsproducing but we dont 
believe its jobsdestructive either wages said 
the union which represents about 40000 oil workers and 70000 
chemical and atomic workers is pushing for more effective recovery 
of oil at existing fields rather than exploratory drilling in 
environmentally sensitive areas 
wages conceded that enhanced recovery is more expensive than 
searching for new gushers 
no one is forcing the industry to make the hard judgments 
about spending the money thats required for secondary recovery 
he said we have a lot of fields out there that have not been 
flooded that have not been steam injected the oil is sitting 
there 
he also mentioned the extraction of oil from shale a type of 
rock as an alternative to coastal exploration 
exxon was one of the promoters of the oil shale projects out 
where i come from in colorado wages said and one bright 
sunshiny day they just picked up closed down and told everybody 
they were laid off but they would have the american public the 
press the government and everyone believe that its absolutely 
essential to drill in alaska why because no one will take the 
economic positions that have to be taken to develop other sources 
wages also ridiculed industry and government officials who say 
coastal drilling is essential for national security 
that is a specious argument its inconsistent with the 
facts wages said 
there are no government restrictions on oil imports and as a 
result imports of both crude oil and refined products such as 
gasoline heating oil and distillate oils are approaching historic 
highs he said 
at the same time record numbers of american refineries have 
been shut down in the last five years 
we dont have enough refining capacity to meet demand 
based on how much we are importing wages said 
all of the positions that the industry and the bush 
administration are taking are inconsistent with national 
security wages said 
national security is not served by the saudi arabiantexaco 
joint venture its not served by the venezuelans joint venture 
with citgo champlin and unocal 
its like saying we wont let the soviets work in our defense 
plants but well let the soviet government operate them 
wages hopes to win support before the memory of valdez fades 
wed like congress to take up the nations energy policy now 
before the ghost of the valdez is gone he said because as 
long as that ghost is there theres not going to be drilling up 
there when that ghost disappears there will be a subtle quiet 
subterranean move to make sure that they are permitted to drill

donald j trump the 
quintessential wheelerdealer faces a new kind of board in his 
newest venture trump the game 
the real estate mogul has joined forces with board game 
manufacturer milton bradley co which expects the game to be the 
biggest seller in its 129year history 
trump flew in his private helicopter to milton bradley 
headquarters here thursday to fulfill a promise to the company 
they were intent on having me come up to meet the real 
people he said these are the people doing the work to hell 
with the executives 
many of the 2300 workers at the western massachusetts factory 
clapped at each stop in the 45minute visit women sighed isnt 
he handsome and men lined up for autographs of the paper money 
that bears his likeness and comes in denominations no smaller than 
10 million 
more than 2 million of the games are scheduled for production by 
years end it is the no 1 seller in the 300 stores that have 
received advance copies milton bradley president george ditomassi 
said 
neither the company nor trump will reveal his royalties but 
both said he is donating proceeds to charities for the homeless and 
for research into aids cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis 
the board game is a sophisticated battle in which players first 
bid against each other using the fake cash and trump cards of 
course for airlines casinos luxury hotels and other trump 
properties then try to negotiate deals 
trump said the game is tough even for a veteran of the 
highstakes business world like him but he resisted explaining its 
appeal if i said it youd say i have a big ego so why say it 
the idea for the game came from an independent inventor from 
chicago who suggested milton bradley a division of hasbro inc 
as the manufacturer 
trump said he settled on the nations largest board game maker 
because the loyalty decisiveness and professionalism of this 
company is just unbelievable as the applause died down he 
barked at workers ok get some overtime 
during a news conference later trump denied rumors that he 
planned to run for mayor of new york which had surfaced after he 
took out a fullpage newspaper advertisement recently supporting 
the death penalty and increased police presence 
and he sneered at the suggestion that a new bidder for the 
eastern airlines shuttle could affect his 365 million offer 
its not serious he said of the bid from america west airlines 
inc i have not even heard of them 
besides he said his contract with eastern guarantees him a lot 
of money even if the deal falls through

profitless pecan producers have expressed 
optimism about a promotion plan that would help them compete with 
their arch enemies walnuts and almonds 
there have been no profits in the pecan industry in the last 
three or four years said grower fred beshears of monticello fla 
beshears one of about 20 speakers thursday at the 24th annual 
conference of the georgia pecan growers association said almond 
and walnut growers spend 15 million and 10 million respectively 
on promotion 
in contrast previous efforts to unite the pecan industry have 
failed so there has been no concerted effort to increase 
consumption 
theyre educating the consumer to eat walnuts and almonds but 
people outside the pecan belt dont know about the benefits of 
pecans said beshears president of the federated pecan growers 
a group that represents growers in all 16 pecanproducing states 
speakers at the meeting discussed marketing economics pest 
control and growing techniques the 200 growers attending packed a 
conference hall in the morning when beshears discussed the proposed 
federal marketing plan 
under the plan growers would be assessed half a cent on each 
pound of pecans they sell the assessment would generate 1 million 
to 15 million a year for research and advertising he said 
a bill establishing the marketing plan is scheduled to be 
introduced within a week by us sens wyche fowler of georgia and 
david boren of oklahoma a 15member board would oversee the 
program 
beshears said growers will emphasize the nutritious qualities of 
pecans 
pecans are very healthy and nutritious he said they have 
no cholesterol theyre high in protein i wish we could say they 
improve a persons sex life 
beshears said the per capita consumption of pecans has remained 
steady in recent years while americans ate more walnuts and 
almonds 
from 1970 to 1987 pecan prices climbed 64 percent while walnut 
and almond prices jumped 103 percent and 214 percent respectively 
georgia is the nations largest pecan producer other leading 
states are texas oklahoma new mexico alabama louisiana and 
mississippi 
weve been in a real cost squeeze said tom crocker a 
horticulturist with the university of georgia extension service 
all our costs are going up and were receiving less for the 
nuts walnut and almond growers are organized and were not

the architects of drexel burnham lambert incs 
landmark settlement of civil securities fraud charges will have to 
wait even longer for the agreement to be finalized 
thats because the judge who could approve the deal is blocked 
by court order from doing so and a panel of judges declined to 
assign the case to another judge thursday 
the assignment committee for the us district court for the 
southern district of new york held that no circumstance has 
arisen that would make it appropriate to reassign the case or 
any part of it to another judge 
the settlement has been placed on hold for nearly a month 
because of a legal challenge to us district judge milton pollack 
who is assigned to the case 
former drexel junk bond chief michael milken who is not part of 
the settlement is challenging pollacks impartiality the matter 
is before the us supreme court 
a federal appeals court has issued a stay preventing pollack 
from taking any further action including considering and 
possibly approving the settlement until the supreme court decides 
whether it will consider milkens appeal 
meanwhile the appeals courts refusal to assign a different 
judge continues to delay the civil settlement as well as drexels 
record plea bargain to criminal charges 
resolution of the sec pact also is needed before drexel can 
formally plead guilty to six felonies and pay 650 million to 
settle criminal charges brought by the us attorneys office in 
manhattan 
were going to meet and decide what to do next sec 
solicitor paul gonson said thursday were obviously very 
disappointed 
a drexel spokesman steven anreder said the investment banking 
giant also was disappointed 
we believe it would be in everyones best interest to have the 
settlement reviewed and approved 
drexel and the sec have twice asked the 2nd us circuit court 
of appeals to reconsider its stay to allow pollack to handle the 
settlement or else assign the case to a different judge 
but the appeals court said it didnt have authority 
the sec and drexel then tried to get the district court 
assignment committee to temporarilly assign the case to another 
judge to consider the settlement 
the sec said it strongly believes it is in the public interest 
and important to the protection of investors to finalize the 
settlement as expedititously as possible 
but the threejudge panel headed by chief judge charles l 
brieant also nixed the idea saying it hadnt been shown any 
evidence that such delay which may result from awaiting action 
by the supreme court will affect the public interest adversely 
the panel also noted that pollack has not requested of this 
committee that all or any part of this action be assigned to 
another judge and gives us no present indication of intending to 
do so 
drexel originally battled to get pollack to excuse himself from 
the case because his wife stands to make a hefty profit from a 
debtfinanced acquisition drexel helped arrange 
pollack refused to step down from the case and the 2nd circuit 
which delayed further district court proceedings pending its 
decision upheld pollack in november 
drexel eventually dropped its objections to pollack but the 
delay was extended when milken and his brother lowell who were 
both indicted for racketeering and securities law violations last 
month sought to argue the issue before the supreme court

the california supreme court has upheld 
most of proposition 103 a landmark law that places new controls on 
insurance companies but insurance rates probably wont plummet 
soon 
the surprising unanimous ruling thursday has some important 
longterm consequences for the california insurance industry and 
its millions of customers who now have laws to guard against 
geographic discrimination policy nonrenewals and uncontrolled 
rate increases 
but for the short term rates for car property and liability 
insurance appear to be in the hands of the states newly powerful 
insurance commissioner roxani gillespie 
gillespie an appointee of gov george deukmejian is like many 
of her predecessors a former insurance executive proposition 103 
strengthens the office and seeks to sever its ties with the 
industry by making it an elective position starting next year 
until then gillespie occupies a particularly sensitive post 
because of the court ruling 
proposition 103 approved by voters in november was supposed to 
roll back insurance rates 20 percent below november 1987 levels and 
freeze them until this november unless an insurer could show a 
substantial threat of insolvency the prospects were for a 
relatively inflexible freeze with few exceptions 
but in the one important aspect of thursdays ruling that 
favored insurers the court said the threat of insolvency 
standard was too narrow and failed to guarantee a fair rate of 
return the constitutional requirement established by the court 
in rentcontrol cases 
rejecting arguments that the freeze was justified as a temporary 
measure to compensate for uncontrolled rate increases justice 
allen broussard said the asserted rise in insurance rates is 
a longterm chronic situation which will not be solved by 
compelling insurers to sell at less than a fair return for a year 
the court left the rollback in place at least on paper to take 
effect when the ruling becomes final in 30 days barring an 
extension or appeal but insurers will be allowed to apply to 
gillespie for immediate exemptions and to implement rate increases 
on their own while she considers the applications 
any amount that the commissioner considers excessive or 
unfairly discriminatory must be refunded plus interest 
in addition starting this november any proposed rate increase 
will have to be approved by gillespie before taking effect the 
first time the state has required advance approval of insurance 
rates 
the measure also calls for a further 20 percent discount for 
good drivers defined as those with no more than one moving 
violation in three years 
its reasonable to assume that many companies will seek 
exemptions from the 20 percent rollback said thomas conneely 
president of the association of california insurance companies 
gillespies department which is being expanded currently lacks 
the staff forms and office space to handle an expected flood of 
exemption requests 
we will be there to monitor every action promised 
proposition 103 author harvey rosenfield he said insurance 
companies should implement the rollback and refund any rates above 
that amount since last november 
gillespies department also must decide when auto insurers may 
cancel or refuse to renew policies under a section of the 
initiative that was upheld by the court 
the provision allows nonrenewal only in cases of fraud 
nonpayment or a substantial increase in the hazard insured 
against no definition has been provided for a substantial 
increase and insurers have already raised questions over whether 
it would cover for example the addition of a teenage driver in a 
household 
insurers raised a constitutional challenge against the 
provision saying it could not be applied to insurance policies 
that were issued before last november without violating contractual 
rights broussard disagreed 
the infringement on contracts was relatively moderate he 
said and was outweighed by the public interest in keeping 
insurance available to all particularly in light of fears that 
many insurers would refuse to renew policies if proposition 103 
passed 
broussard also noted that insurers still can withdraw from the 
state with approval by gillespies department 
the commissioner has cited proposition 103s nonrenewal 
provisions in prohibiting several companies from pulling out of 
california without arranging substitute coverage for their 
customers 
another important provision that will soon be before the 
department changes the rules for setting auto insurance rates 
insurance companies citing differences in costs traditionally 
have varied rates between geographic areas prompting complaints by 
many city residents that insurance was unavailable or unaffordable 
proposition 103 requires rates to be based primarily on a drivers 
record with geography considered only if the department of 
insurance allows it

the detroit free press has won permission from 
its parent company to publish for another year or until the us 
supreme court decides the fate of a joint operating agreement with 
the detroit news 
the arrangement announced thursday calls on the free press to 
make cuts so its losses are less than 23 million 
the free press lost 227 million last year and publisher david 
lawrence jr said he was confident the paper could hold that pace 
through cuts in color news space travel and streamlined business 
practices 
absolutely this is possible or else it would be stupid 
lawrence said thursday we are confident we can achieve this 
goal 
the board of directors of knightridder inc decided unanimously 
at a meeting thursday morning in miami to continue publication 
when the supreme court decided monday to hear a challenge of the 
joa with a decision expected next year some analysts wondered if 
knightridder would absorb the free press losses for another year 
the free press and the news owned by gannett co have sought 
the partial merger since 1986 the papers aim to cut costs by 
combining advertising circulation and production operations while 
keeping separate news and editorial departments 
gannett hasnt released annual loss figures but has said the 
news lost 6495 million from 1980 through 1987 
the free press also said it and the news will reopen contract 
negotiations at once with both newspapers unions more than 3000 
union employees have gone without contractual raises since 1986

hanover trust because the bank extended credit to a company the 
union is striking a spokesman for the housing organization says 
the umw went on strike against pittston coal group inc of st 
paul va last month 
were sort of joining hands with them in terms of trying to 
put pressure on an entity which in one way or another is 
supporting pittston said peter sawell a spokesman for the 
association of community organization for reform now acorn 
acorn and umw filed papers with the federal reserve on thursday 
asking it to block manufacturerss purchase of 11 branches of 
goldome federal savings bank 
the groups claim manufacturers broke the law by failing to make 
mortgage loans in predominantly black or hispanic neighborhoods in 
brooklyn 
the community reinvestment act requires that banks meet the 
credit needs of their entire communities and not just 
higherincome neighborhoods in their service areas 
asked why umw was concerned about banking practices in brooklyn 
where it has no members umw spokesman kenneth zinn said 
the role that theyre playing is to generally forsake 
lowincome and poor people in the community for large companies for 
leveraged buyouts for highincome neighborhoods and we think 
theres something the matter with that 
umw has been attempting to put pressure on pittston through 
several banks including manufacturers hanover that extended a 
100 million line of credit to pittston in december 1987 
umw has charged the credit line was pittstons strike fund 
about 1500 miners in virginia and west virginia had been working 
without a contract for 14 months when they went on strike april 5 
in february the umw announced the withdrawal of 30 million 
from crestar fianancial corp one of the five banks extending the 
line of credit to pittston the umws international union withdrew 
67 million from the bank while the bakery and confectionery 
unions pension fund pulled out 23 million 
clearly we started looking at manufacturers hanover when we 
saw what they were doing with their capital assets in terms of the 
loan to pittston zinn said whether this puts pressure on 
them i dont know thats for the bank to decide 
mht spokesman john stefans said his company has been found by 
federal and state banking regulators to be in compliance with the 
community reinvestment act 
stefans said a umw official spoke at the banks annual meeting 
april 21 in new york and asked the bank to withdraw its portion of 
the line of credit 
the bank spokesman said he had not seen the acornumw papers and 
could not respond directly but he said the bank had not made loans 
for one to fourfamily houses until recently 
the union and acorn charged in their papers that while 43 
percent of brooklyns population lives in predominantly white 
census tracts manny hanny has progressively made more of of its 
loans 67 percent in 1986 68 percent in 1987 and 69 percent in 
1988 in these tracts 
they said that in census areas with more than 75 percent 
minority residents where 57 percent of brooklyns population 
lives manufacturers hanover granted far fewer loans

the state is challenging usairs proposed 
purchase of eight eastern airlines gates in philadelphia saying 
the transaction could reduce competition and lead to higher ticket 
prices 
the sale worth about 85 million to strikebound eastern would 
give usair 23 of 49 gates at philadelphia international airport 
pennsylvania attorney general ernie preate said in a motion filed 
in us bankruptcy court in new york 
usair already controls 36 of 51 gates the greater pittsburgh 
international airport he said 
usairs fares per mile for flights of 200 to 500 miles to or 
from pittsburgh are 12 percent higher than the average fare for 
shorthaul flights to or from other cities preate said 
the lack of competition is hurting pennsylvania consumers and 
the situation will only worsen if usair is able to increase its 
dominance over philadelphia he said 
the petition filed thursday asks bankruptcy court judge burton 
r lifland to reject the proposed sale and order eastern to offer 
the gates to other airlines before a scheduled may 23 court hearing 
usair spokesman john bronson called the arguments seriously 
flawed and said they will inhibit growth of air service in 
hiladlephia 
court papers also said braniff midway and pan am express an 
east coast shuttle are seeking gates in philadelphia and twa is 
considering establishing a philadelphia hub 
usair on the fifth day of the machinists strike against eastern 
that started march 4 announced it had agreed to buy the gates after

american indian tribes are exploring major bond 
issues as a way to raise cash for tribal development projects an 
idea boosted by a recent change in federal law and one that has 
piqued the interest of the japanese 
late last month daiwa securities america us arm of the 
japanese investment house gathered tribal leaders government 
officials indian experts and others in new york for a daylong 
conference on tribal financing 
charles entwistle a daiwa senior vice president said the 
meeting was designed to present financing opportunities to both the 
tribes and investors 
it looks like a good opportunity for channeling some of the 
japanese money coming into the united states entwistle said 
were satisfied that the business is there now its just a 
matter of can we put deals together 
the effort is prompted by an amendment to the federal indian 
finance act signed into law last september the amendment allows 
tribes to float bonds that would be backed by government guarantees 
for up to 90 percent of their value 
such government backing would put tribal bonds on par with many 
bonds issued by government agencies 
government guarantees allow the bond issuer to pay a lower 
interest rate since the buyers are assured of getting most of their 
money back should there be a default the lower interest rate makes 
the bonds cheaper for the tribes to issue 
daiwa is working on a major indian funding project that would 
amount to hundreds of millions of dollars entwistle said though 
he declined to give details 
in addition to bonds funding mechanisms for tribal projects 
under exploration by daiwa include joint ventures equity interests 
and private placements or debt issues that are sold privately and 
not publicly traded entwistle said 
one bond issue the company is working on would provide about 
65 million for the chickasaw nation to buy the arbuckle 
wilderness a 485acre drivethrough park and exotic wild animal 
preserve in oklahoma that is a major tourist attraction 
however the governmentguaranteed bond issue has been delayed 
by the federal bureau of indian affairs which must approve the 
financing 
the bia and its parent the interior department have not 
finished writing regulations to implement the amendment to the 
indian finance act said bia spokesman carl shaw 
no one knew at the time that amendment was passed that there 
would have to be new regulations written shaw said last week 
in addition the bia must receive funding for a reserve fund to 
guarantee the bond issues shaw said a request for that funding 
was not submitted to congress this year because we dont feel 
like we can request those funds due to budgetary constraints 
shaw said 
the soonest the reserve fund could be approved allowing 
governmentbacked tribal bonds to be issued would be fiscal 1991 
which starts october 1 1990 assuming congress approves the 
funding by then shaw said 
entwistle said he believes the bia is creating unnecessary 
delays nowhere in the amendment does it say that new regulations 
or a new reserve fund are needed he said pointing out that a 
reserve fund was created under the existing indian finance act 
the law was written to be enacted immediately he said 
indian tribes can float bonds under the original indian finance 
act which was approved in the early 1980s but the bonds arent 
guaranteed by the government instead the tribes must back the 
issues by naturalresource earnings or other tribal revenue 
the amended finance law provides enhanced capability for the 
tribes to raise money shaw said 
charles blackwell an indian attorney who is a consultant to 
daiwa said the bia dispute is overshadowed by the significance of 
the indian gathering in new york 
leaders from 20plus tribes came to wall street bringing their 
deals and saying lets do business he said it was the first 
time in history 
congress is 100 percent behind the individual initiatives that 
are taking place in indian country he added and the tribes 
themselves are emerging as very powerful business entities in the 
united states the bia will fall in line

like a good many other american industries 
housing and real estate have lately felt the pinch of high interest 
rates 
but some wall street analysts maintain that the homebuilding 
business is going through nothing much worse than a moderate down 
cycle that wont have dire or farreaching consequences for the 
economy 
in fact a few observers argue that stocks of homebuilding 
companies which generally have turned in an uninspired showing 
over the past year or two could soon start to revive if interest 
rates are ready to come down 
figures published by the value line investment survey show that 
housing starts the historical gauge of the homebuilding industrys 
health have been declining steadily from a peak they reached more 
than three years ago 
in the first quarter of 1986 work was started on new private 
dwelling units at the rate of 194 million a year 
in the second quarter of this year by contrast value line 
estimates the total will come in at an annual rate of 140 million 
still the investment advisory firm says it believes housing 
starts will bottom out toward the end of this year not far below 
current levels 
that would be the culmination of a historically mild decline 
that has developed gradually from the 1986 peak says analyst 
stephen grant in value lines recently published quarterly 
appraisal of the industry outlook 
most of this decline has occurred in multifamily housing due 
to previous overbuilding stimulated by tax laws that have since 
been changed 
singlefamily housing starts have a good shot at topping the 1 
million level in 1989 for an unprecedented seventh consecutive 
year after troughing at 660000 in 1982 
even if housing is in for a more extended period of weakness 
than analysts now expect some observers contend that it need not 
drag the rest of the economy down with it 
in the past weakness in housing traditionally ushered in 
recessions in the overall economy when tight money sent home 
buying and homebuilding into a slump demand dropped off for 
building materials home furnishings appliances and a ripple 
effect occurred 
in the 1980s however past patterns havent held says robert 
barbera economist at shearson lehman hutton inc 
while housing has been strong ever since the early 1980s he 
notes manufacturing is in the early stages of recovery from a 
severe mid80s slump 
housing and factory activity are out of phase at present 
barbera says and that enhances the prospects for a slide in us 
housing activity without an economywide downturn 
barbera acknowledges that its always dangerous in financial or 
economic forecasting to adopt the premise that things are 
different this time than they were in previous cycles 
but analysts say several things have indeed occurred lately to 
change the nature of the homebuilding business including the 
advent of the adjustablerate mortgage and the growth of the 
mortgagebacked securities market which channels additional money 
into real estate finance 
says grant we believe the housing cycle will go through 
narrower swings than in the past

the head of the city pension system says other 
stockholders should join him in voting against the exxon corp 
board unless the company gives assurances that it has taken steps 
to prevent another disaster like the alaskan oil spill 
city finance commissioner anthony e shorris and comptroller 
harrison j goldin met with exxon president lee r raymond on 
thursday 
shorris said they wanted to ensure the safety of the citys 250 
million investment in exxon stock and expressed concern that such 
an environmentally devastating spill not happen again 
shorris said exxon management listened to our concerns and 
asked for a couple of days in which to come back with a response 
we told them that depending on your answers we will vote 
against the board at the companys may 18 stockholders meeting 
he said 
although the pension fund holds 6 million shares or less than 1 
percent of exxon stock shorris said we would obviously be in 
contact with other pension systems throughout the country to see if 
we could get them to back us 
exxon spokeswoman sarah johnson declined to comment on 
thursdays meeting saying that meetings with investors are private 
shorris is chairman of the new york city employees retirement 
system which together with police fire and teacher pension 
systems controls about 20 billion in investments 
mayor edward i koch commented later that the oil spill at 
valdez alaska and exxons slow response are two outrages that 
cannot adequately be described in words 
he said he supported shorris decision to use nycers leverage 
to make exxon the environmentally sound corporate citizen it should 
have been long ago 
shorris said the city was willing to wait a couple of days 
to hear back from the oil company but cautioned that time is 
short 
he said the city wanted to know if any changes were contemplated 
in management structure of the firm what kind of research and 
development programs it has to deal with oil spills of the valdez 
magnitude and what contingency plans it has to deal with such 
mishaps 
he said that while the city is concerned with the environment 
the pension trustees also have a fiduciary obligation to the 
pensioneers to make sure their funds are safe

alaska colorado louisiana oklahoma texas and wyoming 
a lot of growth in new england is driven by services and 
hightech industries said kathy albetski of the departments 
bureau of economic analysis the slow growth was driven by the 
weakness in oil 
the fastest growth rate was recorded in the 
visaliatulareporterville region of california but that was 
largely because incomes there were relatively low to begin with 
the areas per capita income rose 97 percent to 12968 a level

bringing up the rear was the mcallenedinburgmission area of 
texas at 7001 
the first and lastplace areas were the same as in 1986 but 
the gap between them grew as the 91 percent rate of per capita 
income growth in the bridgeport area more than doubled the 42 
percent pace in the mcallen region 
the per capita income gap between the two regions was 19315 in 
1987 up from 17412 a year earlier

unemployment shot up 03 percentage points 
last month to 53 percent as job growth dropped to its lowest level 
in nearly three years the government said today in a report 
confirming a slowdown in the economy 
the april jobless rate was the highest since january and moved 
civilian unemployment off the more than 15year low of 50 percent 
posted in march 
the report inspired a broad rally of the stock market with the 
dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbing 1759 points in 
the first 90 minutes of trading 
some analysts questioned whether the economy has slowed too much 
to orchestrate a soft landing without a recession the early 
consensus was that a recession was not imminent although many 
analysts held fast to predictions one would come late this year or 
next year 
this is certainly consistent with a soft landing this is not 
a sign of a recession in progress said economist roger brinner 
of data resources inc in lexington mass 
the white house played down the increase in unemployment with 
spokesman marlin fitzwater noting that the percentage of 
workingage americans who have jobs remains at an alltime high 
of 633 percent 
the labor departments survey of business found the addition of 
117000 nonfarm payroll jobs in april the lowest number since the 
government reported a drop of 92000 positions in june 1986 
the department also revised march payroll growth to 171000 
down from 180000 in yet another sign of a slowing economy 
the slower job growth contrasts sharply with the average monthly 
payroll growth of 300000 in the 12 months that ended in february 
the number of unemployed workers also increased in april after 
two months of decline rising about 420000 to 65 million 
according to the labor departments separate household survey 
the business survey found that the average work week in the 
nonfarm private sector rose 04 hours to 35 hours while the 
manufacturing work week grew by 03 hours to 413 hours 
manufacturing overtime edged up 01 hour to 40 hours 
the department however said those figures may well be revised 
downward because the formula for seasonally adjusting the figures 
does not take into account that the easter holiday fell in march 
this year instead of april 
the department said the civilian labor force the pool of 
employable people grew by 395000 in april its largest monthly 
jump this year that would be greeted as good news by financial 
analysts who have blamed rising wages on an unusually tight labor 
market 
underscoring market concerns about inflation the report said 
average hourly earnings rose a seasonally adjusted 07 percent in 
april after climbing 03 percent for two months 
however janet norwood commissioner of labor statistics 
cautioned against reading the latest wage data as a major 
inflationary factor saying wage growth seems to occur in fits 
and starts 
at the same time she acknowledged that the report was another 
piece in the mounting evidence of an economic slowdown 
the slowdown in march and april is real ms norwood said in 
prepared congressional testimony while we are not getting net 
job losses we are creating far fewer jobs than we were even a few 
months ago and few industries are significantly expanding their 
employment 
she said some slowdown has to be expected in the record seventh 
year of the economic expansion and the slower growth did not 
necessarily signal a downturn 
the data make it increasingly unlikely that the federal reserve 
board will tighten credit again when its policymaking committee 
meets later this month the central bank has been keeping the tight 
rein on credit to slow the economy to curb inflation and recent 
reports have shown evidence of that slowdown 
the 117000 growth in nonfarm payrolls was about have the 
number predicted by most analysts and occurred almost entirely in 
the service sector still the growth even in that strong sector 
slowed somewhat with wholesale trade posting only a modest gain in 
jobs while finance insurance and real estate reported declines 
construction posted a modest gain of 6000 jobs after two months 
of reporting declines 
the increase in the civilian unemployment rate predominantly 
affected men 
the jobless rate among white men rose from 36 percent in march 
to 40 percent last month while among hispanic men it shot up from 
65 percent to 83 percent unemployment among black men rose from 
98 percent to 100 percent 
the unemployment rate among white women also rose from 38 
percent to 41 percent while among black women it dropped from 91 
percent to 88 percent the government does not break down the 
hispanic unemployment data by sexes 
among black teenagers the demographic group with by far the 
highest jobless rate unemployment dipped from 348 percent to 262 
percent in april 
in a separate caculation of unemployment including military 
personnel based in the united states the labor department said the 
jobless rate also rose by 03 percentage points from 49 percent 
to 52 percent

grain and soybean futures prices closed higher 
friday in quiet trading on the chicago board of trade as 
expectations of additional export of us grains spurred the market 
wheat futures continue to show strength as a result of the offer 
this week by the united states to sell 15 million metric tons of 
grain to the soviet union under the export subsidy program 
i think even if they are not bidding now they will be in the 
market in the near future said ted mao a grain specialist for 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york that is keeping wheat 
prices firm 
a day after the united states made the offer the soviets 
announced a bid for 300000 metric tons of wheat 
wheat prices were also helped along by the poor condition of the 
winter crop in kansas caused by dry weather and heat 
expected soviet demand for us corn also spurred prices for 
that commodity 
the soviets have made sporadic buys of corn in the past mao 
said the market is waiting to hear how much more buying will be 
done 
soybean futures rose on word of tightness in the us and 
brazilian cash soybean markets 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with may at

loss of 353 million for the same period a year ago 
revenue rose to 3155 million from 2767 million a year 
earlier 
losses increased largely because of rising interest rates on 
company debt and higher market costs for new products in the school 
publishing division the losses were offset by better performances 
in hbjs amusement park and insurance businesses according to the 
companys earnings statement 
because much of the companys business is seasonal

top executives of the los angeles herald 
examiner are exploring the possibility of a managementled buyout 
of the paper from hearst corp by a group that would include 
employees 
the discussions are in a very preliminary stage said john j 
mccabe the heralds chief operating executive 
i think its a long shot mccabe said we have to develop 
a strategic plan and ascertain if there would be equity funding 
available 
mccabe announced his plans to a group of the papers editors 
wednesday 
he said the proposal would be based on converting the 
242000circulation hearst daily to a tabloid format the 
possibility of such a conversion has been under study at the paper 
for several years 
earlier this year representatives of the toronto sun corp had 
discussions with hearst about a possible joint venture involving 
the herald examiner 
but the president of the toronto sun douglas creighton said 
that because of the suns heavy commitments to a new daily 
newspaper in ottawa and its simultaneous startup of a daily 
financial newspaper in canada his company had decided not to 
proceed 
in april los angeles billionaire marvin davis approached hearst 
about possibly buying the herald examiner but davis who recently 
launched a 27 billion bid for northwest airlines decided against 
the move 
heart plans to continue exploring different options mccabe 
said obviously hearst decided some months ago they were 
interested in looking for a buyer 
privately held hearst has acknowledged financial losses at the 
herald examiner but does not disclose specific figures for the 
newspaper 
in 1967 when nine unions embarked on a long strike the herald 
had a daily circulation of 729000 making it the nations largest

a highlevel manager at hughes aircraft co 
has accused the firm in a federal lawsuit of overcharging the 
government by 40 million on the radar system for the f18 fighter 
jet and b2 stealth bomber 
the lawsuit filed in us district court last january and 
unsealed late last month alleges that top officers at hughes 
conspired to defraud the government by shifting development charges 
among programs 
hughes aircraft a unit of general motors corp said thursday 
in a statement that its own investigation found that all the 
charges made to the government were proper 
filed under the federal false claims act the suit seeks 120 
million in triple damages the act allows a plaintiff to bring 
lawsuits on behalf of the government and share in the recovery of 
damages 
the suit refers to a special program contract instead of 
specifically identifying the b2 program but unidentified sources 
told the los angeles times that the project involved is the stealth 
bomber 
the suit was brought by william j schumer who was division 
contracts manager at the hughes radar system group in nearby el 
segundo schumer is still employed by hughes but in a different 
division 
attorney dean francis pace who is representing schumer said 
the justice department is investigating the allegations

united steelworkers negotiators friday 
approved a tentative contract agreement with bethlehem steel corp 
that restores wage cuts workers made nearly seven years ago to help 
the company avoid financial disaster 
if ratified by the 20500 usw members on the job at the nations 
secondlargest steelmaker the agreement would be the first among 
four major producers whose contracts expire july 31 
the 50month agreement would immediately boost the average 
hourly wage from 1123 to 1222 restoring an 8 percent cut 
granted by the union in august 1982 
it also restores three paid holidays and cost of living bonuses 
it improves pensions and insurance benefits and awards each worker 
a 500 signing bonus and a 500 advance on this years 
profitsharing payments 
the offer goes next to the unions international executive board 
and then to a vote by the rankandfile the negotiating committee 
voted 187 in favor 
bethlehems major plants are at sparrows point md bethlehem 
pa and burns harbor ind 
this is an agreement that puts the past behind us and all 
the difficult times of the 1980s said usw president lynn 
williams 
the settlement recognizes that sacrifices were made by uswa 
members in the past two contracts and also that bethlehem is still 
a company in transition that must continue to carefully control its 
costs said bethlehem senior vice president curtis barnette also 
the companys chief negotiator 
bethlehem lost more than 2 billion from 1982 to 1986 last year 
it had profits of 403 million and in the first quarter this year 
65 million 
the workers are expected to approve the contract because of the 
money it offers but williams said the centerpiece of the agreement 
is a career development program 
bethlehem will pay 300000 per month for worker training 
education and personal development 
the program will also receive the 5 per hour bethlehem agreed 
to pay for each hour of overtime worked beyond 56 hours per week 
the penalty climbs to 750 per hour in 1991 and 10 per hour in 
1992 
the penalty reflects the unions distaste for heavy overtime 
duty for some of its members while others have faded into 
retirement lowerpaying jobs or unemployment due to the industrys 
massive cutbacks since 1982 
williams said the career development program address the unions 
desire to help workers enhance their skills and with them their job 
security 
weve been itching to get at the problem in a more substantial 
way williams said weve created an opportunity to make a more 
substantial contribution to our members

civilian unemployment rising at the fastest 
clip in more than three years jumped to 53 percent last month 
the government said friday in a report that was taken as the 
strongest evidence yet of an economic slowdown 
propelling the 03 percentage point gain in the jobless rate was 
the smallest rise in new jobs since june 1986 the labor department 
said 
economists and financial markets concerned for months that the 
persistently heady economy was moving into a period of spiraling 
price hikes found both good and bad news in fridays report 
the dow jones industrial average up more than 24 points at 
midafternoon closed down 294 points brokers said some investors 
were apparently worried about what a slowing economy might mean for 
corporate profits 
indeed some analysts even wondered whether the dramatic 
increase in joblessness was signalling that the danger now is one 
not of inflation but of recession 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater played down the 
significance of the first rise in unemployment of george bushs 
brief tenure as president noting that the percentage of 
workingage americans with jobs remains at an alltime high of 
633 percent 
other economists welcomed from fridays news 
roger brinner of drimcgrawhill said the data was about 
perfect for prospects of generating a soft landing for the 
soaring economy slowing growth just enough to rein in inflation 
without triggering a recession 
theres no question the economy is weakening said 
washington economist michael evans but theres nothing in this 
report to suggest we are heading into a recession 
allen sinai of boston co economic advisers inc was more 
cautious 
he predicted a mild recession later this year and said the 
economy was downshifting to slower growth this is part and 
parcel of the bloom being off the rose of what has been a booming 
economy 
economists concurred that fridays surprising jump in the 
unemployment rate will likely be enough to keep the federal reserve 
board from further tightening credit when it next reevaluates 
monetary policy in two weeks 
aprils 53 percent civilian unemployment rate up from a 
15year low of 50 percent a month earlier and the biggest 
onemonth gain since february 1986 was felt most heavily by men 
the jobless rate among white men rose from 36 percent to 40 
percent for hispanic men from 65 percent to 83 percent for 
black men from 98 percent to 100 percent 
the commissioner of labor statistics janet l norwood who 
rarely speculates on the health of the economy told congress 
the slowdown in employment in march and april is real 
while economists have said rising unemployment is a necessary 
ingredient to cooling off inflation fridays report provided no 
immediate evidence of that causeandeffect relationship 
the labor department report based on a monthly sampling of the 
nations households showed that inflation if not picking up 
steam was at least persisting average hourly earnings rose a 
seasonally adjusted 07 percent in april after climbing 03 percent 
each of the prior two months 
sinai said the wage gains were an indication of a coming period 
of stagflation inflation despite slow economic growth 
but evans was skeptical 
i tend to disbelieve that number but its certainly a number 
to watch he said thats a very big number 
as for job growth last month a separate department survey of 
businesses found that only 117000 nonfarm payroll jobs were 
created 
at the same time the labor department revised payroll growth 
for march downward from 180000 to 171000 over the 12month 
period that ended in february an average of 300000 jobs had been 
created each month 
despite the overwhelming evidence of slower growth the 
department said that the average nonfarm work week rose 04 hour 
to 35 hours and that the manufacturing work week grew by 03 hour 
to 413 hours 
department analysts offering an explanation for those figures 
said the departments seasonal adjustment formula used to remove 
periodic predictable effects from the unemployment calculation 
assumes that easter falls in april the holiday was celebrated in 
march this year 
analysts said that quirk also was a likely factor in a reported 
april increase of only 5000 jobs in retail trade which had been 
posting average monthly gains of about 60000 
growth in the overall service sector was somewhat slower as 
well although service industries continued to provide the 
overwhelming bulk of payroll growth 112000 of the new positions 
that sector had averaged 258000 new positions over the prior three 
months 
the net gain of 5000 payroll positions in goodsproducing 
industries included a modest 6000 increase in construction 
employment after two months of declines and the second consecutive 
monthly gain in mining employment partially offsetting those gains 
was a drop of 9000 in manufacturing employment 
at the same time weekly manufacturing overtime edged up 01 
hour to an even four hours a sure sign to analysts that managers 
see even slower growth ahead and have decided to pay more overtime 
in lieu of hiring additional workers 
manufacturers and other employers have decided that life may 
be a little bit tough in the third and fourth quarters and they 
dont want to increase their fixed costs by adding to payrolls 
said brinner 
the labor department offered these other unemployment statistics 
joblessness among white women rose from 38 percent to 41 
percent but dropped for black women from 91 percent to 88 
percent 
among black teenagers unemployment dipped from 348 percent to 
262 percent 
in a calculation of unemployment including military personnel 
based in the united states the department said joblessness also 
rose by 03 percentage points from 49 percent to 52 percent

a jury has awarded 185000 to a man who 
was handcuffed at work and jailed after alamo rent a car agreed to 
extend his rental but then accused him of not returning the car on 
time 
an orange county jury agreed thursday that alamo maliciously 
prosecuted howard lee by falsely accusing him of keeping the rental 
car and then having him arrested 
the jury awarded the electrical contractor 80000 in 
compensatory damages for loss of reputation and 105000 in 
punitive damages 
although lee said he was satisfied with the verdict he said he

in a show of solidarity with troubled apple 
growers the washington state fruit commission on friday decided to 
pull 71000 worth of television advertising for northwest cherries 
from cbs affiliates in st louis atlanta and tampa fla 
the action is a protest against the cbs television show 60 
minutes which apple growers feel damaged their industry with a 
recent report on the chemical alar 
the move came as apple sales continued to rebound climbing 9 
percent in the past week according to the latest industry report 
released friday 
our association wanted to voice its displeasure over the way 
the cbs broadcast of the 60 minutes program chose to 
sensationalize the alar story commission spokesman pat dunlop 
said 
the television ads were part of a 900000 promotion of 
northwest cherries the directors of the marketing and promotion 
group approved thursday 
roy brunett a 60 minutes spokesman in new york declined 
comment on the action because it does not directly involve the 
network 
alar is not used on cherries but many of groups members grow 
both crops and were trying to take a united stance on this 
issue dunlop said 
atlanta st louis and tampa had been targeted for extensive 
television advertising because sales of northwest cherries in those 
areas are below the national average dunlop said 
the 71300 budgeted for advertising buys on the cbs affiliates 
in those three cities will instead be spent on advertising on other 
television stations there said dennis miller of the evanskraft 
advertising agency in seattle which handles the commissions 
accounts 
on feb 26 60 minutes ran an exclusive account of a natural 
resources defense council report on pesticides in childrens food 
the study concluded that eating apples treated with alar increased 
cancer risks in children 
the report findings have been disputed by the apple industry and 
federal regulators have declared apples safe to eat 
but the nrdc report sent apple sales into a tailspin and 
growers contend they have lost millions of dollars as a result 
washington grows half the nations apples and nearly all the 
domestic production this late in the season the industry still has 
168 million 42pound boxes in storage that must be sold before the 
next harvest in the fall 
the us environmental protection agency has said it plans to 
ban alar next year based on preliminary studies but the chemical 
is still legal to use

the dollar spurted higher in worldwide trading 
friday despite waves of concerted central bank intervention and the 
governments report of higher us unemployment during april 
the dollar still seems to be king said jack barbanel 
senior vice president at gruntal amp co 
early in the session the us currency fell sharply on the 
labor departments report indicating the jobless rate had climbed 
to 53 percent in april from 50 percent the previous month but 
the currencys recovery was quick and dramatic 
as the currency pushed against the level of 190 west german 
marks the federal reserve joined by west germanys bundesbank and 
other european central banks began the first in a series of rounds 
of dollarselling 
traders noted that the intervention though frequent was 
moderate in volume they interpreted that as a sign the fed only 
intended to slow the dollars rise rather than completly curtail 
it 
consistently strong buying took the dollar back through the 
intervention levels said jim mcgroarty senior vice president of 
greenwich capital markets inc in greenwich conn what the day 
showed is that there is a consistent strong demand for dollars for 
investment in the us be it in the stock or bond market he 
said 
while the unemployment report was consistent with recent 
statistics showing slower economic activity observers note that 
interest rates in the united states do not appear to be easing 
high us interest rates have boosted demand for dollars and 
dollardenominated investments 
the fed would like to keep the dollar from rising too far 
which would make us goods more expensive overseas in order to 
help ease the us trade deficit 
as long as the dollar still is a highyielding currency 
youre going to see it maintain pretty good strength barbanel 
said adding that only a severe economic slowdown or a swelling 
trade deficit are likely to stifle demand for the us currency

pittston co announced its first 
dividends in six years friday but a spokesman said the decision 
wasnt a response to striking coal miners who have recently raised 
doubts about the companys finances 
this had been talked about in the annual report and talked 
about by analysts said william j byrne jr a pittston 
spokesman people can read into these things what they want 
members of the united mine workers had questioned the companys 
failure to pay dividends since 1983 as part of a union strategy to 
take its disputes with the company directly to shareholders the 
union also has three proposals on the companys proxy ballot that 
will be voted during pittstons annual meeting wednesday 
officials at the union headquarters in washington dc werent 
available friday for comment on the payment of dividends according 
to a secretary reached by telephone 
pittstons board of directors meeting in greenwich agreed to 
pay a 5cent dividend on each share on june 1 to all stockholders 
of record as of may 16 rumors about the dividend had caused a 
50cent rise in the companys stock thursday to 1950 a share on 
the new york stock exchange 
in addition to announcing the dividend the companys directors 
approved a plan that will allow the company to repurchase up to 3 
million of its common shares since july 1986 pittston has bought 
52 million of its shares at a cost of 665 million or about 
1265 a share 
the company will purchase the shares from time to time as 
conditions warrant byrne said 
its the kind of program that wall street expects you to do 
we believe our stock is undervalued byrne said 
about 1500 miners in virginia and west virgina went on strike 
against the company on april 5 in a dispute over wages and 
benefits two hundred other miners at the companys operations in 
kentucky have remained on the job 
representatives of the miners union have formed the socalled 
pittston independent shareholders committee which owns 1721 of 
the companys 378 million shares outstanding

precious metal futures prices dropped friday in dull trading on 
new yorks commodities exchange in the wake of news that the 
nations unemployment rate shot up 03 percent to 53 percent in 
april 
on other markets grain and soybean prices were up livestock 
and meat prices were mixed and oil prices were down 
gold settled 120 to 30 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in june at 37960 a troy ounce silver was 15 cents to 
39 cents lower with may at 5598 a troy ounce 
there was more weakness in the economy than expected said 
stephen w platt an analyst for dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago initial selling was on the belief that the unemployment 
news would temper a surge in inflation inflation increases the 
desirability of investment in gold and silver 
platt also attributed the selloff to the strong dollar 
gold futures were able to recover most of their losses in late 
trading as investors began to believe the market was oversold 
silver which was trading within a 6cent range was also able 
to attract some support late 
metals have been hit by lack of participation platt said 
adding that with the bad market and adequate supplies there is not 
a rush to buy 
grain and soybean futures prices were higher in quiet trading on 
the chicago board of trade as expectations of additional export of 
us grains spurred the market 
earlier this week the united states offered to sell 15 million 
metric tons of grain to the soviet union under the export subsidy 
program 
the soviets have announced a bid for 300000 metric tons of 
wheat leaving about 12 million metric tons available to them 
i think even if they are not bidding now they will be in the 
market in the near future said ted mao a grain specialist for 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york that is keeping wheat 
prices firm 
expected soviet demand for us corn also spurred prices for 
that commodity 
the soviets have made sporadic buys of corn in the past mao 
said the market is waiting to hear how much more buying will be 
done 
soybean futures rose on word of tightness in the us and 
brazilian cash soybean markets 
wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with may at 437 a bushel 
corn was 1 cents to 4 cents higher with may at 280 a bushel 
oats were 3 cents to 6 cents higher with may at 196 a bushel 
soybeans were 1 cent to 9 cents higher with may at 759 a bushel 
energy futures declined in light trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange on expectations of a surplus of gasoline 
crude oil took a beating because of the weakness in 
gasoline said andrew lebow an analyst with ed amp f man 
international futures inc in new york 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 21 cents to 56 cents lower 
with june at 2002 cents a barrel heating oil was 95 cent to 
774 cents lower with june at 4085 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 55 cent to 212 cents lower with june at 6750 cents 
a gallon 
live cattle prices were mixed and pork futures slightly higher 
in light trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
the drop in cattle futures were limited by expected stronger 
cash prices in coming weeks and strong boxed meat purchases by 
retailers said analyst tom ohare of smith barney harris upham amp 
co in new york 
hog prices were helped by an anticipated decline in marketings 
next week but futures were weighed down by weak cash prices at the 
wholesale level 
live cattle were 15 cent lower to 20 cent higher with june at 
7242 cents a pound feeder cattle were 07 cent lower to 07 cent 
higher with may at 7697 cents a pound hogs were 05 cent lower to 
17 cent higher with june at 4727 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 37 cent lower to 13 cent higher with may at 3095

californias state employee pension fund the 
nations biggest said friday it might back an attempt by other 
major exxon corp shareholders to pressure the company to better 
prepare for future environmental disasters in the wake of its 
alaskan oil spill 
a spokesman for the california public employee retirement 
system which owns 8 million shares amounting to about 06 percent 
of exxons outstanding common stock said the fund may back new 
york citys plan to use its holdings in an effort to advocate the 
company change its spill strategies 
we are looking very closely at what new york city is doing 
said james burton deputy comptroller for the state of california 
if they are able to reach an agreement with exxon that would 
address our concerns we would endorse that 
new york officials said thursday after meeting with exxon 
executives that three city pension funds owning 6 million shares of 
exxon stock would vote against company management at the may 18 
annual meeting of shareholders if exxon failed to act on the 
groups recommendations 
among other requests the group is asking for the formation of a 
subcommittee of the board to handle environmental matters as well 
as for a new contingency plan to deal with future disasters 
alaska officials and environmentalists have criticized exxon for 
what they consider its slow response to the march 24 spill which 
has fouled hundreds of miles of waters and coastline 
new york citys employee firefighter and police funds together 
own exxon stock amounting to less than 1 percent of the companys 
133 billion outstanding common shares 
about 35 percent of exxons shares are owned by institutional 
investors the company has some 713000 shareholders 
burton said all pension funds with large holdings of exxon stock 
are worried that the spill would have financial consequences for 
the company california investors are particularly concerned about 
the inadequate state of preparedness by exxon he said 
were concerned about its management management has made 
statements in the past representations that they are capable of 
handling oil spills burton said it appears that they were in 
fact not prepared and that their representations are not accurate 
burton said that if california decides to take a position for or 
against exxon management the california state teachers retirement 
fund which holds 55 million exxon shares also would be included 
california comptroller gray davis is the trustee for both funds 
owning 135 million exxon shares or about 101 percent of the 
outstanding common 
separately a spokesman for new york states employee retirement 
fund indicated it was considering its own course of action tom 
pandick director of investor affairs for the state said the 
pension fund does not normally send an official representative to 
exxon annual meetings but would do so this year 
a spokesman for new york city comptroller harrison j goldin 
said goldin has been talking with the executive director of the 
council of institutional investors which represents 65 large 
pension funds with 300 billion in assets 
we have indications of interest of 22 million shares from 
other pension funds said steven cohen deputy counsel for the 
comptroller cohen said all of the pension funds are members of the 
council 
alaska pension fund officials said earlier this week they would 
withhold votes on their 650600 shares at this years meeting as a 
symbolic gesture to underscore the states concern about the spill

a year after armstrong tire co was 
acquired by the italian tiremaker pirelli several dozen employees 
of the new pirelli armstrong tire corp are going the extra mile 
and studying the mother tongue of their mother company 
treading where they havent been in years the classroom the 
new italian language students range from vice presidents to 
engineers 
some of the employees are spending extra time at work to take 
classes being offered in the cafeteria of the companys 
headquarters others including some vice presidents are being 
trained by tutors who come to their offices or are taking college 
courses 
in the hallways of the companys headquarters and out on the 
buildings grounds it is not uncommon to hear employees practicing 
their new language skills 
pirelli armstrong officials say it was their idea to start the 
program and that participation in the crashlanguage courses has 
been strictly voluntary 
its our way of saying we like being part of the pirelli 
organization said jan colella employee relations manager at 
pirelli armstrong 
it was our idea they executives in italy said slow down 
you dont have to learn so fast she said 
while most of the people from the pirelli group in milan italy 
speak english not all do so well so it is helpful if we can 
meet each other halfway sometimes collella said 
about 15 employees have finished a beginners class and have 
moved on to the next level of instruction meanwhile a second 
beginners class has also started the classes are held two days a 
week from 4 to 6 pm so that the employees are taught partly on 
their own time and partly on the companys the work day ends at 5 
pm 
collella said her office drew up a list of employees from the 
300 who work at the headquarters who might find knowledge of 
italian useful either because of contacts they will be making with 
italians or because of materials they must read 
when the employees were approached about taking lessons we 
didnt have anyone say no she said we got a very positive 
response 
at least seven managementlevel employees are learning italian 
through the berlitz method including william bruce who is a vice 
president and corporate counsel 
its tough to go back to school after all these years said 
bruce who is 37 its even tougher he said to find the time for 
visits by a tutor and for studying 
im not entirely satisfied with my progress at this point 
he said i can read it better than i can speak it 
a tutor has visited bruces office at least a couple dozen 
times but some weeks he has had to skip lessons he said he also 
has instructional tapes to play in his car but he said i cant 
say ive listened to them as religiously as i should 
bruce said there has been absolutely no attempt by executives in 
milan to pressure their american employees into learning italian 
the opposite happened he said when i was over there they 
said why are you learning it 
they seemed to be pleased by it he said 
bruce said he has found even his beginners knowledge of italian 
very useful on visiting milan and that he would like to attain a 
reasonable degree of fluency so i can communicate in a basic 
business conversation 
its fun its different bruce said

bond prices would rise 
the employment report said hourly earnings rose a seasonally 
adjusted 07 percent in april after climbing 03 percent a month 
for two months but held said the rise which could have ignited

a jump in aprils unemployment rate and weaker job creation 
implied economic growth has slowed but the government report 
friday provoked inconsistent reactions from financial markets 
the labor department said the civilian unemployment rate climbed 
to 53 percent from 5 percent in march 
as for job growth last month a survey of businesses found only 
117000 nonfarm payroll positions were created the smallest 
monthly addition in 3 years 
economists said the unexpectedly weak employment news offered 
the most convincing evidence yet of slower activity and said this 
may keep the federal reserve board from tightening credit any 
further when it reevaluates monetary policy in two weeks 
some analysts said the central bank might even decide to become 
more generous with credit causing interest rates to decline 
at first wall street greeted the report with an enthusiastic 
rally pushing the dow jones average of 30 industrials more than 20 
points higher 
after awhile though investors started worrying that a 
significant reduction in business activity could squeeze corporate 
profits plus the fed might not have the leeway to loosen its 
credit clamp because inflationary pressures dont seem to have 
abated much 
these worries and sales to collect profits left the dow jones 
average with a loss on the day of 294 at 238196 for the week 
the key market measure shed 3684 points 
overall stocks had a mixed day advancing issues outnumbered 
declines by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of new york stock 
exchangelisted stocks with 820 up 603 down and 539 unchanged 
meanwhile the dollar continued to flex its muscle ignoring the 
economic evidence and defying concerted attempts by central banks 
to check its advance 
usually weak us economic statistics tend to depress the 
dollars value against other major currencies 
foreign exchange dealers said as the currency pushed against the 
level of 190 west german marks the fed joined by west germanys 
bundesbank and other european central banks began the first in a 
series of dollar sales 
the intervention though frequent was moderate in volume 
dealers interpreted that as a sign the fed only intended to slow 
the dollars rise rather than completely curtail it at the end of 
new york trading the dollar was quoted at 18977 west german 
marks up from 18958 on thursday 
in the credit markets bond prices closed moderately higher 
relinquishing the earlier gains that came soon after the 
unemployment report was issued 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond rose point or 375 
per 1000 face amount its yield which moves in an opposite 
direction from price fell to 895 percent from 899 percent late

the machinists union at northwest airlines 
has told the carriers parent it plans to mount its own bid to buy 
the airline holding company union sources said friday 
the international association of machinists district lodge 143 
northwests largest union made the proposal in a letter to the 
board of directors of nwa inc northwests parent the sources 
told the associated press 
nwa is believed to be the target of several suitors including 
two to four that nwa chairman steven rothmeier said last week are 
friendly billionaire oilman marvin davis has made the only formal 
bid a 27 billion 90ashare offer that he this week switched 
from a hostile to a friendly effort 
nwa said it filed an amended document thursday with the 
securities and exchange commission stating that it plans to 
provide additional confidential information and access to an 
unspecified number of interested parties 
nwa also said it plans on may 12 to distribute certificates 
representing preferred stock purchase rights under the 
corporations poison pill shareholder rights plan to holders of 
nwa common stock as of the close of business may 4 
kevin whalen a northwest spokesman confirmed receipt of the 
letter but said he hadnt seen it and couldnt describe its 
contents 
were going to study the letter before we have a response to 
it whalen said we havent digested all the things in it 
the letter said the union was determined to explore initiation 
of our own program as an alternative to other bids for nwa said 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the machinists union represents about 21500 mechanics baggage 
handlers and other employees at northwest 
the letter said the unions proposal is at a preliminary stage 
however it outlined several elements likely to be included in its 
bid 
it would avoid the heavy debt burden typical of leveraged 
buyouts 
it would reduce labor costs while increasing nwas business and 
still not adversely affect the compensation of individual 
employees 
it would involve a substantial employee stake in nwa 
it would put a block of nwa stock in the hands of a patient 
investor acceptable to employees as opposed to a speculator 
interested in shortterm gain 
meanwhile nwa stock which shot to record highs thursday on 
signs that potential suitors were preparing for a bidding war rose 
even higher friday the stock closed at 105 a share up on the 
new york stock exchange 
bankers trust corp of new york confirmed thursday that it was 
working on a proposal with los angeles investor al checchi who 
leads a group holding 49 percent of nwa stock bankers trust 
senior vice president thomas parisi said the firm is prepared to 
advise checchi and arrange financing including an equity stake of 
its own parisi said details of a financing package have yet to be 
arranged 
mike hamilton a financial analyst with piper jaffray amp 
hopwood said stock traders also were intrigued by signs that 
another apparent suitor may be preparing an offer the company 
leveraged buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
reportedly has affiliated with shearson lehman hutton inc and 
apparently sold a large block of stock wednesday in 
cincinnatibased kroger co netting a 19 million profit 
in another development thursday nwa chairman steve rothmeier 
and the leaders of northwests 5000member pilots union said the 
unsettled labor contract covering the pilots remains a major wild 
card in the takeover battle 
pete dodge and kirk faupel officials of the air line pilots 
association also confirmed that they had been approached by four 
potential suitors checchi davis who started the bidding march 
30 kelso amp co a new york investment firm and wesray capital 
corp an investment firm founded by former treasury secretary 
william simon 
but they said all four broke off contact after nwa announced its 
ground rules 
in a separate interview rothmeier reiterated that the open 
labor contract is scaring off friendly bidders who dont want to 
buy or invest in an airline with excessive wage costs or labor 
trouble 
the company and the pilots continued their contract talks 
friday according to another alpa spokesman jim halvorson who 
said he had no immediate word on whether progress had been made
