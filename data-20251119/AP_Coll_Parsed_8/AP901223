feet above the bahamas on saturday knocking the twinengine 
cessnas baggage compartment into the surf but causing no 
injuries authorities said 
the falcon jet was flying at about 4000 feet on a routine law 
enforcement patrol over bimini island on saturday morning when its 
tail struck the cessnas baggage compartment said lt jeff 
karonis a coast guard spokesman in miami 
the cessna carried a pilot and five san francisco science 
teachers 
considering the impact and everything everybody involved was 
very lucky said aircraft mechanic bill peck who examined the 
cessna after it safely landed in miami 
if there had been about five or 10 inches difference in the 
way the jet had hit the bottom of the plane the people on the 
plane definitely would have been killed 
the belly of the cessna was scraped where its baggage 
compartment was ripped off and about six inches of the jets upper 
tail section broke off officials said 
the federal aviation administration was investigating the 
incident karonis said

defense secretary dick cheney warned 
sunday that the clock is ticking quickly toward war with iraq 
cheney also appeared to indirectly confirm that us forces 
known to have nuclear weapons aboard naval vessels also have some 
chemical weapons capacity in the persian gulf region 
the secretary is wrapping up a fiveday visit to saudi arabia 
that included classified strategy sessions with commanders and two 
days of prechristmas troop visits 
as he had all week cheney ducked questions about whether the 
united states has decided on a timetable to attack iraq if iraqi 
president saddam hussein ignores a united nationsimposed jan 15 
deadline to withdraw from kuwait iraq overran the neighboring 
emirate on aug 2 and later annexed it 
the clock is ticking as each day goes by and he saddam does 
not withdraw his forces from kuwait cheney said 
he told reporters that the american troop deployment in the 
region was nearing the 300000 mark 
cheney refused to answer when asked directly if the united

religious leaders urged prayers for 
nancy cruzan and her family saturday and called on antieuthanasia 
groups to stop trying to force the state to resume feeding the 
woman who is in a vegetative state 
her father joe cruzan said saturday that those protesting on 
his daughters behalf dont understand that if she could express 
herself she would say she does not want to live 
mark roebuck a spokesman for the missouri department of health 
said late saturday that ms cruzans condition continues to 
deteriorate and will soon be downgraded to critical she has been 
in a persistent vegetative state since she was injured in a car 
accident almost eight years ago 
doctors predicted ms cruzan 33 would die within two weeks 
after her feeding tube was removed dec 14 
her father told the joplin globe that terminal cancer patients 
in the missouri rehabilitation center where ms cruzan is a 
patient have rejected food and not been forcefed 
we believe that nancy would reject this treatment if she were 
able to make a decision he said she cant so therefore we 
have to make it for her 
antieuthanasia activists were stymied last week in asking 
various courts to force the state to resume feeding ms cruzan 
those legal setbacks snow and bitterly cold weather have 
lowered morale among some 15 demonstrators camped outside the 
missouri rehabilitation center where ms cruzan is cared for but 
spokesman andrew burnett said theyre planning on keeping the 
vigil up to the end of this ordeal 
spokesman andrew burnett director of the antiabortion and 
antieuthanasia group advocates for life said the protesters were 
planning on keeping the vigil up to the end of this ordeal 
in the meantime the rev patrick j mahoney a protestant 
minister who runs the center for christian activism in boca raton 
fla an advocacy group appealed saturday to the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals in st louis to get ms cruzans tube reconnected 
in his appeal mahoney asked the court to order the feeding tube 
reconnected until it can determine whether ms cruzans civil 
rights were violated in essence ms cruzan has been given a 
death sentence without process of the law the appeal document 
said 
the evangelical lutheran church in america the united methodist 
church the presbyterian church usa and the unitarian 
universalist association of congregations joined in issuing a 
statement supporting joe and joyce cruzan and their other two 
daughters donna and christy the cruzans are methodists 
we urge that those who are attempting to disrupt the ruling of 
the court and the wishes of nancy cruzan and her family end their 
activities and join us in respecting the judgments of the courts 
which have thoroughly examined the questions involved in the cruzan 
case and have concurred in the cruzan familys decision the 
statement said 
the statement also asked americans to lend their prayerful 
support to the family of nancy beth cruzan as they face the most 
difficult days of their life 
demonstrations at the rehabilitation center and the 19 arrests 
there tuesday only further burdened the cruzans said kay dowhower 
director of the evangelical lutheran church offices in washington 
we would hope our statement would be a sign of support and 
appreciation for how lonely death and the death process can be 
mrs dowhower said god and nature should take its own course 
what we have done in this case is prolong the suffering by 
sustaining life 
the roman catholic church also expressed support for the 
cruzans in a letter to be published sunday in the newsleader in 
springfield bishop john j leibrecht of the springfieldcape 
girardeau diocese said removing ms cruzans feeding tube was 
morally permissible 
fourteen demonstrators remained jailed saturday still invoking 
the name nancy cruzan and refusing to eat until she is fed or dies 
on friday joe cruzan presented demonstrators huddled outside 
the hospital in 15degree weather with a new coffee maker filters 
cups and an extension cord 
we are doing what we feel god has directed us to do and that 
is to carry out what we believe he told them we believe we 
are in the best position to know what would be nancys wishes 
cruzan said he appreciated their prayers and hoped the ordeal 
would be over soon 
lets all pray for a miracle that god will put an end to this 
and raise her up out of that bed and we can all go home and have a 
merry christmas he said

the saratoga and its three escort ships were in the red sea as 
part of the naval buildup in the persian gulf region following 
iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2

preserving the christmas tradition of a cozy 
house festooned with decorations family pictures and love is even 
more important to jeanne white since her son ryan died from aids 
last spring 
when you face a crisis like we have the family is the one 
that pulls together and stays together you cannot do it without 
family mrs white said 
the holiday decorations almost didnt come out this year but 
mrs white ultimately decided to follow the tradition ryan loved 
even though im sad a lot especially this holiday season has 
really been rough i feel like hes just everywhere hes in every 
part of everything i do mrs white said 
it helps that her mother is staying with her this month and her 
sisters family will be in for christmas day plus the phone 
continually rings with friends from around the country charities 
seeking mrs whites endorsement and reporters wanting interviews 
the chaos is a kind of therapy for mrs white who has taken 
another oneyear leave from her assembly line job at general motors 
corps delco plant in kokomo 
i dont know whether therell be a time when im tired of 
talking about aids we keep losing so many friends to it the 
people we have met along the way she said it drains you and 
you wonder out of a lot of the people we met when are they going 
to come down with it 
ryan died april 8 at age 18 after a fiveyear battle with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome a hemophiliac he was 13 when 
diagnosed with aids that he contracted through a tainted blood 
product 
hatred and abuse were heaped on ryan and his family by kokomo 
residents who fought to keep ryan out of middle school he won a 
landmark court case to attend school but the family left the school 
district anyway moving to the quiet lakeside home in cicero about 
20 miles north of indianapolis at that school he was welcomed and 
befriended 
recently a group of musicians released a song colors as a 
tribute to ryans memory and to promote aids awareness next up a 
book started by ryan that chronicles his life and deals frankly 
with questions about aids a coauthor helped mrs white finish the 
book after his death 
ryan white my own story is scheduled for release march 15 
by dial books with proceeds going to the ryan white fund at riley 
hospital for children in indianapolis a spring tribute to ryan is 
planned in los angeles to benefit the charities who supported him 
amid her grief the 42yearold mrs white remains focused on 
the killer disease that took her son away 
its on my mind a lot i see more and more hemophiliacs who 
are dying or who are coming down with aids and its like do i 
want to continue to be around all this tragedy 
she answers her own question 
you want to motivate some goodness there are some things i 
want to see get done she said 
i want to generate more awareness to where everybody 
understands this disease and to make it a disease like cancer or 
anything else that people can talk about a disease that maybe we 
can have some hope for where the end result isnt always 
death

the ronald reagan presidential library is 
nearing completion on a california hilltop but it may be years 
before the former presidents papers are available to scholars 
reagan is the first president to come under a 1978 law that 
makes presidential papers the property of the government and gives 
the national archives five years to process them 
we would prefer to use the full five years for processing 
john t fawcett assistant archivist for presidential libraries 
said in an interview 
however some papers may be available before the expiration of 
the five years which would be jan 20 1994 fawcett said the law 
also requires the agency to make such records available to the 
public as rapidly and completely as possible 
most former presidents tend to want to open these papers 
rather quickly the archives official said there are good 
administrative reasons why we should wait five years to begin 
opening the papers but we may do it sooner 
cathy goldberg a spokeswoman for reagan said from los angeles 
that reagan is pleased that scholars students and the public 
will have access to the presidential papers of his administration 
but since the library is under construction at this time the date 
of availability has not been determined 
samuel gammon executive director of the american historical 
association said in general we are always anxious to see 
things as soon as possible but we do recognize that the national 
archives in handling presidential libraries has certain financial 
problems and so on 
until reagan former presidents owned their white house papers 
except for those of richard nixon which were made government 
property b special legislation after the watergate scandals since 
the establishment of the presidential library system beginning 
with the franklin d roosevelt library in hyde park ny other 
presidents have donated their papers to the government and they 
have generally been available in less than five years 
reagans library being built near simi valley calif is 
expected to be completed shortly after his 80th birthday on feb 6 
after that the archives will begin moving in the papers which are 
now stored in a warehouse in culver city calif then the ronald 
reagan foundation will install museum exhibits dealing with the 
careers of reagan and his wife nancy dedication of the library is 
scheduled for early november 
reagan the first president to serve eight years since dwight d 
eisenhower in the 1950s left behind a record amount of paper an 
estimated 52600 cubic feet fawcett said more than 20000 cubic 
feet or 40 million pages almost equal to the entire bulk of the 
nixon papers were destroyed in a program initiated by the 
archives these papers were part of the mail to the president from 
members of the public fawcett said a sample was kept along with 
careful records of the rest these were the only reagan papers 
destroyed he said 
the documents had to be transported farther than any other 
presidential papers had since reagan is from california so for 
the first time the papers were flown fawcett said the archives 
considered using trucks or trains or even barging the documents 
through the panama canal but concluded that flying them would cost 
about the same as truck transportation and be safer and quicker 
a staff of 14 has been processing the papers at culver city the 
library will have a staff of 22 
under the law the former presidents personal papers those not 
related to official business remain his own property this 
category includes papers dealing with his 1984 reelection 
campaign but fawcett said reagan like jimmy carter before him 
has decided to deed campaign papers to the government 
both reagan and then vice president george bush exercised an 
option in the law to shield several categories of papers from 
public scrutiny for up to 12 years these include classified 
national security matters information about appointments to 
federal offices trade secrets confidential advice of presidential 
advisers information infringing on personal privacy and 
information that is protected by other laws 
archives is deciding what papers fit into each category if a 
researcher challenges such a classification archives must justify 
its decision within 30 days 
fawcett said archivists will make recommendations to reagans 
representative los angeles attorney stephen blitz to open up some 
of these papers in less than 12 years for instance he said there 
may often be no longer any reason to keep advice to the president 
on past decisions confidential 
blitz office said he was out of town and not available 
bushs vice presidential papers are stored at the archives in 
washington and may become part of his presidential library fawcett 
said rice university in houston the university of houston and 
texas a amp m have all bid to be the site of that library 
however long it takes for reagans papers to become public it 
is certain to be sooner than before the advent of presidential 
libraries 
abraham lincolns papers were not open to public research until 
1949 and the adams family still imposes some restrictions on the 
papers of john and john quincy adams fawcett said

next year in the philippines probably 
will be a grim one of rising inflation a declining economy and 
political instability 
after three years of economic growth rates over 5 percent many 
economists predict recession in 1991 with sharp increases in 
unemployment especially if war breaks out in the persian gulf 
higher oil costs that followed iraqs seizure of kuwait on aug 
2 forced the government to raise consumer fuel prices by more than 
45 percent 
that sent shock waves through an economy already struggling with 
doubledigit inflation and there are clear signs the business 
community is losing confidence in president corazon aquino 
the philippines gets 64 percent of its energy from imported oil 
and more than 80 percent of it comes from the middle east 
new foreign investments declined by 47 percent in the first 
eight months of 1990 and the departure of capital rose 342 percent 
as financiers moved their money to more stable havens 
we have not only lost our sense of bearings we have taken 
leave of our senses teodoro benigno mrs aquinos former 
spokesman wrote in the philippine star the philippines is now 
looked upon abroad as a basket case 
annual inflation of about 12 percent is expected to reach 16 
percent even without war in the gulf that will lead to demands by 
labor for wage increases industry says it cannot afford 
strikes and demonstrations are going to abound in the months 
ahead political and economic risk consultancy ltd of hong kong 
said in a report last month the government is widely perceived 
as being helpless 
aurelio periquet president of the philippine chamber of 
commerce and industry said industrial output could decline 40 
percent in 1991 because of higher fuel costs and a chronic energy 
shortage 
labor secretary ruben torres said recently that unemployment in 
this nation of 60 million people may rise to 13 percent from the 
current level of 9 percent 
thousands of filipinos have fled jobs in iraq and kuwait not 
only adding to the unemployment rolls but reducing remittances a 
major source of hard currency 
a national election scheduled for 1992 with no clear successor 
to mrs aquino in sight virtually guarantees political 
uncertainty the president has said she will not seek a second 
term 
mutinous soldiers after seven uprisings against mrs aquino 
say they will try at least once more to overthrow her communist 
rebels remain active but their strength has declined because of 
ideological differences and failures in strategy 
mrs aquino says her governments economic strategy was derailed 
by the persian gulf and an earthquake in july that killed nearly 
1700 people critics blame the looming economic crisis on 
government indecision and mismanagement 
fearful of domestic unrest the aquino government stalled for 
nearly 18 months on a pledge to the international monetary fund to 
reduce the budget deficit by eliminating subsidies on prices of 
petroleum products 
the deficit grew to 60 billion pesos 21 billion more than 
three times the original estimate causing the imf to delay new 
loans and aid 
on dec 5 the government raised fuel prices 45 percent more 
than the increase for crude oil that plunged mrs aquinos 
administration into a political crisis marked by nationwide 
transport strikes and calls for her resignation 
foreign exchange has become so scarce industrialist raul 
concepcion declared in a recent speech that even if oil fell to 
20 a barrel the philippines still would not have the dollars to 
pay 
our exports at 8 billion will be flat he said people 
do not seem to be aware of the gravity of the crisis and the 
government seems reluctant to open up 
despite the problems the public appears tired of politics after 
years of political upheaval 
demonstrations against oil price increases have been minuscule 
compared with the people power uprising of 1986 that drove the 
late president ferdinand marcos into exile and propelled mrs 
aquino to power 
jose luis alcuaz a former government telecommunications chief 
who organized recent protests of oil prices said people have been 
numbed by a series of problems its really difficult to organize 
now it will take some time 
that may explain in part why no clear successor to mrs aquino 
has emerged national elections are scheduled for may 1992 
among possible candidates mentioned are house speaker ramon 
mitra defense secretary fidel ramos senate president jovito 
salonga businessman eduardo cojuangco and former the former 
immigration chief miriam defensorsantiago 
none seems to have generated public enthusiasm 
many filipinos believe the structure mrs aquino set up early in 
her administration is too unwieldy to work regardless of who is 
president 
in 1986 she reestablished a usstyle bicameral legislature 
and presided over the writing of a new constitution modeled after 
the american system of checks and balances 
without strong executive leadership the system proved sluggish 
and decisions come only after long painful processes of 
compromise

operating at a wartime pace the us defense 
mapping agency says it has shipped 35 million maps to the nearly 
300000 us troops stationed in the persian gulf 
that may seem like overkill but the military needs maps of 
varying detail and intricacy with many to be used once and 
discarded the agency says 
we certainly hope it doesnt come to war but if it were to 
become a hostile action we want our troops to have the best 
products they can said dave black the agencys director of 
public affairs when the joint chiefs of staff lay out the 
requirements we meet them 
cartographers at the agencys two major production centers in 
st louis and brookmont md have been working 10 to 12hour 
shifts seven days a week since shortly after the united states 
began sending troops to the persian gulf as part of operation 
desert shield 
they worked around the clock through labor day and thanksgiving 
and there might not be any extra time at home for christmas not 
with a jan 15 deadline for iraq to get out of kuwait or face 
possible military action 
all of saudi arabia kuwait and iraq have been committed to 
paper black said the agency has had every country in the volatile 
middle east mapped for several years relying heavily on detailed 
satellite photos 
about 4500 different maps have been used in the territory 
covered by operation desert shield breaking down the topography 
into relatively small coverage areas for pilots tank commanders 
admirals and ground troops 
generally pilots need the big picture but pilots of lowflying 
aircraft including helicopters and jets launched from aircraft 
carriers need more specific information about hills and other 
terrain than bomber pilots soldiers on the ground need to know 
where roads and power lines are 
the number of maps shipped to the gulf include countless spares 
pilots might mark out a mission on a map then discard it ground 
troops do likewise for another reason 
youve got these things folded up and stuffed in your pocket 
so after a sweaty day in the desert they literally come apart 
said a clay ancell deputy director in charge of production at the 
center in st louis where aeronautical maps are made maps for 
land and sea are produced at brookmont near washington dc 
nearly every soldier in the desert has some sort of map the 
first ones began arriving in saudi arabia about a week after the 
first us troops landed there 
thanks to improved technology map production has already 
overstepped what was done during the korean and vietnam wars 
during the korean war the presses ran 24 hours a day seven 
days a week for years said otto stoessel graphic arts chief of 
the aerospace division we turned out a lot of work but compared 
to operation desert shield it was nothing 
weve done 10 times the amount of work in the last two months 
than we did during all of korea he said 
the defense mapping agency has been in existence since 1972 
before that each branch of the service took care of its own 
requirements which often caused duplication 
about 8000 people are employed at the centers in st louis and 
brookmont and even before the persian gulf crisis they were busy 
said ancell 
maps constantly must be updated and before last august the 
agency also was busy making maps used in the nations battle to 
stop the flow of drugs from south america 
were always playing catchup ancell said if you would 
gather up the joint chiefs of staff none of them would be happy 
with the support that their command receives they always want 
more

as much of the nation prepares to commemorate 
jesus christs birth christian groups have split on whether the 
arrival of their faith in the americas 500 years ago should be 
celebrated or mourned 
the roman catholic church plans a wartsandall celebration of 
five centuries of christianity for its 55 million members the 
national council of churches is planning counterdemonstrations to 
protest christian churches complicity in the perpetuation of 
paternalism and racism into our cultures and times 
the council says christians should tear asunder what christopher 
columbus has wrought in terms of the exploitation of native 
populations 
the groups document has some historians accusing the council of 
reviving the black legend used to condemn roman catholic 
expansion into the new world during the reformation the bloody 
16th century religious movement was aimed at reforming the catholic 
church and resulted in the establishment of protestantism 
the rationale is that it needs to be a year of repentance and 
reflection rather than a year of celebration said the rev joe 
agne a leader of the racial justice group that developed the 
council of churches statement 
the catholic church and some other religious groups say the 
injustices caused by colonization need to be recognized but so 
should the good the faith has done in this part of the world 
im kind of sorry for those who call themselves christians who 
dont think its something to celebrate said the rev james 
hennessey a priest and historian at canisius college 
the national council which includes most of the mainline 
protestant churches states what some historians have termed a 
discovery in reality was an invasion and colonization with 
legalized occupation genocide economic exploitation and a deep 
level of institutional racism and moral decadence 
other groups such as clergy and laity concerned an interfaith 
group with 20000 members also have said there is little to 
celebrate 
i would have to say that although christianity is a great 
thing the christian church as a human institution has been 
responsible for some pretty immense wrongdoing over the years 
said mark reeve editor of the calc report 
others though accentuate the positive said catholic 
archbishop edward mccarthy of miami already strong forces have 
gathered to characterize chritianity in the ugliest of terms while 
the reality of the churchs commitment to the americas is 
unparalleled in the annals of human history 
a pastoral letter approved by the catholic bishops in november 
heritage and hope evangelization in america apologizes for 
the racism and mistreatment native populations have endured since 
columbus landed but they added 
over the centuries thousands of men and women sought to bring 
the good news of jesus christ to their times healing the sick 
educating the ignorant and witnessing to their culture of the 
presence of christ 
rabbi james rudin director of interreligious affairs for the 
american jewish committee agreed that on balance theres much to 
celebrate in 1992 
although 1492 the year jewish people were expelled from spain 
was a dark moment in jewish history the voyage of columbus paved 
the way for one of the greatest jewish communities in history 
the one in the united states he said 
from a jewish perspective the arrival of columbus is looked 
on with great favor because it opened up a new era in jewish 
life rudin said 
some historians say the national council of churches document 
almost revives the stereotype of the passive noble savage in 
presenting history in stark contrasts of good and evil 
they point out contrary to the council of churches document 
some indian groups at the time engaged in slavery and inhuman 
practices such as blood sacrifices 
i see a reverse kind of racism in that nothing good can come 
from the people of europe and only good can come from the people 
called primitive said historian martin marty of the university 
of chicago 
other historians also questioned why the document dwelled on the 
evils of catholic missionary efforts and failed to specifically 
criticize the effects of english colonization or other largely 
protestant efforts in displacing native populations 
you pick on the spanish because that was part of the 
reformation polemic the spanish made good bad guys from the point 
of view of anglosaxon tradition said historian james muldoon of 
rutgers university this is a throwback to the 16th century 
reformation polemic 
the rev sam wynn head of the native american international 
caucus of the united methodist church said theres enough blame to 
go around 
for example he said a united methodist district superintendent 
led a cavalry massacre of 700 people 
this is not a time to celebrate past events that have 
annhilated whole groups of people in the name of god he said 
but others point out that even dating back to the days of 
columbus christian groups were outspoken in raising moral concerns 
over issues such as racism and the treatment of native peoples 
maybe the way we examine ourselves today is due to the 
consciousness raising that has occurred in the past 500 years 
said maria luisa gaston coordinator of the catholic celebration

romanians and bulgarians whose farms 
once fed eastern europe welcome freedom after decades of 
oppression but are more occupied with the struggle to get enough 
food and fuel for the winter 
they had hoped economic hard times would end with the downfall 
of their the old regimes a year ago but it hasnt happened 
we need food and clothes said livia hosszu of timisoara 
you cant eat democracy 
in romania food production has declined 20 percent since 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu was overthrown and executed 
less is being exported but much finds its way to the highpriced 
black market 
only 120 tons of meat were left in bulgarias main warehouse by 
middecember sofia alone normally needs 7000 tons a month sugar 
cooking oil and potatoes also were scarce or unavailable and energy 
was rationed 
after ceausescu and bulgarias todor zhivkov of bulgaria were 
ousted new governments were chosen in free elections with mandates 
for economic reform they promised a break with the old 
inefficient economics and a taste of the freemarket policies that 
western europe prosperous 
people in both countries say things have not improved 
bulgarians lived relatively well on the food and energy bought 
by zhivkovs liberal borrowing policies so this has been the worst 
winter ever for many 
months of political bickering between a weak government and 
divided opposition prevented action on measures to improve living 
standards 
shelves in food store usually are empty bulgaria stopped making 
payments months ago on a foreign debt of more than 10 billion and 
is strapped for cash to import energy 
if i could choose id choose to live in a country where there 
is maybe less democracy but more goods said marina popova 27 
who spends much of her time in a stuffy kitchenliving room with 
her husband 3yearold child and inlaws 
we dont have enough wood to heat the whole house and thats 
why during the day we all live in one room she told a visitor to 
kalugerovo her village 80 miles southeast of sofia 
little was for sale in the village store cheese packets of 
rice and cans of fish a supply van that used to come fully loaded 
three times a week now delivers sporadically said the store 
manager who would not give her name 
it may have been bad while zhivkov was in power but at least 
our shop was full she said 
another resident sotyanka sirakova said life gets worse and 
worse in bulgaria 
meat has been unavailable for four months and cooking oil for 
three she said in a shabby room she shares with her husband mrs 
sirakova 52 is an unemployed cleaning woman 
romanians suffered severely during the last decade of ceausecus 
rule when he exported most of the countrys food and raw materials 
to pay off the foreign debt 
a sense of betrayal by the subsequent government is particularly 
strong in the western city of timisoara 300 miles from bucharest 
where the the uprising against the dictator began 
the sacrifice was for nothing anna kis said of the 
unfulfilled promise of better times 
mrs kis a 42year old widow and ms hosszu 52 were 
interviewed after a fourhour shopping tour in giroc the working 
class district where some of the first protests occurred 
many people spend hours each day foraging for necessities more 
than 100 people waited outside a butcher shop for gristly 
unidentifiable cuts of meat 
the two women said food rationing normal under ceausescu had 
been introduced again in timisoara 
they said monthly limits per person were 44 pounds of sugar 2 
pounds of oil 15 eggs about half a pound of butter about 3 
pounds of flour and one chicken 
when asked what she had bought mrs kis pulled a chunk of lard 
and a garlic clove from a battered sack 
i wanted some salami or ham she said i also couldnt 
find any butter eggs flour or rice youve got a ration card but 
no food 
where food is concerned she said there is no difference 
between ceausescu and president ion iliescu who was elected in 
may iliescu is under increasing pressure to resign in part 
because of the dismal economic picture 
many basic items of clothing are unavailable and others are too 
expensive said mrs kis who earns 2800 lei 80 a month she 
said shoes that cost 350 lei a year ago now sell for 1500 lei if 
they can be found at the official price 
even on the black market you cant get what you want much of 
the time and things are three times as expensive as in state 
shops she said 
homes are warm in giroc mrs kis said said but the peole worry 
aout a fuel shortage 
in the nearby village of carpinis nothing but piles of coal 
dust remains in the fuel depot 
only those who know the right people stay warm and fed said 
magdalena wambach the village teacher its just like under 
ceausescu

citing increased arms shipments to leftist 
rebels in el salvador the bush administration may release 425 
million in salvadoran military aid which congress recently set 
aside us officials say 
any such move would almost certainly touch off heated opposition 
from democratic lawmakers who have become increasingly impatient 
with the continued american role in el salvadors bloody civil war 
now more than a decade old 
of particular concern to administration officials is evidence 
that the farabundo marti national liberation front fmln has 
received a substantial number of sovietmade sa14 
antiaircraft missiles one of which was used to shoot down a 
salvadoran fighterbomber last month another missile shot down an 
ac47 fixed wing gunship two weeks later 
the officials who asked not to be identified said the major 
supply source for the fmln continues to be the sandinistadominated 
military establishment in nicaragua 
even though the sandinista government was voted out of office in 
nicaragua in february arrangements agreed to by president violeta 
chamorro left the sandinistas in control of the military 
the commander in chief of the nicaraguan armed forces humberto 
ortega has denied any sandinista role in equipping the fmln 
the bush administration had asked for 85 million in aid for the 
salvadoran military for the current fiscal year but congress 
approved only half setting aside the remainder in a bid to promote 
a negotiated settlement in el salvador 
congress also was displeased with the pace of el salvadoran 
president alfredo cristianis investigation of the murders of six 
jesuit priests last year 
the aid could be released if president bush concludes that the 
fmln is continuing to import substantial quantities of weapons or 
is launching attacks noncombatant civilians recent fmln military 
campaigns have claimed hundreds of lives including some 
noncombatants the state department says 
release of the aid also could be approved if the administration 
concludes that the conservative cristiani government is being 
threatened by an fmln military offensive 
the officials said the status of the 425 million in set aside 
aid is under review meaning the administration is weighing 
the possibility of restoring it 
congressional sources said administration officials in publicly 
discussing the possibility of releasing the 425 million set 
aside are attempting to scare the rebels off the battlefield 
recent attempts at negotiating a settlement have bogged down 
the administration says an fmln demand for the liquidation of the 
salvadoran military and its price for a settlement is unreasonable 
the us officials said the soviets have confirmed sending 
sa14s to nicaragua and cuba and did not authorize the transfer of 
any of these weapons to the fmln 
when questioned about an sa14 launcher found at the site where 
the a37 fighterbomber was shot down soviet authorities confirmed 
that the item was supplied to the sandinista army in 1986 us 
officials said 
it was the first time the rebels had managed to down a 
salvadoran military aircraft in 11 years of war 
the fmln cause seemed doomed last winter after chamorros 
victory over nicaraguas sandinista president daniel ortega a 
us official reflecting on the continuing sandinista supply role 
said they the fmln are probably pleased and surprised at their 
ability to continue to receive supplies 
the official added that cuba also has been supplying the fmln 
and training rebel recruits 
after the two warplanes were shot down the state department 
announced on dec 7 that it was speeding up shipments of millions 
of dollars worth of military equipment to the salvadoran armed 
forces 
 
if the administration releases the aid congressional sources 
predict an angry reaction from some democratic lawmakers who will 
argue that the case for such action is weak 
one such source asking not to be identified said releasing the 
aid makes no political sense for bush 
why would the president want to start a fight when hes trying 
to line up support behind his persian gulf policy the source 
said

they saw homeless people a preacher giving a 
lively sermon an accordion player a violinist a man playing a 
comb wrapped in wax paper and lots of rats and mice 
but charlie redell and roy fox witnessed no muggings or drug 
deals during a threeday expedition through the entire subway 
system which they say proves the subway is not the 
terroramoment adventure that some people expect 
redell 17 and fox 51 a family friend set out thursday 
morning to ride every inch of subway track 722 miles worth 
they finished late saturday about six hours ahead of schedule 
still riding on the 115 tokens theyd put in the turnstyles 
thursday 
redell undertook the venture as a project for his humanities 
class at townsend harris high school 
many of my classmates live in queens and have overprotective 
parents and they never ride the subway he said my main gal 
with the project is to show that everything isnt as horrible as 
people say roy and i were never bothered once i never saw a knife 
and i never saw a gun 
fox a former radio talk show host who is now the caretaker of a 
cityowned 18th century house in the borough of queens says he 
wanted to see just how far a 115 token could go seven hundred 
and twentytwo miles thats not a bad deal 
fox says others have ridden every route in the subway system on 
one continuous trip but as far as he knows no one has ridden 
every inch of track to do this he and redell went through many 
stations more than once but on different tracks uptown 
downtown local and express 
in addition to the homeless people musicians and vermin their 
journey included two delays caused by a track fire and a power 
failure a freezing ride in the middle of the night on an elevated 
section of track a large woman dancing vivaciously to country 
music blasting from her radio a man with a huge hole in the seat 
of his pants wearing no underwear a man who kept threatening to 
slug his date and a very drunk fellow named walter who divulged 
his life story 
all part of the free entertainment provided by the ta 
said fox 
the transit authority had provided them with a list of working 
bathrooms scheduled track work and station concession stands 
the cuisine turned out to be a lot better than the candy and 
donuts they had anticipated buying one night redells mother met 
them at a station with dinner from mcdonalds which she served on 
her best china a photographer who met them periodically when they 
beeped his pager brought broiled chicken and fruit along with a 
table cloth and silk flowers and a television camera crew gave 
them hot dogs 
they slept only a few hours during the three days however 
when they finished they looked like the homeless people they 
had shared cars with hands black with grime 3dayold socks 
bunched down around their ankles blue jeans filthy 
whats next for the adventurers

a friendly 24year alliance between the 
national endowment for the arts and new york theater producer 
joseph papp collapsed in bitter enmity last month after an 
acrimonious exchange of letters over the issue of obscenity in the 
arts 
at the end papp had spurned nearly 748000 in federal grants 
and accused nea chairman john e frohnmayer of betraying the arts 
community in a futile attempt to appease the fanatical zeal of 
the religious right 
frohnmayer accused papp of inexcusable and selfserving 
behavior in rejecting the nea grants to protest a congressional ban 
on federal support for arts projects that might be deemed obscene 
papp president of the new york shakespeare festival fired his 
parting shot in a nov 15 letter asking how frohnmayer intended to 
implement new legislation which dropped the obscenity ban but 
requires the nea to consider general standards of decency in 
its grantmaking decisions 
your past record provides little assurance of an arts 
atmosphere free of subtle and notsosubtle intimidation papp 
wrote 
copies of the private sevenmonth exchange of letters between 
papp and frohnmayer were released by nea headquarters in response 
to a freedom of information act request by the associated press 
in separate interviews thursday frohnmayer and papp made clear 
that neither was in a hurry to heal their breach 
if we can restore relations with saddam hussein anything is 
possible papp said in a telephone interview from new york 
i suspect theyll come back at some point frohnmayer said 
but i dont propose to do anything about it myself 
papps battle with the nea under frohnmayers leadership 
coincides with serious financial problems at the new york 
shakespeare festival which papp founded in 1954 in a church 
basement on the lower east side 
the nonprofit theater organization largest in the united 
states now includes the fivestage public theater in manhattan 
free shakespeare performances at the delacorte theater in central 
park an annual latin festival and numerous other theatrical 
ventures 
papp received his first federal grant totaling 100000 in 
1966 a year after the arts endowment was created by congress 
earlier this month papp announced the festival will lay off 30 
of its 123 employees at the end of the year to save about 750000 
a year just about the amount of nea money he had turned away 
its totally a matter of economics papp said 
the producers battle with frohnmayer was fought over 
antiobscenity legislation which congress passed in october 1989 at 
the behest of sen jesse helms rnc the nea chairman has final 
authority to decide whether grants are approved or rejected under 
the law 
papp also objected to frohnmayers requirement that grant 
recipients sign an antiobscenity pledge even though it wasnt 
required under the law the nea chairman rescinded the pledge after 
congress repealed the obscenity ban last october and substituted 
the decency standard 
relations between the two men began to sour when papp wrote 
frohnmayer on april 9 expressing dismay about the obscenity ban and 
misgivings about the unthinkable if not downright subversive 
act of accepting a 50000 endowment grant under those conditions 
papp rejected the 50000 
the mood of the correspondence changed drastically after 
frohnmayer in late june overruled an nea panel of outside judges 
and rejected grants to four controversial performance artists 
whose solo stage acts usually deal with gay and lesbian issues 
racism and politics 
in a fourpage singlespaced letter dated july 3 papp charged 
that frohnmayer had sadly become jesse helms enforcer a censor 
a role illbefitting the leader of the arts in america by denying 
the four grants 
you must realize dear john that no matter how far you go 
you will never be able to appease the fanatical zeal of the 
religious right papp wrote 
papp urged frohnmayer to reverse himself and approve the four 
grants even if it meant possibly being fired by president bush 
do you want praise from senator helms and his cohorts or to 
live by your conscience and to be revered by americans who believe 
in the arts as a crucial part of our democracy papp asked 
frohnmayer didnt write back this time 
instead he rejected the appeals of the four grant applications 
karen finley holly hughes john fleck and tim miller they sued 
frohnmayer in federal court charging that he violated the 
constitution by denying the funds for political rather than 
artistic reasons 
on nov 1 after congress imposed the decency standard on 
arts endowment grants papp sent frohnmayer a curt threeparagraph 
letter 
he wrote that unreasonable restrictive measures make it 
impossible for the new york shakespeare festival to continue its 
relationship with the national endowment for the arts 
accordingly papp said he rejected as unacceptable nea 
grants totaling 323000 which had been approved the previous may 
and july 
because papp never claimed the funds before the fiscal year 
ended sept 30 the undisbursed grant money automatically reverted 
to the us treasury 
frohnmayer was outraged 
you sat on those grants throughout the duration of the fiscal 
year and now tell us that you will not use them thus denying 
323000 to some other deserving arts applicant he wrote papp on 
nov 5 
your actions are inexcusable and selfserving he added 
frohnmayer served notice he would withdraw three other papp 
grant applications from consideration unless he heard from the new 
york producer by nov 16 
in a nov 15 letter the last of the exchange papp confirmed 
he was withdrawing the three applications for new grants totaling 
375000 that brought to 748000 the federal funds awarded or 
applied for that papp rejected

the sponge fishermen of biscayne bay are feeling a 
squeeze on their livelihoods a state proposal in its final drafts 
would ban sponge fishing in biscayne national park covering about 
twothirds of the spongefertile biscayne bay 
federal and state officials worry that continued removal of 
sponges would seriously threaten the bays fragile ecosystem 
the fishermen insist their activity doesnt hurt the bays 
environment also threatened by shore development and heavy 
recreational use and keeps them and their families alive 
i dont know what im going to do said 77yearold pedro 
chico cordova a cuban immigrant who fishes with his son in 
biscayne bay ive been doing this all my life theres nothing i 
can do except for this 
sponge fishermen have worked biscayne bay which stretches about 
50 miles from key largo to north miami for nearly 1 centuries 
the fishing continued even after the southern end south from key 
biscayne was declared a national park in 1980 
a blight in the mediterranean in 1987 destroyed most of the 
mediterranean sponge population and forced a drastic increase in 
prices worldwide the natural sponges are considered superior to 
manmade sponges in some types of cleaning and cosmetic 
applications 
with the price increase the industry exploded at the prime 
florida sponge fishing sites in biscayne bay tarpon springs and 
the florida keys by 1989 as many as 30 boats with three or four 
men each were pulling sponges from the bay 
the mediterranean stock has since revived and the number of 
sponge fishermen in the bay has dropped to about 40 
thats still too many for park rangers 
its in excess of what the bay can handle said richard 
curry resource management coordinator for biscayne national park 
park officials say sponges are an irreplaceable component of a 
delicate marine ecosystem they act as water filters and their 
porous bodies provide habitats for smaller organisms such as 
juvenile fish and crabs 
further commercial fishing is contrary to the mandate of the 
national park service the officials say 
were here to preserve and protect the resources not preserve 
and utilize the resources said curry whos studied the bays 
ecosystem for 13 years 
responding to the park services concern the state fisheries 
commission recently passed the proposal to ban sponge fishing in 
the park it will hold a public hearing on jan 8 and fine tune the 
plan by its meeting at the end of january 
the present version of the plan calls for a gradual phaseout of 
sponge fishing in the park over the next year fishermen will be 
able to spend only two out of every four weeks on the water until 
dec 1 1991 when the commercial fishing of sponges will be 
prohibited entirely 
curry says the sponge ban may presage a wider ban on other 
commercial fisheries in the bay 
the fisheries commission estimated that fishermen harvested more 
than 1600 pounds of sponges last year 
some use environmentally harmful methods of fishing curry said 
they spread cooking oil on the surface of the water for better 
visibility and in violation of the law spend more than the 14 
days on the water in boats with poor sanitary facilities curry 
said 
in addition officials say sponges are being removed much 
faster than they can grow back 
the pure numbers of fishermen indicated to us that the 
harvesting was in excess of what the bay could handle said james 
a sanders park superintendent 
the fishermen all cuban immigrants are bitter about the 
proposed ban and perceive it as a personal attack on their way of 
life 
the workers are going to sue the government because you just 
cant throw the fishermen out on the street said cordova who 
grew up in the sponge fishing town of caibarien cuba

joseph and mary walked through streets of 
manhattans grim lower east side past the makeshift tents of 
homeless people and rundown tenements juxtaposed with gentrified 
apartment buildings 
they knock on a door 
we are looking for warmth and a bed for the night joseph 
tells the man who answers his arm around his pregnant wife 
no came the angry reply go i say for thou are poor 
and there is no bed or rest here for thee 
the scene was from an outdoor christmas pageant staged saturday 
by the rev george kuhn about 100 parishioners turned out to walk 
with the couple singing hymns and carrying candles 
but the story of a poor couple seeking warmth is more than a 
bible story its one kuhn hears daily as pastor of st brigids 
across the street from tompkins square park one of the citys 
largest encampments of homeless people our church opens right 
onto a place where 250 people are sleeping every night kuhn 
said so its very hard to preach the gospel and ignore the 
central people in the gospel the poor 
he delivers his message in the streets marching in 
demonstrations for affordable housing clashing with police and 
getting arrested again and again 
among the homeless and the squatters who have learned not to 
trust anyone too quickly he has a reputation as a sincere man who 
shares their doityourself spirit 
here if somethings wrong you fix it said calli tumulty 
a young woman living with a group of squatters in a row of 
abandoned cityowned tenements thats what father kuhn does he 
tries to fix things 
kuhn 51 dislikes to be called a radical street activist his 
is a religious pursuit 
as a pastor of a parish you live in the real world he 
said and our real world consists of drugs aids violence and 
homelessness 
his church was built by irish immigrants in 1850 the parish now 
is mainly hispanic and poverty is still rampant colorful murals 
put a bright face on otherwise crumbling buildings built more than 
a century ago creeping gentrification has forced some families out 
of their homes while others struggle with escalating rents 
the struggles of the parish are obvious in tompkins square park 
where on a recent frigid day dozens of homeless people huddled 
around trash barrel fires while neighborhood children played on 
swings and slides 
twice last winter the city tried to move the homeless out to 
shelters but the homeless returned to their flimsy tents and 
shanties a city count dec 13 found 104 people living there kuhn 
believes the number is more than twice that 
kuhn already had four arrests under his clerical collar for 
antiwar and antinuclear protests when he arrived at st 
brigids in 1986 
he stayed out of jail until he got involved last year with a 
group of squatters who occupied an abandoned school he was 
arrested three times for crossing a police barricade to take them 
food before they were finally evicted 
last october kuhn was arrested along with 20 others after 
squatters attempted to occupy some vacant neighborhood apartments 
in each arrest the charges were eventually dropped 
kuhn has the tacit support of cardinal john oconnor and has 
never been reprimanded following any of his arrests said joseph 
zwilling a spokesman for the archdiocese of new york 
kuhn blames the city for moving too slowly for not taking 
drastic measures like taking over vacant buildings or giving 
squatters legal standing to deal with desperate times by his 
count the city owns 200 abandoned buildings in the neighborhood 
if anyone doesnt see the public crisis that this city is 
facing with anywhere between 70000 and 100000 people homeless 
theres something wrong with them he said 
kuhn intends to continue doing what he can for the homeless and 
believes most of his 600 parishioners support him 
the only real protection they have is father george said 
peter cruz a church elder

the hunt for the killer of five college 
students which has no end in sight has also become a search for 
dollars 
investigators will visit washington early next month to lobby 
for financial aid they have run up a 3 million tab while checking 
out more than 5500 leads some 114 million in federal grants 
covered only a part of the overtime costs of the six agencies 
involved in a task force investigating the killings 
officials from the task force plan to meet to meet with sens 
connie mack and bob graham among others in hopes of getting more 
money 
the gainesville police department is already in the hole for 
309120 and the other agencies expenses also are outstripping the 
amount of the grants 
a city this size cannot afford that hit said patrick 
callahan budget coordinator for the gainesville police department 
gainesville police are already cutting back on some programs and 
delaying implementation of others to continue paying for the 
investigation 
well do what it takes we are not going to base this 
investigation on available income he said well find the 
money its that important 
the department he said is determined to pay for the 
investigation for a full year after the murders that may not be 
long enough 
there is nothing im aware of at this point in time to allow 
me to project when well solve this case state attorney len 
register said recently 
the focus has faded from former university of florida freshman 
edward lewis humphrey for weeks considered a strong suspect he is 
currently serving a sentence in a mental institution for beating 
his grandmother 
gainesville police chief wayland clifton said he remains 
confident the case will be solved but cautions citizens not to let 
down their guard 
our assumption is he could strike again clifton said 
most of the 65 investigators who remain on the case are taking a 
break for the holidays and will return in january some florida 
department of law enforcement agents have moved out of motels and 
into apartments telling relatives they could be here a year 
it could be even longer register said 
more than 300 investigators came in aug 29 after the last of 
five victims were found 
the killings came on the eve of the fall semesters beginning as 
students moved into apartments and dorms the excitement of a new 
school year on everyones minds 
fall is kind of a semester of dreams its the semester you 
think you are going to get straight as youre going to find the 
girlfriend or boyfriend of your dreams youve got a football team 
all set for a new season said michael browne university of 
florida student body president that was all taken away from 
us 
the murders are still topics of conversation and there is still 
fear on the campus 
the student newspaper the independent florida alligator

egypts traditional role as big brother to 
the arabs has never been tested more than during its confrontation 
with the other major arab power iraq analysts say president hosni 
mubarak passed the test well 
no matter how the persian gulf crisis ends they say egypts 
role has been enhanced with saudi arabia and the smaller persian 
gulf states 
its importance stemming mainly from its military strength and 
the political weight it carries with the west probably will be 
increased for a long time to come 
a likely scenario would be the oilrich sheikdoms especially 
saudi arabia financing a standing egyptian army as the backbone of 
regional security in the gulf 
this is not viewed as an egyptian rentacop nor is it viewed 
as a saudi bailout said jim zogby of the washingtonbased 
arabamerican institute he said political and economic cooperation 
would be an integral part of the relationship 
egypt already has close to 30000 soldiers in saudi arabia and 
the united arab emirates part of a usdominated multinational 
force half a million strong 
mubarak and president bushs administration pieced together the 
arab force involving syrian and moroccan troops as well after 
iraqs army invaded kuwait on aug 2 and its president saddam 
hussein annexed the emirate six days later 
zogby and others said the basis of egypts new military 
prominence is a general unease with the presence of a 
quartermillion us soldiers on arab soil to protect arabs from 
arabs 
richard murphy former assistant secretary of state for the near 
east and south asia sees among the arabs a sense of shame that 
arabs fouled the nest but they want to take care of it 
themselves 
the notion of american forces remaining in the area after the 
crisis ends in itself is uncomfortable for everybody said 
murphy by telephone from new york where he is an analyst for the 
council on foreign relations 
and even if they did stay he said a united nations flag 
would be more comfortable but the saudis want an arab force 
that means to a great extent an egyptian force egypt has a 
standing army of half a million men and more than 600000 reserves 
it is the only arab force capable of standing up to iraqs 
millionman military 
in cairo the thinking in the foreign ministry is that us 
soldiers will be necessary for some time after iraq is driven out 
of kuwait the gulf arabs and egypt need breathing room for 
organizing a regional defense force egyptian diplomats say 
they also are talking about how the arab force must be formed 
from within and egypts special role in it 
any arab security system must emanate from within the arab 
nation foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid told an economics and 
political seminar at cairo university it should not be imposed 
from outside if it is it will definitely fail 
abdelmeguids chief aide minister of state butros ghali said 
the reshaping of egypts role extends beyond shoring up weaker 
nations with its military might 
one of the first objectives of egyptian diplomacy once the 
gulf crisis is over will be to create a new momentum in favor of 
economic integration of the arab world ghali told an interviewer 
in new york 
with that he said can come political cohesion that would let 
the arabs compete with a united europe

police barred holiday grocery 
shoppers from supermarkets sunday after a bomb exploded and six 
other bombs were deactivated before stores opened the authorities 
blamed guerrillas 
no one was hurt and damage was still being added up said 
police spokesman cesar augusto somoza 
the explosion at 815 am 915 am edt ripped through a 
supermarket 200 yards from the president rafael callejas offices 
the spokesman said the presidential offices were closed for the 
holidays 
a police bomb squad deactivated six powerful bombs at three 
other supermarkets the police spokesman said two of the six were 
discovered at a grocery store in a mall 300 yards south of the us 
embassy 
police ordered supermarkets to stay closed until the afternoon 
while they searched for bombs 
somoza linked the bombs to an announcement by the morazan 
liberation front which said on the radio sunday it was beginning 
an offensive against callejas government for its economic 
policies 
the 11yearold morazan liberation front detonated two other 
bombs earlier this month police said the organization a militant 
wing of the honduran communist party is blamed for numerous 
dynamite attacks since 1983 
police said they had arrested two front members juan jose vaca 
nunez 30 and marco tulio funez duarte 31 on suspicion of 
bombing and bombing attempts both are union leaders at a 
subsidiary of the cincinnatibased banana company chiquita brands 
international inc 
the guerrillas announcement said they initiated an offensive 
of solidarity with the people and against those who not caring 
about hondurans suffering and oppression do dirty business in the 
name of the governing national partys structural adjustment 
policy 
on march 12 barely two months after callejas inauguration his 
administration put into effect a series of austerity measures that 
have crippled consumers buying power the administration approved 
a 300 percent increase in electricity water and phone rates 
prices have soared for basic products such as meat beans milk 
bread eggs and fuel the cost of gasoline rose 147 percent 
between june and september to 556 a gallon 
callejas introduced the measures in an effort to offset 
honduras 600 million deficit and make payments on the countrys 
35 billion foreign debt 
however they resulted in raging inflation calculated at 32 
percent for the year by the government and as high as 100 percent 
by private economists 
the morazan liberation front said sunday it has formed 
detachments of hondurans to struggle for better living conditions 
for honduras poor 
police claim that the group detonated two highpowered bombs on 
dec 12 and 18 that injured one person and damaged three buildings 
in san pedro sula 125 miles northwest of tegucigalpa 
the group is named for former president francisco morazan who 
led an armed movement to unite the five countries of central 
america in the early 1800s 
the front born during 14 years of military rule initiated an 
unsuccessful boycott of 1980 legislative elections 
members have been accused of wounding at least 15 us soldiers 
in dynamite attacks between 1983 and 1989 they have also been 
charged with three armed attacks on us military convoys traveling 
honduran highways

intent

and wounding 11 others in a socalled slave market a spot where 
arabs gather for hire as day laborers by israeli employers 
popper armed with an uzi submachine gun ordered 50 
palestinians to sit on the ground then raked them with gunfire

gun and was wearing israeli army pants 
after poppers arrest authorities said he was deranged and 
despondent over a failed love affair army officials said popper 
was dishonorably discharged from service for being absent without 
leave 
poppers attorney said his client was mentally incapable of 
understanding the charges against him but a panel of five 
courtappointed psychiatrists found him competent to stand trial 
family members later complained they could not afford examination 
by independent psychiatrists

popper two weeks before the rishon lezion killings and that he 
threatened to kill himself the radio said

of the shootings and told her i did a terrible thing i fired at 
15 arabs to be far away from you

tied to a tree and raped by a man 
after his arrest popper said he had been raped by seven arabs

mahala roach tried an innovation for 
christmas 1851 
the children had such a number of gifts that i made a 
christmas tree for them mother aunt and liz came down to see it 
all said it was something new to them she wrote in her diary 
that year i never saw one but learned from some of the german 
stories i had been reading 
she didnt describe the tree but it probably looked something 
like the little orange tree in the living room of the 1850 
house the louisiana state museums recreation of a period 
french quarter apartment 
people used what they had mostly either crepe myrtle or mock 
orange said dot mouton who led a museum tour 
gilded nuts and apples hang from the branches along with lacy 
handkerchiefs a paper doll a top a ring a necklace a tiny 
stuffed bear small red and gold paper cornucopias and a few small 
wrapped boxes 
the gilded nuts might have held small gifts 
a lot of people dont realize that the nut was a surprise you 
might have a nut or you might have a little gift said claire 
conlin a former history professor who researched christmases past 
for the museum of course that was a walnut because it was 
easier to glue back together 
most gifts werent wrapped 
wrapping wasnt important until the end of the century said 
mrs conlin she said the famous swedish opera star jenny lind 
during a christmas stay in north carolina wrapped her gifts as a 
joke 
instead of wrapping the presents to keep them secret they were 
kept hidden until the tree was decorated and children werent 
allowed into the parlor with the christmas tree until the day they 
got their presents 
in addition to toys around the base of the tree there also is a 
pitcher and sponge 
you notice the candles for lighting on the tree there would 
be a servant at the tree all the time in case of fire said ms 
mouton 
mahala eggleston roach was from vicksburg miss rather than 
from new orleans but the customs were the same said mrs conlin 
she said mrs roachs diary was used because it had so many 
christmas entries 
ive researched a number of places in the south ive also 
researched in chicago during the same period the customs were 
very much the same she said 
one entry in the diary shows that christmas stockings werent 
hung only for children 
i found in my stockings a beautiful gold cross a pair of 
etruscan sleeve buttons and two bottles of wine on the table 
mrs roach wrote in 1860 
and yes she probably did hang up both of her stockings 
they seem to have hung up more than one stocking even in 
sketches if there are two children in bed there seem to be four 
stockings hung up said mrs conlin

a bibletoting assailant broke into a home for 
elderly jewish people saturday night and attacked six residents 
with a pipe but officials discounted bigotry as a motive for the 
assault 
police said he made no antisemitic comments during or after the 
attack and a jewish leader said the man simply appeared to be a 
deranged individual 
one man and five women ranging in age from 76 to 90 from the 
golden acres home for jewish aged were taken to baylor university 
medical center five of the injured were discharged sunday with 
one woman remaining for observation said hospital administrator 
wilbur b smith 
two of the six suffered concussions said hospital spokeswoman 
nancy rhodes the others had cuts and bruises names werent 
released 
they really are basically very stable and doing ok she 
said 
police said the attacker in his early 20s broke into the 
255resident nursing home shortly before 9 pm by smashing the 
glass of the front door carrying a bible and a fourfoot section 
of pipe he went to a secondfloor recreation room where the six 
residents were sitting and beat them 
he told them not to be fearful said herbert shore the 
homes retired administrator who rushed there after hearing of the 
attack 
police were unsure of the mans identity sunday saying he had 
given thm several names he was taken to parkland memorial 
hospital authorities said 
he was acting alone and may have been deranged as far as we 
can tell shore said 
police said the man would be charged with six counts of 
aggravated assault or injury to an elderly person both are 
felonies 
clearly its a horrible act by what seems at this hour to 
be a deranged individual said mark briskman regional director 
of the bnai brith antidefamation league 
i think its more random than targeted briskman said after 
talking to police youre talking about a guy who is high on 
something youre talking about an individual not a group of 
individuals 
but he added it is absolutely shocking and despicable if 
the elderly were targeted because it was a jewish facility 
rabbi sheldon zimmerman of temple emanuel said the nursing home 
tightened security a couple of years ago after threats from 
skinheads who espouse white supremacist and antisemitic views

a prominent family has demanded 
floggings for four religious policemen who they say forced their 
daughters car off the road and roughed up the 20yearold student 
because they believed she was dressed immodestly 
the incident is one of several indicating the rising tension 
between westernized saudis and islamic conservatives 
the conservatives are reasserting their control one saudi 
diplomat said on condition of anonymity issues that link religion 
and politics are highly sensitive in the kingdom and no sources 
wanted to be quoted by name 
the rigid moslems say they are enforcing islamic laws as 
founding prophet mohammed would have wanted they are especially 
vigilant in enforcing the ban on alcohol and socializing between 
the sexes as well as enforcing modest dress for women which they 
interpret as headtotoe covering 
formally known as committees for encouraging virture and 
preventing vice the police are usually called muttawiin or 
volunteers they reject wearing bands around their headscarves as 
many saudis do as unnecessary adornment they wear short thobes 
as the saudi mens robe is called and some carrylong thin camel 
prods 
the sources said the government concentrating its forces on the 
confrontation with iraqi president saddam hussein does not want 
tension over social issues 
in this kind of environment the last thing the ruling family 
wanted to do was start experimenting with societys traditions a 
western diplomat said 
the government has tried to calm the religious elements that 
have criticized the influx of hundreds of thousands of foreign 
troops to defend the kingdom since iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
and in an attempt to diffuse the situation the government 
recently appointed dr abdul aziz ibn abdulrahman alsaeed 
president of the religious police alsaeed was educated at the 
alazhar university the oldest islamic university known for 
encouraging debate on islamic issues 
alsaeed told the okaz newspaper that the worst excesses of the 
religious police would be curbed but he said the force would be 
more active 
they should deal with people nicely and argue with them for 
the better as the koran prescribes he said referring to the 
holy book of islam 
in the latest incident thursday the daughter of a prominent 
riyadh family had just left a tennis game in the diplomatic 
quarter she was riding in the car with two foreign maids and a 
sudanese driver family members said 
religious police in another car signaled them to pull over but 
the girl told the driver to dash for home 
the muttawiin bashed into the car repeatedly in a freeway chase 
over several miles forcing the car to stop 
when the four would not open their doors the police aged 16 
to 22 smashed the windows and hauled out the driver they pulled 
the maids hair and then tussled with the girl when she tried to 
prevent them from driving the car 
they called her names and accused her of immodest dress and 
wearing makeup the family said her hair was covered and she was 
not wearing cosmetics 
the traffic police interceded and summoned the girls brothers 
under islamic law when a girl is unjustly insulted in public 
her family has the right to ask for retribution and they asked for 
80 lashes 
riyadh governor prince salman ordered the four men jailed while 
the investigation is under way the family said 
a november protest in which 40 women defied the traditional ban 
on women driving by taking to the highways of riyadh proved a 
rallying cry among conservatives 
religious police have since stationed themselves outside the 
diplomatic quarter near upscale shopping centers and womens 
universities the number of confrontations has jumped markedly and 
a few have involved members of the royal family unheard of 
previously 
foreign women have had their cars stopped and been jailed 
overnight allegedly for not covering their heads diplomats said 
the religious police raided a diplomatic party in riyadh in 
november and their rough treatment of guests prompted an official 
protest 
in late november police climbed over walls into the villa of a 
rich perfume manufacturer in jiddah where a party involving liquor 
and single women was under way an islamic judge handed down 
sentences of up to two years

never mind the slow christmas sales in the united 
states and britain german merchants are enjoying a holiday boom 
fueled by 166 million eastern germans hungry for consumer products 
after decades of deprivation 
shoppers have been standing a dozen deep at german cash 
registers this christmas season elbowing and pushing their way to 
snatch up everything from expensive video recorders to chocolate 
santas 
in a weekend report the german retailers association estimated 
christmas sales in the united germany at 18 billion nearly 70 
percent of the stores surveyed reported sales were up this 
christmas season compared with last year although no percentage of 
increase was given 
there is an overwhelmingly positive mood in the retail 
stores the association of german retailers said 
overall retail sales in germany for the entire year are expected 
to reach 465 billion up a hefty 12 percent from 1989 the annual 
figure will be a postwar record 
the figures tell only part of the story beyond that are packed 
stores harried sales clerks and streets filled with shoppers 
in downtown berlin shoppers from eastern germany and eastern 
europe are snapping up everything in sight 
we dont have it say sales clerks fielding dozens of 
demands oh thats been sold out for a long time 
watches computer and electronics products and toys are the 
leading sellers jewelry and other bigticket items are often in 
hot demand as well 
berlins grocery stores are having a hard time keeping supplies 
in stock of christmas baking staples such as almonds and raisins 
berlins tagesspiegel newspaper said sunday the city was 
enjoying the sales of a century 
the tagesspiegel reported that berlin would see a 30 percent 
jump in sales compared with last year that would be a 
recordbreaking increase 
richard hennig the manager of one huge hertie department store 
told the newspaper that hardly any department has been left out 
of the christmas sales rush 
just how long the good times in germany can go on remains to be 
seen recessions are looming in the united states and britain two 
of germanys big export markets 
many financial experts are predicting an overall economic 
slowdown next year as the full costs of german unification hit the 
countrys manufacturers and consumers the countries reunited on 
oct 3 
but for now the buying frenzy is unabated 
in berlins far western section of staaken close to former east 
germany a mother went to a woolworth store back in november to 
search for a barbie doll accessory for her daughters christmas 
stocking 
we dont have that because all the people from eastern germany 
are coming over and buying everything up the store clerk said as 
he dashed from one customer to another 
store detectives are being kept busy too by an increase in 
shoplifting a sign in the window of one store in berlins spandau 
district said the rise in theft had been catastrophic 
the demand is also swamping the huge german mailorder houses 
which pride themselves on promptly filling customers orders 
some customers of the otto catalogue store have been getting 
letters saying that the high number of orders from east and 
west have slowed delivery the house said that as a result it 
could not keep its usual promise of deliveries in time for 
christmas

end to her nearly eight years in a vegetative state 
the 33yearold woman remained in deteriorating condition 
sunday 10 days after a judge allowed her parents to order her 
feeding tube removed doctors say her condition brought on by a 
1983 traffic accident is irreversible 
the future right now is a great big question mark her 
father joe cruzan said in an interview published sunday by the 
joplin globe 
it will be extremely difficult to cope with the transition 
after eight years of constant stress when the first thing you do is 
to come home and check the mail and the message machine he said 
its like coming into a different land 
the father urged antieuthanasia activists camping in freezing 
temperatures outside the southwestern missouri hospital to pray for 
his daughter 
i think we should concentrate our prayer on gods will for 
nancy if he wants her to be healed he will heal her he said 
if not that he will make her death quick and painless 
his wife joyce cruzan said its time to let go 
at least well know nancys at peace the mother said 
somewhere out there nancys still tied to this body by a thread 
we are going to snip that thread and then she will be completely 
free 
mrs cruzan said her daughters condition has not changed much 
since the nutrition and hydration was stopped dec 14 we havent 
seen a lot of change her face may be a little thinner 
doctors have said she likely will die this week with a feeding 
tube they said she could have stayed alive another 30 or 40 
years 
a candlelight vigil was held saturday night at the lawrence 
county jail for protesters arrested tuesday when they tried to 
reach ms cruzans room they were released late saturday 
sheriffs officials said 
joe cruzan told the newspaper that if his daughter could make 
the decision she would reject attempts to keep her alive 
there are people on this floor right here terminal cancer 
patients whoif they dont want their food are not forcefed 
he said i have never had anyone tell me they would like to live 
like this 
various courts last week denied attempts by by antieuthanasia 
activists to force the state to resume feeding ms cruzan 
the rev patrick j mahoney a protestant minister who runs the 
center for christian activism in boca raton fla asked the 8th 
us circuit court of appeals in st louis on saturday to reconnect

omar a moslem taxi driver dons his red 
santa claus suit and fluffy white beard every morning to deliver a 
toy stores christmas gifts in moslem west beirut 
lebanon with 17 known religious sects once observed all 
religious holidays but that tolerance died amid the bloodletting 
of nearly 16 years of civil war 
christmas celebrations were further muted in 1985 when 
proiranian shiite fundamentalist gunmen cracked down on 
unislamic activities 
now with new efforts to end the civil war the citys christian 
areas are again celebrating the holiday and the moslem sector is 
joining in 
christmas carols echo through the hamra commercial district of 
moslem west beirut christmas trees and other festive decorations 
are up in the streets just as they are in the eastern christian 
sector 
omar thats the only name he would give has been hired by 
toy shop owner fawziya makkouk a moslem woman 
he said he found nothing strange in delivering toys to moslem as 
well as christian children to celebrate a christian ritual 
i like children said omar who has three of his own i 
like making them happy by delivering the toys i also make some 
money i also get some toys free for my kids 
even now its not all sweetness and light political rivalries 
remain and the future is uncertain in a city wrecked by war 
municipal electricity is rationed to three hours a day because 
of battle damage garbage is piled up at street corners whole 
blocks of the city are in ruins 
and theres real economic hardship after years of fighting so 
most people dont have much to spare for christmas 
but for now at least the fundamentalists of hezbollah or party 
of god and other christian and moslem militias have gone 
gone too is the green line the forbidding fortified 
demarcation line between moslem west beirut and the eastern 
christian sector it had run like a jagged scar through the city 
since civil war erupted in april 1975 
the militias have pulled out of the capital under an effort by 
president elias hrawi to end the conflict in which an estimated 
150000 people were killed the lebanese army has moved back in to 
restore longabsent law and order 
there is widespread optimism that hrawi backed by the syrians 
will be able to succeed in bringing peace despite the repeated 
failures of similar efforts in the past 
most beirutis are praying that the violence is behind them and 
that christmas will help bring the lebanese together again 
for ghassan abdallah a liberal shiite moslem businessmen this 
years celebration is special he has reserved a table at a 
restauarant overlooking the mediterranean in the moslem sector for 
a party with my christian friends 
they stopped coming to west beirut when hezbollah got rough in 
1985 he said in an interview but this year were going to 
have a reunion 
i hope the militias will be disbanded altogether so that we 
can get rid of them once and for all abdallah said 
were not scared of the militias any more said bassam 
itani the sunni moslem owner of a toy shop in west beiruts zarif 
district 
greater beiruts now under army control and were really 
relaxed the fundamentalists cant threaten us any more 
mrs makkouk whose store in the moslem zaydaniyeh district 
said last year she hadnt dared to have a santa in her shop 
she said business was good now but pointed to the constant 
dwindlind of the lebanese pound once the middle easts most stable 
currency 
the pound was pegged at 250 when the war broke out in 1975 on 
friday it was 890 pounds to the dollar on beiruts money market 
store owners said that a small plastic christmas tree costs the 
equivalent of 25 a set of decorations another 15 and a humble 
gift at least 10 
that adds up to the minimum monthly salary decreed by the 
government mrs makkouk said not many people can afford 
that 
the currency slide has sent prices sky high in lebanon which 
imports more than 85 percent of its goods 
this morning a little boy came to me with 800 pounds which 
was the equivalent of 1 yesterday mrs makkouk said he 
wanted to buy a toy car the price last week was 800 pounds because 
the dollar was worth that but now its changed i couldnt sell 
the toy

prime ministerdesignate omar karami is 
having difficulty forming a national reconciliation government 
charged with ending 15 years of civil war 
the phalange party the biggest rightwing christian political 
force in lebanon has joined the nations main christian militia in 
refusing to participate in karamis projected cabinet 
the move dampened karamis chances of quickly forming a 
broadbased new government to replace that of prime minister salim 
hoss who resigned with his 14man cabinet on thursday 
both the phalangists as well as christian warlord samir geageas 
lebanese forces militia claim karami plans to bring in more 
prosyrian christians than rightwingers 
those potential members of the cabinet do not represent the 
christian community their wide presence in the cabinet creates an 
imbalance in favor of the moslems said a phalangist statement 
published sunday 
such a government will murder reconciliation rather than bring 
it about the statement said 
it was alluding to elie hobeika geageas main syrianbacked 
maronite catholic rival and assad hardan a senior official of the 
syrian social nationalist party 
the party is a secular lebanese leftist faction that advocates 
the merger of lebanon syria iraq jordan preisrael palestine 
kuwait and cyprus in a greater syria 
syria the main power broker in lebanon has 40000 troops in 
lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
geageas lebanese forces has charged that a cabinet made up of 
30 politicians and warlords as president elias hrawi and karami 
envisage would be a tower of babel 
the militia also contended that karami lacked the statesmanship 
and national prestige that the useducated hoss enjoyed as a 
veteran of lebanese politics for the past 14 years 
karami 55 a sunni moslem surfaced on the political stage only 
three years ago when he inherited the leadership of the northern 
provincial capital of tripoli from his elder brother the late 
prime minister rashid karami 
the elder karami the longest serving prime minister in 
lebanons 47 years of independence was assassinated by a bomb 
explosion aboard an army helicopter in north lebanon june 1 1987 
one of lebanons three strongest militias the iranianbacked 
shiite moslem fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god has also 
refused to join karamis government 
the new government is certain to lack the vision and the 
minimum degree of harmony required to resolve the nations woes 
a hezbollah statement said 
another major militia druse warlord walid jumblatts 
progressive socialist party has earlier expressed reservations 
about the government change 
that party predicted karamis cabinet would be an untidy 
government that would stumble upon its first steps this could 
create a dangerous power vacuum 
the new government when formed faces the task of disbanding 
the various warring militias and enforcing an arab leaguebrokered 
peace plan that parliament ratified aug 22 
it also is expected to map out a plan for reconstructing 
warravaged beirut and shoring up the economy 
the new government must also fill 31 vacancies in the 
onechamber parliament by appointment and raise the number of its 
seats from 99 to 108 to attain equality between moslems and 
christians as envisaged by the peace plan 
christians have had a 6to5 edge in parliament since 
independence from france in 1943 
the present parliament was elected in 1972 for a fouryear term 
the civil war which broke out in 1975 has prevented elections and 
the house has repeatedly renewed its mandate 
government troops reunited civil wardivided beirut dec 3 by 
deploying in the capital and its environs as a first step in 
putting the peace accord into effect 
the peaceful deployment followed withdrawal of the various 
militias from the capital to their respective areas of influence in 
north east and south lebanon

a homeless mission turned down a 600 gift from a 
topless club saying that accepting the donation would do more harm 
than good 
we want people to be involved in giving but i think the 
message you send has to be a clear message said william 
thompson the union gospel missions executive director 
its kind of hypocritical for us to be teaching and preaching 
to our guys about moral responsibility and a the same time taking 
the benefits of peoples moral irresponsibility 
workers at the dallas gentlemans club said they had just wanted 
to do something nice 
i just think that the spirit of giving ought to be offered to 
everybody club owner randy dumas said i guess we were just a 
little hurt that they looked down their noses at us 
in a letter to the club thompson wrote we sincerely 
appreciate your concern for the homeless in dallas however the 
union gospel mission ministers not only to the physical needs but 
to the spiritual needs as well

inaugural speech last may he would declare an end to the state of

expected to help efforts to reunify china and taiwan 
they have been separated since the nationalists retreated to 
this island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists 
chiu said the nationalists have no timetable to reunify china 
but ending the state of war will reinforce the governments 
determination to achieve a peaceful reunification 
he urged the beijing government to respond favorably by 
renouncing its threat to use force to reunify china and taiwan 
should other attempts fail 
the chinese communists will never win the approval of the 20 
million people here for reunification if they insist on using 
force to resolve the problem across the taiwan strait he said 
both nationalists and communists regard taiwan as a chinese 
province the nationalists continue to regard themselves as chinas 
legitimate government

cellular phone service should be available 
nationwide by mid1992 now that federal authorities have issued at 
least one construction permit for systems in all urban and rural 
areas an industry trade group said sunday 
the federal communications commission on friday issued 20 new 
permits including tunica county miss and kosciusko county 
ind the only two areas of the country in which cellular systems 
had not been authorized the cellular telecommunications industry 
association said 
we couldnt ask for a much better christmas present ctia 
president robert w maher said one of our industrys most 
important goals is to provide ubiquitous service across america so 
that if youre traveling you can use your phone anywhere building 
these markets makes that dream a reality 
cellular also will be a boon to those living in rural areas 
maher added 
the fcc has designated 306 metropolitan or msa markets and 428 
rural or rsa markets and said that two cellular operators may be 
licensed in each market 
all of the nations msa markets which cover about 75 percent of 
the population has cellular service the ctia said the 428 rsa 
markets cover only about 25 percent of the population but span 
about 80 percent of the nations land mass of the 428 rsas about 
150 have cellular service the ctia said 
the fcc through a lottery awarded the last cellular licenses 
in december 1989 it now is in the process of awarding construction 
permits for the lottery winners who then have 18 months to 
activate their systems fridays permit awards assured that by 
mid1992 all areas of the nation should have at least one 
operating cellular system 
the cellular industry also plans to introduce within 12 months 
to 18 months an automatic call delivery service that will allow 
cellular users to receive calls automatically no matter where they 
are 
currently callers seeking someone who has traveled away from 
his or her local calling area must know where that person is in 
order to complete a call with automatic call delivery a person 
roaming outside the home market will send out a locating signal 
to the closest cellular system whenever he or she turns on the 
cellular phone computers then will do the searching and service 
authorizations 
if youre up in chicago and im back in washington and all 
ive got is your local washington number im going to be able to 
dial that washington number and that phone call i going to 
find you anywhere in the united states ctia spokesman norman 
black said 
but before seamless roaming can be introduced in all areas 
the regional bell companies will need to receive a waiver from a 
1984 consent decree that limits what longdistance and computer 
services the bell companies may provide 
in september us district judge harold greene greene issued a 
limited waiver allowing bell companies in some markets to introduce 
intersystem handoff so that callers traveling between some 
cities will not have to hang up and dial again as they pass from 
one cellular system to another

when ivor jones went into the coal mine in 
1926 there were four pits operating in maerdy and 52 others in 
the surrounding rhondda valleys 
at 78 he saw the last one close this week and 280 men lose 
their jobs twenty others accepted mining jobs elsewhere 
its a sad bloody moment this pit closing jones said as 
the last shifts were being worked at the maerdy colliery 
i went to the soup kitchens when i was 9 years of age i saw 
hard times and depressions im afraid now that its going to start 
all over again he said 
work stopped on thursday on friday maerdys miners and their 
families marched to the pit behind a brass band their lodge banner 
fluttering damply in the drizzle to dedicate a plaque to their 
mine and a nearly vanished way of life 
it was a quiet defeat for a town once known as little 
moscow where miners flew the red flag at the pit head in the 
1920s 
the stark reality is that 300 men mostly with families with 
an average age of 34 are losing their jobs at christmas time 
said the rev norman hadfield a former miner who conducted a 
memorial service 
miners received severance pay based on their length of service 
in some cases exceeding 60000 
the local district council and the governmentsponsored welsh 
development authority are already working on new industries for 
maerdy but the results may be years away 
the wda says it has created more than 700 jobs close to maerdy 
and a new business park has opened in ferndale two miles 
downstream that hasnt lifted the gloom felt by some miners 
there are no prospects for me in another job at the moment 
said mike lhomme who was losing his job after 10 years 
very few men have found new jobs to go to and families face a 
bleak time here because there isnt any work in the rhondda said 
eric price a miner since 1963 
unemployment in wales is 67 percent compared to 60 percent in 
britain as a whole but its two points higher in the midglamorgan 
region including the rhondda valleys 
south wales has seen worse in the general strike of 1926 the 
trade union congress gave up after nine days the miners stayed out 
from may until december at last nearly starved back to work in 
the 1930s unemployment exceeded 70 percent in some valleys 
when i was working up there there wasnt even a road to the 
mine said jones who started mining in 1926 youd walk up the 
railroad track in all kinds of weather hail snow whatever 
then you went down in the pit soaking wet and there was no 
protective clothing 
and then if there was an accident the men had to carry them 
down on a stretcher 
jones son alun also a retired miner sipped pints of bitter in 
the miners institute as his father talked 
that pit closing is ripping the guts out of me the son 
said 
in 1913 south wales produced a third of the worlds coal 
exports and had 485 working mines 
the valleys also produced leaders arthur horner a founder of 
the national union of mineworkers was a maerdy man aneurin bevan 
a labor cabinet minister in the 1940s and the labor partys 
current leader neil kinnock both came from nearby tredegar 
mining employment peaked at 272000 in 1920 and in 1923 the 
mines produced 5225 million tons by the mid1930s production and 
employment fell by more than half 
as late as 1958 there were a dozen working mines in the rhondda 
since 1969 there was only maerdy 
maerdy is a grim little town at the head of the narrow valley of 
rhondda fach or little rhondda at this time of year the sun slips 
below the ridge separating it from rhondda fawr before 3 pm 
whatever wealth was made in maerdy little of it stayed the 
only big building is the miners institute built in 1905 
the basic home is a twostory stone row house two windows wide 
standing row on row up the western side of the valley 
backed against greening mountains of rubble the town evokes 
the angry summer a poem about the general strike by idris 
davies born three valleys east in rhymney 
great are the shadows over the rhondda 
and the mansions built in the shires 
great are the fortunes made in gwalia 
and the promontories of slag

withdrawal but has said it will not cede any territory

any concessions qatar foreign minister mubarak alkhater said

statistics that show japans population growth 
declining to a postwar low are likely to sharpen fears that lagging 
birth rates are weakening the nations economy 
preliminary figures released friday from japans 1990 census 
show the nation grew by only 21 percent from 1985 to 1990 the 34 
percent growth from 198085 was the previous postwar low 
the oct 1 census counted 123622541 people in japan the 
country is still the worlds seventh most populous but it has one 
of the worlds slowest growth rates 
over the past year the country has been flooded with magazine 
newspaper and television reports that speak of a baby shock 
officials express fear that with fewer children the nation will 
eventually have trouble supporting the elderly a growing 
percentage of the population 
business leaders say industry is already beginning to feel a 
labor shortage 
birth rates in japan have been declining since the introduction 
of modern birth control after world war ii according to dr makoto 
atoh director of the health and welfare ministrys department of 
population policy studies 
a housing shortage high land prices rising ages at marriage 
and the soaring costs of education and childrearing have 
contributed to the declining rate he said 
we think the major cause for the decline is the rising 
percentage of singles and the rising age of marriage atoh said 
health and welfare ministry figures show that 20 percent of 
people in their late 20s were single in 1975 but 37 percent in 
that age group were single last year 
most women believe the high cost of educating children is the 
biggest obstacle to having more said dr naohiro ogawa deputy 
director of the nippon university population research institute 
and the consultant for a recent survey by mainichi newspaper 
another factor is cramped housing conditions and the 
astronomical prices of new homes mechanization in the home 
expanded education and job opportunities have led an increasing 
number of women out of the home 
some say the refusal of men to change their roles in the home 
discourages large families 
japanese men dont share housekeeping all the burden is on 
the shoulder of women at home so its impossible to have more 
children said mariko mitsui a tokyo city assemblywoman 
a government policy group has considered revamping maternity 
leaves changing housing policies and improving child care as 
measures to get women to have more children 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto a governing liberal 
democratic party leader and a likely future prime minister caused 
an uproar in june when he was quoted as blaming the shrinking birth 
rates on the expanded opportunities for higher education for women 
hashimoto later denied making the remark 
four out of five women questioned in the mainichi survey said 
they opposed government intervention to boost the birth rate ogawa 
said

sajudisbacked lawmakers on saturday there are signs that rule of 
this kind has already been introduced surreptitiously

of independence movements in the three baltic republics of 
lithuania latvia and estonia have contended in recent weeks that 
the kremlin is preparing to crack down on them 
tass quoted landsbergis also the sajudis leader as urging the 
lawmakers to develop a detailed program for resistance if the 
soviet union introduces an overtly occupationist form of rule in 
lithuania 
he said attempts were being made to impose a new union treaty on 
lithuania through threats of bloodshed and use of violence and 
that it was essential to prepare means of resistance 
selfdefense

pressure from hardliners to introduce a state of emergency and 
rule by decree in areas troubled by ethnic or political conflict 
last week he told the congress of peoples deputies the 
national parliament that he would not hesitate to do so in regions 
where conflicts threaten security or peoples lives 
at the same time gorbachev is seeking approval for the new 
union treaty regrouping the 15 soviet republics in a loose 
federation with the central government 
landsbergis reiterated lithuanias refusal to sign the document 
lithuania has already made its choice and will remain true to 
it tass quoted him as saying 
lithuania declared independence on march 11 since then the 
other 14 republics have also declared some form of independence or 
autonomy from the central government

a referendum on a new consitution that 
would end military rule in this west african nation appeared headed 
for approval in a vote sunday 
however critics say the document will allow the military to 
keep too much power 
several other african countries are also carrying out major 
political reform in the wake of the prodemocratic revolutions last 
year in eastern europe 
electoral officials said initial results indicated the 
referendum was winning approval many areas reported up to 98 
percent voting in favor of the document final results were 
expected monday 
the document provides for the military to hand over power to two 
political parties but only after a fiveyear transition during 
which a militarypicked council would rule 
opponents have criticized the lengthy transition period the 
makeup of the council and constitutional provisions allowing only 
two political parties 
the government says the twoparty provision would prevent 
parties from forming along tribal lines it said the long 
transition period is needed for an orderly transfer of power 
guinea has been hit this year by strikes by government workers 
demanding bigger salaries university graduates unable to find work 
and students wanting larger government grants 
last month police fired on protesting students killing two and 
wounding three 
guineans suffered years of brutal repression under sekou toure 
he ruled from 1958 when guinea became independent from france 
until his death of a heart attack in 1984 the military then staged 
a coup and brig gen lansana conte took over as president 
contes government is accused of corruption and oppression 
including detentions without trial and torture of political 
detainees according to the londonbased human rights group amnesty 
international 
guineas population was estimated at 63 million in 1987 but 
that does not include at least 2 million guineans who fled during 
sekou toures rule and remain in exile 
guinea is rich in minerals but among the poorest countries in 
the world

sunday night plunging half the capital into darkness for 15 
minutes in a blackout drill testing the citys ability to cope with 
air raids

to all of baghdad east of the tigris river the only light was the

rivers west bank 
it was the first practice blackout but senior officials said 
saturday plans were being made for such drills in all the major 
population centers 
lt col wail abid hamudi operations director at the civil

given by news media for carrying out the blackout 
residents were told to turn off outdoor lights and use thick 
curtains inside to prevent light from being spotted by enemy 
planes 
motorists were advised to turn off headlights and park when they 
hear sirens 
street lights would be switched off and store owners were told 
to disconnect their neon signs 
he had said the drill would last for only one minute however 
instead of relying on people to switch off lights the power was 
simply cut to eastern baghdad on sunday night for 15 minutes after 
the siren sounded 
iraq has stepped up civil defense preparations since the un 
security council set a jan 15 deadline for iraqi to withdraw from 
kuwait or face military action

hundreds of people rallied sunday to denounce 
moves they fear could bring dictatorship to the kremlin 
their protest came at the start of a critical week in which 
president mikhail s gorbachev seeks parliamentary approval for 
stronger presidential powers 
signs carried by some in the crowd of 1500 people supported 
eduard shevardnadze who resigned thursday as foreign minister to 
protest the growing influence of hardliners and what he said was a 
coming dictatorship 
shevardnadze is with us gorbachev is against us 
shevardnadze stay with us pleaded one sign held aloft on a 
broken hockey stick 
alexander obolensky a radical member of the congress of 
peoples deputies said reformers such as shevardnadze and 
alexander n yakovlev have been forced into the background by 
hardline communists yakovlev retired in august from his post in 
the communist party leadership 
shevardnadze trying to protect the intrigues of our 
president sacrificed desperately his political career obolensky 
said at the rally 
we want to ask you directly mikhail sergeyevich obolensky 
said addressing gorbachev you have pushed aside democrats you 
surrendered your faithful supporter yakovlev you lost 
shevardnadze who are you going to be with 
you are losing your allies he said remember the fate of 
khrushchev the reformer dont expect us to bow our heads 
obediently like in 1964 
khrushchev was ousted that year and replaced by leonid i 
brezhnev who reversed many reforms 
as the congress begins the second week of its parliamentary 
session monday it is expected to begin preliminary voting on the 
constitutional amendments to strengthen gorbachevs presidency 
gorbachev wants direct control over a reorganized executive 
branch of government to deal with a worsening economy and a 
fragmenting union 
he also is expected to make changes in the leadership before the 
week is out including naming a vice president 
on saturday the deputies heard kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov 
deliver a speech that brought back some of the chill of the cold 
war 
kryuchkov said the cia is gathering information on workers 
movements in the soviet union for its purposeful masterminding 
and funding of antisoviet formations such as radio stations 
that attack the soviet union 
he also lashed out at proindependence groups in the 15 soviet 
republics saying they have armed 26000 fighters he said 
foreigners were trying to topple the soviet government 
today if we undertake decisive actions to restore order we 
have to accept the fact that there could be bloodshed kryuchkov 
said 
maria denisenko a radical member of the russian legislature 
attacked kryuchkovs speech as tragic at a time when the united 
states and other western nations were sending aid to the soviet 
union 
the kgb chief clearly showed us that he is going to defend 
socialist gains and he wont stop at anything including 
bloodshed she said if the moment comes the whole nation 
should rise up to defend democracy 
the crowd in the small square opposite moscow city hall cheered 
congress deputy and crusading magazine editor vitaly korotich 
who did not address the rally said in an interview that 
kryuchkovs speech had little relevance 
i think that the kgb of course always needs an enemy i 
think if the kgb collapsed the cia would die of starvation and 
vice versa korotich said 
but kryuchkov was not the only soviet official talking tough on 
saturday gorbachev issued a decree declaring that separatist 
actions by turkish christians and russians in the southwestern 
republic of moldavia were illegal 
in a presidential decree he gave moldavia 10 days to dissolve a 
new national guard and to reconsider a law that made moldavian 
which is similar to romanian the republics official language 
on sunday in kishinev the capital of moldavia a rally of 
reconciliation organized by the communist party ended in a 
brawl after some people shouted at participants invaders go 
home and tried to seize the microphones the tass news agency 
reported 
soviet television showed shoving matches in the crowd and tass 
said police intervened to restore order afterward opponents of 
the rally marched to the local party headquarters and shouted 
anticommunist slogans tass said 
moldavia which borders romania has been hit by ethnic tension 
during its push for independence from the soviet union 
the gagauz a group of about 150000 turkish christians 
declared a new republic in southern moldavia in eastern moldavia 
more than 300000 ethnic russians and ukrainians have declared a

the youthful bolshoi ballet grigorovich company 
is performing a most charming version of the nutcracker 
the moscow import adds another variation to this seasons new 
york city ballet and joffrey ballet performances and american 
ballet theaters rendition of the nutcracker on television 
christmas day 
yuri grigorovich artistic director of the bolshoi ballet 
announced his new company in october after performances in moscow 
the company has been touring america since nov 23 its version of 
the nutcracker runs through dec 30 at the brooklyn academy of 
music 
the saturday night cast was the same as at wednesdays opening 
except for drosselmeyer the magician oleg dedogriuk was a spry 
brisk dancer in white wig in this version not a creaky oldster 
this company doesnt have any aging members the 60 dancers being 
19 to 25 
it also doesnt have any children small dancers dance the 
children and when drosselmeyer walks in with a nutcracker doll 
its really tamara glasova under his arm wearing red and a mask 
with a wide mouth 
marie called clara in the original in 1892 is oksana 
konobeyeva who has a sweet face and fine form she cant hold 
balance unsupported so she moved quickly off poses that end on one 
toe or held the pose graciously when supported by dmitry tuboltsev 
as the nutcracker prince 
tuboltsev small and slim has the poise of a dancer noble he 
jumped high and landed lightly and securely he is clearly a dancer 
to watch many members of this company are expected to enter the 
bolshoi ballet 
the mouse king maxim knish also was a fine dancer grigorovich 
choreographed the micetoy soldiers fight less like a fight than a 
dance when the mouse king was wounded and carried out he twitched 
his claws delightfully raising childish laughs all over the 
auditorium 
theres no toy nutcracker and no sugar plum fairy here marie 
does all the leading ballerina dancing there are five ethnic 
couples who have duets a form beloved of choreographers making 
fulllength ballets to tchaikovsky music here theyre spanish 
indian chinese russian and a shepherd and shepherdess from france 
who dance pulling a gray sheep on wheels between them 
they all were very good and the scenery the christmas tree 
becoming larger and white was surprisingly elaborate for a touring 
company

surinames former military ruler 
lt col desi bouterse announced his resignation sunday as army 
commander the dutch government warned of a possible military coup 
in its former colony 
in a dutch tv interview by telephone from paramaribo capital of 
suriname bouterse said his resignation was an act of defiance 
toward president ramsewak shankar 
im no longer willing to take orders from this kind of a joker 
who exposes the dignity of his nation to ridicule bouterse said 
shankar was chosen president of the small mineralrich nation 
on south americas northeastern coast in free elections in november 
1987 his installation in january 1988 ended eight years of 
dictatorship by bouterse 
in the hague a foreign ministry spokeswoman said the dutch 
government hopes bouterse realizes that a coup will have a 
detrimental effect on development aid 
suriname a nation of 400000 people has been heavily dependent 
on dutch aid it gained independence from the netherlands in 1975 
and was governed as a westernstyle democracy until bouterse seized 
power in a february 1980 coup 
bouterse did not say when his resignation would take effect or 
who would replace him 
according to dutch television the surinamese army was placed on 
alert heightening speculation about a possible bouterse coup 
attempt 
however the television also quoted a surinamese army statement 
as saying it would continue reconcilatory overtures made by 
bouterse toward the shankar government 
the dutch have been at odds in the past with bouterse whose 
troops shot to death 15 prominent opposition figures in 1983 the 
deaths prompted suspension of a 11 billion dutch aid package to 
suriname

was definitely not rescued mobley said he is not on the ship 
he is not ashore

israeli officials said sunday that emergency 
efforts are needed to accommodate an influx of soviet jews who the 
immigration minister said are raining from the sky in record 
numbers 
in southern beersheba immigrants set up a tent camp to protest 
lack of housing other israelis there staged a demonstration to 
urge that mobile homes for immigrants not be put near their 
prosperous neighborhood 
about 5500 soviet jews reached israel in a special airlift from 
thursday through saturday with an additional 1500 arriving 
sunday 
state television broadcast footage of the unprecedented flood of 
immigrants being processed at ben gurion international airport 
outside tel aviv 
ive never seen anything like this here said shifra oren a 
longtime volunteer at the terminal 
immigration minister yitzhak peretz said the influx of newcomers 
had forced authorities to resort to emergency housing solutions for 
the first time since the immigration wave began in mid1989 he 
said about a third of this weekends arrivals were housed in 
hotels 
officials attributed the upsurge to fears of political 
instability and the economic crisis in the soviet union and to 
improved transit through eastern european countries 
the trick is to get the jews out as soon as quickly as 
possible seymour reich outgoing chairman of the conference of 
presidents of major american jewish organizations said after 
stepping off a plane 
reich said the urgency was partly out of concerns triggered by 
thursdays resignation of soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze the resignation has aggravated fears of growing 
unrest in the soviet union 
jewish groups planned to ask the bush administration to use 
every means possible at their command to bring the jews out 
reich added 
the sense of urgency was pointed up by a government waiver of 
the usual ban on friday evening and saturday flights the jewish 
sabbath israels national carrier el al was ordered to use every 
plane available to ferry the jews from eastern europe 
simcha dinitz chairman of the quasigovernmental jewish agency 
that handles immigrant transportation said the rate was expected 
to increase to a regular influx of 1500 soviets daily 
officials expect more than 30000 soviets in december bringing 
this years immigration total to 200000 that includes all jewish 
immigrants israel expects about 1 million soviets by the end of 
1992 
uri gordon chief of the jewish agencys immigration department 
urged the government to declare a state of emergency 
we witness a real drama of a people in migration but we 
should remember we will be tested by absorption we have to declare 
a state of emergency in the country and create a new set of 
priorities gordon said 
we should immediately freeze housing prices and each one in 
the israeli society personally has to help the government 
alone wont solve the problem 
in the negev desert town of beersheba where thousands of 
soviets have settled eight new immigrant families raised a tent 
camp in the southern town of beersheba to dramatize the housing 
crunch 
the allowance they receive is not enough to rent an 
apartment protest spokesman ilya schneider said he said a 
twobedroom apartment in the least expensive beersheba neighborhood 
costs 400 a month 
an immigrant family of three receives 9000 a year in 
government allowance to cover rent food clothing education and 
transportation expenses 
there are cases of four five families renting one apartment 
and this leads to problems arguments and even fist fights 
schneider said 
beersheba city officials said protesters refused to sign rent 
contracts fearing they will run out of money and have no place to 
live 
israelis in beershebas welltodo neve noy area demonstrated to 
protest government plans to set up 7000 mobile homes for 
immigrants near their neighborhood 
the housing crisis has been made worse by slow building starts 
work has begun on only about 17000 of 45000 housing units planned 
to be started in 1990 officials report

the leadership of the irish 
republican army on sunday announced a threeday christmas 
ceasefire the first in 15 years 
britains cabinet minister for northern ireland peter brooke 
welcomed the ceasefire he said he hoped it pointed to a lasting 
peace in 1991 
the decision to suspend ira military activity from midnight 
sunday to midnight wednesday was announced in a statement issued in 
dublin and released in belfast 
we have instructed all active service units to suspend all 
offensive military action in the britishoccupied area for a period 
of three days from midnight said the statement which was signed 
p oneill the pseudonym for the ira army council 
our active service units reserve the right to take defensive 
actions it added 
in his comments brooke said a ceasefire in northern 
ireland albeit brief is a welcome epitaph to 1990 and maybe a 
pointer to achieving a lasting solution in 1991 
there could be no better news on the eve of the new year 
than that the message that terrorism cannot be allowed to succeed 
may have taken root and that recognition has dawned that there is 
no future for terrorism he said 
in northern ireland lawmaker peter robinson deputy leader of 
the democratic unionist party said the ira calling ceasefires 
has nothing whatsoever to do with the community interest but is to 
give themselves the opportunity to reorganize and restock it 
should be viewed in that light 
irish prime minister charles haughey said he earnestly hoped 
the move could be extended indefinitely a development he said 
would open up great possibilities for progress 
the last suspension of the iras 20yearold battle to drive the 
british out of northern ireland was in december 1974 and lasted 
eight months 
since the largely roman catholic ira began its guerrilla fight 
2849 people have been killed in violence 
the struggle pits catholic nationalists against protestant 
loyalists determined to retain the predominantly protestant 
provinces link to britain the ira wants to unite the province 
with the overwhelmingly catholic irish republic 
the leadership of the ira extends greetings to all those who 
suffered as a result of the britishoccupied six irish counties 
the ira statement said we are particularly mindful of all the 
families who have been bereaved in the last 20 years and of the 
political prisoners and their families 
gerry adams president of the the iras legal political wing 
sinn fein said of the ceasefire i welcome the news and hope 
that the british forces will respond in kind so that irish people 
can have a peaceful christmas

interior minister aryeh deri said he sued a 
leading israeli daily for libel on sunday for suggesting he may 
have exploited his position to purchase four apartments 
the article which was published by the yedioth ahronoth daily 
six months ago preceded the opening of a police investigation of 
deri and his aides on suspicion of fraud and mishandling public 
funds 
deris ultraorthodox torah guardians faction is a key member of 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs governing coalition which relies 
heavily on smaller religious parties for majority support in the 
120member parliament 
in the suit filed in tel aviv district court deri 31 asked 
for 500000 in damage state radio and television said 
the moment yedioth hinted and quite heavily that i exploited 
my status or state resources to achieve the many assets i acquired 
this i will not pass over lightly deri said on tv 
on radio deri said this is the first libel suit others are 
on the way i will fight until the end to put things in place 
and expose my truth yedioth ahronoth editor moshe vardi 
responded in a statement read to reporters if anyone thinks that 
this is the way to quiet the press he will learn it is a mistake 
and on the matter of the facts this the court will decide 
the newspaper is one of israels most widely read dailies it 
has not yet filed a defense statement with the court the national 
itim news agency reported no trial date was immediately set 
according to the radio and itim the article in question was 
published by yedioth on june 15 
it reportedly suggested that deri and his wife owned four luxury 
apartments and said the ministers salary is insufficient to 
fund the purchase of this property 
deri has denied ownership of at least two of the apartments the 
reports added 
another article published by yedioth in june accused deri of 
unlawfully funneling hundreds of thousands of shekels to public 
councils and religious institutions that supported his party a 
shekel is worth about 50 cents 
police later opened an investigation into these suspicions and 
some in deris party later threatened to bolt shamirs coalition 
unless the inquiry was dropped 
deri said sunday he learned that the investigation was 
reaching its conclusion he did not elaborate

that covers legal matters 
officials began looking for the anglin brothers in the northwest 
florida area about two years ago and recently confirmed the search 
was continuing 
at least 41 known escape attempts were made at the prison from 
1934 until it closed in 1963 but none of the wouldbe escapees 
with the possible exception of the anglins and morris succeeded 
the prison which housed notorious criminals such as al capone 
george machine gun kelly and birdman robert stroud is now 
part of the golden gate national recreation area and a popular 
tourist attraction 
in san francisco chief deputy us marshal richard bippus would 
only confirm that interest in the case was high 
its like a roller coaster bippus said it goes uphill 
and downhill were on an uphill right now our interest is more 
active lets say that interest was revived in 1989 when a segment 
about the june 
11 1962 escape was broadcast on the nbctv program unsolved 
mysteries 
a woman who identified herself only as cathy called the shows 
tip number and said she recognized clarence anglin as a man who 
lived on a farm near marianna fla mclendon said 
the brothers also were linked to the area by a woman who 
recognized a photo of clarence anglin and said he lived near 
marianna she correctly identified his eye color height and other 
physical features 
another witness identified a sketch of morris saying it bore a 
striking resemblance to a man she had seen in the area 
in 1986 clarence anglins grandson claimed his grandfather had 
died a free man in iowa more than a decade after the escape and 
that the other two men were eaten by sharks during the escape 
attempt 
the breakout from the institution which prided itself as being 
escapeproof embarrassed prison authorities 
the men first broke through barred air vents at the back of 
their cells giving them access to an interior utility corridor 
separating the two halves of the threetiered block of cells all 
three were housed on the ground floor 
in that area they spent months making things for their escape 
including life vests and at least one rubber raft apparently using 
pilfered raincoats 
the night of their escape they put dummies in their beds broke 
through the vents scaled pipes to the roof and dropped to the 
waters below authorities believe they then inflated a raft or 
rafts and launched them on chilly waters 
two life vests a wooden paddle and a packet with pictures and 
addresses belonging to the inmates later were found floating in the 
bay some believe the men drowned trying to make the twomile 
crossing 
but others including bippus believe the items were planted to 
throw officials off track 
it would be nice if the anglin brothers would turn themselves 
in and we could get rid of this and they could stop looking over 
their shoulders bippus said

advertisers looking for ways to get their 
message to moviegoers are turning away from onscreen pitches and 
hiring movie theaters to hand out free samples of candy popcorn 
and other goodies 
united artists the largest movie chain with 2500 screens 
handed out pb max candy bars this month to patrons entering its 
theaters in los angeles ua also was to give moviegoers in its 
dallas theaters free boxes of smart foods popcorn 
cineplex odeon the second largest chain with 1690 screens 
says its handing out packs of sugarfree dentyne chewing gum and 
samples of mens cologne at the end of the movie said howard 
lichtman executive vice president of marketing 
if someone doesnt like a product we dont want them leaving 
it on the floor he explained 
instead of paying for time on screen companies pay chains fees 
to hand out their products 
marketing experts believe this is one idea the audience wont 
reject 
people love free samples said susan smallweil a 
specialist in consumer behavior at new yorkbased ad agency 
warwick baker amp fiore in this case advertising isnt an 
uninvited guest its a welcome guest 
both ua and cineplex hope freebies will boost ad revenue lost 
earlier this year when walt disney co and warner bros studios 
banned onscreen advertising at theaters that show their movies 
the reduction of onscreen advertising is going to hurt us 
said cathy kasberg director of promotions and marketing at ua 
hopefully this can give us another avenue for income 
ua hopes to hand out different products such as soap pens and 
frozen yogurt every weekend other chains have similar plans
