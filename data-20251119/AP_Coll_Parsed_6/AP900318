the caribbean moon casts a silvery 
light that is kind to the shabby streets and crooked docks of this 
steamy port town on the miskito coast 
the doctors who set bluefields broken bones and deliver its 
babies gather on a porch catching the breeze catching their 
breath waiting for dinner 
they are the cuban medical brigade 15 idealistic envoys of a 
revolution becoming isolated and stale because of changes sweeping 
the rest of the communist world 
suddenly they dont know where they stand 
change has hit nicaragua ousting president daniel ortegas 
leftist sandinistas one of cubas only remaining allies violeta 
barrios de chamorros new government will be conservative and 
proamerican 
will it ask them to stay will cuban president fidel castro let 
them remain to taste postrevolutionary democracy 
the story of the doctors and their compatriots in a 300strong 
construction brigade here is a story of a community in need 
hardwon acceptance and the vagaries of politics 
it began a decade ago when bluefields was torn by anticuban 
riots today many bluefilenos dread the cubans departure 
it would strip nicaraguas isolated south atlantic coast of its 
only surgeons anesthesiologists obstetricians and orthopedist 
it would shatter the vision of a thousand sturdy new homes 
replacing shacks flattened by hurricane joan in 1988 
it would be chaos said dr donald weil the nicaraguan 
director of the sandino regional hospital where more than half the 
staff is cuban 
a few blocks away the cuban doctors gather around their 
communal dinner table talking about work about home about what 
lies ahead 
well be here as long as they want us says dr ernesto diaz 
trujillo a 40yearold intensive care specialist who is 11 months 
into his twoyear tour 
bluefields got a taste of life without the cubans when they 
stayed home in the tense days after the feb 25 election 
they didnt want to come out on the street because they didnt 
know what would be happening said johnny hodgson a local 
sandinista official 
things fell apart at the 118bed hospital which has only 12 
nicaraguan doctors some patients had to be sent to managua 190 
miles west and reachable only by plane or boat most just had to 
wait 
we couldnt handle it dr weil said 
after two days community leaders went to the cubans and 
persuaded them to return to work reassuring them they were not 
only safe but desperately needed 
the experience converted all but the most fervent 
anticommunists in bluefields weil said people changed colors 
like chameleons 
back at the cuban residence the table falls silent as the 
brigades orthopedic surgeon shouts into the telephone reassuring 
his mother back home in cuba 
no problems he yells jamming the receiver into one ear and 
his finger into the other so he can hear absolutely no 
problems 
their voices crossed only 800 miles but it might as well have 
been 800000 
nicaraguas atlantic coast an enclave of mestizos miskito 
indians the descendants of british pirates and of african slaves 
is a universe away from both havana and managua 
anticommunism runs deep a legacy of the regions ties to the 
yankees who mined its gold cut its lumber fished its waters and 
to the missionary fervor of the moravians and the capuchin priests 
who educated its children 
i remember when i was studying in secondary school we had to 
pray after every class hodgson recalled with a laugh and if 
you didnt mention cuba and communism in your prayers it was as if 
you were not praying 
acceptance was a long time in coming for the cubans who began 
arriving in nicaragua soon after the 1979 revolution 
the people of the coast resented the cuban teachers and their 
highly political curriculum 
in september 1980 anticuban riots erupted when the government 
announced plans to send in more teachers thousands of people 
mostly blacks took to the streets 
the government sent in the army to put down the riots arrested 
hundreds of people and accused bluefields of trying to launch a 
separatist movement 
the teachers were eventually withdrawn the doctors stayed 
nearly irreplaceable because of the shortage of physicians in 
nicaragua 
but it took the fury of a hurricane joan on oct 21 1988 to 
bridge the gulf between bluefields and castros envoys 
it was cuba that arrived first with aid and was most generous 
when bluefilenos gathered the boards of 5000 homes scattered like 
matchsticks by 135 mph winds there were cubans by their side 
the construction brigade has put up more than 100 of a planned 
1000 sturdy prefabricated homes the first residents began moving 
late last year into what is now the best neighborhood in town 
this is the first time with the construction of these houses 
that the people of bluefields really live with the cubans you 
know walk with them and pass the whole day with them hodgson 
said 
the construction brigade lives in a cubanbuilt complex that 
will become a university after they leave there are touches of 
home such as cuban cigars cigarettes and coffee 
all of them has a girlfriend or boyfriend they are 
courting said marvin taylor a local politician 
at the former british diplomatic mission where the doctors live 
dinner is over the doctors head back to the porch to the rocking 
chairs under the sign to the lazy moonlight 
trujillo lingers for a moment making a point about people and 
politics about isolation and coexistence 
if i drink red wine and you drink white he says holding a 
glass high there is no reason we cant toast

mikhail s gorbachev has once again shaken up the 
soviet political system this time to give himself even more power 
as the countrys first westernstyle president 
but as lithuania leads other small republics toward independence 
and russia itself contemplates electing a chief executive the 
question down the road for gorbachev is president of what 
the congress of peoples deputies the soviet parliament 
grumbled and complained more than usual but thursday acknowledged 
gorbachev as the political master from poland to the bering strait 
and iran to the arctic circle the area includes more than 100 
nationalities and almost 300 million people 
gorbachevs moves early this year leading to his election 
appeared to complete a revolution of the political structure that 
even he until recently did not expect 
in december he fought andrei d sakharov to prevent the 
parliament from eliminating the communist partys guarantee of 
power but two months later he led the fight to end it 
his close politburo adviser alexander n yakovlev told an 
official newspaper that gorbachev opposed a presidential form of 
government and only recently came to believe it was needed to hold 
his country together 
gorbachev told parliament he intends to be president of all the 
people including 37 million lithuanians whose leaders hastily 
declared independence before gorbachev could gain his new powers 
our country is living through difficult times but if we act 
energetically and as a team we certainly will be able to overcome 
the difficulties he said the russian people and all the 
peoples united with it in a great multinational state will succeed 
in reviving their common homeland and will surely achieve that on 
the road of perestroika and socialist renewal 
but his dealings with the wayward republics give little grounds 
for such optimism 
when it declared independence lithuania changed its soviet name 
and emblem and activists report that onethird of its 15000 
potential draftees refused to show up this year for service in the 
soviet army it announced plans to start setting up border 
checkpoints 
on friday gorbachev gave lithuania until monday to answer a 
parliament proclamation that the declaration of independence was 
invalid 
even as he assumed new powers that do not exclude direct 
presidential rule of an area he was faced with the lithuanian 
contagion spreading 
the soviet union will have its president and estonia will 
move toward independence said endel lippmaa a leading deputy 
from the lithuanias fellow baltic republic of 16 million people 
an unofficial estonian congress demanded that the kremlin name 
the time that it would pull its soldiers out estonian government 
officials said they agreed 
latvia the third baltic republic also is pushing for 
independence and the caucasus republic georgia has demanded 
negotiations about restoring independence moldavians are looking 
more closely across the border to their ethnic brothers in romania 
after the revolution there armenia and azerbaijan locked in a 
bloody territorial dispute share a mutual antipathy for gorbachev 
all those republics make up only about 10 percent of the 
countrys population they were collected by the czarist empire 
which broke up after the bolshevik revolution and then gradually 
gathered again by the soviet union the baltics were independent 
countries between the world wars and were the last to join the 
soviet union they were absorbed by josef stalin in 1940 
central asia home to about one in five soviets increasingly 
has been wracked by ethnic violence but so far there has been 
little talk of secession 
but the longslumbering slavic heartland of russia the ukraine 
and byelorussia is showing signs of waking up 
the three republics which contain more than twothirds of the 
countrys people held local elections march 4 runoffs were 
required in most districts but progressives appeared to do well 
perhaps presaging drives for autonomy similar to those gripping the 
smaller republics 
but the rukh movement has gained a foothold in the ukraine with 
its demands for more autonomy and there are appeals for outright 
independence for the secondmost populous republic 
in russia nationalists say that it is the russians themselves 
who have suffered the most from soviet rule unlike other 
republics russia does not have its own capital its own hymn or 
its own communist party structure nationalists are pressing people 
to think of themselves as russians rather than soviets 
the russian federation by far the largest republic already has 
decided to elect its own president one of the announced candidates 
for the job is gorbachevs populist nemesis boris n yeltsin 
yeltsin has nationwide popularity and nationwide ambition he 
said in italy earlier this month that he would like to be soviet 
president if there were a popular vote 
while gorbachev has paid a price in popularity for his 
leadership over the past five years yeltsin has sniped at him for 
not moving faster and his popularity has twice translated into 
impressive electoral victories 
in march 1989 he won almost 90 percent of the vote in sweeping a 
parliament seat from moscow two weeks ago he outpolled more than 
70 percent of the vote in his ural mountain hometown of sverdlovsk 
in a race for a seat in the russian federation congress it is that 
body that will choose the russian president 
if gorbachev cannot hang on to the nonslavic republics there 
will be less and less difference between the territory of the 
russian federation and the territory of the soviet union the two 
chief executives almost certainly would find their interests and 
powers in conflict 
even without the 14 other republics russia would be a huge 
country but not necessarily big enough for two masters

the clock on st michaels episcopal 
church is still missing its gold hands mute testimony to the 135 
mph winds of hurricane hugo that passed this way six months ago 
but just as yellowgreen leaves have sprouted on trees stripped 
bare by leviathan winds south carolina is mending after the worst 
storm to batter its coast in centuries 
hugo smashed ashore at charleston on sept 21 killing 29 
people leaving thousands temporarily homeless and thousands more 
without electricity for weeks with damage estimated at 59 
billion it was most costly hurricane to ever hit the us mainland 
now spring has come around horsedrawn carriages drift through 
downtown azaleas bloom behind wroughtiron fences the historic 
district is cleared of debris and tourist attractions have long 
since reopened 
but in outlying areas on the sea islands northeast of town and 
in sumter 90 miles inland recovery has been slower even as 
volunteers from across the nation continue to donate time money 
and energy to help in the recovery 
leroy miller a mennonite volunteer from weatherford okla who 
arrived in charleston on jan 9 has helped replace roofs on 35 
homes through the countys raise the roof program there are still 
200 people on a waiting list 
people have a problem understanding why we would do this 
without pay miller said i dont know what to tell them its 
just another way of reaching out to humanity 
among those he helped was harriett yates who after the 
hurricane was forced to make do with a blue tarp to cover the roof 
of her tiny fiveroom house 
i appreciate it she said i couldnt have done it without 
them 
on nearby sullivans island which was home to 2500 people many 
buildings crushed in the 12foot tidal surge that accompanied the 
hurricane still await the bulldozers blade and piles of 
hurricanerelated debris await pickup 
julie britt lost her home but she moved into an apartment 
rather than leave the island 
i have never felt a love of place as much as i love this 
place she said the way we deal with it is a blessed amnesia 
in which you dont remember how it looked before 
on the isle of palms where damage was estimated at 100 
million only about half the 3500 residents have returned and 
some never will mayor carmen bunch said many older residents 
already were pinched by rising living costs 
rebuilding continues slowly in hardhit mcclellanville where 
the shrimping industry was decimated and farther north in the 
resort community of pawleys island which was cut in half by the 
hurricanes tidal surge 
and in many poorer areas jobs were lost when marginal 
businesses were forced to close because of storm damage and 
disruption marvin lare executive director of the south carolina 
institute on poverty and deprivation said the storm could push 
more than 180000 people in the state below the poverty level 
in charlotte nc 200 miles inland workers still are picking 
up tree limbs brush and other debris at the rate of 32 truckloads 
a day said linda sherrill a spokeswoman for the city electrical 
crews continue to erect utility poles in a city that was left 
virtually powerless after the storm 
the charleston council approved a temporary 14 percent property 
tax increase to cover storm expenses and make up for declining 
collections 
the federal emergency management agency distributed nearly 100 
million to help individuals cover uninsured losses but as in any 
relief operation there have been problems 
fema spokesman frank mosco said about 500000 was returned 
after the agency discovered people received money they were not 
entitled to as many as 130 people who failed to respond to fema 
letters asking for repayments could face criminal charges he said 
in carolina forests crews are using tractors helicopters and 
mule teams to clear thousands of splintered trees an estimated 1 
billion board feet of timber 44 million acres was toppled a 
blow to the 43 billionayear industry 
larry edmond of the us forest service said crews hope to 
salvage at least 25 percent of the downed timber an acre of forest 
normally has 3 tons to 20 tons of fuel in the form of fallen 
timber many spots of forest in the carolinas have 200 to 1000 
tons per acre of drying debris officials said 
south carolinas 5 billion tourism industry is gearing up amid 
optimism that business this summer will be as strong as ever 
myrtle beach escaped the brunt of the storm and hilton head island 
another popular resort was unscathed even with the storm tourism 
rose 4 percent last year the state tourism department says 
advertisements promoting the state make no mention of hugo or 
the aftermath but there are some who believe that such silence is 
unneeded that articles about the states recovery will be do 
nothing but help the economy 
weve had so much additional exposure on charleston in the 
positive sense said helen stansell of the charleston trident 
chamber of commerce south carolina is going strong and coming 
back

two sets of models waited to cross the stage 
for the spring fashion show in a new orleans mall the young 
beauties had been hired to sell clothes the 12 nervous children 
hoped to sell themselves 
the children were wards of the state who had volunteered for 
saturdays easter fashion show in hope that someone might see them 
and want to adopt them 
were going back in time said gloria mitchell who attended 
the fashion show at the lakeside mall this is like slavery 
were auctioning off these kids 
but officials from the state department of social services said 
fashion shows like the departments weekly television spots help 
find something thats in short supply families to adopt some of 
louisianas 5000 foster children 
except for 1988 when officials objected to having the children 
shown along with cats and dogs from the society for the prevention 
of cruelty to animals the department has used fashion shows as a 
chance to show some of these children in as good a light as 
possible 
i would love to not have to do this said kerry ermon whose 
job is finding adoptive families in the new orleans area i would 
love it if we had more families than children but thats not the 
reality 
only children who volunteer participate the younger ones say 
they do it for fun the older ones say they have to 
i want to get a family said mark 13 a veteran of the 
fashion shows and television spots 
since most people prefer to adopt infants a childs hopes of 
adoption grow slimmer with every year television and fashion show 
appearances become more urgent especially for black children for 
whom there are few potential families ermon said 
even the highvisibility events tend to attract more prospective 
white parents than black ermon said she said its a constant 
frustration for social workers that even white children who have 
severe emotional problems find homes more quickly than wellbehaved 
black children 
black families in new orleans adopt less often than white 
families ermon said and white families rarely adopt black 
children 
the recent fashion show brought that point squarely home at a 
show at another mall a week ago nine of the 12 children were 
black on saturday seven of the eight children were black 
yet after the shows almost all of the questions were about the 
white children 
linda burvant a court reporter said she and her husband have 
been considering adoption she said she didnt like to see the 
children made to feel uncomfortable but the fashion show was her 
first chance to see some of the children in state custody 
i would think in order to go up there they have to really want 
a home she said its sad

a battle over an experimental hog farm 
that pitted billionaire against billionaire will be decided by 
voters who will choose whether to require the farm to spend 10 
million on a waste treatment plant 
in effect weld county voters must judge tuesday whether the 
bass brothers of fort worth texas have set up an operation using 
unproven methods that could pollute the water supply or whether 
such criticism is a smokescreen orchestrated by a rival tycoon who 
has other reasons for wanting the farm closed 
its very debilitating to be attacked for the very thing you 
think is very special said bill haw president of national hog 
farms 
what haw thinks is special is the hog farm built by his company 
15 miles east of here along the south platte river financial 
backers include four men on the forbes magazine list of richest 
americans texas brothers robert sid lee and edward bass in its 
october issue the magazine estimated that robert was worth 144 
billion sid and lee 125 billion each and edward 1 billion 
but philip anschutz owner of the southern pacific 
transportation co and the subsidiary denver amp rio grande railroad 
doesnt think the hog farm is so special especially since his 
32000acre eagless nest ranch is downstream from it forbes put 
anschutzs worth at 125 billion also chiefly from oil 
the 25750acre farm which began operating last year plans to 
raise 300000 pigs a year in a sterile environment that avoids use 
of antibiotics or other commonly used drugs 
to get rid of the hog waste the farm treats it and uses it to 
fertilize grassland used by grazing cattle haw calls it the most 
environmentally sound livestock operation in the world 
haw said anschutz is just using the environmental issue as a 
ruse to try to acquire the land that national farms now owns haw 
said the farm thwarted anschutzs hopes of expanding his ranch 
where he raises cattle and shoots wild game 
i cant imagine what mr anschutz expects to accomplish other 
than vengeance haw said were certainly not going to leave 
initially anschutz and haw took the issue to court but now it 
is the voters who get to pass judgment the farms owners havent 
said what they will do if the ordinance requiring the treatment 
plant is approved 
both sides have hired denver public relations firms to press 
their arguments and anschutz founded and helped finance a 
citizens group called protect our water 
a vote for the proposed ordinance said gretchen cutts a 
spokeswoman for the group would send the right message to the 
right corporations and the right message to the wrong corporations 
that this is a community that cares about environmental concerns 
but it isnt just the anschutzfunded group that has raised 
environmental questions 
at a hearing last week joann silverstein a university of 
colorado civil engineering professor said the farms waste 
disposal process already may be increasing nitrate levels in ground 
water and in the south platte river and would undoubtedly do so 
further if the farm isnt forced to change its methods 
nitrates are dangerous to pregnant women and have been linked to 
blue baby syndrome a potentially fatal disease in newborns 
caused by lack of oxygen in the blood she said 
at the same hearing however weld county health director randy 
gordon called the fluctuations in nitrate levels normal and said 
there is no proof they are caused by the hog farm 
dan luecke of the environmental defense fund in boulder agrees 
that opponents have a legitimate concern about nitrates from hog 
waste seeping into water 
on a conceptual level you could say spraying the waste water 
on farmland makes sense but i have seen no data on the quality of 
the water going on the land he said 
while both sides expect to win each also concedes that weld 
countys 125000 residents are probably confused about which way to 
vote 
according to county clerk mary ann feuerstein protect our water 
spent 38500 in campaigning through march 4 national hog farms 
has reported spending 5600 up to that date but haw estimates his 
company will spend at least 70000 before the campaigning is 
finished 
nonetheless beverly cruz bartender at the scotch pub in 
greeley said she hasnt heard any of her customers talk about the 
hog farm or the waste 
usually if its something theyre concerned about they will be 
talking about it she said

republicans who warned last fall that l 
douglas wilder was a liberal hiding behind conservative rhetoric 
praised the nations first black elected governor for his cautious 
approach in his first legislative session 
wilder opened the general assembly session in january with a 
lecture on fiscal discipline demanding that the legislature come 
up with a 200 million reserve fund for 199192 he ended the 
session by orchestrating a power play to repeal the sales tax on 
nonprescription drugs a cause he has long championed 
but for most of the session wilder took a handsoff approach 
allowing the legislators to do their job his style contrasted 
sharply with that of his predecessor gerald l baliles who 
routinely had aides buttonholing legislators to lobby for his bills 
wilder said at a news conference on the last day of the session 
march 10 that he thought the lawmakers appreciated his approach 
we know how to communicate and weve been doing it a long 
time said wilder who served 16 years in the virginia senate and 
four years as lieutenant governor 
wilders style served him well he got his reserve fund and the 
nonprescription drug tax repeal only four of the 119 bills 
proposed by his administration failed to pass and legislators from 
both political parties went home happy 
governor wilder in his budget restraint showed more of a 
republican philosophy than we could have hoped for said house 
minority leader raymond r guest jr baliles spent everything he 
could wilder is trying to get us back on track 
early in the session wilder endeared himself to republican 
leaders by calling him into his office to brief them on his 
legislative agenda we had more time with the governor today than 
we did the previous four years guest said at the time 
larry sabato a political analyst at the university of virginia 
said the approach was vintage wilder hes inclined to win groups 
that would not otherwise be allied to him 
sabato said the session was a good one for wilder whose 
historic election last november is viewed by many as the first step 
to national office 
his agenda is in two parts sabato said theres the 
virginia part and theres the national part the bottom line is he 
did well for both he projected the image of being a fiscal 
conservative and a taxcutter virginians are pleased and its a 
message he can sell to the national democratic party 
with the exception of the money initiatives wilder did not have 
much of a legislative agenda sabato said that will surprise many 
national observers 
part of it is the race thing he said its the belief 
that black governor equals activist governor thats not 
necessarily so 
most of the 119 administrationproposed bills were not 
controversial just two were rejected outright companion bills 
that would require state employees to pay part of their insurance 
costs the other two one addressing rules governing notaries the 
other on unemployment compensation procedures were tabled or 
withdrawn 
mark rozell a political analyst at mary washington college in 
fredericksburg va was more critical than sabato 
i dont think hes really had a coherent program per se that 
he has articulated rozell said part of that is derived from 
the budgetary crisis which understandably places serious 
constraints on his ability to be a more activist governor 
nonetheless there have been some issues on which wilder could 
have taken a much more assertive leadership role to that extent 
his first session has not been very successful 
rozell criticized wilder for failing to take a clear position on 
such issues as public smoking restrictions and admission of women 
to allmale virginia military institute 
the legislature passed a bill imposing modest statewide 
restrictions on smoking once unthinkable in tobaccoproducing 
virginia wilder has said hes for reasonable smoking restrictions 
but hasnt said whether he will sign the bill another bill 
proposed by a legislator to prohibit sex discrimination in public 
college admissions policies was killed 
rozell said wilders latesession tax repeal victory 
demonstrates how effective a leader he can be should he decide to 
be more assertive wilder argued that the tax on nonprescription 
drugs while not a large cost to the average household was unfair 
in that it fell disproportionately on the elderly and poor 
sabato and most legislators liked the way wilder distanced 
himself from the legislature 
the governor doesnt have to get involved in every little 
squabble sabato said he picked and chose his fights very 
carefully 
governor wilders big goal was to get the budget in shape 
said delegate leslie l byrne a democrat he trusts the 
legislative process and he gave us a free hand to meet the goals 
he wasnt intrusive 
delegate george allen a republican said he appreciated 
wilders silence on many controversial issues 
the legislature was able to work its will allen said 
they werent having their arms twisted into doing things they 
didnt want to do

from its beginnings as a case of many 
issues the trial of exxon valdez captain joseph hazelwood has come 
down to just two key questions was hazelwood drunk and was he 
reckless to leave the bridge just before his tanker grounded 
beyond the specifics that jurors will consider when they receive 
the case this week is the implicit question of whether the nations 
largest oil spill was an accident or a crime 
this was a maritime accident captain hazelwood was not 
responsible for that accident defense attorney dick madson told 
jurors in opening statements he is expected to make a similar 
point when final arguments are presented tuesday 
the ultimate responsibility for the tanker is with the 
captain said assistant district attorney brent cole in his 
opening statement the most dangerous part of the journey was 
after hazelwood absented himself from the bridge 
although many civil suits were filed after the grounding of the 
exxon valdez a year ago next saturday hazelwood was the only 
member of the ships crew charged criminally 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is accused of one felony 
criminal mischief and three misdemeanors reckless endangerment 
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of 
oil if convicted he could face 7 years in prison and 61000 in 
fines 
the tanker rammed a charted reef in prince william sound 
spewing nearly 11 million gallons of alaska north slope crude oil 
devastating fisheries and wildlife and fouling the rocky shoreline 
for hundreds of miles 
cole promised at the outset to prove hazelwood was drunk and 
away from his appropriate post on the bridge during the most 
treacherous part of the tankers voyage in prince william sound 
but his claim that the sound was treacherous was disputed by 
tanker captains who testified for the defense one called it a 
mill pond another said it was like navigating the pacific 
ocean it was so wide open even the prosecutions last 
witness a texaco tanker captain said the sound was not a 
particularly difficult area to navigate and was not crowded with 
the tanker traffic that often blocks other ports 
as testimony piled up over six weeks it became clear that 
headlinemaking reports of a drunken skipper were based on 
circumstantial evidence hazelwood was seen at a bar in the port 
city of valdez the day his ship sailed 
witnesses reported that he drank vodka but how much he drank 
and at what hour remained in dispute three witnesses said they 
smelled alcohol on the skippers breath that night 
but not a single witness described hazelwood as appearing drunk 
no one saw him stagger no one heard him slur his words crew 
members said he negotiated a precarious gangway without missing a 
step they called him cool calm and in command before and after 
the grounding 
the question of inebriation was muddled because authorities 
failed to do a timely blood test hazelwood wasnt tested until 10 
hours after the disaster making the results a dubious gauge of his 
condition at the crucial hour 
the prosecution called an expert witness to calculate 
backwards and figure from hazelwoods 061 blood alcohol reading 
at 1030 am what the level might have been the midnight before 
the expert said hazelwood would have been drunk with a reading of 
perhaps 14 
but defense experts said the calculation method was nonsense 
and involved too many variables including whether hazelwood had 
something to drink aboard ship after the grounding 
hazelwood who did not testify in his own defense never 
explained neither did he say why he left the bridge in control of 
a third mate and went below during the transit in icy conditions 
the third mate gregory cousins tesified that hazelwood 
discussed with him a navigational plan to leave the shipping lanes 
maneuver around ice floes and return to the shipping lanes 
he asked if i felt comfortable with what we were going to do 
and i said yes recalled cousins he said do you feel 
comfortable enough that i can go below and get rid of some 
paperwork i said i felt very comfortable 
cousins did not hold the special coast guard pilotage 
endorsement for prince william sound a technicality which has been 
magnified during the trial 
hazelwood was the only officer with the special license the 
defense suggested that the coast guard may have waived the pilotage 
requirement that too remained unsettled 
cousins competence became less of an issue than the abilities 
of the helmsman robert kagan who was blamed by many for the 
disaster 
cousins indicated that kagan who had past problems with 
steering failed to follow his command for a 10degree right turn 
which would have taken the ship out of harms way 
did hazelwood know of kagans deficiencies did he err in 
leaving the bridge with this seaman at the helm 
the jury must answer those questions and decide whether 
hazelwoods actions constitute recklessness according to a legal 
definition as actions that are a gross deviation from the 
standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the 
situation 
monday is set aside for legal discussions on how the judge 
should instruct the jury final arguments are scheduled for 
tuesday and superior court judge karl johnstone has said he hopes 
to instruct jurors in the law and submit the case to them the same 
day

bright lights in the sky puzzled 
observers in several states saturday night and authorities said 
the phenomenon wasnt caused by space debris 
people reported seeing strange lights described variously as 
white streaks flashing lights or a fireball in missouri 
southern illinois iowa and arkansas 
a spokesman for the north american defense command which tracks 
objects in space from peterson air force base in colorado springs 
colo said the lights didnt result from bits of a satellite or 
other manmade debris falling through the atmosphere 
we are quite confident it is not caused by the reentry of 
manmade objects said maj dick adams norad spokesman 
the lights could have been meteorites adams said but he 
couldnt be sure because the agency doesnt track natural phenomena 
the national weather service in st louis reported getting 
numerous calls some from people who said they saw a white light 
followed by an explosion 
i was outside when it happened said highway patrol sgt 
thomas lefaivre in kirkwood mo outside st louis i saw a big 
flash like one of my halogen lights burned out but then i noticed 
my lights were okay and figured it must have been lightning

polls opened in east germanys first free 
election sunday with the speed and manner of expected german 
unification a prime issue opposition parties alleged exsecret 
police may vote more than once to prop up communist candidates 
about 122 million voters were eligible to cast ballots for a 
400seat parliament with the likelihood of a merger with west 
germany sundays balloting could be the 41yearold nations first 
and last free election 
the vote marks the full transition to democracy from the once 
ironfisted communist rule and help set the pace of unification 
with west germany 
all major parties support unification but at a different pace 
some conservative parties urge a quick merger while leftist groups 
favor a more cautious approach most east germans agree such a 
joining is inevitable 
voters will choose from a dizzying array of 24 parties and 
groups the nations 22000 polling stations were to stay open from 
7 am 1 am est to 6 pm sunday west german television is 
expected to give computerized projections sunday night but 
official results are not expected until monday 
an east german television official said his crews for the first 
time had to make elaborate arrangements for an election 
this time we dont know what the result is going to be 
everything is new for us and we should expect some chaos said 
the official who refused to give his name 
many voters have been bewildered by the slates of candidates 
ranging from radical leftists and communists to archconservatives 
the campaigning was bitter and there is continuing fear about the 
oncedreaded secret police 
seven east german political parties claimed saturday that former 
secret police agents planned to use sets of false identity cards 
each with a different name to vote several times 
there is the suspicion of well prepared voterigging planned 
for march 18 the parties said in a statement 
the communistled government claims the secret police force has 
been virtually disbanded but many east germans have doubts 
the secret police force which officials say once numbered 
nearly 200000 agents and informers was the hardline communists 
main instrument of controlling east germans a popular revolution 
forced the ouster of hardline communist leader erich honecker on 
oct 18 and opened the way for the elections 
most former secret police agents reportedly remain loyal to the 
communists who were not expected to receive more than 18 percent 
of the vote 
in the city of erfurt the social democrats christian democrats 
and five other parties demanded the use of fingerprints to prevent 
secret police agents from casting extra ballots 
the parties also said they were making their concerns known to 
the un human rights commission in geneva 
an election commission representing all political parties has 
said voterigging is impossible 
the election will be monitored by observers from the 34 members 
of the conference on security and cooperation in europe which was 
founded to monitor compliance with the human rights provisions of 
the 1975 helsinki accords 
an american observer team will consist of staff members at the 
us embassy and six members of congress state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
the secret police known as the stasi in german already have 
played a part in the election 
the top candidate of a conservative east german party resigned 
last week after admitting he had worked with the secret police for 
years 
and martin kirchner the general secretary of another 
conservative party the east german christian democrats admitted 
having contacts with the secret police during several sporadic 
visits during the early 1980s he denied cooperating with them 
most campaigning ended friday but a few political parties made 
final pitches saturday 
the east german election is seen by many as a dress rehearsal 
for west german elections in december west german politicians have 
worked hard to build up an east german base for the time when 
unification comes 
in bonn president richard von weizsaecker said the elections 
would clear a healthy path to the unity of the germans 
the voters in the gdr east germans arent just deciding 
their own fate but also the stability of the european home in 
which we all want to live with equal rights and without fear of 
each other weizsaecker added 
many east berliners complained about what they considered west 
german arrogance and interference in their elections east german 
flags with the communist hammerandsickel insignia flew defiantly 
from several buildings 
its sad that we are so dependent on the west we feel like 
beggars as if we are asking for alms said marlies clausenitzer 
a 50yearold arts teacher from the town of schoenhausen just 
outside east berlin 
the election will be followed by efforts to form a new 
government to replace the communistled coalition now ruling east 
germany the large number of parties could make it difficult for 
one party to win a majority creating the need for another 
coalition 
also on election eve a west berlin newspaper reported that east 
germanys caretaker government has demanded an immediate financial 
bailout from bonn to prevent economic collapse 
east germany urgently needs 5 billion marks 294 billion to 
provide for the population and prevent economic collapse the 
berliner morgenpost newspaper said 
according to the report west german chancellor helmut kohl has 
refused to act on the east german request pending the outcome of 
sundays elections kohl has said he is not willing to pour good 
money into a bad system

and arab east jerusalem the fundamentalist islamic group hamas or 
zeal called it to protest secretary of state james a baker 
iiis proposal for preliminary israelipalestinian talks in cairo 
a recent hamas leaflet called the proposal an americanzionist

arab reports said that in the west bank city of hebron about 50 
masked palestinians armed with axes and knives stopped cars and 
slashed the tires of at least 10 vehicles that defied the strike 
call

the 1990 campaign season opened in slashing 
style in texas setting a nasty tone that experts predict will mark 
many races this year 
candidates may sign cleancampaign pledges commentators may 
criticize nasty ads but if negative tactics work politicians will 
use them analysts say 
political consultants see nothing wrong with that 
the standard should be do you tell the truth and is it fair 
even though the truth is painful said bob squier who is 
handling democrat ann richards media spots in the texas 
gubernatorial race 
i rely on the press for accuracy which is probably a mistake 
and the public decides whether its fair said gop media 
consultant roger ailes who handled george bushs ads in 1988 and 
this year is working for senate hopeful lynn martin of illinois and 
others 
in texas the three democratic candidates pledged not to attack 
the character integrity or honesty of their opponents with this 
result 
richards now facing a runoff against state attorney general 
jim mattox ran an ad charging that mattox and former gov mark 
white got rich off public service and had the worst resumes money 
can buy 
white ran an ad telling viewers to watch mattoxs lips if 
theyre moving he could be lying 
mattox took aim at richards refusal to discuss whether she 
ever had used illegal drugs maybe after youve decided not to 
tell the truth about yourself its pretty easy to lie about your 
opponents his ad said 
john buckley a former spokesman for the national republican 
congressional committee said richards might not have made it into 
the april 10 democratic runoff had she not gone negative 
the texas candidates were not making a lot of headway with 
positive appeals acknowledged mike mccurry a spokesman for the 
democratic national committee theres some discussion that 
when everybody is up and running the only way to break through 
that clutter is to go sharply negative 
while the texas democrats appear likely to continue their 
bloodletting through the runoff some candidates have had second 
thoughts about using negative ads this year 
in florida rep bill nelson a candidate for the democratic 
gubernatorial nomination opened his campaign by trying to blame 
gop gov bob martinez for the early release of a convict who later 
was charged with killing two police officers 
nelson quickly shelved the strategy after a rival democrat 
accused him of trying to willie hortonize the election and a 
circuit judge scolded him for calling the convict a killer before 
he had been tried 
horton a convicted killer became a campaign issue in 1988 when 
george bush criticized michael dukakis for supporting a 
massachusetts furlough program from which horton escaped 
nelsons campaign is not the only one that has backed off from 
negative ads 
texas republican gubernatorial hopeful kent hance had a change 
of heart provoked by a drop in the polls with his support waning 
hance withdrew a confusing tv ad questioning the integrity of gop 
rival and eventual victor clayton williams 
some observers cited the hance incident as proof that negative 
ads dont pay but others argued the ads flaws had nothing to do 
with its tone 
theres good and bad effective and ineffective smart and 
dumb said squier if you do a dumb ad it will probably 
backfire on you 
while much of the texas mudslinging was done through television 
ads candidates and their surrogates are on the attack live and in 
person as well 
in california for example democratic attorney general john van 
de kamp turned his candidacy announcement into a tirade against 
primary opponent diane feinstein former mayor of san francisco 
van de kamp blasted feinsteins record on civil rights 
insurance the environment and womens issues and accused her of 
budget mismanagement that turned san francisco into the city that 
could not pay 
feinsteins surge past van de kamp meanwhile was largely 
attributed to early positive ads that discussed her experience 
and support for the death penalty 
other are taking the positive approach as well 
in florida martinez is touting his record on the environment 
martin has run a soft gettingtoknowyou spot in illinois and 
rep ronnie flippo dala a candidate for governor ran an ad 
featuring a county development chairman praising his work for a new 
economic project 
theres no guarantee however that any of these races wont 
turn nasty particularly when the field narrows after the primary 
season 
martins opponent sen paul simon dill has invoked the 
negativead threat as a fundraising tool roger ailes bushs 
media hitman who produced some of the most vicious campaign ads of 
1988 is now at work on tv spots for martin we must be ready to 
respond simon wrote past contributors earlier this year 
some analysts believe the nastiest races in 1990 may be those in 
which the candidates are the most alike leaving character as the 
only battleground by that theory candidates with substantive 
disagreements can take the higher road 
already however reality is departing from theory in iowa 
where gop rep tom tauke is challenging sen tom harkin a liberal 
democrat the recent focus has been on harkins homes in virginia 
and the bahamas 
the state republican chairman charged that harkin is a hypocrite 
whos out of touch with iowans 
desperate vicious negative countered the harkin campaign 
gop flings mud first the des moines register said 
business as usual the experts say

teenagers on drugs are at least three times 
more likely to attempt suicide than drugfree adolescents 
according to a study of patients at drug treatment centers 
dr richard h schwartz a vienna va pediatrician who 
coauthored a report published in the american journal of diseases 
of children said the research shows that drugs play a powerful 
role in the large numbers of teenage suicides 
theres no question that the drugs themselves can lead to 
depressive effects that lead to suicide attempts he said 
the more easily obtainable is the drug the greater the adverse 
effects suicide attempts increase dramatically 
suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15 to 
24yearold americans in virginia schwartz said it is the second 
leading cause of death among this age group 
schwartz said his study involved testing and questioning 298 
adolescent patients at four treatment centers he identified only as 
being in three separate areas east of the mississippi river 
twothirds of those surveyed admitted they had thoughts about 
committing suicide and 30 percent said they had made actual suicide 
attempts 
earlier studies said schwartz show that between 6 and 7 
percent of the general population attempt suicide in adolescence 
schwartz said the patients in his study were between 13 and 19 
years old most 93 percent were white and 66 percent were male 
the most popular drug among the group was marijuana with 
alcohol a distant second other drugs such as crack cocaine 
angel dust and lsd also were used 
among those who attempted suicide 40 percent said they made the 
attempt within eight hours after using drugs 
although there probably are multiple factors that lead to 
suicide attempts schwartz said the higher rate among drug users 
may be attributed to the depressive effects or low that 
develops after using some drugs 
some drugs in and of themselves have depressive effects 
alcohol does and so does pcp or angel dust and lsd said 
schwartz for drugs that are stimulants such as crack or cocaine 
the depression is a rebound they go up very high and the higher 
the high the lower the low 
following a crack binge for instance he said there will be an 
almost intolerable depression and many drug users see no way 
out but suicide 
most of the suicide attempts were of low lethality said 
schwartz with 61 percent requiring no medical attention but 10 
percent tried to kill themselves at the wheel of a car and 8 
percent tried to hang themselves 
about 15 percent of those attempting suicide spent time in 
intensive care said schwartz these were not superficial wrist 
slashings but serious attempts that could have resulted in death 
without prompt medical care 
the physician said he and his coauthor american university 
psychologist alan l berman were astounded that almost half of 
the teens who seriously attempted suicide reported that lethal 
means for doing it again were still in their family homes 
schwartz said 23 percent of those who tried to kill themselves 
said their families continued to keep firearms and ammunition 
around the home afterwards 
you cannot keep weapons at home like that if there is an 
adolescent on drugs he said you can assume a oneinnine 
chance of multiple suicide attempts so you need to get rid of 
firearms among successful suicides theres a growing tendency to 
use firearms 
the study by schwartz and berman is in the march issue of the 
american journal of diseases of children

a driverless car packed with explosives 
rolled toward a hotel early sunday where syrian soldiers are based 
but it careened off course into sandbags and the bomb was defused 
safely police said 
a police spokesman said the target of the car bomb was almost 
certainly the commodore hotel which houses about 100 syrian 
soldiers 
the sevenstory hotel in moslem west beirut was for years the 
main base of western correspondents covering lebanons civil war 
it was wrecked in 1987 in fighting between rival moslem militias 
police reported that before dawn the navy blue audi sedan its 
motor and lights off was rolled down a street leading to the 
commodore hotel 
but it veered slightly to the left and hit a sandbag position 
on a road intersection about 20 yards from the commodore and 
luckily failed to go off said the police spokesman he cannot be 
named under standing regulations 
the spokesman said bomb disposal experts established that the 
explosives were set to detonate at 4 am but they could not 
determine why they did not go off 
the car bomb remained undetected for more than two hours until 
syrian sentries began patrolling the area at 6 am the spokesman 
added 
two boxes of explosives weighing a total of 132 pounds were 
taken from the car 
no group claimed responsibilty for the attempted bombing had it 
gone off the bomb would have been the second such attack in 
lebanon this year 
lebanons warring factions have used car bombs as weapons of 
terror since the civil war broke out in 1975 
on jan 27 a car bomb exploded 50 yards from the home of sheik 
mohammed mehdi shamseddin spiritual head of lebanons 12 million 
shiite moslems in an apparent assassination attempt no one was 
hurt 
it too was rolled down an incline but detonated after it bumped 
into an earth mound at the side of the road 
the syrians maintain 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate 
they control about 70 percent of the country and have long been 
targets for moslem rivals who seek to undermine their peacekeeping 
mission 
the commodore is across the street from a sevenstory block 
housing the beirut offices of the associated press cbs and nbc 
the british broadcasting corp and kuwaits alqabas daily 
newspaper 
elsewhere sunday police reported new battles between renegade 
gen michel aouns troops and fighters of the lebanese forces 
militia headed by samir geagea 
the rival christian forces pounded each other with artillery and 
tank barrages all night in the christian enclave north of beirut 
police said there was no immediate report of casualties 
the exchanges in the mountains of kesrouan province followed 
mortar duels saturday in which six civilians were killed 
the victims included a family of four trapped in a burning 
underground shelter 
by police count 762 people have been killed and 2115 wounded 
since jan 30 when aoun launched his attempt to crush geageas 
militia the lebanese forces militia is the only serious military 
challenge to aouns leadership of the estimated 1 million 
christians in the enclave

a bill that would guarantee equal rights to 
millions of americans with handicaps is moving toward passage this 
spring although disagreement over a related civil rights proposal 
threatens that timetable 
backers of the americans with disabilities act say the bill has 
regained momentum after a nearly fourmonth interruption that 
included adjournment of congress supporters had planned on full 
passage before christmas 
the bill would grant disabled people equal employment 
opportunity although business with fewer than 15 employees would 
be exempted it also would grant equal access to transportation 
telephone service business and entertainment and professional 
services 
on march 6 a subcommittee of the house public works and 
transportation committee sent the senatepassed bill to the full 
committee after modifications favorable to the transportation 
industry 
the house education and labor committee approved the bill last 
november on a 350 vote adding only a clarification sought by the 
business community on the status of drug users 
more importantly the house energy and commerce committee 
reported the bill last week on a 403 vote with no amendments to 
the senatepassed version except for more compromises over 
transportation requirements 
the recent actions mean that only the judiciary and public works 
and transportation committees must act on the bill before it goes 
to the house floor 
we are confident that the americans with disabilities act will 
be enacted into law in either april or may of this year said 
ralph g neas executive director of the leadership conference on 
civil rights a coalition of civil rights groups 
the national federation of independent business the 
smallbusiness advocacy group that is trying to change the bill 
substantially says it has made gains through lobbying at the grass 
roots level and in congress 
to that end nfib in february persuaded the house small business 
committee to conduct a hearing on the bill even though it lacks 
jurisdiction among witnesses were businessmen in wheelchairs who 
said they objected to portions of the legislation 
i think that were making progress and i think that the 
momentum is shifting somewhat nfib lobbyist david k rehr said 
rehr said both democrats and republicans in the house are 
looking at the bills economic impact more critically than the 
senate did when the bill passed that chamber 768 in september 
the supporters of the bill say business concerns were considered 
at every step the bill provides long timetables for 
implementation a number of exemptions and a promise of technical 
guidance supporters say 
they say the bills costs will be offset by more disabled 
americans entering the economic mainstream and depending less on 
government payments 
the nfib and others contend the bill is laden with legal 
abstractions that will force the typical main street proprietor to 
spend even more on lawyers fees both inside and outside of court 
nfib also wants a tax credit for businesses that accommodate 
disabled employees or customers the group argues that the 
disabilities bill is the only civil rights legislation that imposes 
a direct cost on business 
but those issues will be set aside until a bigger one involving 
the white house is resolved vocal white house support helped move 
the bill through the senate and helped win over republicans in the 
house 
when disabled activists demonstrated at the capitol last week 
many of them later to be arrested in their wheelchairs for acts of 
civil disobedience rep steny hoyer dmd told them 
we are 25 years late in having a civil rights bill for the 
disabled we understand that 
hoyers oblique reference to the civil rights act of 1964 
pointed to the new threat the same civil rights community that 
backs the disabilities law as a logical and morally necessary 
extension of the 1964 act also backs the civil rights act of 1990 
which was introduced in february 
the new law would change title vii of the landmark 1964 law to 
make it possible to sue employers for damages if they intentionally 
discriminate against blacks other minorities and women 
title vii currently limits relief to nondamage remedies such 
as back pay and injunctive relief that could be awarded by a judge 
the disabilities bill refers directly to title vii as the source 
of relief for job discrimination against the disabled 
the bush administration opposes the modification to the civil 
rights act and has asked that the title vii reference be stripped 
from the disabilities bill instead the specific remedies would be 
spelled out

more than 20000 people rallied in a 
downtown park sunday to demand swifter democratic change and to 
denounce elderly members of the electoral college that will choose 
taiwans president this week 
the protest was the largest in taiwan since the lifting of 
martial law in 1987 it highlighted growing anger with a political 
system largely dominated by aging members of the ruling nationalist 
party born on mainland china 
police said there were about 10000 protesters but reporters 
estimated the crowd at more than 20000 many however were 
onlookers 
in a reference to the elderly nationalists who control the 
electoral college protesters shouted old thieves step down 
and people elect the president demonstrators beat drums and 
gongs to galvanize the crowd 
leaders of the opposition democratic progressive party which 
organized the demonstration urged president lee tenghui to 
dissolve the electoral college known as the national assembly and 
allow general presidential elections 
the national assembly elects the president wednesday and lee is 
the only candidate 
about 500 college students continued a sitin they began friday 
in front of the chiang kaishek memorial park to protest the aging 
assemblymen democratic progressive party politicians urged the 
crowd to support the protest by staying in the park overnight and 
delaying the filing of income tax 
this park will become another tiananmen square if the ruling 
party still refuses to listen said opposition party chairman 
huang hsinchieh referring to last years prodemocracy protests 
in china 
we have tolerated this absurd parliament for 40 years we 
cannot and should not stand it any longer said chang kuolung a 
physics professor of the national taiwan university 
in the park some protesters burned a national flag after they 
chopped off the flag pole a man and two women who tried to stop 
the flag burning were slightly injured in a melee with the 
protesters 
demonstrators forced several photographers to pull out their 
film 
the white gates and a facade of the chinesestyle park were 
painted with slogans such as old thieves go democracy comes 
and long live taiwanese 
about 100 protesters later marched one mile to the presidential 
building and demanded a meeting with president lee they were 
blocked by hundreds of riot police behind barbedwire barricades 
the group then staged a brief sitin and returned to the park 
students mostly from the prestigious national taiwan 
university vowed to stage a oneweek class boycott beginning 
monday to press their demands for democratic change 
the focus of the anger are the 668 elderly deputies in the 
752seat national assembly who were elected on the chinese mainland 
before 1949 in 1949 they fled to taiwan with the rest of the 
nationalist government after losing a civil war to communist forces 
the deputies many in their 80s and 90s have been frozen in 
office to support the nationalist claim to still be the legitimate 
government of china they have defiantly rejected demands they 
retire 
in an attempt to ease growing public criticism president lee 
appealed to the nation in a televised speech saturday night to 
use a calmer and more responsible attitude to face our present 
political development 
critics said lees address was too vague because he failed to 
give a timetable for introducing more democracy to this island of 
20 million people 
lee is a 67yearold native taiwanese many aging assemblymen 
distrust lee because they believe he is not committed to their 
dream of returning victoriously to the chinese mainland but they 
dropped efforts to draft their own candidate for wednesdays vote 
because of intense public pressure

senate leaders struggling to keep a 
compromise clean air agreement from unraveling hope this week to 
fend off a series of strengthening amendments that the white 
house calls too expensive 
returning from a weeklong recess senators renew debate tuesday 
on the farreaching air pollution control legislation that has 
preoccupied the senate most of this month 
among the thorniest issues are whether to go along with a plea 
from sen robert byrd dwva for assistance to any coal miners 
who lose their jobs because of new pollution curbs and over 
attempts by more than a dozen senators to toughen controls on 
smogcausing pollutants from automobiles 
meanwhile similar legislation in the house has begun to move 
the house energy and commerce committee begins this week to 
consider details of the bill 
although president bush has indicated he would like to have a 
clean air bill in time for his signature by earth day which will 
be celebrated april 22 no one on capitol hill predicts a bill will 
be ready by then 
the clean air legislation somewhat different versions in the 
senate and house represent the first major changes in 13 years in 
the 1970 clean air act bush as well as most members of congress 
acknowledge tougher controls on air pollution are overdue 
but getting a bill through congress has pitted regional groups 
against one another and prompted intense lobbying by a variety of 
industries who argue that the controls under consideration are too 
expensive and threaten the nations economy 
the house and senate bills impose significantly tougher controls 
on smogcausing pollutants from both automobiles and industrial 
sources require industry to install new equipment to curb toxic 
chemical releases that now total more than 27 billion pounds a 
year and for the first time require sharp reductions in sulfur 
dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from coalfired electric power 
plants to curb acid rain 
but a coalition of senators argue that a compromise agreement 
with the white house after weeks of closeddoor negotiations 
substantially weakened the senate bill especially its curbs to 
control urban smog by tightening emissions from automobiles 
sens timothy wirth dcolo and pete wilson rcalif planned 
to push an amendment early in the week that would restore a tougher 
second round of tailpipe controls and require automakers to produce 
a specific number of alternative fuel vehicles 
the tougher controls in the wirthwilson amendment have been 
strongly criticized by the bush administration and characterized as 
likely deal breakers that could scuttle the compromise 
agreement and threaten passage of clean air legislation altogether 
byrds coal miner assistance amendment also has been called a 
threat to the senatewhite house agreement and will have to be 
dealt with before serious progress can be made on other provisions 
according to senate aides 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine had been 
prepared to vote on the byrd proposal before the senate adjourned 
for its recess but mitchell postponed a vote after it became 
unclear whether he had enough votes to rebuff byrd who wields 
considerable power among senators because of his chairmanship of 
the appropriations committee 
the byrd plan calls for the government to pay miners between 50 
percent to 80 percent of their most recent salaries for four years 
after they become unemployed if their job loss stems from tougher 
acid rain pollution controls on coal utilities 
the controversy over the coal miner provisions threatened to 
complicate attempts by mitchell and sen bob dole rkan the 
minority leader to keep support for the compromise legislation 
intact 
if the assistance program is approved it could cause the white 
house to withdraw support for the legislative package and cause 
other senators to seek similar job protection provisions for other 
workers such as the petrochemical or steel industries who also 
face possible harm 
but if byrd is rebuffed he could persuade enough senators to 
oppose the bill to prevent its passage 
in the house meanwhile rep john dingell dmich chairman of 
the energy and commerce committee said he wanted to complete 
action on clean air legislation before the easter recess april 6 
dingell last week cautioned committee members to proceed 
without undue delay and procrastination but said he anticipated 
long and difficult committee sessions with the consideration 
of amendments scheduled to begin tuesday 
among the yetunresolved problems facing the house committee is 
whether to provide assistance to coalburning utilities in the ohio 
valley and elsewhere in the midwest that meet tougher acid rain 
controls 
the bush administration staunchly opposes a national fee or tax 
to help the dirtiest electric plants cut pollution but rep philip 
sharp dind is planning to seek such a fee on industrial 
emitters of sulfur dioxide 
rep henry waxman dcalif and other members also are expected 
to seek tougher emission controls on toxic and smogcausing 
pollutants from industrial sources and further reductions in 
automobile emissions both through tighter tailpipe controls and 
wider use of alternative fuel vehicles

rita schattman isnt old enough to vote but 
the republican party thinks shes got enough cash in the bank to 
automatically hand over 1250 a month to its secret candidate 
support weapon 
a 16yearold democrat from fort worth texas miss schattman 
was surprised to find a genuine 25 check mailed to her recently 
from an arm of the national republican senatorial committee 
but it wasnt until she got to the 11th paragraph of a 
threepage letter touting the gops new candidate escrow 
funding concept that miss schattman realized that by cashing the 
check she was agreeing to let the party take 1250 a month out of 
her bank account 
after a twomonth trial at the gops expense miss schattman 
could either cancel participation or continue letting the party 
automatically transfer 1250 a month from her bank account to a 
fund to help republican candidates 
trouble is the high school junior says she doesnt even have a 
checking account 
its the oddest thing i think ive ever received she said 
after school friday republican officials are also at a loss to 
explain how miss schattman who hopes to get her drivers license 
this week wound up on a mailing list for prospective members of 
the republican presidential task force 
when she saw the check miss schattman said her first reaction 
was thats pretty stupid for them to send me money i wouldnt 
do anything for them 
miss schattman said she then tried to think of a way of 
endorsing the check over to a cause like habitat for humanity or 
the abortion rights league but she decided she didnt want to risk 
having her name show up in the charter issue of whos who in 
the republican party 
the fundraising letter paid for and authorized by the national 
republican senatorial committee said recipients who deposit their 
checks before the expiration date would be included in what 
promises to become one of americas most prestigious reference 
books 
i want to know if its legal for them to have done that send 
out the checks old ladies who dont read the entire thing 
because it hurts their eyes might think how nice and they cant 
read the tiny print on the back of the check miss schattman said 
buried on the back of the check in tiny type is a notice that 
the 1250 monthly charge would be going up by 10 percent on each 
oneyear anniversary 
other democrats also are questioning the republicans strategy 
joe louis barrow deputy director of communications for the 
democratic national committee said a democratic lawyer in 
pennsylvania received a similar letter and has apparently asked the 
federal election commission for a ruling 
bob slagle texas democratic party chairman called the 
fundraising effort too deceitful and fraudulent to be funny 
leave it to the republicans to figure out another way to con 
you slagle said 
since the feb 23 letter went out to several thousand people 
the national republican senatorial committee has made several 
changes for its next edition including adding a tollfree number 
for recipients confused about the plan said spokeswoman wendy 
democker 
we do want good will attached to our fundraising efforts 
she said 
ms democker said the first mailing went to current members of 
the republican presidential task force who mail in a monthly 10 
contribution and to prospective members 
she said using electronic fund transfers instead of soliciting 
individual checks from thousands of contributors was a more 
streamlined way of doing business but she didnt know how a 
16yearold wound up on the mailing list 
how she found her way onto our mailing list is she paused 
interesting thats pretty unusual 
slagle complained some recipients of the check might deposit it 
without realizing what they were getting into 
most people arent interested in reading three pages and im 
sure some people are going to be suckered by it slagle said 
ms democker however said participants would see on their bank 
statements that 1250 was being taken out and there is a 
threepage letter 
slagle an attorney also questioned whether the contract 
printed on the back of the check is enforceable under a texas law 
which requires the use of large type for certain contract 
provisions 
id hate to be a lawyer enforcing that he said

average fuel economy for automobiles has 
declined each of the last two years reversing an earlier fiveyear 
trend toward more efficient automobiles an environmental group 
said sunday 
the environmental action foundation cited statistics from the 
environmental protection agency and national highway traffic safety 
administration 
according to the government figures cited by the group the 
average fuel economy of 1990 model cars is expected to be 282 
miles per gallon compared with 283 mpg for 1989 model cars and 
287 mpg for 1988 model cars 
an analysis by the epa attributed the trend to the manufacture 
of heavier cars with quicker acceleration times and the use of 
larger engines with greater horsepower 
in terms of fuel efficiency were heading south on a 
northbound oneway street said robert dewey of the 
environmental action foundation 
the figures showed that between the 1983 and 1988 model years 
the fuel efficiency of both domestic and imported cars increased 
steadily from 264 mpg to 287 mpg 
dewey said the government figures also show that the gap between 
imports and domestic cars is narrowing in terms of fuel efficiency 
in 1986 imports on a fleetwide basis were 8 mpg more efficient 
than domestic cars in the 1990 models the difference has narrowed 
to 3 mpg he said 
these figures clearly dispel the myth that japanese automakers 
still hold a huge efficiency advantage over domestics said dewey 
the advantage of japanese automakers in past years over domestic 
fleets in fuel efficiency largely has been based on the fact the 
japanese built smaller cars in recent years with government 
restrictions on the number of imports the japanese imports have 
consisted of more large less fuel efficient vehicles 
there has been increasing concern among environmentalists over 
the fuel efficiency of cars because the more gasoline cars use the 
more they emit carbon dioxide which is linked to global warming 
legislation expected to be considered later this year in the

advocates of organically grown fruits and 
vegetables say a new poll shows that the popularity of produce 
grown without chemical fertilizers and pesticides is more than just 
a passing fad 
the louis harris poll being released monday does show however 
that national publicity about possible pesticide dangers has 
prompted more people to try organic produce 
the 1989 survey found that 84 percent of americans would prefer 
organically grown fruits and vegetables the same percentage as in 
a similar poll conducted in 1988 
the first poll was taken before a deluge of negative publicity 
about alar a chemical used in growing apples that was taken off 
the market after reports that it might cause cancer 
this shows that the organic mandate is not a passing fad 
fueled by fear but a clear preference fueled by reason said 
stevie daniels executive editor of organic gardening magazine 
which commissioned the survey 
with organic food gaining faster acceptance the lack of a 
federal organic standard is often cited as the reason why such 
foods are not more readily available at large supermarket chains 
said organic gardening analysts 
the large retailers are looking for a usda label to make sure 
they have a label the consumers will understand daniels said 
some 30 percent of those surveyed said they had changed their 
eating habits of whom 28 percent actually sought out organically 
grown food 
the latest survey found a big increase in the percentage of 
people who had eaten organically grown food nearly 58 percent of 
those surveyed in 1989 reported they had eaten organic foods up 
from 38 percent a year earlier 
the increase shows the increasing popularity of organic foods 
after the negative pesticide reports of 1989 according to organic 
gardenings analysts 
the reason given by 65 percent of the respondents for eating 
organically grown food was longterm health effects the next 
largest group 195 percent cited nutritional value 
more than 52 percent said they would buy organically grown 
produce even if it cost more down from 58 percent in the 1988 
survey eightyfour percent said they would buy organic foods if 
they cost the same virtually the same percentage as a year earlier 
interviews for the nationwide poll were conducted by telephone 
between nov 6 and dec 13 1989 the previous survey was done 
between nov 9 and dec 23 1988 sampling error for the results is 
plus or minus 3 percentage points 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee has introduced legislation that would set a national 
standard enabling qualified growers to label their produce 
organically produced 
the bill would 
prohibit farmers from using synthetic chemicals for at least 
three years before their products could be labeled organic 
mandate periodic residue testing and periodic unannounced site 
inspections 
allow states andor independent agencies to run the 
certification programs 
allow states to enact stronger standards 
leahy said the bill is designed to reduce consumer confusion 
over selfproclaimed organic or natural foods 
its downright dishonest to call foods natural when they are 
grown with heavy doses of toxic chemicals leahy said in a 
statement after introducing his bill 
increased demand for organic foods will help farmers save 
money in pesticide costs and protect them from overexposure to 
toxic chemicals he said

the united states trails its foreign 
competitors in the health and care of children and fares poorly in 
a comparison of child poverty rates a house committee reported 
sunday 
the report by the house select committee on children youth and 
families said the united states has the highest percentage of 
children affected by divorce and its male youths are far more 
likely to be murdered than those in other developed nations 
what this shows is there are some very serious questions about 
the status of americas children when compared to others said 
the panels chairman rep george miller dcalif 
the committee based the report on a new study by the us census 
bureaus center for international research which compared 
statistics on us children with those of 11 other nations 
among its findings 
us children experience the highest parental divorce rate one 
in four children now live in singleparent families which have 
higher poverty rates than twoparent families the proportion of 
children living in singleparent families increased since 1960 in 
all 12 countries but the gap between the united states and the 11 
others widened 
among six industrialized countries the united states and 
australia had the highest poverty rates among families with 
children 15 percent and 14 percent respectively even after tax 
and transfer benefits were applied 
at least 99 percent of poor families with children in the other 
developed countries received government assistance compared to 73 
percent in the united states 
the rate of teenage pregnancy was highest in the united states 
than other countries examined 
infant mortality rates ranged from a low of 5 deaths per 1000 
live births in japan to 25 deaths per 1000 in the soviet union 
the us rate was 10 deaths per 1000 live births equal to or 
worse than nine countries 
the united states had a murder rate for male youths four to 
five times that of other developed countries but mexico had a rate 
twice that of the united states 
the united states compared favorably in rates of youth 
unemployment and suicide 
miller said statistics on infant mortality show the united 
states does a good job of saving ill babies that would have died in 
less developed countries but low average birth weights suggest the 
united states does a poor job of prenatal care he said 
its lack of will miller said were not willing to spend 
those preventative dollars its criminal really 
he said the comparisons suggest the united states will not meet 
goals set by president bush to make the united states rank first in 
science and math education by the end of the 1990s 
the report compared 12 industrialized countries australia 
canada france germany great britain hungary italy japan 
norway soviet union sweden united states it also provided some 
information on four countries listed as developing israel mexico 
india and china 
the study used various types of data from the countries and 
comparisons often were based on figures from different years 
in a minority report republicans on the committee said such 
variations limit its value they said the report cannot be used 
as evidence to prove that a new child policy agenda is needed 
republicans said the most significant comparison showed the 
united states has the highest proportion of singleparent families 
while 229 percent of family households in the united states 
are headed by a singleparent less than 6 percent of households in 
japan are headed by a single parent they said 
this factor has widespread implications for many indicators 
including poverty infant mortality rates teenage pregnancy rates 
abortions outofwedlock births and even educational 
achievement the republicans said

a dream vaclav havel cherished 
through years of persecution came true sunday the brave 2000 
people of charter 77 eastern europes oldest human rights 
movement met for the first time 
they were packed into the elegant prague building where havel 
last november negotiated the overthrow of stalinism with communist 
leaders aged men bent old women bearded hippies and freshfaced 
youth relished their freedom to be together at last 
the feeling is excellent beamed petr pospichal a longtime 
dissident who works for civic forum the movement born out of 
charter that overturned communist rule last fall after all these 
years we just now realize how many we are 
for many years prisonerturnedpresident havel said in 
brief opening remarks i had a dream i had this dream when i was 
free but more often when i was in prison 
it was a dream that all signatories of charter 77 would meet 
one day in some prague hall and will talk without being disturbed 
by the police this dream this archetypal vision is being 
fulfilled today 
but the joy for havel and many others was tinged with grief 
for those who did not live to see the triumph of the 13year 
struggle waged by eastern europes oldest and arguably most 
diverse movement for freedom and human dignity 
among those mourned was jan patocka a philosopher who like 
havel was one of the first signatories of charter 77 he was one of 
its first spokesmen and spiritual father of its vision of founding 
a civic society in which free citizens take responsibility for 
their actions 
patocka died in march 1977 two months after charter was born 
after intensive police interrogation 
charter whose ideals are now expressed in state policy rather 
than underground literature circulated among friends was unique in 
eastern europe in uniting many different strands of thought 
it began as an association of 240 intellectuals who signed a new 
year manifesto protesting the suppression of freedom in 
czechoslovakia and grew to become one of the most vigorous 
supporters of human rights in eastern europe 
in charter religious activists worked with excommunists 
expelled from the party in the purges that followed the crushing of 
reform in 1968 wildly unconventional rock musicians met staid 
intellectuals young peace campaigners aligned with aging 
preworld war ii democrats 
maintaining that unity will be the tough task facing chartists 
in civic forum after free elections june 8 in which it is expected 
to garner the largest share of the vote 
these are very different worries from those of the past 13 years 
battling the repression of communist rulers who feared such broad 
and potentially dangerous dissent 
men like havel and jiri dienstbier now foreign minister in the 
postrevolutionary government were constantly detained 
interrogated watched and jailed 
the harassment brought them international renown as defenders of 
human rights and democracy in czechoslovakia and eastern europe as 
a whole 
but charter was also signed by hundreds of lesserknown 
individuals who braved persecution to subscribe to the founding 
documents ideals exercising what havel in a famous 1975 essay 
dubbed the power of the powerless 
stanislav stransky an upright 68yearold was one of those 
first jailed in 1948 by the communists and forced all his life to 
work only at menial manual labor he helped charter by maintaining 
an illegal printing press 
for him sunday was a great day because i met all these 
people i only ever heard about 
during the communists rule chartists considered a gathering of 
even 30 of their number a success over the secret police 
on sunday about 2000 people came from all over the country to 
chat listen to speeches and buy the onceunderground publications 
that as recently as last october earned their editors months in 
jail 
mulling the future however jan urban a prominent former 
dissident who now heads civic forum found trepidation clouding his 
joy 
on the one hand its beautiful to see all these people 
together and to feel that something has happened urban said 
on the other hand its frightening to see what may happen 
very soon in this country to see that after so many years of no 
politics people arent prepared for the problems they will face 
under a stalinist system which politicized everything except 
politics itself charter tried to initiate debate and a broad range 
of political thought 
its members typed out by hand hundreds of documents discussing 
issues from the environment to ethnic tensions the economy to 
womens rights 
it was this activity that enabled civic forum to assume control 
within just three weeks when the communist hold on power crumbled 
last november 
discussing all those things for such a long time it made us 
ready to serve urban said at a moment of crisis people were 
able to go not to a stokers place dienstbiers former job but 
to the ministry of foreign affairs

president najib told his ruling 
communist party on sunday that it should surrender its monopoly on 
power and hold a special session to write the change into the 
constitution 
the announcement was made during a meeting of the central 
committee of the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
the meeting also debated changing the ruling partys name 
one choice favored by liberals was the national unity party 
another the peoples party was supported by hardliners no 
decision was made 
the party should take voluntary legal steps to cancel its 
privileged status najib said in a speech to the central 
committee according to the official bakhtar news agency we must 
give up our monopoly on power 
the meeting also removed 24 central committee members but this 
did not reduce the partys hold on power as its members retained 
control over all government ministries 
najibs speech was seen as an attempt to make himself and his 
party more acceptable to usbacked guerrilla groups which have 
been fighting his party more than a decade 
following the withdrawal of soviet troops last year the 
guerrillas said najib must step down before peace talks could begin 
afghan government officials said they interpreted najibs 
tentative steps toward political reforms as a sign of his weakness 
and perhaps of the soviet unions unwillingness to back largescale 
change in afghanistan 
the soviet union is afghanistans closest military and economic 
ally the central committee meeting was attended by highranking 
soviet diplomats and officials from the soviet foreign ministry 
afghan government officials said 
diplomats in kabul have said a march 6 coup attempt has brought 
najib to his weakest position since being installed as president in 
1986 a highranking government official said sunday that about 
half of the officers in the military are being replaced following 
the insurrection 
the coup attempt was led by shah nawz tanai who was defense 
minister at the time national security remains compromised because 
tanai escaped and joined forces with the guerrillas 
najib called for a meeting to modify references in afghanistans 
constitution to the guiding role the party plays in national 
affairs 
the national assembly meeting would be held within two months a 
government official said it would include representatives from 
afghanistans largely powerless national assembly along with 
appointed members from government ministries and important tribes 
around the country 
in spite of all our success war still continues and the 
people still suffer najib said but we have taken steps toward 
giving up the monopoly on power recently weve been going slowly 
we need to accelerate the trend toward democracy in our society 
najib also said the ruling party would meet soon to revise the 
partys charter removing references to its marxist past the 
structure of the peoples democratic party of afghanistan remains 
leninist but over the last few years its ideology has begun to 
change from communist to nationalist 
free enterprise flourishes in kabul and the government has 
lately begun allowing stateowned enterprises such as ariana 
airlines and the continental hotel to operate as private 
businesses 
eastern european diplomats cautioned against making parallels 
between afghanistan and eastern europe where hardline communist 
leaders have been ousted from power by popular revolutions that 
moscow allowed to proceed 
moscow doesnt deal with kabul the way it does with 
budapest said one diplomat it treats kabul like it treated us 
in the 1950s afghanistan is more like a colony we at least are 
becoming independent 
diplomats in kabul say moscow does not want najib to adopt 
reforms too quickly because that could hurt the bargaining position 
with the united states the main supporter of the guerrilla groups 
in future negotiations

ann landers says a lot of people need 
professional help including those who write excessively long 
letters to advice columnists 
the veteran agony aunt said she skimmed through 1500 letters on 
a flight friday from chicago to seattle where she spoke to the 
northwest womens show 
letters on old themes like those from teenagers asking how to 
get more attention from a potential mate can be boring she 
admitted and naturally she prefers letters that are reasonably 
concise 
sometimes ill get people who write 14 pages or so but those 
people are probably psychotic though she said i tell them 
they need professional help you know a lot of people need 
professional help 
one recurrent theme is whether toilet paper should be hung over 
the top or down against the wall 
im very compulsive about it she said the toilet paper 
needs to be hung down along the wall ill actually rearrange it 
myself if im over at someones home and i see it hung over the 
top

she tried to express her feelings about east germanys first free 
elections sunday 
this is the greatest day of my life after being put down all

after four decades of communist rule east german voters were 
filled with emotion and enthusiasm as they lined up at city polling 
stations and in rural areas at makeshift voting booths in pubs and 
eateries 
adelgund fernschild cast her ballot from a hospital bed in 
leipzig even former communist party functionaries and leaders 
being held for alleged abuses in office were allowed to vote the 
official adn news agency said 
before i couldnt choose i could only hand in my ballot and 
today i can choose between many this is a very special day said 
elfriede matzko 53 as she strolled along in the sunshine after 
voting 
her family was divided over the best candidate and her daughter 
voted for the communists 
but i am 53 and she is in her 20s that makes a lot of 
difference i never could accept that they built the wall and 
refused to let us travel for no reason mrs matzko said 
she said she was looking forward to german unification i 
think we will have a good future this is a very special day 
karsten simmert 24 a trampoline artist with the east german

the air force has failed to provide congress 
critical data on the b2 stealth bomber making it difficult for 
lawmakers to take up the pentagons budget request the chairman of 
the house armed services committee says 
rep les aspin dwis in a letter to air force secretary 
donald rice released sunday said his panel some time ago had 
sought the results of laboratory and scalemodel tests of the 
radarevading characteristics of the b2 
regrettably the air force has to date not submitted this 
essential information to appropriately cleared committee staff 
members aspin said in the letter dated march 12 
aspin said it would be difficult if not impossible for the 
committee to consider the bush administrations fiscal 1991 budget 
request for the stealth bomber 
president bush has proposed spending 55 billion and procuring 
five b2s in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 the administration 
hopes to buy 132 planes considered the most expensive in history 
for a total cost of 70 billion 
air force spokesman maj dick cole said friday that rice spoke 
to aspin on tuesday the day after the letter was written and 
pledged the services full cooperation 
a congressional source who requested anonymity said friday 
that the panels chairman had received assurances that the 
information will be forthcoming but the committee still had not 
received the data which the air force has withheld despite 
repeated requests 
in a separate letter to defense secretary dick cheney dated 
march 9 aspin asked the pentagon chief to provide to the committee 
by march 31 an analysis of alternative plans for buying the stealth 
bomber 
the pricetag of 530 million per plane has sent shock waves 
through congress lawmakers have questioned investing in a costly 
bomber in light of the rapid changes in eastern europe 
it is essential that the committee understand precisely the 
implications of reducing b2 production for fiscal year 1991 and 
beyond aspin wrote cheney 
the chairman suggested that the analysis consider the cost and 
impact of reducing the buy of bombers in fiscal 1991 from five to 
zero one two or three planes 
those same series of purchases should be assessed for fiscal 
1992 fiscal 19921993 and fiscal 19921994 
the pentagon in arguing for the fleet of 132 bombers has said 
any reduction in the buy will increase the cost of a single plane 
to nearly 1 billion a copy 
the department has invested more than 23 billion in the program 
to date

can a television show that depicts cincinnati 
as a midwestern backwater help the citys image 
sure can say local leaders if its wkrp in cincinnati 
the comedy series about the goingson at a fictional cincinnati 
radio station is a welcomed contrast for a city bedeviled by the 
pete rose gambling investigation and pollution problems at the 
nearby fernald uranium processing plant 
i dont mind wkrp mayor charles luken said obviously 
it makes us seem less than cosmopolitan on occasion but i take the 
attention the city can get where i can get it 
producers hope to sell a syndicated version of wkrp in 
cincinnati to individual tv stations in the fall of 1991 the 
original 90 episodes were first broadcast on cbs from 1978 to 1982 
if youre asking if 10 companies will make their relocation 
decision based on the revival of wkrp in cincinnati that 
probably wont happen said roger ruhl of the greater cincinnati 
chamber of commerce 
but is it a plus in cincinnatis image arsenal yes it 
certainly creates an awareness or a hook to the city 
when lois smith joined the greater cincinnati convention and 
visitors bureau in the 1970s the city didnt have much that 
outsiders knew about 
but once wkrp hit it was immediate recognition she said 
it was one of the greatest things that ever happened to us 
publicitywise 
at travel and trade shows the visitors bureau began giving away 
tshirts with a cincinnati skyline and the letters wkrp the 
souvenir shirts were grabbed up as fast as they were offered she 
said 
mike rozow vice president of public affairs and tourism for the 
visitors bureau is no less enthusiastic 
it certainly isnt harmful to the image of the city he 
said its a fun show 
were not talking about a show that deals with brain surgery 
here its a show that people enjoy that enjoyability is 
translated into the name of cincinnati

carter told the associated press that after talks with the 
syrian president thursday he felt that assad is ready to make 
peace under the framework of an international conference 
carter on the fourth leg of his middle east tour said such a 
conference could set the stage for the direct negotiations that 
israel has sought 
president assad has told me that he would be very glad to 
have bilateral direct talks with israel to resolve all the 
differences including the golan heights carter told reporters 
asked if he believed that assad would be ready to compromise on 
the golan he said i am not authorized to say but i think he 
would negotiate in good faith 
israel captured the 450squaremile golan heights in the 1967 
middle east war and annexed it in 1981 israel has insisted the 
strategic heights which overlook the sea of galilee are essential 
to its security 
a newspaper in the united arab emirates reported sunday that 
syria will demilitarize the golan heights if israel withdraws its 
troops from the territory the governmentowned albayan said this 
was the outcome of talks between the united states and syria the 
paper did not say where or when the talks took place it said they 
were secret and highlevel 
carter met with labor party leader shimon peres who told 
parliament last week he received information from an 
authoritative source that the syrians are proposing peace 
negotiations demilitarizing the golan heights 
he refused to say if he believed assad would agree to 
demilitarization un peacekeepers have separated the two armies 
in the golan since former secretary of state henry kissinger 
negotiated an agreement in 1974 
israel radio quoted carter as telling peres that syria would be 
willing to join in negotiations if there was progress in proposed 
israelipalestinian talks 
syria as well as nearly all arab countries in the middle east 
has refused to officially recognize israel and has remained in a 
technical state of war with the jewish state since its 
establishment in 1948 
only egypt has signed a peace treaty with israel in return for 
the sinai peninsula captured from it in the 1967 middle east war 
carter mediated in 1978 the peace treaty known as the camp david 
accords 
carter also met with caretaker prime minister yitzhak shamir of 
the rightwing likud bloc aides quoted shamir as saying he was 
ready to continue peace efforts on the basis of carters autonomy 
plan for the occupied lands without the deviations that some have 
tried to impose upon it 
shamir referred to recent us efforts to get concessions from 
him on the participation of east jerusalem arabs in a proposed 
palestinianisraeli dialogue and subsequent elections

secretary of state james a baker iii is off 
to africa on sunday with the aim of helping to end apartheid in 
south africa and seeking a ceasefire in a 14year war in angola 
in five fastpaced days baker also will attend ceremonies 
marking the independence of namibia and hold meetings with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher 
the celebration of a new nations birth attended by dozens of 
world leaders in windhoek the namibian capital is a springboard 
for baker to meet also with nelson mandela the south african black 
activist and with angolan president jose eduardo dos santos 
bakers aides made clear before his departure that the bush 
administration has no intention of yielding to mandelas demands 
for stiffer sanctions against south africa and that it would not 
recognize angola until the luanda government settles with the 
usarmed unita rebels based in the southern part of the country 
but baker also is ready to assure mandela that the 
administration would keep pressuring president fw de klerk of 
south africa to free all political prisoners and to end a 3 
12year state of emergency that stance puts baker somewhere 
between the mandela and de klerk camps 
his plan on angola meanwhile is to seize on the current 
military stalemate to call for negotiations between the government 
and unita rebels headed by jonas savimbi savimbi receives 35 
million to 40 million in covert us aid annually according to 
congressional sources 
baker will follow up on his windhoek talks by seeing de klerk 
and foreign minister rf botha in south africa on thursday 
on friday bakers aides said he would tour soweto the black 
township outside of johannesburg and visit with walter sisulu an 
african national congress official like mandela and archbishop 
desmond tutu a antiapartheid activist later in the day baker 
will fly to zaire for a meeting with jonas savimbi the head of the 
unita group 
but sisulu said in a telephone interview in south africa that he 
and his wife albertina will skip the meeting with baker because 
the couple has plans to travel to london on march 21 two other anc 
officials govan mbeki and raymond mhlaba will likely see baker 
sisulu said 
tutu said he expects to meet baker but details have yet to be 
confirmed tutus aides said the meeting might be held in cape town 
rather than johannesburg 
mandela whose meeting with baker is to take place in namibia 
has refused to see the american official on south african soil 
saying he opposes highprofile visits to south africa they 
the visits suggest that president de klerk has done something 
positive something fundamental which requires the world to review 
sanctions he said 
de klerk who freed mandela from prison last month has invited 
the 71yearold mandela and exiled black leaders to begin 
negotiations on april 11 
the move was welcomed by the state department both sides the 
white community and black majority were credited with deciding to 
approach an end to apartheid through negotiations rather than 
confrontation 
were very happy at most recent developments which we think 
represents a real change in the thinking in that country a 
senior us official said friday 
in angola baker believes the time is right to promote a 
ceasefire in part because the two sides have been at a military 
standoff in mavinga a savimbi stronghold since december 
the united states is alone among western countries in 
withholding diplomatic recognition to angola although that country 
has developed a private economy and ships 75 percent of its oil to 
the united states through chevron and conoco 
washington has protested soviet support for angola and the 
presence of cuban troops in the country 
about half of the 50000 cubans have left under a complex 
agreement that also ended south african control over namibia the 
rest are supposed to depart by next year 
but soviet aid even though it is decreasing continues to be 
humongous the senior us official said were talking about a 
decrease from about a billion dollars a year to 600 million 
were not asking for the overthrow of the government the 
official said we are not asking for any type of regime were 
not asking that jonas savimbi be made president of angola 
signalling us conciliation he went on all were asking for 
is for the government of angola to reconcile with a major dissident 
organization which represents a significant number of angolan 
people 
in the event of a new political order said the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity we will be very happy to bow 
out

disagreement inside the bush administration 
over the possibility that drastic changes in the soviet union will 
be reversed is raising new questions about the size of the us 
defense budget 
while cia director william webster testified earlier this month 
the political changes in the soviet bloc are irreversible defense 
secretary dick cheney has maintained that moscow could reassume its 
former confrontational pose 
treasury secretary nicholas s brady said sunday that the 
administration is still sticking with cheneys proposed 32 
billion cut in inflationadjusted defense spending for fiscal 1991 
beginning next oct 1 
three billion dollars is it thats what secretary cheney 
says thats what it is brady said on cbstvs face the 
nation program thats our position at this point in time 
websters testimony however is one indication of disagreement 
within the administration particularly between cheney and white 
house budget director richard darman over whether bigger defense 
cuts might be acceptable 
a senior white house official who refused to allow his name used 
was quoted by the new york times on sunday as saying the 
irreversibility of changes in the soviet union makes deeper 
military spending cuts possible 
the newspaper quoted senior administration officials as saying 
they were willing to acquiesce to total cuts of 10 billion to 11 
billion but adding that cheney was still fighting the emerging 
consensus 
a cut of 10 billion to 11 billion would produce a fiscal 1991 
defense budget of 296 billion to 297 billion defense roughly the 
same as this year compared to the 303 billion pentagon spending 
plan that bush submitted to congress in january 
brady called the times story inaccurate saying ive sat in 
all of these discussions and there has been no talk about a 10 
billion cut 
meanwhile senate budget committee chairman jim sasser dtenn 
called sunday for a 20 billion cut in the pentagons budget or 3 
percent less for defense than what we spent last year 
bolstering the case for further slashes in defense spending was 
the house armed services committee chairmans interpretation last 
week of a classified joint chiefs of staff assessment of military 
strength 
rep les aspin dwis said the service chiefs now believe the 
united states and its allies could fight and hold off the soviet 
union in europe without resorting to nuclear weapons 
i look at this net assessment and i say we win we can go the 
other way nato wins the good guys win aspin said 
the pentagon based its assessment on the soviet unions 
unilateral troop reductions announced by president mikhail 
gorbachev in december 1988 and the us intelligence communitys 
conclusion last year that the soviet threat has lessened 
the joint chiefs also took into account the ussoviet treaty 
expected later this year to reduce conventional forces that pact 
would create an imbalance with the united states keeping 30000 
troops on the flanks in addition to the 195000 us and soviet 
forces in central europe 
one aspect under fire in cheneys spending plan is an 80 
million increase over last year to develop a shortrange nuclear 
missile as a replacement for the groundbased lance missile 
the new missile would be deployed principally in west germany 
but officials there have criticized creating a weapon thats 
principal targets would be in east germany poland or 
czechoslovakia 
the followon to the lance does not make sense given the 
change in the european borders said rep dave mccurdy dokla 
a senior member of the house armed services committee 
mccurdy said the administrations call for the program reflects 
a policy that has not caught up to the reality of the 
environment 
aspin predicted last week that congress would not fund the 
pentagons request of 112 million for the program 
democrats say websters comments juxtaposed against cheneys 
failure to take advantage of the changes in eastern europe and the 
soviet union provide them with an opening to craft their own 
defense agenda for the future 
this gives the democrats the opportunity to establish policy 
in this vacuum thats good for america and good for the party 
said mccurdy 
another top member of the panel rep nicholas mavroules 
dmass said cheneys fiveyear defense plan should be forthcoming 
and once that is in hand the democrats should put forth their own 
policy 
the democratic party has got to strike out we have not done 
that mavroules said last week we have to take both arguments 
cheney and webster and then formulate our own policy 
republicans contend democrats will continue to argue for 
significant cuts in defense spending but will turn parochial when 
it comes to determining where the cuts will be made 
the real battle is in the jobs bill rep john rowland 
rconn said of the defense budget ive never seen such 
confusion or indecision 
the oftstated gop strategy is to paint the democrats as 
budgetconscious only when someone elses district is involved

winners is being raised this year to 653000 each from 489000 
the head of the nobel foundation was quoted as saying sunday 
the foundation is hoping to eventually make the prize after 
inflation worth what it was in 1901 said stig ramel his 
comments appeared in the svenska dagbladet

was 150000 kronor in todays terms that would be 784000 last 
years prizes were worth about 489000 each 
svenska dagbladet said this years increase in prize money was 
secured by a planned sale of the foundations 22 percent stake in 
the real estate company bevaringen further increases are planned 
the inventor of dynamite alfred nobel created the nobel prizes 
in physics chemistry medicine literature and peace

the small ultraorthodox religious faction that 
helped topple the likudled government announced sunday it will 
support the rightwing likud to form a new coalition government 
much like the last one 
the announcement by the shas or torah guardians came as 
president chaim herzog opened meetings with political leaders to 
decide who will form the next cabinet 
shas legislator yair levy said his party based its 
recommendation on concerns that rightwing extremists could take 
control of the government and hamper peace efforts 
so we asked that there be a national unity government in order 
to be able to advance the peace process he told reporters 
the likud leader yitzhak shamir had refused to accept 
usbacked compromises that would have sped up the longstalled 
peace process this led to his downfall thursday in a vote of 
nonconfidence in parliament 
five of the six shas lawmakers abstained from supporting shamir 
in the vote which led to the collapse of the socalled unity 
government of likud and the centerleft labor party 
we believe and hope that after what happened that even likud 
will understand without a peace plan it is very difficult to 
exist levy said 
in a rare tv appearance shas spiritual leader rabbi ovadia 
yosef criticized shamirs policy saying it invited bloodshed and 
war upon israel 
one man sins and everyone else must suffer yosef asked he 
added that his partys move to continue to support likud was based 
on sentiments of its constituents 
the shas reversal may influence herzog in naming the next prime 
minister 
israeli newspapers have reported that labor leader shimon peres 
appeared to be herzogs likely choice 
herzog was expected to announce his selection this week but the 
actual formation of a government could take weeks or months as 
likud and labor seek to form alliances 
the outcome depends greatly on four small religious parties 
including shas their 18 members in the knesset or parliament 
hold the balance of power in the 120seat body 
the result could be a coalition of rightwing and religious 
parties led by likud a leftistreligious coalition headed by 
labor another likudlabor cabinet or if all else fails new 
elections 
shamir remains caretaker prime minister until there is a new 
government 
labor is technically parliaments largest faction with 39 seats 
likud has 35 but also controls a fiveseat liberal faction 
peres 66 was quoted by the national itim news agency as 
expressing confidence he could put together a governing coalition 
there are 70 legislators who support the peace initiative in 
my opinion said peres listing religious leftwing and arab 
parties however i know the difficulty of getting everyone 
together under one roof 
levy said his party did not recommend who should lead likud in 
forming the government but the rightwing partys leaders called 
sunday for the 74yearold shamir to again be given the task 
party leaders made the announcement after likud parliament 
members headed off a rebellion against shamir saturday night with 
the surprise backing of former trade minister ariel sharon the 
prime ministers arch rival 
sharon who resigned from the cabinet last month with sharp 
criticism of shamir praised the prime minister for standing up for 
likud principles rather than accept the compromise and back us 
peace proposals 
with full awareness that he would lose his position and that 
the government would collapse shamir stood for our principles 
sharon said we must support someone who would do that 
israeli news reports said some labor and religious leaders want 
herzog to name former defense minister yitzhak rabin instead of 
peres to form a new laborled government rabin is labors no 2 
man and a longtime rival of peres for the partys leadership

a mildmannered former consultant who 
authorities say killed his wife mother and three children and then 
lived quietly for 18 years under an assumed name now passes his 
time in his jail cell reading the bible 
lawyers for john e list and prosecutors meanwhile are busy 
preparing for trial starting tuesday and jockeying over whether a 
fivepage letter list left behind intended for his pastor can be 
used as evidence 
its been categorized over the years as a somewhat detailed 
diary of events said lt bernard tracy the latest in a long 
line of westfield detectives handling the case since 1971 
police believe that lists wife helen 45 his 85yearold 
mother alma and their children patricia 16 john jr 15 and 
frederick 13 had been dead about a month when their bodies were 
found dec 7 1971 in the mansion the family shared in westfield 
nj a new york city suburb 
list who had written notes to his childrens teachers saying 
the family would be away for a few weeks had vanished police were 
finally called to the house when neighbors noticed that lights that 
had been left on in the house had burned out 
when authorities entered the house they found religious music 
blaring from a radio and the wife and childrens bodies lined up 
neatly in sleeping bags in the ballroom lists mothers body was 
found in her upstairs apartment all had been shot to death 
police also found the letter addressed to lists pastor its 
contents have never been detailed but reportedly list claimed he 
was distraught over his familys wavering religious convictions 
as police searched for list the abandoned 18room mansion 
became a landmark for thrillseeking teenagers it burned down 
mysteriously a year after the bodies were found 
list now 63 remained at large until last june when the crime 
was featured on the fox television show americas most wanted 
along with a plaster bust of what list might look like nearly two 
decades later 
several people recognized list as the man they knew as robert p 
clark a married accountant living in midlothian va although army 
fingerprint records showed that clark and list were the same 
person the defendant conceded only last month that he is indeed 
list 
lists attorney elijah miller jr said the concession was 
necessary for legal reasons to file the evidence motions 
prosecutors must still prove lists identity 
defense attorneys will argue that the police search of lists 
home was illegal and that the letter to his pastor is protected by 
priestpenitent privilege confidential communications with a 
pastor can be held privileged under new jersey rules governing 
trial evidence 
the state will argue that the letter does not meet the 
requirements of the evidence rule said assistant prosecutor 
eleanor clark declining to comment further 
even before the routine pretrial arguments are made however 
superior court judge william le wertheimer said he will choose a 
jury with selection to begin tuesday the jurors then will be sent 
home with instructions to ignore publicity about the case 
wertheimer imposed the unusual schedule pretrial motions are 
usually decided before jury selection to reduce the exposure of 
prospective jurors to news accounts the judge said he will then 
decide pretrial matters including the letter the document has 
never been released although authorities have discussed some of 
its contents 
list felt his familys religious convictions were wavering and 
that he had to kill them for their own good police familiar with 
the case said investigators also said list was in financial 
straits that he had two mortgages on the westfield home was 
failing as a financial consultant and had been siphoning money from 
his mothers 200000 savings account 
others have said that list may have been distraught over his 
wifes drinking and his daughters desire to be an actress 
list gets few visitors as he awaits trial at the union county 
jail said warden warren maccarelli he said list is separated from 
the general prison population for safety concerns and spends 
his time reading the bible and other religious works 
we continue to have him on our prayer list said the rev 
joseph m vought of the lutheran church of our saviour in richmond 
va where list as clark was a member for several years 
aside from the letter the state plans to introduce the usual 
evidence of murder trials ballistics reports medical and 
fingerprint evidence and testimony by the officers who searched 
the house the prosecutor said 
those pieces of evidence even without the letter are enough to 
bring list to trial said tracy 
i think there are five real important pieces lying on the 
ground with bullet holes in them he said

four americans on spring break were 
held against their will and threatened by a group of mexicans 
before a police cruiser passed by and rescued them mexican police 
say 
three matamoros mexico residents face a judge monday on 
charges of deprivation of freedom in the incident which began 
early friday 
the three college students and a friend all from the oklahoma 
city area had been visiting bars in matamoros and were heading to 
the gateway international bridge to return to brownsville when they 
accepted a ride said marland crabtree one of the americans 
as soon as we got in they turned around and started to drive 
really fast said crabtree 25 they drove us all over town 
going at about 100 miles an hour through city streets and running 
stop signs 
last year a university of texas student was kidnapped in 
matamoros while on spring break and was killed at a nearby ranch 
allegedly by members of a drug cult fourteen other bodies were 
also found at the ranch 
crabtree his brother darren 19 jeff jones 21 and a 
19yearold woman told police they were held for about three hours 
threatened with death and taken to a vacant warehouse the woman 
who was not identified said she was sexually molested 
the abductors were ordering the americans to go into the 
warehouse when matamoros police officer ruben morales gonzalez 
drove by about 330 am 
i saw them there and i thought it was strange for them to be 
at that side of town at those hours said gonzalez when i 
stopped one of them raced toward the car and told me they were 
taken against their will then i called for reinforcement 
darren crabtree said the americans feared for their lives when 
the abductors told them to go into the warehouse 
at that point we thought they were going to kill us because 
last year those people got killed during spring break said 
marland crabtree they were telling us that we better go in 
because they had a gun 
gonzales said it was unlikely that he would have spotted the 
americans if they had been in the car since its windows were 
tinted black 
the oklahomans told the brownsville herald they could not get 
out of the cars back seat because it had electricpowered windows 
and child safety door locks 
the oklahomans were kept at the matamoros jail until friday 
afternoon because mexican officials feared they would leave the 
country without telling a court reporter what had happened 
the three men arrested were jesus rangel gonzalez oscar garcia 
velazquez and olga lidia castillo all of matamoros

three northwest airlines pilots accused of 
flying a commercial jetliner from fargo nd to minneapolis while 
intoxicated will appeal their license revocations two attorneys 
said 
the national transportation safety board will hear the appeals 
april 3 said attorneys representing robert kirchner first 
officer and joseph balzer second officer on the march 8 flight 
the federal aviation administration revoked the licenses of 
kirchner of highland ranch colo balzer of antioch tenn and 
capt norman l prouse of conyers ga march 9 after its 
investigation showed the cockpit crew boarded the flight within 
eight hours of drinking the federal limit 
northwest fired the three pilots on friday following its own 
investigation saying they had violated the companys stricter 
rules prohibiting drinking less than 12 hours before flying 
bruce hanley the minneapolis attorney who represents balzer 
and mark mcdermott a washington dc attorney representing 
kirchner said saturday that their clients maintain northwest or 
the faa could have stopped the flight 
the two attorneys told the star tribune that northwest had 
enough information to ground flight 650 before it left fargo with 
91 passengers aboard northwest has declined to discuss what role 
it played before takeoff 
hanley said all three members of the cockpit crew also will 
appeal their dismissal by northwest through their union the air 
line pilots association 
northwest is trying to polish its own public image by putting 
the blame on the pilots said mcdermott a former faa attorney 
and vice president of the bar association that represents 
individuals before the transportation board 
mcdermott said it was ludicrous that northwest or the faa 
could not have stopped the flight 
only three northwest crews were staying overnight in fargo the 
night before the flight mcdermott said northwest said it got an 
anonymous telephone tip at midnight six hours before takeoff that 
a capt sugo had been drinking in a moorhead bar but did not 
find the name on its pilots roster 
mcdermott said he finds it difficult to believe northwest would 
not have checked out the three crews 
at 215 am four hours before takeoff the faa contacted 
northwest about an anonymous tip and went to the airport to meet 
the crew before the takeoff 
northwest refuses to comment on what actions it took before the 
departure 
hanley said a northwest gate agent had to have seen the 
three pilots before their departure if they the faa and 
northwest perceived there was a problem they should have stopped 
them hanley said theres no question the plane would not have 
taken off without proper clearance 
mcdermott said he will challenge the results of bloodalcohol 
tests of the three pilots conducted by the hennepin county medical 
center those tests showed the three all had blood alcohol levels 
above the legal limit faa regulations prohibit concentrations of 
04 percent or above 
on the issue of time lapse between drinking and flying 
mcdermott and hanley said they will contend that their clients 
stopped drinking before 1030 pm the plane was scheduled to 
depart at 6 am did not take off until 625 am 
all three pilots were met by an faa inspector before they took

the commander of the indian 
peacekeeping force said sunday the last of his troops would 
withdraw by the end of the week leaving the towns and jungles they 
once patrolled to the guerrillas they were sent to disarm in 1987 
more than 1155 indian soldiers were killed in the 2year 
peacekeeping operation the longest foreign venture by the worlds 
fourthlargest army 
if the weather remains as it is i expect to pull out the last 
contingent by march 24 lt gen amarjit singh kalkat told 
reporters at china bay one of only two military camps in sri lanka 
still occupied by indian troops 
about 5500 soldiers remain in northeastern sri lanka down from 
an estimated peak of 125000 at the height of the jungle war 
against the tamil tiger guerrillas who once again move openly on 
the streets of trincomalee 
the guerrillas waged war against sri lankas sinhalesedominated 
government since 1983 before turning their guns on the indian 
peacekeepers they have entered the political process but have not 
given up arms 
kalkat said the indian mission had accomplished its purpose 
the aim was to bring normalcy for the democratic process to go 
through and it went through the general said 
at this point that military group the tigers is saying they 
have full faith and confidence in the sri lankan government 
kalkat said at the same time the government of sri lanka is 
reposing full faith in the militant group and is dealing with 
them 
he also said the indian army had learned valuable lessons about 
operating in a politicomilitary environment 
in these kinds of operations the military and political 
strategies directly contradict each other kalkat said this 
was the biggest onus on my commanders 
in trincomalee a town of 50000 people the indians departure 
went largely unnoticed the fish market was crowded and men stood 
in groups near the towns solitary cinema waiting for the show to 
start 
there was no sign of civilian administration instead a young 
man in green fatigues with a czechoslovak revolver appeared to be 
in charge 
we have taken over he said identifying himself as a 
ruban a senior member of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
youve seen the situation ruban said in the tamil language 
our cadres are enough to maintain peace 
the tigers took over the town march 10 after the indian troops 
withdrew to china bay and the proindian tamils running the 
provincial government fled 
tiger guerrillas and the sri lankan soldiers and police they 
once fought now share law and order duties while soldiers and 
police operate checkpoints and guard some government buildings the 
tigers roam trincomalee in convoys of pickup trucks brandishing 
machine guns and automatic rifles 
within three months we will have elections he said until 
then we have to create and maintain an atmosphere of trust 
the tamil revolt began in 1983 to press demands for a separate 
homeland in northeastern sri lankan for their ethnic minority more 
than 11000 people have been killed since then at least 6000 more 
died in a sinhalese backlash against the government and its peace 
overtures to the tamils 
the tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people claimed they were discriminated against in jobs and 
education by the sinhalese who form 75 percent of the population 
the sri lankan army made up almost entirely of sinhalese 
initially attempted to crush the revolt with an allout attack on 
tamil areas tamil guerrillas responded with attacks on the 
government troops and massacres of sinhalese civilians 
neighboring india which has a politically powerful tamil 
minority of its own tacitly supported the insurgents and tolerated 
guerrilla training camps on its soil 
on july 29 1987 an indiansponsored plan giving the tamils 
limited autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender was signed by 
the new delhi and colombo governments india said it consulted 
tamil leaders about the proposals 
india also agreed its troops would enforce the surrender but 
the tigers reneged on the deal and turned their guns on the indians

soviet military jets repeatedly streaked over the 
capital of lithuania during military maneuvers sunday one day 
before a moscow deadline demanding that the baltic republic 
renounce its declaration of independence 
at the same time however soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
struck a conciliatory tone saying he still planned to talk with 
the lithuanians about returning to the soviet fold and he said 
there had been no ultimatums 
we will carry on the dialogue gorbachev told reporters 
sunday after voting in runoff elections which were held in russia 
and other parts of the soviet unions slavic heartland 
also sunday 50000 to 100000 lithuanians demonstrated against 
independence at a rally in vilnius the lithuanian capital soviet 
television said the demonstration included calls for civil 
disobedience and for the creation of workers squads to secure 
order and defend socialist property against the secessionist 
government 
the size of the protest shown on national television damaged 
the lithuanian governments claim that the population fully 
supports secession gorbachev has said he is concerned for the 
rights of nonnative residents and fears that splitting the soviet 
union would prompt hundreds of thousands to migrate 
on sunday he continued to insist that lithuanias march 11 
independence declaration was illegal and must be decided by the 
entire soviet union not just the republic he said economic 
political cultural and technical ties were too strong to tear 
apart and human contacts have become particularly deep 
he added that he would work for a new federation agreement that 
would satisfy everyone 
the soviet military maneuvers surprised the lithuanian 
government parliamentary spokesman vladslovas panumis said in a 
telephone interview but military officers told lithuanian 
president vytautas landsbergis that the training had been planned 
in advance panumis said 
a westerner in the lithuanian capital vilnius said it was 
unclear whether there were many planes landing at a military base 
or whether it was just one or two jets making repeated passes over 
the city 
the baltic tribunal an emigre newspaper in copenhagen says 
there are eight military bases in lithuania including one near 
vilnius at least 1 million soviet troops are believed to be 
stationed in lithuania which is on the soviet unions western 
border 
another parliament spokesman quoted lithuanian premier kazimera 
prunskiene as saying the military maneuvers on the border with 
latvia and in southeastern lithuania seemed to be routine and there 
was no cause for concern 
telephone communications between lithuania and the west were out 
of order saturday and sunday but it was possible to telephone to 
the republic from moscow a shift supervisor for the moscow central 
telephone office said the international telephone channels to 
lithuania were closed down saturday for maintenance work and she 
had no idea when they would be restored 
the soviet parliament on thursday directed gorbachev to defend 
soviet interests and citizens in the baltic republic of 38 
million it declared the lithuanian move illegal and the soviet 
constitution still in force 
gorbachev on friday sent landsbergis a telegram giving him until 
monday to respond to how the directive is being realized he did 
not say what the kremlin would do if the lithuanians refused to 
respond he and his aides say they have ruled out the use of force 
on sunday gorbachev said the telegram was not an ultimatum 
i think we shall receive a reply from the authorities of 
presentday lithuania and depending on what it is everything will 
become clear the character and content of the answer will define 
our next steps he said 
we shall act responsibly with a view to realizing the 
aspirations of the lithuanian people from the viewpoint of 
strengthening their independence and sovereignty but at the same 
time within the scope of cooperation with all republics he said 
landsbergis and aides met sunday to draft a response stating 
that lithuanian law will observe the legal rights of the soviet 
union and protect national minorities on saturday landsbergis 
appealed to democratic nations for official recognition of his new 
government 
meanwhile a military helicopter had dropped leaflets on vilnius 
calling voters to an antiindependence rally on sunday 
demonstrators at the rally called the newly elected lithuanian 
parliaments declaration of independence an anticonstitutional 
coup 
i kucherov a communist party member who remained loyal to 
moscow when the majority of the lithuanian party split from the 
soviet party in december said on the evening news show vremya 
that he called for civil disobedience and for government workers to 
refuse to carry out separatist orders 
sundays protest was sponsored by the vilnius communist party 
and young communist league the edinstvo prorussian movement the 
socialist federation of workers and the council of veterans of war 
and labor 
the crowd was estimated at 50000 by a correspondent and at 
100000 by soviet television and the lithuanian interior ministry 
the leaflets dropped by the helicopter stated who asked if we 
agreed according to one read to the associated press over the 
telephone by gintautas alksneses a member of sajudis 
the leaflet accused the independence activists of representing 
those who owned bourgeois lithuania and disposed of the fates of 
people sold lithuanian land and factories to foreign capital and 
cost hundreds of thousands of lithuanians their jobs forcing them 
to flee the country in search of bread 
the leaflets also demanded a referendum on the question of 
independence which was declared a week ago by the first freely 
elected parliament in lithuania in 50 years

chancellor helmut kohl called sundays 
election victory by the east german coalition he helped promote a 
clear mandate for swift reunification 
kohl who made frequent trips to east germany to campaign for 
the threeparty conservative alliance also urged east germans to 
stop migrating to the west and begin rebuilding their country 
official returns reported by east germanys ard television gave 
victory to the conservative alliance for germany a threeparty 
coalition 
the big showing by conservatives in east germanys first free 
elections was a huge personal victory for kohl based on television 
projections the alliance captured the largest single bloc of seats 
in the new east german parliament 
kohl conciliatory in the face of victory called for a broad 
governing coalition in east germany where political groups in 
recent months largely have been shaped by the principal west german 
parties 
this first truly free direct vote is a historical event 
kohl said at a news conference in bonn the events in east 
germany the most peaceful revolution in the history of the german 
people made it possible that it came to such an election 
the east german conservative alliance is led by the christian 
democrats sister party of kohls christian democratic union the 
east german christian democrats favor quicker reunification than 
the rival social democrats whose party was supported by the west 
german social democrats 
west german social democrats have accused kohl of using the 
reunification issue to fan german patriotism and boost his own 
standing in the west german elections in december 
they said the conservative victory in east germany was based on 
unrealistic expectations and promises made by their counterparts in 
the west they accused kohl of promising the relatively 
impoverished east germans a rosy future if they merge their nation 
quickly with prosperous west germany 
oskar lafontaine the probable top candidate for the social 
democrats against kohl said the chancellor will now have to uphold 
his big promises 
the decisive thought for east germans may have been if we 
vote for kohl the money will flow lafontaine said in an 
interview with the ard television network 
kohl said the projected election results were a mandate for 
reunification and westernstyle democracy 
the east german citizens have decided against every form of 
extremism kohl said most important they want to follow a 
path together with west germany that will lead to unification 
the new east german government is likely to exist only long 
enough to negotiate the details of the unification of the nations 
kohl said east german voters had clearly rejected the 
communists who reconstituted themselves as the party for social 
democracy and were projected to finish third in the balloting 
the chancellor urged east germans to stay at home and help 
reconstruct a new country a reference to the tens of thousands of 
east germans who have fled to west germany in the past year 
my message at this hour is stay home kohl said 
work with us in your villages cities and communities in your 
factories and in your local administrations to build up this 
beautiful country

prodemocracy activists claimed victories sunday 
in local moscow and leningrad elections while latvians and 
estonians in their first free vote in 50 years elected parliaments 
that activists hope will press for independence 
crucial runoff elections were held in russia byelorussia and 
the ukraine the areas make up the soviet unions slavic heartland 
accounting for about 80 percent of its territory and twothirds of 
the countrys population 
from moscow to vorkuta in northern russia reformers ran against 
communist party and government officials 
in moscow the prodemocracy bloc claimed 10 of 14 contested 
seats in sundays runoff said irina boganseva of the voters club 
prodemocracy activists in leningrad claimed many victories in 
individual races and estimated they would control at least 65 
percent of the city council said elena zelinskaya of the northwest 
information agency early returns showed only one communist party 
official winning a seat she said 
further results were not expected until monday and official 
tallies were days away 
in the two baltic republics of estonia and latvia annexed by 
the soviet union in 1940 supporters of independence movements 
hoped their candidates would emerge victorious following the 
example of nearby lithuania 
lithuanias parliament was taken over by independence supporters 
in elections in february and early march and the lawmakers 
declared the republic independent on march 11 
the soviet congress declared the move illegal and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev gave the republic three days to 
respond the deadline expires monday but gorbachev has offered to 
hold talks with the lithuanians 
latvia followed lithuania and legalized alternative political 
parties several months ago estonia has not removed the communist 
partys constitutional guarantee on power but a variety of 
political parties put forward candidates without interference 
the soviet parliament legalized multiple political parties for 
the entire country tuesday but that was too late for strong 
movements to form in the heartland of russia byelorussia and the 
ukraine 
in latvia average voter turnout was 75 percent the republics 
electoral commission said the proindependence latvian peoples 
front nominated 185 candidates out of the total 390 competing for 
the 201 parliament seats 
election officials said 69 percent of the contenders there are 
communists including some peoples front members the official 
soviet news agency tass said 
people fronts spokeswoman anda anspoka said the front hoped to 
gain a twothirds parliamentary majority to fight for 
independence 
thousands of popular front supporters rallied in the latvian 
capital of riga sunday urging voters to support their movement at 
least five other parties including the green or environmental 
party competed in the latvian elections tass said 
estonian journalist michael taro predicted the peoples front 
would win about 35 of the 105 seats in estonia with 15 or 20 more 
going to other proindependence groups 
in estonia about 63 percent of the voters turned out by 2 pm 
said annu laido of estonias electoral commission the lowest 
turnout at that point was 54 percent in tartu 
in the three slavic republics voters chose between candidates 
in some 1610 runoffs held after no candidate gained 50 percent of 
the vote in the main round on march 4 
according to data reaching us voter turnout today is somewhat 
lower than on march 4 secretary of russias electoral 
commission anatoly petrov told tass turnout by noon was especially 
low in western siberia between 26 percent and 27 percent 
in moscow officials reported a 57 percent turnout after the 
polls closed 
i think people want to participate because they believe that 
things would change for the best that these are the first 
democratic elections for the first time we have alternative 
candidates for the republic and local councils said ivan petrov 
chairman of the electoral committee at a polling station in 
moscows kievsky district 
tensions ran high at some moscow stations located in libraries 
movie houses or schools the runoffs put many members of the 
democratic russia group a coalition of reformist radicals against 
party bureaucrats police officials and nationalist candidates 
in moscows proletarsky district former political prisoner 
victor bulgakov faced yuri gorbachev a local kgb official a 
moscow activist said 
and in vorkuta where coal miners have staged repeated strikes 
mine engineer victor yakovlev faced soviet coal industry minister 
mikhail shadov 
some reformers accused political rivals of playing down the 
importance of the elections in the hope that insufficient turnout 
would require a new election giving the conservatives a second 
chance soviet law requires at least 50 percent of the voters to go 
to the polls for an election to be valid 
mikhail zarapin a reformist candidate who lost in the march 4 
round at the tagansky district and now functions as an independent 
observer in the elections said he felt people were just too 
ignorant 
they dont really know the candidates some would take the 
three ballots and just cross out the first name in each of those 
others think they should cross out people from outside their 
district he said 
candidates were not required to run in the district where they 
live 
another russian said people were tired of the soviet unions 
newfound political games and did not believe elections would 
change much 
i have to vote one young woman said as she emerged from the 
voting booth but frankly i would rather not vote for any of 
them

a honduran airliner carrying 25 
americans home from a diving trip crashlanded on roatan island in 
a caribbean rainstorm sunday and four passengers were slightly 
injured an airline official said 
marcos briceno manager of tansahsa airlines said in a 
telephone interview the four americans were treated for minor 
injuries at a hospital on the island and released a few hours later 
briceno said sharp strong winds suddenly whipped the old dc3 
plane as it was landing on the islands beachside airstrip 
towards its right side until the wing and the engine on that 
side came to rest in water off the runway 
the aircraft was a twinengine propeller driven plane dating to 
world war ii when it was widely used to ferry american troops to 
and from europe 
briceno said the plane with a crew of four had taken off 
normally from the island of guanaja for the 45mile flight to 
roatan the twin islands in the caribbean about 280 miles 
northeast of tegucigalpa and 43 miles off the mainland are resorts

coast guard crews used vacuum trucks sunday 
to suck up a hazardous chemical solvent that spilled into the 
delaware river while being unloaded from a norwegian tanker 
the spill forced the evacuation of about 250 people from a 
threeblock area in northeast philadelphia on saturday six police 
officers and five workers at a pier near the spill were treated for 
headaches and nausea after breathing fumes of the chemical cumene 
coast guard officials said 12843 gallons of cumene which is 
used in fingernail polish remover spilled aboard the jo rogn and 
a small undetermined amount ran into the river 
fifteen workers used six vacuum trucks to remove a 20000gallon 
mixture of water and cumene said coast guard lt robert mitchell 
the chemical appeared as a light film on the rivers surface 
and by 1 pm no noticeable spill remained he said 
the cleanup was to resume monday morning said coast guard petty 
officer louis moore 
the tanker was carrying 32 million gallons of cumene which is 
a fire hazard and dangerous if inhaled swallowed or absorbed 
through the skin 
most of the cumene was contained and put into a slop tank said 
coast guard petty officer richard minnich a small amount leaked 
into the river but most of it evaporated quickly he said 
a suspect valve appears to be the source minnich said 
apparently the ship sensors said it was ok but it was found to 
be open or partially open 
because the slop tank contained other material coast guard 
officials said they could not estimate how much of the cumene was 
recovered from the river the main concern was not aquatic or 
marine life but fire hazards they said the fire department 
declared the emergency under control about noon saturday four 
hours after the spill was reported and allowed the estimated 250 
evacuees to return home 
the spill occurred when the tanker was unloading the chemical 
into a holding tank at unitank co the tanker is owned by odfjell 
shipping of bergen norway and the shipping agent was identified 
as aspenshipping co in philadelphia mitchell said 
harold yates a spokesman for the us environmental protection 
agency said the water at a sewage treatment plant about a mile 
north of the pier will be monitored but he said there was no 
danger of contamination of drinking water because the nearest 
source for water on the delaware river is upstream

the people who began the revolt 
that brought down a communist dictatorship already were looking 
sunday beyond the elections made possible by their bold defiance 
the prodemocracy fervor that exploded in leipzig last year was 
replaced by quiet contemplation sunday when east germans held 
democratic elections for the first time 
despite the free balloting many residents instead focused on 
the inevitable reunification with west germany 
bernd fischer a 29yearold engineer said he took pride in 
last falls demonstrations totally new things were being created 
then now especially after the election campaign that feeling was 
gone 
the only point of the vote was to shape a germany to be united 
as soon as possible he said we hope the election will bring 
us progress good work good pay and good life for all 
he and his wife kerstin 27 said they voted for the german 
social union a leipzigbased rightist party calling for quick 
unity 
it was uplifting moment said seigmar maywald 50 after he 
voted what was born in the demonstrations reached its peak in 
the elections 
but his companion 34yearold evelyn werner said we cant 
rest on our laurels just keep on saying that were heroes 
its enough politics for now the rest we must achieve through 
hard work maywald added 
activists in leipzig east germanys secondbiggest city began 
the huge demonstrations that forced the ouster of hardline 
communist leader erich honecker on oct 18 
the movement was initially led by grassroots reform groups that 
held huge rallies every monday in leipzig later conservatives who 
supported swift german unity began dominating the rallies 
but downtown leipzig was quiet on election day services at st 
nicholas church a focal point of the demonstrations drew sparse 
gatherings 
signs that reunification with west germany was on the minds of 
many were evident in the western newspapers fresh oranges and 
electronics that were brought from across the border and hawked on 
the streets 
for 87yearold luise woithon the election was a chance to 
ponder a dark past she remembered four decades of rigged communist 
voting and the 1932 elections that put the nazis in power 
were hoping for better times she said 
the rev christian fuehrer lutheran pastor at st nicholas was 
among the driving forces in the revolutions early days and helped 
lead the call for free elections 
now we have to build the rule of law in east germany he 
said a single german state is inevitable but it has to come 
from within a european framework 
fuehrer voted for alliance 90 a somewhat leftist group that 
includes new forum once the most influential opposition group the 
alliance is expected to have only token representation in the new 
freely elected parliament 
despite its terrible showing new forum still held a 
postelection party 
we expected an outcome like this member ralph lange said 
with a shrug but it is a little worse than we thought

bodyguards overpowered a gunman who 
rushed up to a croatian opposition leader in an apparent 
assassination attempt sunday a television report said 
the incident occurred in the town of benkovac in southwestern 
croatia an area mainly populated by serbs during a meeting to 
establish a local branch of the croatian democratic union party 
yugoslav television said 
an unidentified man brandishing a pistol tried to approach party 
leader franjo tudjman but bodyguards pounced on him as he ran 
toward the rostrum the report said 
the man was injured in the scuffle and taken away by the police 
the television said tudjman reportedly was unhurt but the meeting 
was discontinued 
tudjman a historian and former yugoslav army majorgeneral was 
sentenced in 1971 to two years in jail he was accused of extremist 
croatian nationalism during a purge of croatian leadership 
last year he reemerged on the political scene when he 
announced the formation of the croatian democratic union which has 
been accused by yugoslav authorities of stirring up croatian 
nationalism 
the union which reportedly has more than 200000 members and 
plans to contest next months parliamentary elections in croatia 
has been criticized particularly in serbia 
tudjman has complained about serbian leadership as well 
serbia and croatia are the two largest of yugoslavias six 
states 
the croatian democratic union has also been sharply denounced by 
serbs in croatia who claim the party is ideologically similar to 
the extremist nationalist organization of ustashas the ustashas 
were sslike units in the army of the croatian puppet state set up 
by nazi germany when it occupied yugoslavia in 1941 
the croatian group has rejected the comparison

al hirschfelds caricatures of theater 
personalities have graced the pages of the new york times for six 
decades but the master of line drawing is not done learning 
all i know is that when it works im aware of it but how 
its accomplished i dont know said hirschfeld who turns 87 in 
june 
now 98 of his works 31 of them originals are featured in a 
traveling exhibit that premiered saturday at the brandywine river 
museum the first of 15 stops on a us tour organized by the trust 
for museum exhibitions 
the mainly blackandwhite exhibit gives viewers plenty of 
chances to search his subjects for the hidden name of his daughter 
nina a hirschfeld trademark 
hirschfeld said the exhibit puts his early sins prominently on 
display but his illustrations from the 1920s through the 1980s 
also show his development as an artist 
through trial and error you eliminate and eliminate and get 
down to the pure line and how it communicates to the viewer 
hirschfeld said friday the last drawing you do is the best one 
it should be 
hirschfeld spends his days finding the right lines to make the 
face be it sidney poitier or oliver hardy his seemingly simple 
sweeping stroke catches mikhail baryshnikov in air fred astaire 
dancing up a wall or leonard bernstein conducting an orchestra 
using basically an s on its side and a couple more sweeping 
strokes he creates the folded arms of peter ustinov in an 
imaginary odd couple role as oscar madison part of an 
unlikely casting series done for playbill 
his lines can be heavy to create the eyes nose and mouth of 
zero mostel as tevye in fiddler on the roof or hundreds maybe 
thousands of sharp wisps to capture his black bushy beard 
margo feiden whose new york galleries house several of the 
works in the exhibit said hirschfeld is doing his best work now 
its very clearly defined now said ms feiden who is 
hirschfelds agent its very distilled one day hes going 
to be able to draw a dot in the middle of the page and were going 
to be able to know who that is 
hiding the name of his daughter in his work began in 
philadelphia nina was born in 1945 while he was making a sketch 
for the philadelphia opening of the play are you with it so he 
put her name in the background he kept hiding ninas name for a 
while and when he tried to stop public demand wouldnt let him 
he cant get a handle on the fascination which once led to a 
60000 pentagon grant to a university of pennsylvania professor to 
study the search for ninas he thought it was insane and was 
even less impressed when the professor told him the work would help 
pilots read maps 
you drop a pebble in the water and the ripples never cease 
he said

there is no evidence that two us 
helicopters crashes that killed 11 americans last month were caused 
by terrorist attacks the us military said sunday 
we are still investigating but we are treating the matter as 
an accident because there are no indications in the aircraft that 
it was an attack said a spokesman for the us southern command 
who asked not to be further identified 
leaflets signed by the dec 20 movement or m20 and 
distributed in the western city of david claimed responsibility for 
the feb 21 crashes near colon at the northern end of the panama 
canal 
the fliers also said the group was responsible for the march 2 
bombing of a discotheque in panama city that killed one american 
soldier and injured 28 other american soldiers and panamanians 
the helicopters were flying in the middle of a storm the 
southern command spokesman said sunday repeating the cause given 
at the time 
the spokesman declined to comment on m20 which takes its name 
from the date of the us invasion that overthrew dictator manuel 
antonio noriega 
the panamanian government has not acknowledged the groups 
existence but officials have said pronoriega groups exist and 
were likely to have access to weapons caches believed still hidden 
in the country 
a communique from the government and justice ministry on 
saturday said 26 ak47s and one falk automatic rifle were 
confiscated friday in security operations for the david 
international fair 
the agricultural and crafts fair which attracts americans and 
visitors from neighboring countries opened friday 
the m20 leaflets said the group formed as a result of the us 
invasion and that its principal ojective is everything that 
smells of gringos 
it threatened to kill us soldiers and attack american property 
and the david fair 
a member of the communist party of the people was arrested 
friday in david for distributing the fliers and officials said two 
other members were sought 
however the panama city daily la prensa on sunday quoted a 
party official as denying any ties between the party and the group 
any attempt to link any member of our party with actions that 
vary from the pp line is a fabrication that reflects the beginning 
of a witch hunt in this country luther thomas the partys 
international relations secretary was quoted as saying we do 
not know about an m20 group or any other group of this type

phone lines saturday and unloaded more than 125000 cheap passes to 
bozos circus over the next five years 
wed call the response overwhelming said wgntv spokesman 
tom leach 
the show first aired on sept 11 1961 starring bob bell as the 
redhaired floppyfooted clown when bell retired in 1981 joey 
dauria took the billing in a show seen in more than 20 million 
homes worldwide 
the station which is carried on many cable channels stopped 
distributing tickets in 1980 when the waiting list grew too long 
but 5 hours after opening a bozo hotline it was swamped with 
35000 calls 
for 3 each caller was allowed to get four tickets to a bozo 
taping the show is taped every weekday from september through 
april 
leach said a portion of the money will cover the cost of 
registering and the rest will go to a west side neighborhood center 
some callers mistakenly rang the phone at a real estate office 
in suburban chicago that has the name number but a different area 
code 
a lot of people were angry because we couldnt give them

a tehran daily sunday criticized the 
governments campaign to curb irans population explosion an 
effort that has underlined ideological disputes between president 
hashemi rafsanjani and his radical rivals 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia quoted an editorial in the radical jomhuri islami 
newspaper as saying the government had taken an unprincipled 
approach in seeking to slow down population growth 
irans population is swelling at a rate of about 39 percent a 
year one of the highest in the world 
rafsanjani leader of irans socalled pragmatists has 
recognized that unchecked population growth threatens to outstrip 
economic development and jeopardize the countrys reconstruction 
drive following the august 1988 ceasefire in the war against iraq 
the government put the population at 55 million recently before 
the 1979 islamic revolution the figure was 37 million it is 
expected to top 100 million by the year 2010 
the jomhuri islami editorial reflected opposition by 
revolutionary hardliners to the birth control campaign the 
government began last year and the radicals growing criticism of 
rafsanjanis policies 
they argue that a large population will help iran become the 
leader of the islamic world and ensure its power and prosperity 
blunting population growth is central to rafsanjanis drive to 
revitalize irans limping economy expand industry and attract 
foreign investment which the antiwestern radicals charge 
undermines the purity of the revolution 
jomhuri islami noted those advocating population control warn 
that the current rate of increase is too high and that the 
country will not be able to provide food education medicines and 
so on 
it said they argue that the present shortcomings in social 
services are the natural outcome of rapid population growth 
even proper planning will not solve the problem and it is unlikely 
to establish harmony between the existing facilities and the 
populations needs 
on the other hand the editorial said opponents of population 
control argue that the main problem is migration of villagers 
to the cities and its side effects such as congestion in the 
capital and major cities 
tehran is bursting with a population that has doubled in recent 
years to about 7 million 
if tehran is exploding due to the high rate of population 
increase there are many abandoned villages throughout the country 
that are in miserable condition due to the lack of population 
the editorial said 
irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei has supported 
the governments campaign by declaring that birth control does not 
violate islam 
islam itself has been seen as a factor for the alarming surge in 
irans population since the revolution whose leaders stressed 
early marriage and encouraged large families 
the marriage rate doubled from 45 per thousand in 1975 to 98 
percent in 1983 according to available statistics 
but the economy has not been able to keep up 
there is a shortage of housing and schools and unemployment has 
risen tehran and other cities regularly suffer power cuts and 
water shortages food accounts for an estimated onethird of all 
imports because the agricultural sector has deteriorated alarmingly 
since 1979

two days of flooding across south alabama left 
at least 3700 people homeless and killed nine others by sunday 
and one town remained a muddy pond a day after its levee failed 
i cannot begin to imagine everything thats been lost or 
damaged said us rep bill dickinson after taking a helicopter 
tour of elba where 1500 people were evacuated after the pea river 
levee ruptured saturday sixteen inches of rain had fallen in the 
area in the two days before the earthen barrier gave way 
about 45 miles downstream in geneva emergency workers shored up 
another levee and continued evacuating residents who started 
leaving their homes friday night 
margaret mixon emergency management director for geneva county 
where about 450 people had fled said officials believed the geneva 
levee would hold but she added i guess elba was pretty 
confident too 
rivers throughout southern alabama swelled to as much as 21 feet 
above flood levels sunday as the water from the nearly nonstop 
rains drained toward the gulf of mexico 
flooding also continued in sections of louisiana mississippi 
georgia tennessee the carolinas and florida as well as in 
northeast texas and new england 
alabama state troopers said six people drowned friday night in 
covington county when a car fell into a rainswollen creek where a 
bridge had washed out and two more people died the same way 
saturday night in neighboring escambia county 
a third man died in the county saturday when he walked into a 
flooded area to check on his parents about 200 people were forced 
to leave their homes in escambia 
a state police helicopter early sunday rescued three people 
trapped on alabama 229 by roaring floodwaters from the tallapoosa 
river at tallassee about 25 miles northeast of montgomery 
two rescue squad members were forced to abandon their boat while 
trying to reach a driver whose pickup truck had stalled in the 
water said trooper capt roy smith the chopper plucked the two 
rescuers from the water and rescued the driver from the bed of his 
truck more than three hours after the drama began 
in the montgomery area about 80 miles northwest of elba some 
500 people had to be evacuated as the muddy alabama river rose to 
19 feet above flood stage with an even higher crest expected 
monday 
downstream to the west in selma about 200 people were evacuated 
as the river rose toward its record 1961 flood level said 
emergency management director warren rhoades hundreds more could 
be evacuated by tuesday afternoon when the river is expected to 
crest 13 feet above flood level rhoades said 
the choctawhatchee river was 21 feet above flood stage in the 
southeast alabama town of newton about 30 miles east of elba and 
sheriffs deputies said some 500 people had been evacuated since 
friday in newton and surrounding dale county evacuations in 
covington houston and dallas counties brought the total number of 
evacutations to about 3700 
most people were staying with friends or in motels and very few 
were in shelters said lawrence bowden of the alabama emergency 
management agency 
state troopers reported dozens of road closings from montgomery 
south to the florida line about three dozen schools in four 
counties said they would be closed monday because of flooding 
in elba the water receded slightly sunday gushing through a 
100foot hole on the levees north side and pouring back into the 
pea river through a large crack that formed on the south side 
but water still covered all but the tops of firststory windows 
at the coffee county courthouse and the citys three public 
schools were still submerged on saturday water had reached 
secondstory windows at the courthouse 
pumps would be used to help divert the current back into the 
river bed said william fuller chief of the army corps of 
engineers emergency management division in mobile 
the water was up to the windows of lela wilsons onestory home 
which she moved into about a week ago 
it hurts it honestly hurts it seems like everything you work 
for you wind up losing she said 
merchants in brewton west of elba began mopping up the 6 feet 
of water that filled stores and the first floor of city hall on 
saturday 
rep dickinson said southeast alabama should certainly 
qualify for federal disaster relief once gov guy hunt made a 
request to federal amergency management officials 
elba mayor fred moore said he would talk with hunt after 
officials assesed the damage which he estimated would run into 
millions of dollars in his town alone dickinson who carried a 
camera to photograph the damage pledged his help at the federal 
level 
col larry bonine the district engineer for the corps of 
engineers in mobile said it was too early to tell whether the elba 
levee ruptured from the weight of the water or whether the river 
rose higher than the barrier and washed so much of it away that it 
gave in called overtopping 
if the water overtopped it theres not too many levees that 
are built to handle that he said 
the earthen levee was constructed around elba in the 1930s by 
the works progress administration after a record flood engulfed the 
town of 4400 in 1929 
levees are built based on historical flood data said 
fuller this storm exceeded the capacity that was built into the 
design this was built for the 29 flood 
bonine was not sure when the levee last was inspected or if it 
met the standards of a corpsbuilt structure fuller said 
engineering teams would be brought in to inspect it

archbishop desmond tutu and 
some african national congress leaders said sunday they will meet 
secretary of state james baker iii when he visits south africa this 
week even though anc leader nelson mandela criticized the trip 
if the secretary of state wants to see me of course ill see 
him but i will not meet him in south africa mandela said 
saturday after returning from a fivenation tour during his trip 
he called on foreign governments to cut all diplomatic ties with 
the pretoria government 
baker who flies to neighboring namibia on monday has invited 
mandela to a meeting there both men will be attending celebrations 
of the south african colonys independence mandela has indicated 
he will accept that invitation 
the us official then intends to fly to cape town on thursday 
to meet with president fw de klerk and black leaders 
we do not want any highprofile visits to south africa because 
these can result in a lot of confusion mandela said saturday 
they suggest that president de klerk has done something positive 
something fundamental which requires the world to review sanctions 
and other strategies which we have invited in order to increase 
pressure on south africa 
de klerk freed mandela last month after he served 27 years in 
prison for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government 
the president also legalized the anc and other antiapartheid 
groups 
walter sisulu a member of the ancs national executive and a 
close friend of mandela said sunday night he had received an 
invitation to meet baker in soweto outside johannesburg but would 
be unable to accept it because he will be in london 
however he said anc leaders govan mbeki and raymond mhlaba who 
were imprisoned with mandela for plotting to overthrow the 
government will meet with the secretary of state 
asked to explain why anc leaders would meet with baker inside 
the country after mandelas comments sisulu said the issue had not 
thoroughly been discussed earlier in any case he said mandelas 
meetings are considered different from those of the other black 
leaders 
tutu the anglican archbishop of cape town who won the 1984 
nobel peace prize said he expected to meet baker probably in cape 
town although the meeting hadnt been confirmed 
regarding mandelas statement tutu said i appreciate the 
necessity for political leaders to keep foreign governments under 
pressure to take a firm stand against apartheid 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

rafsanjani abc news said sunday night 
in a report from paris attributed to sources within the 
hezbollah movement in lebanon pierre salinger reported that 
leaders of groups holding hostages in lebanon were summoned to 
tehran for meetings last week 
there the current plan to release the hostages was sabotaged 
by iranian hardliners opposed to rafsanjani salinger reported 
the hostage leaders returned to lebanon three days ago and one 
of the organizations islamic jihad issued a statement saying the 
hostages wouldnt be released he said this position was 
confirmed at a secret meeting in lebanon 48 hours ago 
spokeswoman alixe glen said there would be no white house 
reaction to the report sunday night 
there had been several weeks of hints that the hostage issue 
might be moving toward a solution until march 15 when islamic 
jihads threatened to kill three captive american educators unless 
its demands were met regarding jewish immigration from the soviet 
union the demands were not spelled out 
the tehran times newspaper in iran which has close ties to 
rafsanjani said in recent editorials that the hostages should be 
freed on humanitarian grounds rafsanjani himself said he thought 
the issue was moving toward a solution 
also sheikh mohammad hussein fadlallah spiritual guide of 
hezbollah said last month in a sermon that a humanitarian means of 
freeing the hostages must be found

an alliance of conservative parties favoring 
quick unification and backed by the bonn government scored a 
powerful victory in east germanys first free elections sunday 
according to official returns 
however the alliance for germany fell short of winning a 
majority in the new 400member parliament 
the elections marked the first free balloting in east germanys 
41year history and capped the transition to democracy since the 
fall revolution that ended oneparty communist rule 
the results will help set the pace of unification which only 
became possible following the democratic changes across eastern 
europe last year since then many east germans have clamored for 
unification with prosperous west germany as a way to a better life 
and the election results seemed to reflect that widespread 
sentiment 
the alliance for germany defeated the leftistleaning social 
democrats who only a few weeks ago were considered the 
frontrunners the alliance made up of the christian democrats 
the german social union and democratic awakening received strong 
support from west german chancellor helmut kohls governing party 
the final official returns announced early monday by election 
commission chairwoman petra blaess gave the alliance 48 percent of 
the popular vote and 193 seats in the parliament the christian 
democrats who led the alliance alone gained 41 percent of the 
vote for 164 seats 
the social democrats received 22 percent and 87 seats the 
reformed communists finished as the thirdstrongest individual 
party with 16 percent and 65 seats 
the conservative alliance could gain the extra margin for a 
majority from the centrist liberal alliance which won 21 seats 
a variety of other parties won the remaining spots there were 
24 parties or organizations competing for seats in the parliament 
which is to hold office for a fouryear term 
commentators in east germany and west germany agreed kohl played 
a key role in helping the conservatives win by promising quick 
replacement of east germanys nearly worthless currency with the 
west german mark and other financial benefits kohl also campaigned 
extensively on behalf of the alliance 
it was a victory for kohl west germanys ard television 
network said 
i just want to celebrate lothar de maiziere head of the 
christian democrats said at his partys headquarters he was 
viewed as the top contender to become east germanys first 
democratically elected premier 
after the voting he said a grand coalition with the social 
democrats and other parties was possible to lead the country toward 
unification with the greatest possible popular support 
he said a broad coalition also was needed to muster the 
twothirds parliamentary majority necessary to change east 
germanys constitution and pave the way for quick reunification 
with such a majority the east german parliament could simply 
declare a merger with west germany 
de maiziere also promised his party would strive for quick 
economic monetary and social union with west germany 
kohl also voiced support for a broad coalition 
the german citizens have decided against every form of 
extremism he said at a news conference in bonn the west german 
capital most important they want to follow a path together 
with west germany that will lead to unification 
gregor gysi chairman of the reformed communist party 
immediately offered support to the social democrats to prevent the 
conservatives from gaining a twothirds parliamentary majority 
the current caretaker government is led by a communist hans 
modrow he and gysi had proved surprisingly popular during the 
campaign as they tried to shed their partys hardline image 
the election came five months to the day after hardline 
communist leader erich honecker was toppled in the countrys 
peaceful revolution 
a roaring crowd of 2000 supporters jammed the conservative 
alliances headquarters late sunday waving party banners and west 
german flags and drinking and dancing 
as quickly as possible unification dieter schloder said 
there is no question about it 
in washington the white house saluted the election we have 
long supported the aspirations of the people of east germany to 
decide their own future through a freely elected parliament and 
government said white house deputy press secretary alixe glen 
virtually all the parties favored unification with west germany 
but at different paces 
about 122 million people were eligible to vote and some 
districts reported 80 percent turnout by midday 
people lined up at polling stations in cities as well as 
makeshift voting booths in rural pubs and eateries some people 
cast ballots from hospital beds 
this is the greatest day of my life after being put down all 
these years whispered 66yearold annelisa schoen choking back 
tears of joy as she voted in east berlin 
some voters seemed a bit perplexed by the huge selection that 
included such contenders as the beer drinkers party 
we have nothing we can draw from no experience with the new 
parties that we can use as a measure theres no way we can know if 
we are voting for the right person said christel wilke a poll 
supervisor in schoenwalde 18 miles north of berlin 
the elections were the result of a peaceful revolution that was 
touched off by an exodus of east germans to the west 
the nationwide movement ousted honecker on oct 18 led to the 
opening of the berlin wall in november and other oncesealed 
borders and ended the communists guaranteed monopoly on power 
honecker and many of his former associates now are accused of 
abuse of power while in office and face trial but even they were 
allowed to vote east germanys official adn news agency said 
the new government will take part in unification talks with west 
germany and the four world war ii allies britain france the 
soviet union and the united states 
a major issue is the military strength and alignment of a 
unified germany the western powers want what is now west germany 
to remain part of the nato military alliance 
the soviets and east german communists have called for a neutral 
single state 
just when the new government will take office was unclear 
the election campaign was bitter the election originally was 
scheduled for may but it was moved up because of fears that 
modrows interim leadership would collapse 
there were claims that former secret police agents would use 
false sets of identity cards to vote several times and boost the 
communists chances no irregularities were reported however 
the communists tried hard to remove the taint of the honecker 
leadership even changing their name to the party of democratic 
socialism but the memories of years of repression were not easily 
erased despite reforms thousands of east germans have continued 
to leave their homeland for west germany 
as one way to stem the flood kohl and the alliance for germany 
support making the powerful west german mark east germanys 
currency as well de maiziere reitered this desire sunday night 
the most important thing now is that people dont continue to 
leave he said 
at his news conference in bonn kohl agreed my message at 
this hour is stay home he said work with us in your 
villages cities and communities in your factories and in your 
local administrations to build up this beautiful country

japans first lunar probe launched a smaller 
satellite into orbit around the moon early monday a government 
space official said 
the probe called the musesa satellite is circling the earth 
in a highly elliptical orbit that brought it within 10213 miles of 
the moon said yasunori matogawa spokesman for the 
governmentfunded institute of space and astronautical science 
shortly before the 400pound probe crossed the moons path 
during its swingby it released a second smaller satellite that 
was driven into lunar orbit by a kick motor he said 
matogawa said the procedure went as planned the smaller 
satellite will move in an orbit ranging from 12400 to 43400 miles 
from the moon 
the mission will give japan valuable experience in targeting 
orbits and in the use of swingbys for future spacecraft traveling 
to distant planets the musesa will pass the moon eight or nine 
more times during the next year it is expected to remain in orbit 
as the musesa crossed the moons path observation equipment 
aboard the probe photographed the moon but the images were not 
very clear because of the satellites relatively long distance from 
the moon matogawa said there is no observation equipment on the 
smaller satellite 
both the institute of space and astronautical science which is 
conducting the mission and japans other space agency the 
national space development agency have plans for manned space 
flights and interplanetary travel 
the satellite launched in january from uchinoura space center 
in southern japan is a symbolic step forward in japans budding 
space program until now only the united states and the soviet 
union have sent missions to the moon

when general motors corp chairman roger b smith 
retires in july many industry analysts and company stockholders 
expect his replacement to be more familiar with loadbearing shocks 
than noload funds 
after a troubled decade of direction under a bean counter who 
never worked in a prototype design studio rumblings are increasing 
both in and out of the auto giant for a car guy to take control 
smith who will cap a 41year career with gm has been harshly 
criticized for paying excessive heed to profits and too little 
attention to products during his tenure as chairman 
the image of an accountant who never really understood the car 
business has dogged smith for a long time 
his most recent brush with bad publicity is the acclaimed 
documentary film roger amp me which chronicles the devastation 
caused by gm plant closings and layoffs around flint mich 
birthplace of the corporation in 1908 
as gms chairman since new years day 1981 smith also has made 
the tough decisions like reducing hourly and salaried work forces 
to maintain the companys profitability 
when he officially steps down july 31 it will be 19 days after 
his 65th birthday the age of mandatory retirement from one of the 
worlds largest manufacturers 
well before then the board of directors probably will designate 
the next occupant of the 14th floor corner office of the general 
motors building that almost certainly will occur by the companys 
annual meeting in midtolate may it may be as soon as the next 
regular board meeting april 2 
the competition is focused on five men gms president and four 
executive vice presidents 
the new chief executive will face many problems including a 
decaying share of the us car and truck market ferocious 
competition from japan and streamlining the corporation which 
employs about 750000 people worldwide tens of thousands of other 
people employed by other companies directly rely on gm for their 
jobs as well 
the investors that i speak to express the preference of an 
operations guy rather than a finance guy said auto analyst scott 
merlis of morgan stanley amp co of new york 
smith began his gm career as a general accounting senior clerk 
in detroit and rose through the financial side at ford motor co 
chairman harold poling came up in finance but has considerable 
product experience chrysler corp chairman lee iacoccas 
background is primarily productoriented 
you would think that with gms slide in market share you 
would have to assume that its productrelated said auto analyst 
joshua harari of standard amp poors corp in new york theyve 
modernized their plants theyve been successful in europe and in 
the truck market in the united states so a product guy in the car 
market might help 
gms us car and truck market share has dropped from 441 
percent at the end of 1980 the day before smith became chairman 
to 346 percent at the end of last year the market share gm lost 
went principally to the japanese on the strength of their us 
assembly plants and to gm domestic rival ford 
also during smiths reign gm embarked on an aggressive plant 
modernization program spending billions of dollars in new 
equipment and methods of building distinctly different cars and 
trucks 
in the mid1980s and continuing to a lesser extent today gm 
was criticized for making cars for divisions that looked basically 
the same the hybrid names oldsmobuick and chevymobile 
still pop up from time to time 
as gms market share slid so did profits by the end of 1986 
the muchsmaller ford was outearning gm fords profit dominance 
of gm continued for the next two years gm regained the profit lead 
last year 
smith began a costcutting plan in 1987 and has vowed to lop 
more than 12 billion off the companys expenses 
profits have been propped up by the sales of gms europeanmade 
cars vauxhall and opel which enjoyed critical and commercial 
success 
whatever management did successfully in europe should be 
duplicated in the united states harari said i dont know if 
its so much pulling in the people or the techniques used in 
europe 
all of it has led to a lot of speculation about whos next 
large institutional stockholders including the california 
public employees retirement system and the new york state and local 
retirement system expressed intense interest in the search process 
but were rebuffed by gm in written pleas for briefings 
gm says the search process and whos doing it is a private 
function of the board a team drawn from the 14 outside directors 
is conducting the search 
most short lists of likely chairmen include gm president and 
chief operating officer robert c stempel executive vice president 
f alan smith of the operating and public affairs staffs groups and 
executive vice president john f smith jr who directs gms 
international operations 
also mentioned are executive vice president william e hoglund 
of the automotive components group and executive vice president and 
chief financial officer robert t oconnell 
from here it still looks like stempel to me independent 
auto analyst david healy said then there are a bunch of guys 
named smith

greyhound buses have traversed americas landscape 
since 1914 when a swedish immigrant paid 600 for a fancy 
hupmobile to haul miners from hibbing minn to a saloon 10 miles 
away in alice 
in the 76 years since the company has changed owners several 
times and evolved into the only nationwide bus company blessed 
with widespread recognition but troubled by high costs low 
profitability and labor unrest 
its current owner says the latest strike the second walkout in 
seven years may delay but wont stop the companys rebound 
we were rebuilding what had become a very weak resource 
said chairman fred currey we were right on track and this is an 
interruption of that rebuilding process theres no doubt about 
that 
the drivers union struck march 2 and greyhound has been 
operating at reduced levels since using permanent replacements and 
nonstrikers 
currey led the investor group that bought the bus company from 
phoenixbased greyhound corp for 270 million in 1987 four months 
later he bought trailways lines inc for 80 million and merged 
the two under the greyhound label 
he has made the combined company a personal campaign traveling 
the country appealing directly to employees to help restore 
greyhound in some meetings he emphasizes teamwork by having 
employees stand arminarm 
middle income and lower income people in this country dont 
have any other intercity transportation and i can take great 
satisfaction in being part of an organization that fulfills that 
need currey said in an interview 
the strike has not altered curreys personal approach the first 
day he left his dallas skyscraper office and walked to the bus 
terminal nearby where a few drivers were picketing some carrying 
drop dead fred signs 
theyre good people currey said although few of them 
understood our contract proposal and i must say im fearful they 
do not understand what a permanent replacement means 
he has returned to the dallas picket line at least once and last 
monday rushed to jacksonville fla where eight people were 
injured in a sniper attack on a bus 
currey worked the terminal crowd thanking people for traveling 
greyhound and hopping a bus himself for a ride to orlando i took 
the trip because i thought it was important for greyhound people 
not to be intimidated he said 
what is now greyhound lines inc traces its ancestry to carl 
eric wickman a swedish immigrant who in 1913 bought the hibbing 
minn hupmobile dealership 
after he couldnt sell a particularly wellappointed 
eightpassenger hupmobile complete with copperclad headlights 
and brass radiator cap and crank handle he bought it himself for 
600 and began charging iron ore miners 15 cents for a oneway 
10mile trip between the hibbing firehouse and a saloon in alice a 
round trip cost a quarter 
wickman sold and then repurchased the company eventually moving 
it to duluth and later chicago as a network of regional bus 
companies came under the greyhound umbrella 
for a time in the 50 and 60s the companys mascot was a 
purebred greyhound wearing a jeweled tiara and named lady 
greyhound 
by the time it moved from chicago to phoenix in 1971 the 
company had been condensed into one system as greyhound corp a 
manufacturing and financial conglomerate 
greyhound officials point to 1983 as the beginning of the bus 
systems decline because the bus industry was deregulated and the 
company went through a bitter 47day drivers strike 
four years later when currey and others bought the company he 
won an agreement from the union for a 22 percent wage cut 
these were the most unusual labor discussions i have 
participated in because currey rather than coming to the table to 
see how much he could squeeze from the employees came to ask the 
employees to work with him in rebuilding the company and to share 
the benefits of the results said domenic sirignano union 
president at that time 
now the words have changed 
the companys recent contract offers have demonstrated once 
again that the reward greyhound had in mind for its employees 
amounted to millions for management and pennies for the people who 
drive and maintain the buses and for the office workers who ensure 
the efficient operation of the greyhound system said james la 
sala international president of the amalgamated transit union 
some critics claim the current strike is unionbusting a charge 
currey denies his aides say curreys respect for organized labor 
was evident in the contract he signed with the union before buying 
the company 
he had the option of starting all over with a clean piece of 
paper and a totally new work force said company spokesman george 
gravley if we were a unionbusting company what better chance 
would we have 
greyhound lost 20 million its first two years and made a 
730000 profit on last years 1 billion in revenue executives 
say the company cannot afford more than the 63 million threeyear 
pact it has offered 
the union says its latest offer would cost less that 
managements but greyhound values it at more than 200 million 
over the life of the contract 
greyhound drivers were paid an average 24743 last year 
currey says greyhound will be back at full operation by the end 
of the month but the money spent to withstand the strike threatens 
a 100 million capital improvement program 
that is what is most disturbing to me currey said

the company nearly 3 billion in cleanup expenses exxon set aside 
13 billion last year but the letter noted this estimate does 
not include the potential effects of litigation 
more than 170 civil suits are pending against exxon by fishermen 
and others who claim they suffered losses because of the alaska 
spill and last months federal indictment of exxon on charges 
related to the spill could result in huge fines against the oil 
company 
two spills in new york and new jersey waterways since january 
have further sullied the companys reputation and generated more 
lawsuits including suits by the states of new york and new jersey 
shareholders also are concerned that exxons recent problems 
have undermined the value of its stock ms holtzman said in a 
telephone interview 
when investment houses are not recommending the purchase of 
exxon stock then we are concerned about the effect on our 
portfolio she said 
ms holtzman said the pension funds cannot get rid of their 
shares because it would drive down the price of the stock 
together the three pension funds own slightly more than 1 percent 
of exxons 13 billion outstanding shares 
we cant sell our stock overnight were in for the long 
haul she said 
in new york stock exchange composite trading friday exxon stock 
closed at 4750 up 62 cents the stock has been largely flat in 
the year since the spill it traded in the 45 range at the time of 
the accident 
the latest posturing by exxon shareholders comes about five 
weeks before the companys april 25 annual meeting in houston 
which could be a repeat of 1989s spirited gathering 
unlike last year however shareholders will get the opportunity 
to vote on environmental resolutions that could affect the company 
last years meeting was held soon after the alaska spill and 
shareholders did not have time to submit such resolutions 
six shareholder proposals on environmental issues have been 
cleared by the securities and exchange commission for inclusion in 
exxons proxy statement this year 
the company opposes all six proposals which among other things 
call for exxon to take leadership in dealing with the damage 
caused by its alaska spill 
another resolution calls for an environmental report card based 
on the valdez principles a set of guidelines formulated by 
environmentalists calling for conservation restoration of damaged 
environments reduction of wastes and other moves to protect the 
environment 
the resolutions are not expected to pass since exxon stock is so 
widely held and no single shareholder individual or group owns 
as much as 2 percent of the companys outstanding shares but the 
stockholders who initiated the proposals hope they will increase 
pressure on exxon to become more environmentally sensitive

oil prices will likely slide further in 
the weeks ahead despite opecs fresh call for restraints on crude 
production analysts said sunday 
prices are going to come under a lot of pressure predicted 
peter gignoux director of the international energy department of 
shearson lehman hutton inc in london 
peter bogin associate director for oil markets at cambridge 
energy research associates in paris predicted a gradual slowdown 
in prices before a key opec pricing meeting in late may 
however the softening of oil prices will likely have little 
impact on gasoline prices at the pump 
ministers of the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries hoping to keep the target price of oil at 18 a barrel 
wound up a special committee meeting late saturday by urging 
caution during the second quarter 
demand for crude normally slumps in the apriljune period when 
spring arrives in the united states and other consuming nations as 
a result bogin said prices could drop as much as 170 a barrel 
in the weeks ahead 
the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by the cartel 
unexpectedly soared to 2056 a barrel in early january but has 
since fallen reaching 1791 last week west texas intermediate 
the key american grade has been trading between 20 and 21 a 
barrel 
every dollar decline or rise in the price of a barrel of oil 
amounts to about a 5 cent change in gasoline prices 
but even if gasoline prices slipped in the second quarter they 
likely would firm in the summer months when demand increases again 
gasoline accounts for the bulk of petroleum used in the united 
states 
opec is estimated to be producing as much as 24 million barrels 
of oil a day exceeding its output cap of about 22 million barrels 
for the januaryjune period 
opec secretarygeneral subroto said internal estimates forecast 
demand of 208 million barrels a day in the second quarter 
to try to halt price erosion the ministers renewed their 
determination to abide by their individual supply limits to do so 
some would have to turn off the taps 
we expect that we will withdraw some quantities from the 
market during the coming months said algerian oil minister 
sadek boussena 
but analysts were skeptical that chronic cheaters kuwait and the 
united arab emirates would limit production to meet their quotas 
we dont think kuwait will cut back unless there is an intense 
weakening in prices said bogin 
kuwait analysts estimate is producing at least 17 million 
barrels a day compared with a quota of 15 million barrels a day 
kuwaiti oil minister ali khalifa alsabah has said his country 
does not feel bound by its cap when prices remain at 18 
gignoux the shearson analyst said the united arab emirates was 
unlikely to reduce production 
the emirates which have not accepted its quota of about a 
million barrels a day has been pumping double that analysts say 
much of the ministers closeddoor talks were in preparation for 
the may meeting when they will set pricing and output guidelines 
for the last half of the year 
the ministers opened the monitoring committee meeting friday 
evening and then met informally on saturday only eight nations 
technically belong to the panel but all opec members were 
represented 
opecs members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela
