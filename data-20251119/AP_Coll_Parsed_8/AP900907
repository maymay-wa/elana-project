for an amnesty to give prisoners a fresh start in a united germany

recent days saying they were unfairly jailed under the previous 
communist regime 
pietermichael diestel said thursday in a statement together 
with vera wollenberger of the leftleaning buendnis 90 that the

major crimes should have their sentences reduced

voices 
interject antiamerican slogans as the guided missile frigate uss 
robert g bradley and its two helicopters intercept vessels in the 
persian gulf 
the frigates skipper cmdr kevin j cosgriff of binghamton 
ny told the associated press his ship was challenging an average 
of 10 tankers and freighters a day to enforce the blockade on iraq 
which invaded kuwait nealry five weeks ago its helicopters check 
out almost as many vessels 
as he spoke the greekflag 52000ton tanker filoxenia appeared 
on the horizon the american warship questioned by radio the other 
vessels last port of call destination and type of cargo 
we come from jubail saudi arabia on our way to the saudi 
port of yanbu with a shipment of gas oil the captain answered 
we left jubail on september 5 and well arrive in yanbu on 
september 13 
cmdr cosgriff signaled the radio officer to thank the greek and 
wish him a nice trip 
minutes later helicopter pilot lt rick groenenboon reported he 
had intercepted six outbound tankers from sunrise to midday 
groenenboon of augusta ga identified the intercepted ships as 
two norwegian two iranian one belgian and one japanese 
speaking to reporters flown from manama bahrain to the ship 
he said that radio stations often cut in with very impolite 
words sometimes obscene 
they also say things like yanks go home stop this war 
he added otherwise the radio exchanges with the intercepted 
ships are very polite 
cosgriff said this was his third tour of the gulf having served 
twice in the region during the 198088 iraniraq war he 
participated in escorting usflagged kuwaiti tankers in the gulf 
at the height of the socalled tanker war 
he judged the crisis after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait as 
more serious and i am concerned about aircraft mines and 
missile capable boats 
the frigate has so far not encountered any iraqi warplanes he 
said but that we are occasionally subjected to reconnaissance 
flights by iranian planes 
the 453footlong 3800ton robert g bradley is one of nine 
us warships involved in interdiction operations to enforce the 
un blockade against iraq 
its 200 crewmen would not answer political questions those 
interviewed said they were carrying out military orders and did not 
give much thought to whether the decision to send them to the gulf 
was right or wrong

president saddam husseins best hope of 
breaking the stranglehold of un economic sanctions depends on 
reaching new terms with old enemies western analysts say 
the embargo is slowly choking iraq effectively cut off by 
geography and western warships from lifegiving access to the sea 
western diplomats and military analysts speaking on condition 
of anonymity contend that short of war surrender or compromise 
saddams only possible moves are toward syria and iran 
he has been locked in an often bloody ideological feud with 
syrian president hafez assad for more than a decade he fought a 
grueling war with iran between 1980 and 1988 in which an estimated 
1 million people were killed 
its like a chess game you have to think two three four 
moves ahead to see his options you only have to look at a map 
one western diplomat said 
the usled naval quarantine denies iraq the use of its only 
two ports which are at the northern end of the narrow persian gulf 
saddams only hope of breaking the sanctions is via the coasts 
of syria and iran and through convoys of trucks hauling supplies 
across their long borders with iraq the analysts contend 
that strategy is complicated by iraqs relations with iran and 
syria which has sent troops to saudi arabia to help confront 
saddams legions 
saddam has sought desperately to move closer to iran iraqi 
minister tariq aziz will fly to tehran on sunday the first such 
visit by an iraqi official since the outbreak of the iraniraq war 
saddam has shaken hands with iran made peace giving back 
territory paid for with iraqi blood said another western 
diplomat 
the iraqi leader proclaimed the gulf war a great iraqi victory 
even though it was pretty much a draw brought about by mutual 
exhaustion some iraqis now ask privately why it was fought 
western diplomats and military analysts contend saddam had no 
choice but to make concessions to iran they say even if he 
persuaded other countries to break sanctions no significant 
quantity of supplies could slip past the gulf barricade and that he 
needed to have border openings with iraq 
the analysts predict that saddam has six months perhaps a year 
before iraq crumbles under the weight of the sanctions that 
estimate ignores the effect of any food shortages 
the americans have got him by the throat and they dont have 
to tighten their grip one military analyst said 
saddam has tried to rally support in the arab and islamic world 
while he has wide popularity with the average arab most 
governments oppose him 
in a statement released wednesday he called for a holy war 
against us forces in the gulf for the overthrow of governments 
that collaborate with the americans and for arab and islamic 
solidarity with iraq 
his religious crusade is a marked departure from the secular 
ideology of iraqs ruling arab baath socialist party and is aimed 
in part at moving iran and syria 
a change in syrian policy toward iraq is unlikely saudi arabia 
is the bankroller for syria which has little to gain by ending its 
feud with iraq syria and iraq are ruled by rival wings of the 
baath and have been at loggerheads since saddam took office in 1979 
some diplomats argue saddams best hope left is his old enemy 
iran a country with 50 million people many of whom harbor fierce 
antiwestern sentiment 
iran already has defied the west one diplomat said and 
who would ever ask iran why it is importing so much wheat 
an iranian newspaper suggested in an editorial thursday that 
tehran might send food and medicine to iraq despite the sanctions 
the tehran times which is close to president hashemi 
rafsanjani said iran is certainly able to solve almost all food 
and medicine problems the 16 million population of iraq is 
presently facing 
it added the reason lies in the treacherous approach of the 
west to iran during the war

large and handsome homes line 
every shady block in this township southwest of berlin to many 
residents it would be difficult to move away many fear they may 
have to 
officials say up to 70 percent of the property here has been 
claimed by west germans who once lived in its quiet neighborhoods 
with german unification less than a month away the day is 
drawing nearer when those claims and up to 1 million others 
will be decided by local committees in scores of towns 
such claims are only one aspect of the broader question of how 
to decide who owns land that was until recently under the strict 
communist control and before that part of prewar germany 
the puzzle over property has been blamed for the reluctance of 
many businesses to immediately invest in east germany which is 
scheduled to merge with its capitalist neighbor oct 3 
billions of dollars in land and buildings are also in the hands 
of former communists and a special committee has been trying to 
track down the property before the old guard strikes it rich on the 
real estate market 
klein machnow is one of the prize pieces of residential real 
estate in the nation as well as a favorite of the former elite it 
borders an expensive section of suburban west berlin and is only a 
25minute drive from the bustling center of the reunifying city 
the berlin wall still runs along two sides of the township so 
far only a few openings have been made to connect the asphalt 
streets of the west with their cobblestone counterparts in the east 
many west germans have been driving through those gaps to look 
at the land their parents left them years ago 
gerhard hollman recalled a visit from a west german woman who 
claimed her family once own his home in klein machnow 
she said my family lived here for 20 years i said ive 
lived here for 25 he said 
hollmann his wife and three children are one of two families 
who occupy a sturdy twostory building four doors from the berlin 
wall 
he works in a nearby electronics firm struggling to survive and 
pays a subsidized rent of 57 a month if his home were just a 
block away it might cost 20 times that amount 
you go up and down this street and it is the same he said 
some west germans come here and act very aggressively and say 
get out others are nice and say dont worry i wont want it 
back for perhaps 10 years either way there is a lot of reason to 
worry 
the german states have agreed west germans who once owned east 
german land will be allowed to reclaim it but that no east germans 
will be forced to leave their homes or pay significantly higher 
rents 
there are many unresolved issues including whether west germans 
can take possession of property in future years or if some 
compensation will be available to west germans claiming land 
some east german tenant groups say once west germans have 
control of their old property east germans will face increasing 
pressure to move out or pay rents they cannot afford 
the deadline for filing property claims is oct 13 local 
communities will then begin determining who gets what 
the rush by west germans has shortened tempers 
in pritzwalk an east german was hospitalized with burns after 
he snipped an electrical cord of a west germans recreational 
vehicle an interior ministry spokesman said the cord had been 
surreptitiously plugged into the east germans home 
west germans comprise the largest group of people claiming land 
but by no means the only group 
a group of east germans in the city of schwerin about 110 miles 
northwest of berlin is trying to reclaim farmland on what is now 
the border between the two nations 
a number of german jews also have filed claims on property they 
were forced to sell at low prices during the nazi regime 
scores of corporations both german and foreign also are eyeing 
land and buildings left behind when the communists nationalized the 
nations industry 
a treaty signed by the german states aug 31 gave businesses 
some protection guaranteeing that land purchased for development 
cannot be lost to a previous owners claim 
officials say most of the property being reclaimed is some of 
the best the largest number is in the berlin area where there are 
40000 claims 
buildings ministry spokesman hans zillig said 40 percent of the 
east berlins homes have been claimed 
but manfred melzer a west berlin economist and specialist in 
east german property said there are still too many unsettled areas 
property now is being priced too high by an inexperienced 
bureaucracy with limited knowledge of the free market he said 
after the hardline government fell last year the reform 
communist caretaker government that followed began selling a lot of 
property under the table to communist loyalists at cheap prices 
now many current and former functionaries are believed to be 
sitting on real estate goldmines 
renate oeckert and her husband who works at the former state 
petroleum company said she bought a klein machnow home from the 
government during the frantic days following the democratic 
revolution 
the redbrick home came complete with a berlin wall in the 
backyard 
we have no plans to sell it she said we only wanted a 
nice place to live we just hope nobody comes and says it isnt 
ours anymore

a princess who fled romania 42 years 
ago and became a nun is ministering in her beleaguered homeland to 
aidsinfected orphans who sleep three in a bed and die paupers 
deaths 
as always it is the innocent who suffer said the former 
princess ileana now known as the rev mother alexandra at the 
western pennsylvania monastery she founded in 1967 
on monday the 81yearold exile and her daughter alexandra 
started a weeklong tour of romanias orphanages where an estimated 
14000 children were abandoned 
an archaic practice of giving blood transfusions to sickly 
newborns has resulted in at least 687 aids cases among romanian 
children and the world health organization estimates thousands 
more may be infected with the virus that causes aids 
my interest is to arrange something so that the children who 
are dying of aids should die a humane death said mother 
alexandra who has six children of her own they deserve more 
than putting them all in one bed and pulling them out one at a time 
as they die 
mother alexandra the greatgranddaughter of englands queen 
victoria and czar alexander ii of russia fled the familys palace 
in the capital of bucharest just after new years day 1948 about a 
week after communists forced her nephew king michael to abdicate 
in 1967 she founded the orthodox monastery of the 
transfiguration starting only with a mobile home in ellwood city 
about 50 miles northwest of pittsburgh the monastery complex now 
has 12 buildings 
in a recent interview at her monastery home among paintings of 
her family and relics of its rule mother alexandra said she 
watched with interest last years overthrow of romanias communist 
government and the execution of its feared dictator nicolae 
ceausescu 
ceausescu made aids a state secret his wife eleana who also 
was killed by a firing squad last christmas was the enforcer of a 
ban on contraception and abortions in the nation of 23 million the 
ceausescus hoped to make the country more powerful by having 30 
million people by the year 2000 
the prochoice people are making a great story out of it 
mother alexandra said there was no family planning no pill the 
women were forced to have more children than they could feed 
mother alexandra was invited to romania by christiana a 
fledgling relief organization founded by the countrys doctors and 
priests 
after her return she plans to meet with directors of american 
charities to gather support for relief efforts 
we need to be able to say this is what we need this is what 
we have and this is how we can dispose of it she said i 
have a lot of good will and a lot of faith i hope to be able to 
move others to help 
mother alexandra speculated an international adoption network 
would help some children she said however that such a program 
could not place children in the united states which blocks 
immigration of people infected with hiv 
mother alexandra retains a following in romania in part because 
for 30 years she made twiceyearly broadcasts over radio free 
europe 
she said she plans a lowprofile visit to avoid the fray between 
the government of president ion iliescu which granted her entry 
and the political opposition 
shes also wary of seeing the many changes that communist rule 
wrought on romanian landmarks 
i want to remember it the way it was as my home she said

the space shuttle columbia 
prevented from lifting off early thursday holds the record for the 
most launch delays it is also the oldest ship in the fleet 
columbia set the mark when it was delayed seven times before a 
satellite delivery mission that finally made it off the ground in 
january 1986 two weeks before the challenger accident 
so far in 1990 only three shuttle missions have lifted off and 
with three more scheduled nasa will fail to meet its goal of nine 
flights for the year 
on jan 9 columbia was launched on a satellite delivery run it 
had been scheduled for liftoff on dec 18 but its launch pad was 
being refurbished and not ready a rescheduled launch jan 8 was 
delayed by bad weather 
atlantis was launched feb 28 on a secret military mission it 
was originally scheduled for feb 22 but was postponed successively 
to feb 23 24 and 25 because commander john creighton had a cold 
on feb 25 with the crew in the cockpit a malfunction in the 
range safety computer forced a scrub the following day there was 
another postponement because of bad weather 
on april 24 discovery went aloft to place the hubble space 
telescope into orbit the liftoff originally scheduled for april 
18 was actually moved ahead to april 10 but that attempt was 
halted with four minutes to go because of a faulty valve in a 
hydraulic power unit 
columbia which flew first on april 12 1981 was to go on its 
10th trip into space on may 17 carrying the astro observatory but 
that date was changed to may 30 because of the hubble mission was 
late on launch day engineers found a massive leak of hydrogen 
fuel and spent the next three months searching for a cause 
on aug 29 while readying the ship for a sept 1 flight launch 
control found it had no communications with one of the telescopes 
aboard the shuttle the mission was rescheduled for sept 6 but 
the leak reappeared during fueling the night before and caused a 
third delay

eagle scouts be prepared if you want to collect 
letters of recognition from the governors of all 50 states dont 
expect much cooperation from gov roy romer 
colorados governor is standing firm for postal parsimony 
despite being taunted by a radio show host as stingy roy 
jane nelson a romer spokeswoman said thursday that the 
governor still believes his office cannot afford to send 
congratulatory letters to everyone who asks but it will not be 
caught again sending letters explaining that it cannot send letters 
now if we respond in a negative fashion to a request we will 
simply send postcards because they are less costly and more 
efficient timewise nelson said 
romers postage policy took a licking when the parents of scouts 
douglas baker 14 of new milford nj and derek kahill 17 of 
oradell nj solicited letters of recognition from the 50 
governors the boys had become eagle scouts the highest honor for 
boy scouts 
governors from 49 states complied as did president bush 
romers staff sent letters explaining its noletter policy the 
boys families were upset and george weber host of a koa radio 
show called the flip side took up their cause 
weber interviewed the scouts on the air last week and urged 
listeners to write to stingy roy 
romer who was listening called in to webers program and took 
the talkshow host to task in a 20minute tirade romer also 
lectured the boys on government responsibility 
weber responded take a sedative governor 
the exchange spurred newspaper editorials and cartoons 
columnists compared romer with his predecessor richard lamm who 
was governor from 19741986 although both are democrats romer 
characteristically an upbeat cheerleader for the state is not 
usually compared to lamm who was nicknamed gov gloom 
lamm attracted notoriety for his criticism of the use of 
expensive technology to keep terminally ill old people alive his 
1984 weve got a duty to die comment 
while romers outburst at weber lacked such lifeanddeath 
gravity it did cause enough fallout that he felt obliged to pen 
baker and kahill an apologetic fivepage letter 
i am writing to you personally so that you may understand my 
attitude and feelings about your personal achievement of becoming 
eagle scouts and about the way my office handled the issue he 
wrote 
weber claimed victory but nelson said the governors office 
letterwriting policy has only been altered slightly as a result of 
the episode

not too long ago the future of fort dix 
appeared bleak but the persian gulf crisis has brought a renewed 
sense of purpose at the sprawling army base 
base personnel and critics of a plan to scale back operations at 
fort dix are feeling just a bit smug now that the base is playing a 
major role in mobilizing army reserve units for deployment in 
operation desert shield 
it shows the military importance of fort dix said rep 
james saxton rnj if we are to have a large mobilization of 
national guard or army reserve forces fort dix is just the base 
for that 
this is the kind of thing that we said over and over again 
that fort dix would be important for saxton said 
the hatchet fell on fort dix last year when congress approved a 
massive costcutting plan a federal commission recommended closing 
86 military bases and scaling back five more including central new 
jerseys fort dix about 30 miles east of philadelphia 
an army spokesman lt col joseph allread said the increased 
activity resulting from operation desert shield will not alter the 
ultimate fate of the targeted bases 
it doesnt change the base closure mandate which we have 
allread said when we come through this current situation they 
will still be moved towards closure 
the plans call for the elimination of basic training operations 
boot camp for army recruits at the fort by october 1992 the 
bases 3800 civilian work force was expected to be trimmed by 
about onethird by the cutbacks the base also employs about 8900 
members of the military 
new jersey politicians attempted unsuccessfully to derail the 
plan and the bases role in the persian gulf crisis isnt likely 
to change the plan 
but it has provided a validation of the bases importance at 
least in the minds of those laboring there 
capt dwayne lacewell who commands an engineer battalion placed 
on alert said the mood at fort dix is noticeably more upbeat these 
days 
i think it should bring to light that fort dix has a viable 
mission in the force structure lacewell said obviously fort 
dix is an integral element in providing soldiers to the force 
the arrival of reservists at fort dix last week was widely 
publicized and that said base spokeswoman rebecca wriggle puffed 
out the chests of more than a few soldiers and civilian workers 
having a chance to do something that you prepare every day to 
do is a good feeling wriggle said last week 
fort dix which was established in 1917 will remain an active 
center for reserve and national guard training wriggle said and 
maintain its function of processing soldiers whose term of duty is 
completed 
there are a number of things that will continue wriggle 
said the major thing that is changing is that we will lose our 
initial army entry training function 
and fort dix will continue as a mobilization center for army 
reserve units 
however wriggle said no one was kidding themselves that the 
recent reserve activity would somehow save the forts boot camp 
it is a stretch to think that it will affect the future of 
fort dix she said the realignment is a matter of public law 
now

one of the most popular stops on the campaign 
trail this year is the saudi arabian desert 
sen claiborne pell dri showcased his chairmanship of the 
foreign relations committee by leading a delegation to the persian 
gulf last weekend 
sen carl levin dmich was seen on local television 
interviewing homestate soldiers in the gulf and sen jesse helms 
rnc greeted voters in a uss wisconsin hat upon his return 
with the country in the grip of a middle east crisis candidates 
are racing to demonstrate their patriotism and support for the us 
military 
the themes are traditionally republican and would appear to 
favor that partys candidates but the unstable international 
situation makes voters less apt to throw out incumbents most of 
whom are democrats 
at least one gop incumbent stands to gain from the gulf 
confrontation helms a diehard conservative facing a tough 
challenge from democrat harvey gantt the black former mayor of 
charlotte nc 
gantt champions education and environmental concerns and 
criticizes helms for opposing spending in those areas the gulf 
situation allows helms to divert attention to the kind of federal 
spending he does support defense 
in a new helms ad a narrator talks about iraqs saddam hussein 
his chemical weapons and the us troops in saudi arabia should 
we cut defense 300 billion the voice asks helms says no gantt 
says yes the narrator explains 
gantt made the proposal long before iraq invaded kuwait and says 
he still believes the money can be saved over the next five to 
eight years or longer but he adds i think the voters understand 
very clearly that harvey gantt stands behind the president and 
stands behind our troops 
gantt is not the only candidate who has been forced on the 
defensive by the gulf crisis many who have promoted pentagon cuts 
or voiced reservations about the us role in the gulf are finding 
themselves vulnerable to attack 
in oregon for example gop rep denny smith is accusing his 
democratic challenger mike kopetski of cozying up to saddam 
hussein and promoting appeasement tactics that didnt stop hitler 
kopetski who nearly toppled smith in 1988 did say he opposed 
military action and hoped the iraqi aggression wouldnt go any 
further than kuwait however the remarks were made the same day 
as the invasion and kopetski has since said he supports president 
bushs moves 
smiths strategy could backfire in the end editorial writers 
across oregon are criticizing him for opportunist and offensive 
campaign tactics 
the gulf crisis has become a significant factor in other races 
as well including senate contests in iowa michigan illinois and 
nebraska where three republican representatives and a former 
congressman are trying to oust four democratic incumbents 
in nebraska former rep hal daub pounced on sen james exon for 
expressing reluctance to engage us troops in combat in the gulf 
region in iowa meanwhile rep tom tauke said sen tom harkins 
questions about whether bush needed to call up the reserves were 
either tragically misinformed or blatant opportunism 
rep lynn martin ridiculed illinois dovish sen paul simon as 
an electionyear macho man for urging last month that iraqi oil 
pipelines be bombed and in michigan rep bill schuette has 
attacked levin for past votes against conventional weapons 
but the senators are fighting back with trips to the persian 
gulf news clips of them with the troops talk show appearances 
oped newspaper pieces and emphasis on any relevant positions of 
authority in levins case his chairmanship of the conventional 
forces and alliance defense subcommittee 
the crisis would seem to be a windfall for pell who is facing a 
spirited challenge from rep claudine schneider in rhode island 
in his role as foreign relations committee chairman pell has 
been on television and oped pages and he led a delegation to saudi 
arabia just before congress reconvened 
but his flurry of activity came only after schneiders campaign 
had needled him for weeks about his failure to respond quickly to 
the gulf crisis 
its interesting that nearly a month went by and you did not 
see him really sought after or showing up on cnn or the networks or 
major papers as a voice why arent people asking him said wendy 
burnley a spokeswoman for the national republican senatorial 
committee 
anita dunn burnleys counterpart at the democratic senatorial 
campaign committee scoffed at such criticism the schneider 
campaigns test of whether pell is an effective foreign relations 
chairman is how many times hes seen on tv nationally thats not 
the best most valid test she said

nasa plans to replace a 
softballsized fuel pump this weekend to get shuttle columbia ready 
for a fourth try at carrying an astronomical observatory into space 
in midseptember 
this has been a troublesome and vexing summer for me and for 
nasa richard truly nasas administrator said thursday but 
let me just remind everybody that running the space program is 
not an ordinary business we push the boundaries of human activity 
flying in space and its a hard job 
the new target date for the thricescrubbed launch will be early 
in the week of sept 17 that truly said will let the astro 
mission proceed without affecting the next flight which must begin 
between oct 5 and oct 23 
space engineers following a vapor trail of clues said the pump 
was the leading suspect for the hydrogen leaks that canceled 
thursdays scheduled launch they will not be sure until they open 
the aft compartment of the shuttle on saturday and remove a 
package that includes three of the pumps one for each engine 
the swap itself will take only two days according to officials 
but retesting and all the other steps required before a countdown 
can begin will take up the rest of the week 
all along nasa has said that columbia must be on its way before 
sept 14 so that launch crews can turn their attention to 
discovery sitting on a neighboring launch pad 
but the officials say now that was a soft date subject to 
change in any event the discovery flight is likely to be delayed 
several days because of a problem in its cooling system 
discovery will carry into orbit a space probe that then will be 
launched toward the sun with a velocity boost gained by flying 
past the planet jupiter only in the 19day period will the 
alignment of earth and jupiter permit that boost 
columbias leak problem first surfaced on may 29 while the 
shuttle was being fueled for the first attempt to launch the 150 
million astro observatory after scrubbing the flight engineers 
thought the hydrogen leaked from a plumbing connector between the 
orbiter and its fuel tank 
hydrogen also was detected in the aft compartment william 
lenoir head of nasas space flight program said engineers 
concluded at the time that perhaps half that leak was drawn into 
the aft compartment and the other part went external 
he said engineers found no separate cause for the leak in the 
compartment which houses a maze of pipes valves and pumps but 
we could not conclusively say we did not have yet a second leak 
that was in the aft compartment 
on wednesday evening however engineers found the opposite to 
be true columbia had two leaks in may and only one had been 
fixed the one around the plumbing connection

thais and filipinos remain 
japan today announced an additional 12 million to help asian 
evacuees 
britain on thursday earmarked 38 million more in refugee aid 
prime minister margaret thatcher told the house of commons the

sweden denmark and norway have together pledged 14 million in 
relief aid finland has pledged 25 million and italy 34 million 
european community foreign ministers meeting in rome today

i think we are doing as much as we can the problem is what 
oxfam can do what any charitable organization can do is really 
not enough 
what really needs to happen is for governments to help people 
to get out of jordan out of the refugee camps ms feuchtwang 
said

president bush is appealing directly to the 
iraqi people for support to end the persian gulf crisis as he 
renews a blistering attack on their president and prepares for a 
weekend superpower summit 
we americans should make something very clear our argument 
is not with the people of iraq bush told a republican rally in 
tallahassee fla on thursday night rather it is with iraqs 
dictator who uses innocent travelers as shields who now in direct 
contravention of international law holds hostage civilians from 
many countries 
he said iraqi president saddam hussein must know that our 
policy will not be altered by this brazen blackmail and that 
the united states will maintain its military buildup in the region 
and enforcement of the international economic sanctions against 
iraq 
however bush told reporters traveling with him on a oneday 
political trip that he was glad for saddams offer of airtime to 
televise a message to the iraqi people 
the president called it a real opportunity he has 
previously voiced a desire to take his case to the iraqi people as 
saddam has done to americans with hours of his speeches and 
appearances broadcast live on us news programs 
white house officials said bush will tape a message of about 10 
minutes probably next wednesday after his address tuesday to a 
joint session of congress on the persian gulf situation 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said the white house would put 
together the tape and then have a state department translation 
made well do the whole thing ourselves he said in reference 
to the iraqi offer of a tv crew to travel to washington and 
interview bush 
iraqi ambassador mohamed almashat said that of course iraqi 
tv would air bushs message in its entirety without editing here 
you edit in iraq we do not edit 
bush will explain on the tape why the united states has sent 
thousands of troops and air and sea power to the gulf in the wake 
of iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait officials said 
the presidents statements thursday about having no quarrel with 
iraqis were reminiscent of the language he used in remarks about 
panama before the december us invasion to oust dictator manuel 
antonio noriega 
bush leaves tonight for helsinki finland to discuss the 
persian gulf and other matters with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev on sunday he also will press the soviet leader for a 
quick resolution to strategic arms reduction talks that have been 
going on for eight years 
preparing for the summit bush consulted thursday morning with 
syrian president hafez alassad turkish president turgut ozal 
french president francois mitterrand and west german chancellor 
helmut kohl fitzwater said 
the president also met thursday with israels visiting foreign 
minister david levy before embarking on a day of politicking in 
florida and kansas 
he used the political swing to issue a rallying cry for his 
middle east policy as well as raise money for republican candidates 
and praise ussoviet cooperation which he said can deepen with 
this sundays summit 
the world is united against this aggression by iraq bush 
told the florida rally for rep bill grant and im glad the 
soviet union is on our side on this one 
and there is no substitute for the support of the american 
people he said i need you support and i hope i have it as we 
continue to stand up against aggression in the middle east 
earlier he told a kansas luncheon for gov mike hayden that the 
united states will see through its goal of forcing saddam hussein 
out of kuwait 
there is nothing i want more than for our american servicemen 
and women to come home and they will once weve completed a 
mission that does right by america and the world bush said 
bushs trip thursday marked his first flight on the new air 
force one a specially equipped boeing 747 that replaced his aging 
boeing 707

gun control supporters are calling for a 
nationwide ban on bringing firearms within 1000 feet of schools 
but federal officials say it would be virtually impossible to 
enforce 
passage of this bill will enable our children and their 
teachers to travel to and from schools without an overriding 
fear for their personal safety cleveland police chief edward p 
kovacic said thursday 
he urged the house judiciary committees subcommittee on crime 
to approve the bill which is similar to provisions included in an 
omnibus crime package already approved by the senate 
bringing a gun within 1000 yards of a schoolyard would be 
punishable by a maximum fiveyear sentence under the measure 
the bill reflects growing concern over gun incidents on school 
grounds in recent years including multiple slayings of youngsters 
by deranged individuals in stockton calif and winnetka ill 
those incidents while celebrated are not isolated said 
rep edward f feighan dohio bills sponsor 
on thursday at the same time the congressional hearing was 
taking place an armed high school sophomore held nine classmates 
hostage for more than five hours at a school in cumming ga he 
surrendered after growing dizzy and no one was injured 
the bill would provide exceptions for weapons on private 
property licensed by the state after a background check of the 
owner unloaded and kept in a locked container in a vehicle or 
carried by a school guard 
concern that the bill could not be enforced however was 
expressed by richard cook chief of the firearms division in the 
treasury departments bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms he 
said the bureau has 1800 special agents nationwide to enforce 
scores of laws under its jurisdiction 
our firearms enforcement activities are focused on violent 
criminals and illegal drug traffickers he said 
as you can see from these numbers and the law enforcement 
demands placed upon us atf could not provide direct protection to 
all of the nations schools and could not be expected to be the 
first line of defense against guns and violence in schools cook 
added 
local police should take the lead in enforcing gun laws around 
schools with support from the bureau he said 
subcommittee chairman william j hughes dnj also expressed 
some doubts on whether the bureau would have sufficient agents to 
enforce such a measure 
were lucky if we can inspect a firearms dealer once in 15 
years at this point hughes said 
im just curious what this bill adds to your arsenal other 
than a lot of problems at this point said rep chuck douglas 
rnh he said the answer is a metal detector and not some law 
that cant be enforced anyway 
according to a report distributed at the hearing by the center 
to prevent handgun violence at least 71 people have been killed 
with guns at school nationwide over the last four years the report 
said six were employees and the rest were students 
the report said 201 individuals were severely wounded and 242 
held hostage at gunpoint it said gang disputes were responsible 
for 18 percent of gun violence in the schools romantic 
disagreements for 12 percent longstanding arguments for 15 
percent fights over material possessions for 10 percent and 
accidents for 13 percent

gordon humphrey who was unbeatable as a 
us senator may have trouble getting elected to the new hampshire 
senate 
the popular humphrey who opposes abortion faces state rep 
jack sherburne in tuesdays republican primary and some say an 
upset is a genuine possibility 
i think sherburne has a shot at this which is amazing 
says peg dobbie state director of the national abortion rights 
action league which supports the prochoice sherburne 
the election could go either way and likely will be decided 
by political and abortion activists if the turnout is as low as 
expected says republican executive councilor peter spaulding 
two years ago 4444 people voted in the republican primary 
sherburne believes at least 2000 more will vote because of the 
media attention given the race 
the republican incumbent william johnson who is prochoice is 
running for congress but humphrey 49 of chichester has the 
enormous advantage of nearly universal name recognition in the 
state after 12 years in washington in an unusual move he gave up 
almost certain reelection because he believes senators should be 
limited to two terms 
by contrast sherburne 67 a retired air force fighter pilot 
is little known outside his hometown of deerfield in 1970 he 
retired to his farm where he grows corn apples and christmas 
trees raises chickens and sells firewood 
he served 12 years as a selectman and eight in the legislature 
last year he championed an ethics bill opposed by republican 
legislative leaders 
humphrey is trying to cash in on his name recognition with bold 
blue and white campaign signs that read senator humphrey 
hes not particularly experienced in state politics but 
theres this idea that hes somehow more deserving as a us 
senator sherburne said 
we realized when we started that name recognition was going to 
be the big thing sherburne added were still out there 
fighting 
to combat humphreys advantage naral dobbies prochoice 
organization has set up a telephone bank to contact voters who 
havent heard of sherburne 
to counter spending by abortion rights forces humphrey 
spearheaded formation of an antiabortion political action 
committee heartbeat new hampshire it raised 24000 by early 
september all but 1000 from outofstate contributors humphrey 
said the group is contacting voters in other senate districts as 
well as his 
naral raised 20000 to spend on all races 5000 from out of 
state 
sherburne and humphrey each has raised about 14000 but 
humphrey unlike sherburne has refused to be bound by the 15000 
voluntary state spending limit for the primary saying late 
spending by abortionrights advocates could force him to respond 
sherburne has placed ads in weekly newspapers questioning why 
humphrey would give up a federal seat with a salary of 98400 to 
run for a 100ayear largely volunteer job 
why does he think we need a selfappointed savior from out of 
state the ad asks it then cites sherburnes service as a 
legislator and selectman and his position on abortion 
humphrey has said hed like to run for governor but not while 
his friend republican judd gregg holds the office he also says 
the states conservative character is being eroded and needs 
conservatives like himself to rebuild it 
while acknowledging that name recognition helps humphrey said 
hes taking nothing for granted 
hes campaigned everywhere from dumps on saturday mornings to 
judging a cowchip bingo contest for charity 
humphrey also is trying to capitalize on his skinflint 
reputation in the us senate to win support from unhappy property 
owners whove seen their taxes skyrocket in the past decade 
he proposes letting communities disregard some state regulations 
that add to property taxes and letting towns give tax credits to 
parents who send children to private schools 
sherburne agrees that property taxes can be eased by eliminating 
some education requirements but he said humphrey goes too far 
all he says is fight taxes thats too simplistic 
the mostly rural district is comprised of 14 small towns between 
concord and the densely populated seacoast 
voters interviewed at random in the district monday were more 
worried about the middle east crisis than the senate race many 
were unaware of the race and others were paying little attention 
to it the few who knew how they would vote cited personal ties 
rather than issues 
i think people are going to back jack because they know him i 
know hell listen i know i can get to him and that counts said 
deerfield librarian evelyn cronyn

a new corporation is promising to become the 
worlds largest oil spill cleanup operation 
marine spill response corp president john d costello announced 
thursday his company will spend an estimated 800 million over the 
next five years to set up and operate a system to clean up us 
waters and scour beaches around the atlantic and pacific oceans and 
the gulf of mexico as well as areas around outlying islands in the 
event of major oil spills 
the nonprofit company is to be funded by the oil industry but 
it will operate independently and spills will have to pay for its 
services costello said at a news conference 
the cost is three times the original estimate of a petroleum 
industry task force that set up the corporation 
costello said increases in the estimates were necessary to do 
the job 
the company plans to construct five regional centers in areas 
where major oil spills are most likely to occur the new yorknew 
jersey area port everglades fla north of miami lake charles 
la near the texas border port hueneme calif north of los 
angeles and seattle wash 
missing from the list is alaska where the nations worst spill 
occurred march 24 1989 costello said the vastly improved spill 
response capability in alaska is now greater than it will be at any 
of the corporations regional centers however he said marine 
spill response is negotiating to work out what role it might play 
in alaska 
in addition to the regional centers the corporation will have 
vessels at about nine other sites said costello a retired coast 
guard vice admiral 
were excited by the prospect of creating the worlds largest 
bestequipped and besttrained oil spill cleanup organization he 
said 
each regional center will have the ability to handle a spill 
roughly as large as the record 11milliongallon spill of crude oil 
from the exxon valdez in alaskas prince william sound he said 
regional centers can combine forces to handle even larger spills 
the corporation expects to spend 315 million on initial 
equipment including ships trucks booms skimmers dispersants 
and tools for dealing with wildlife and damaged shorelines 
the company with about 400 employees will administer spill 
response but will contract most of the work out to scores of other 
companies costello said 
the company was set up to fulfill the terms of federal oil spill 
legislation signed by president bush last month the law gives oil 
companies until february 1993 to show they can contain and clean up 
a worstcase oil spill 
costello said the new company would be fully operational by then 
and could provide some limited response even earlier 
the oil spill law also increased the liability of shippers from 
a ceiling of 150 per gross ton of the tanker to 1200 per gross 
ton 
costello said liability laws in some states should be changed to 
allow for a quick response to oil spills he said that although his 
company would have no problem because it is a nonprofit 
corporation its subcontractors might be inhibited

finnish police say they were caught off 
guard when they were told less than a week ago to prepare for 
sundays superpower summit but us and soviet security agencies 
have joined forces to help them 
police chief olli urponen said the summit while a surprise was 
made easier by the experience of other recent visits to helsinki by 
us and soviet leaders 
of course its been a great help to have worked with the 
americans and soviets before on similar occasions he said 
in 1988 finnish police worked with us secret service agents 
when president reagan made a brief stopover on his way to a moscow 
summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev eleven months ago 
they joined forces with gorbachevs kgb agents during the soviet 
leaders threeday official visit 
president gorbachevs visit and president reagans visit form 
a basis for the security arrangements of this summit urponen 
said but each event is absolutely its own and we have to 
make security arrangements accordingly 
on thursday soviet and us security agents met at the 
presidents palace site of sundays oneday summit meeting 
urponen said finnish american and soviet security agents have held 
several meetings during the week of summit preparations 
he refused to comment on details of the ussoviet security 
cooperation us and soviet summit advance team personnel refused 
to discuss questions related to the summit security arrangements 
seppo tiitinen chief of security police who is in charge of 
joint operations said there were no hierarchy problems and that 
finnish police would play the coordinating role 
no direct threats have been made against this summit there is 
no threat apart from the general threat of terrorism 
tiitinen said 
both urponen and tiitinen declined to speculate on whether 
finnish president mauno koivistos criticism of iraq on wednesday 
increased the danger of a terrorist attack 
koivisto in a presummit interview accused iraq of wasting 
natural resources on weapons for war instead of helping the poor 
it is unusual for a finnish president to speak out on such issues 
he said police officers cars and equipment had been called into 
use from other cities and all ablebodied helsinki police have been 
placed on duty for the weekend 
in 1975 35 world leaders met in the finnish capital to sign the 
helsinki final act of the conference on security and cooperation in 
europe urponen said the security job would be easier if police had 
the special powers finlands parliament granted them temporarily 
during that 1975 meeting 
the powers allowed police to stop people on the street and 
search houses if they suspected any danger for those attending the 
meeting 
the special powers were criticized on constitutional grounds 
they required a twothirds majority of finlands parliament which 
is not in session this week

soviet president mikhail gorbachev will not 
condone the use of force to solve the gulf crisis but probably 
would reluctantly look the other way if president bush decided 
that was the only answer sen alfonse damato says 
damato the new york republican made the prediction thursday 
a day after meeting with soviet leader 
damato has for weeks expressed doubt that the persian gulf 
crisis will be resolved without the use of force and has advocated 
the ouster of iraqi president saddam hussein by bombing him off 
the face of the earth 
damato was part of a sevenmember senate delegation that 
traveled to the middle east eastern europe and the soviet union 
the meeting with gorbachev and other soviet leaders covered a 
number of topics including the soviet unions economic future and 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait damato said 
i dont believe that were ever going to see the soviets call 
for the use of force unless extraordinary developments take 
place such as soviet hostagetaking of their citizens etc 
damato said however at a certain point in time if the 
president feels it is absolutely essential then gorbachev will 
reluctantly look the other way 
on the question of us aid damato said gorbachev mentioned 
his desire for mostfavored nation trading status and technical 
assistance from the united states 
however damato said sen connie mack rfla asked gorbachev 
how the united states could justify such assistance when the 
soviets are sending 3 billion to 5 billion a year to cuba and 
billions more to vietnam 
he gorbachev said our relations are undergoing change 
cuba afghanistan vietnam damato recalled he said in the 
future we will be talking about trade and considering financial aid 
within the context of trade not aid 
boris yeltsin president of the russian republic was even more 
direct damato said 
he said there is no way that we can or should be providing 
economic aid to other countries when we are in such dire straits 
gorbachev has condemned iraqs invasion and annexation of kuwait 
and cut off soviet arms shipments to iraq but he has balked at 
joining a naval blockade to enforce a un economic embargo on iraq

the 265th quartermaster detachment of the south 
carolina national guard is one of the reserve units called up for 
possible duty in saudi arabia national writer fred bayles is 
following the 14 guardsmen as they prepare for deployment overseas 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the soldiers manual of common tasks 
is the armys camouflagecovered bible a compendium of instruction 
on everything from digging a foxhole to knocking out a tank 
while it doesnt offer much in the way of plot it is the book 
the 265th quartermaster detachment is reading these days 
it is studied while waiting for chow while resting in the 
barracks while riding in the canvasbacked pickup trucks 
the 14 members of the south carolina national guard water 
purification unit are studying hard for their final exam 
deployment to the mideast 
no one seems to mind the homework 
im glad for the training said spec bobby youmans 29 
you cant give me too much the more we train the more were 
ready 
all this education suits youmans an officer at the allendale 
correctional facility who has been in the guard 11 years 
youmans has been to several national guard schools studying 
things like field telephone systems and refrigeration 
im a jackofalltrades and a master of none he said 
his education is just part of the benefits of his guard 
membership he not only learns a trade he is paid for attending 
the school 
before his callup he planned to go to college with the help of 
the guards college program 
you have to take advantage of what you can to improve 
yourself he said 
for now selfimprovement takes the form of classes in radio 
operations compass reading chemical warfare and small arms 
even the classes location fits the curriculum the men spend 
the afternoon in the humid heat of an open field to prepare bodies 
for desert temperatures 
the first aid class is working on a lifesize rubber mannequin 
with moveable simulated wounds rubberized arms and legs are 
swathed in different combinations of dressings and gauze as the 
instructor offers comment 
keep talking to him he says referring to the dummy tell 
him hes going to be all right get him mad tell him if he doesnt 
make it youre going to get to know his girlfriend you want to 
get him angry 
but make sure you get his m16 and pistol first says sgt 
hullie cohen 
the instructor tells a first aid story about his basic training 
when a soldier threw himself out a high window the man survived 
with cuts and a broken leg instead of getting a discharge the man 
was sent through basic again 
the commander said he didnt want to lose anybody crazy enough 
to jump out a third floor window the instructor explains 
further down the field another squad of men strip down their new 
m16 rifles the men sweat heavily and the instructor stops class 
often for the men to drink from canteens another lesson harped on 
constantly 
as has happened throughout the day the instructor suddenly 
calls gas and the men drop the weapons and pull on gas masks 
next comes a field problem how do the men know when its safe 
to take the masks off 
use your m256 say the men referring to a small test kit 
that detects poison gas 
you dont have one says the instructor 
you ask for a volunteer says sgt bill bostick reciting 
the next step 
before you ask for a volunteer you better make sure your 
weapon is locked and loaded so if the man you ask to volunteer 
doesnt want to you can shoot him said the instructor it 
sounds hard but youve got to think of the rest of the unit 
so bostick a brick mason asks henry harris the retired 
school teacher to volunteer harris tentatively unseals there is 
of course nothing wrong with the air other than a swarm of gnats 
the men practice waiting the prescribed 10 minutes and when 
harris doesnt fall over they too remove their masks 
well make sure we got plenty m256s bostick tells harris

poland has at least as strong a claim for 
forgiveness of its us debts as egypt which president bush wants 
to reward for its help in the persian gulf a senior member of 
congress contends 
the poles are throwing off the shackles of communism imposed 
with us acquiescence after world war ii said rep david obey 
dwis they are suffering hardship while they seek to establish a 
market economy a reform whose success is crucial to the outcome of 
eastern europes dramatic changes 
before going along with bushs plan to let egypt off the hook 
for 7 billion in past military loans i want to know whats 
happening with respect to poland which owes the united states 
some 3 billion obey said in an interview 
analysts say other countries are lining up for similar treatment 
at a time when wiping away debts even uncollectable ones will 
make more difficult the task of struggling us budget negotiators 
in reality everyone else who owes money already is calling 
for similar treatment said robert hunter an analyst at the 
center for strategic and international studies 
lawmakers fear opening a door they may not be able to close 
again quickly and the white house has yet to offer a detailed 
explanation of why egypt deserves help that should be denied to 
other allies 
i am not about to support at this point making a single 
exception for one country without knowing what the rest of the game 
plan is going to be said obey whose appropriations foreign aid 
subcommittee will be a central player in the debate over forgiving 
egypts debt 
of the total official foreign debt owed the united states 
nearly 20 billion is for past sales of military equipment 
much of that amount also is owed by countries who can claim 
that like egypt they have bee helpful in the persian gulf crisis 
or have crippling debt burdens others might make the claim on a 
simple me too basis 
i want to know the administrations plans with respect to 
israel and to pakistan obey said naming some of those 
considered most likely to line up behind egypt 
sen patrick leahy obeys senate counterpart named turkey 
greece morocco and the philippines as other major debtors that 
might seek relief and expressed alarm over the lack of a clear 
policy from the administration 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater has asserted that egypt 
is a special case and its not open season on this kind of 
request but there has been no detailed public explanation to 
back up that assertion 
egypt is the largest single debtor in the category of us 
military loans with an outstanding debt of 67 billion 
second on the list is israel which has 4 billion in 
unrefinanced debt an additional 45 billion in highinterest 
military loans was recently refinanced under a program that offered 
us guarantees and yielded an immediate saving to israel of about 
18 billion 
other top military debtors include turkey which owes 34 
billion a portion of which has been refinanced greece 19 
billion and pakistan 13 billion further down the list is 
jordan which could argue that economic hardship stemming from the 
un trade embargo with iraq could justify forgiving its nearly 
400 million in military debt 
and there is no reason the list will stop at those who owe the 
united states for past weapons purchases polands debt is 
primarily for food purchases from the united states and obey has 
included in the emerging 1991 foreign aid bill a provision that 
would let bush forgive most of it 
carrying the loans on the books means some countries take the 
aid they receive from the united states intended to help build 
their economies and in effect sign the checks back over to the 
treasury in repayment of their debts 
egypt for example owes principal and interest totalling more 
than 1 billion this year more than the 815 million in economic 
aid it got from the united states the situation says obey is an 
absurdity

the us allies who depend on saudi arabian 
oil must realize that sending more than 100000 us military men 
and women to the persian gulf is no free lunch defense 
secretary dick cheney says 
we need to have some of our friends step up to the counter and 
contribute more than some of them have indicated that they are 
prepared to contribute cheney said thursday 
the pentagon chiefs blunt remarks came as secretary of state 
james a baker iii and treasury secretary nicholas brady continued 
their global search for cash to help pay for operation desert 
shield 
cheney in a speech to the institute for strategic studies in 
hot springs va chided those nations whose economies benefit from 
the guarantee of a free flow of oil but havent offered to help 
foot the bill 
theres no free lunch here he said 
except for lauding the military contributions of britain 
france and the arab nations who have come to saudi arabias 
defense cheney mentioned no nations by name 
key arab allies are planning to boost their forces the 
washington post reported in todays editions 
the newspaper quoting unidentified officials in saudi arabia 
and washington said egypt had agreed to expand its force of 2000 
soldiers to 30000 and syria had separately agreed to boost its 
3200man contingent by 20000 
cheney cited ample opportunities to help such as sending 
troops aiding the transportation of troops or refugees or even 
offering economic assistance to nations such as jordan or turkey 
that have been economically strapped by the un trade embargo 
against iraq 
in his first public comment about the numbers involved in the 
us buildup cheney said there are more than 100000 us armed 
forces in the persian gulf region 
but is too soon as yet to halt the flow of troops and 
weaponry he added 
since us forces were dispatched to saudi arabia and gulf 
waters after iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 pentagon 
officials have been publicly silent about the exact number of 
forces or weaponry 
however it had been widely reported that some 60000 ground 
troops and airmen had reached saudi soil while tens of thousands 
of sailors were on the dozens of us navy ships in the persian 
gulf and the red sea 
the worst sin of all would be for us to deploy forces out 
there sufficient enough to get into trouble but not strong enough 
to deal with any eventuality that may arise cheney said 
he said the us deployment of ground troops had reached a 
significant size since the heavy tanks of the armys 24th 
infantry division mechanized and two marine expeditionary 
brigades had joined elements of the 82nd and the 101st airborne 
divisions 
members of the 1st cavalry division from fort hood texas were 
on their way as well cheney said

the leader of the nations largest black 
church says racism in america is worse now than it was during the 
civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 60s 
former president reagan and his appointments to the supreme 
court are a large part of the problem the rev tj jemison said 
thursday at the 110th annual meeting of the national baptist 
convention usa inc 
he reagan will be remembered not because he didnt have a 
memory but he will be remembered because he gave respectability to 
racism he said 
jemison who led one of the first successful boycotts of 
segregated busing in baton rouge la in 1953 said race relations 
stand at a criticial point in the nations history 
he said he thought the battle to condemn racism had been won 
during the civil rights struggle but its worse now than its 
ever been 
in his presidential address jemison also called for a 
negotiated settlement to the crisis in the persian gulf 
he said that while he supported president bushs decison to send 
troops to the middle east this convention does not condone war 
that takes the lives of our best young men and women black and 
white because of oil 
the convention was expected to act today on a resolution on the 
gulf crisis 
with 78 million members the baptist convention is not only the 
nations largest black church body but claims to be the largest 
black organization in the world 
in the highly hierarchical convention the presidential address 
offers a blueprint of where the denomination stands on social 
issues 
the baptist leader singled out reagans appointments to the 
supreme court for criticism saying blacks will feel the impact of 
his conservative movement for three decades 
they call themselves strict constructionists but i call them 
strict segregationists jemison said 
addressing internal church issues jemison appealed to national 
baptists to support their own institutions including the 10 
million world baptist center the center has caused some grumbling 
about whether the denomination is more concerned with architectural 
monuments than the social needs of black americans 
jemison said there must be fewer pastors and churches dropping 
only 100 in the conventions bucket 
isnt that a disgrace jemison said as he urged the 11000 
delegates to give more to both church programs and the world center 
in nashville the first headquarters building for the denomination 
but the emphasis on fundraising for the center rankled some 
delegates 
delegate al lipscomb of dallas said in an interview thursday the 
center is a tower of babel that reflects the denominations 
lack of a social agenda 
this really saddens me to see 10 million in the glorification 
of a center versus all the nation crying out for help lipscomb 
said

members of congress 
bringing words of support to us troops in the saudi desert are 
seeking more support from americas allies for the military action 
several members of the 11man delegation urged allies thursday 
to send troops to join the americans on saudi soil and to help pay 
the costs of the continuing american buildup 
the delegations visit was to continue today with stops at 
several other units before an evening flight to jiddah for a 
meeting with saudi king fahd 
saudi arabia on thursday pledged billions to underwrite us 
military operations in the arabian desert but european allies have 
yet to field ground troops in the region 
im dissatisfied with the lack of burdensharing generally so 
far rep les aucoin dore said thursday during a visit with 
the 82nd airborne divisions 1st brigade in the saudi desert my 
constituents are looking for goodfaith efforts on the part of our 
allies 
echoing that theme was rep bill hefner dnc who said he 
expected more european allies to support the saudi defense effort 
because they depend far more on energy supplies from this area 
than we do 
for the troops the delegation brought promises that congress 
and the american people support the deployment 
you have averted a war to this point rep john murtha 
dpa chairman of the house defense appropriations subcommittee 
told the paratroopers i dont know if you will down the road but 
you have to this point 
several lawmakers said they came away from military briefings 
with the impression iraqs saddam hussein would be foolish to 
attack saudi arabia because of the growing american force 
i think that every day that goes by the risk of a shooting war 
is less and less hefner said 
murtha concurred but added the caution 
anytime you have a potential enemy as fanatical as saddam 
hussein is you have to believe there could be a war he said 
but if he has any professional ability at all he will see that 
he will pay a high price 
murtha said he envisioned a long us military presence in the 
region if saddam stays in power as part of any resolution of the 
current crisis 
we would have to have a substantial presence in the middle 
east murtha said 
he said it was unclear whether us forces would be invited to 
remain on saudi soil but added i dont think the saudis will 
want us to leave any time in the near future 
for now he said the us deployment was openended and has 
the support of congress and the american people 
several members of the delegation said the middle east crisis 
would force a rethinking of american defense policy to respond to 
the first major military challenge of the postcold war era 
they said expensive missile systems are likely to face cuts and 
more will be spent on faster sealift and air transport capacity 
manpower cuts also will be deferred the lawmakers said 
were going to have to shift some priorities said hefner

the militarys command schools are preparing 
officers for conflicts such as the persian gulf crisis by teaching 
the hard lessons once learned in vietnam 
military educators told a congressional panel on thursday that 
from the marine corps classrooms in quantico va to the air 
forces school in maxwell field ala officers are taught that the 
focus is no longer on a superpower showdown 
its not the world environment in which we live brig gen 
john miller deputy commandant of the us army command and general 
staff college told the house armed services subcommittee on 
professional military education 
it was an obvious acknowledgment of the us invasion of panama 
in december and the current massing of troops in saudi arabia to 
thwart iraqi aggression 
students also are exposed to the painful lessons from the 
vietnam war and the rancorous issues that emerged from that 
conflict including the massacre at my lai inflated body counts 
and unauthorized bombings 
the good the bad and the ugly said brig gen phillip j 
ford commandant of the air command and staff college 
miller said many of the instructors are vietnam war veterans who 
saw battles from the company to the command level 
we bring to our task of educating tomorrows leaders the 
realization that we did not fully understand the essential linkages 
between a clear statement of national objectives the development 
of a national strategy a military strategy and an operational 
campaign level miller said 
we have no intention of watching that happen again he said 
capt elizabeth wylie dean of academics at the naval war 
college in rhode island said the goal was not to have a school 
solution but a lively discussion 
during the past academic year a policy and strategy symposium 
at the marine corps facility included presentations from gen 
william westmoreland the former us commander during the vietnam 
war and roger hilsman a top official in the kennedy 
administration who argued against us involvement in vietnam 
among the titles on the reading list for marine corps officers 
are a bright shining lie neil sheehans account of the life 
of john paul vann an acclaimed military leader in vietnam and 
stanley karnows bestseller vietnam a history 
the books detail both the united states successes and failures 
in southeast asia 
were obligated to provide varying points of view its left 
for students to draw personal lessons said col david a vetter 
director of the marine corps command and staff college 
military educators noted that most of their students have never 
been in a war and from a historic perspective the most recent 
lengthy conflict they recall is the vietnam war 
the hearing chaired by rep ike skelton dmo was prompted by 
his conversations with military officials in which he learned that 
the indian wars werent being taught to students at fort 
leavenworth 
skelton said he was pleased to hear that the service colleges 
were taking low and midintensity conflicts seriously as well 
as addressing the thorny issues from the vietnam war 
however he expressed dismay that none of the schools had 
invited retired col david hackworth to speak the highly decorated 
soldier recently wrote a book harshly critical of the us role in 
vietnam

if war erupts in the persian 
gulf a us marine general says american air power could quickly 
smash iraqs defenses 
maj gen royal n moore jr said thursday that the stronger 
technologically superior us and arab forces arrayed in saudi 
arabia along the border with iraq would ultimately triumph over an 
offensive by saddam husseins army 
we want about three to five minutes and were going to give 
them the most violent three to five minutes theyve ever seen 
said moore speaking to reporters at a display of marine corps 
aircraft thats all we want 
earlier thursday saudi arabias defense minister prince 
sultan was quoted as warning iraq that if saddam carried out his 
threat to use chemical weapons saudis would respond with 
lethal chinesemade css2 ballistic missiles that can hit 
anywhere in iraq 
although president bush said aug 5 that iraqs armed takeover 
of kuwait aug 2 will not stand senior us officers have 
carefully avoided suggesting that any offensive is planned 
they stress that us forces are in saudi arabia only to protect 
it from further aggression 
but should war break out moore said his strategy would be to 
immediately gain air superiority by destroying iraqs antiaircraft 
guns missile batteries and air force within hours 
iraqis air defenses are lined up fairly heavy on the coast 
he conceded 
but said moore theres always a back door you cant defend 
everything thus he said the multinational force would aim for 
iraqs vulnerable points 
us and allied air strength in the region including 
carrierbased aircraft and other superior us and british 
artillery is well in excess of 700 iraq has an estimated 500plus 
combat aircraft 
moore described a classic operation in which marine air strikes 
naval gunfire and artillery would soften up a target 
assault troops would then move in by helicopter go around it 
or over it or come in with the amphibious landing deploying 
assault troops from seaborne transports 
the country and the area of operations are so small that itll 
be easy for me to cover any amphibious landing that we desire 
to make he said 
but moore who commands the 3rd marine air wing at el toro 
calif conceded that the struggle for air supremacy probably would 
cause casualties on the us side 
im not going to ever predict that its going to be a 
cakewalk moore said if we do it right the casualties will be 
light we hope 
he said that even if the us forces seized control of the 
skies the final struggle likely would be on the ground 
im not saying that all that airs going to win it said 
moore air cant do everything its the tankontank that 
probably cleans it all up 
moore declined to say whether the allied forces were strong 
enough yet to seize kuwait back from the iraqis 
but he said that if the force level continues there will be a 
period in time that we have enough combat power on the ground to do 
that 
moore said trolling probes by us reconnaissance planes had 
revealed a formidable array of iraqi antiaircraft defenses along 
the coast to the north of the troops location 
the iraqis have set their sovietmade sa2 and sa3 missiles to 
track us aircraft at 80100 miles off the coast the sa2s have a 
range of about 11 miles and the sa3s eight miles

secretary of state james a baker iii issued a 
comprehensive statement on the persian gulf crisis the other day 
that barely mentioned american hostages in kuwait and iraq 
in a curious way baker was speaking volumes about bush 
administration policy on the issue american hostages are not going 
to be an obsession of this administration in contrast with its 
predecessors 
hostage crises produced the darkest hours for the last two 
presidents of ronald reagans eight years in office none was more 
trying than the late 198687 period when his efforts to obtain the 
release of the american hostages in lebanon degenerated into the 
irancontra affair 
president bush and baker both top lieutenants of reagan had 
birds eye views of the political costs of the blunders reagan 
committed in his eagerness to get the hostages home 
and memories are still fresh of how president carter was 
virtually chained to the white house for months on end in 197980 
trying to devise a strategy for liberating the 52 american hostages 
in iran in his reelection bid carter carried six states 
some might say the current administration is being coldhearted 
in not giving the americans in kuwait and iraq its highest 
priority after all there are about 50 times more americans held 
on saddam husseins turf than there were in tehran a decade ago 
but that ignores the efforts the administration has made on 
behalf of the hostages many of which have received little 
attention the us embassy in iraq makes daily appeals to the 
iraqi foreign ministry for their release the main reason the 
american embassy in kuwait remains open under appalling 
conditions in defiance of iraqi orders is so that us diplomats 
there can try to help the 2200 or so americans trapped in kuwait 
there are also tales of american diplomats loitering sometimes 
for days on end at the iraqi border with turkey jordan or saudi 
arabia awaiting the possibility that a stray american in need of 
assistance might turn up when an american appeared at the saudi 
border the other day she was received by a lonesome us diplomat 
who had been staked out there for eight days 
but there is a distinct 
letsdoitdifferentlyfromcarterandreagan image being 
projected by the administration concerning this hostage crisis 
bush refuses to allow the dustup to imprison him in the white 
house he spent much of august frolicking at his maine vacation 
retreat baker has spent part of the crisis at his wyoming ranch 
receiving from a london newspaper the sobriquet the invisible 
man 
the families of some hostages object to what they regard as the 
cavalier attitude of bush and baker toward the captives 
if it was the presidents son he would not go on vacation 
said florence culbertson wife of a former hostage who returned to 
his texas home this week 
the administration is operating under the assumption that the 
best way to obtain freedom for the hostages is to devalue them 
make their captors believe they will gain nothing by continuing to 
hold them 
bush said last week he will not be deterred from taking military 
action by iraqi threats to the hostages baker spoke in a similar 
vein this week to the house foreign affairs committee 
we stand at a critical juncture in our history baker said 
calling the iraqi invasion of kuwait one of the defining moments 
of a new era 
decisive action he said is required to confront a dictator 
who acting alone and unchallenged could strangle the global 
economic order determining by fiat whether we all enter a 
recession or even the darkness of a depression 
bakers between the lines message is that this worstcase 
scenario could come about if the fate of the hostages and not 
national security interests becomes the issue that drives us 
policy

three leftist radicals could receive 15year 
sentences under a deal with prosecutors in which they agreed to 
admit participating in a conspiracy to bomb the us capitol and 
seven other locations 
marilyn j buck linda s evans and laura j whitehorn are 
scheduled to appear today in us district court to plead guilty to 
participating in a twoyear conspiracy of armed propaganda to 
detonate bombs in government buildings and private offices 
according to court documents 
prosecutors have agreed to drop charges against three 
codefendants according to court papers 
the three women also agreed to plead guilty to setting of a bomb 
that blew a hole in a wall outside the us senate chamber late 
nov 7 1983 
the conspiracy count carries a fiveyear prison term while the 
charge of causing malicious damage to the capitol carries a maximum 
10year term 
the blast which occurred after congress had recessed for the 
night damaged five paintings and blew the door off its hinges 
outside the office of democratic leader robert byrd 
none of the bombings in new york and washington between 1983 and 
1985 caused any injuries 
the group calling itself the armed resistance unit the 
revolutionary fighting group or the red guerrilla resistance 
claimed responsibility for the bombings in communiques to news 
organizations 
the underground organization is linked to a series of other 
crimes including the 16 million armed holdup of an armored car 
near nyack ny in 1981 in which two policemen and a guard were 
killed 
buck 42 is serving a 50year prison sentence for participating 
in the armed holdup and four others she was also convicted of 
racketeering for helping convicted murderer joanne chesimard escape 
from a new jersey state prison in 1979 
evans 43 is already serving a 40year prison term for 
illegally purchasing firearms 
whitehorn 45 the only defendant not already serving another 
prison term could face an additional fiveyear sentence if she 
pleads guilty to fraud in connection with possession of fake 
identification documents 
the plea agreement signed by the defendants and prosecutors said 
the government will dismiss charges against timothy blunk susan 
rosenberg and alan berkman 
attorneys familiar with the case said that a supreme court 
ruling on the issue of double jeopardy that was issued in may 
influenced the governments decision to drop the case against 
blunk rosenberg and berkman 
another factor was the lengthy sentences being served by all but 
one of the six defendants said the attorneys who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
blunk 33 and rosenberg 34 are serving 58year sentences for 
possessing a 600pound arsenal of dynamite blasting caps and 
other explosives berkman a physician is serving a 10year 
sentence for possession of explosives firearms and fake

the financial performance of banks in the 
midwest south and west showed improvement in the second quarter 
while loan problems continued to grow in the northeast and 
southeast government figures show 
nationwide commercial banks earned 53 billion from april 
through june of this year down 24 percent from the same period in 
1989 the federal deposit insurance corp reported thursday 
the fdic said banks in the northeast dragged down profits for 
the entire industry which had earned a record 7 billion in the 
second quarter of 1989 
its not great but its not terrible said robert litan a 
senior fellow at the brookings institution a washington research 
group its continued sogginess basically 
at a news conference fdic chairman l william seidman said the 
latest banking results are very much a mixed bag banks in the 
west appear strong while new england is having a real 
recession he said 
seidman conceded that the outlook for banks and the economy has 
been complicated by the persian gulf crisis and the resulting 
increase in oil prices 
higher oil prices should help texas and the southwest but that 
certainly is not going to be helpful to new england he said 
theyre making a bad situation worse for a lot of banks that 
already had problems litan said noting that the inflationary 
effect of rising oil prices tends to make banks more cautious about 
making new loans 
banks in the northeast had a total net income of 1026 billion 
in the second quarter down a steep 629 percent from the same 
period last year 
real estate values have fallen sharply in the region nearly all 
of the banking industrys 2 billion increase in provisions against 
future loan losses was accounted for by banks in the northeast 
where those provisions rose by 19 billion 
that was more than twice the amount set aside for future losses 
by northeast banks in the second quarter of 1989 the fdic said 
the real estate problems of the northeast have spread to the 
midatlantic states and signs of real estate weakness have 
appeared in several southeastern states the agency said 
banks in maryland georgia and the district of columbia showed a 
sharp increase in delinquent real estate loans during the quarter 
the fdic said banks in 22 other states had some rise in the 
delinquency rate of those loans 
six states registered a strong decline in delinquent real estate 
loans utah illinois wyoming kansas montana and north dakota 
eighteen others showed some decrease 
most of the growth in real estate loans overall came from banks 
in the west where they increased 725 percent during the second 
quarter home mortgages in california banks which jumped more 
than 5 billion or 11 percent accounted for most of the growth 
in real estate loans in the west 
construction loans by western banks rose by almost 1 billion 
during the period including 881 million in california while they 
decreased overall for the industry 
despite the progress in some regions the quality of the 
banking industrys real estate loans is continuing to decline 
the fdic said nationwide delinquent real estate loans increased 
by 32 billion in the second quarter a rise of 13 percent from a 
year earlier 
most of the latest increase 305 billion came from banks in 
the northeast 
analysts have said it would take a downturn at only a few large 
commercial banks to cause trouble for the deposit insurance fund 
which posted losses in 1988 and 1989 even if most of the industry 
is healthy 
separately the office of thrift supervision reported last week 
that the financial conditions of more than 200 savings and loans 
have worsened since the agency made its last report in may at 
least 246 sampls are expected to fail and are likely candidates for 
government takeover the office said

outspoken in the face of indifference to their struggle for 
equality says lt gov martha griffiths who complained loudly 
about being pushed off the democratic ticket in michigan 
women are too modest and too quiet griffiths told the 
national press club its partly their own fault that they dont 
get promoted they should be indispensable they should be so good 
at the job that you cant get anybody else 
the former state legislator and congresswoman sponsored the 
equal rights amendment and an amendment to the 1964 civil rights 
act that outlawed discrimination on the basis of sex as well as 
race 
her appearance came in the wake of gov james blanchards 
decision last month against retaining griffiths as his running mate 
in his campaign for a third term 
blanchard a democrat said he needed someone who could assume 
his job at a moments notice he said griffiths 78 had declined 
to release her medical records 
she reacted bitterly to the decision but said thursday she would 
support blanchards reelection because he has been a good 
governor and i know the other guy a reference to gop nominee

percent against once a summary of the measure was read to all 
those polled the measure led 58 percent to 26 percent 
the measure would phase out pesticides linked to cancer ban oil 
drilling in state waters curb ocean pollution mandate big cuts in 
greenhouse gases and raise 200 million to save oldgrowth

president bush and his wife barbara will fly 
to the superpower summit in helsinki tonight aboard the new air 
force one jumbo jet that a delighted president calls marvelous in 
every way 
bush took his maiden flight thursday in the gleaming regally 
appointed boeing 747 that replaced an 18yearold boeing 707 that 
had carried every president since richard nixon 
on crosscountry hops to political rallies in topeka kan and 
tallahassee fla bush pronounced himself well pleased with the 
whaleshaped aircraft one of two jumbos that congress and 
president reagan commissioned in 1986 at a cost of more than a 
quarterbillion dollars 
it can fly 7140 miles without refueling 1400 miles farther 
than the old air force one and could even be refueled aloft in a 
pinch 
have plane will travel the peripatetic president quipped 
when reporters jokingly asked if he planned any day trips to the 
persian gulf to visit us troops 
its marvelous in every way the latest in technology and 
certainly very very comfortable bush said after getting his 
first look inside the jet it is painted in the same striking 
colors of white royal blue and robins egg blue with a gold stripe 
that john f kennedy chose for the first presidential jet 28 years 
ago 
kennedys plane until now has still been used as the backup to 
the regular air force one when a second jumbo jet is delivered by 
next june both the 707s will be relegated to ferrying lesser 
government vips 
the creature comforts range from a showerequipped presidential 
lavatory to an airborne office with a large wooden desk to a fully 
decked conference room that could accommodate more than half the 
cabinet 
bush and his wife will share a cabin in the nose of the plane 
decorated in soothing wood tones with hisandhers leather 
armchairs and twin sofas that fold out into twin beds an 
upholstered wall mural depicts a rustic sunset in soft hues 
theres even a medical room where the white house physician 
could perform emergency surgery atop a stretcher that latches onto 
a reclining chair 
there are televisions galore 85 telephones computers memory 
typewriters facsimile machines a paper shredder two galleys with 
ovens and microwaves and enough freezer space to feed almost 100 
people for a week 
the new plane boasts separate cabins for guests bushs senior 
staff and other aides as well as for secret service agents and 
media representatives 
the jumbo seats 70 passengers and 23 crew members half again as 
many as the old plane it can carry a media pool of 13 members two 
more than before 
the passengers on the maiden flight had nine movies to choose 
from viewed on overhead televisions with the sound over stereo 
headsets thursdays offerings included indiana jones and the 
last crusade and young einstein 
veteran flight attendant becky schulz said it will be more work 
running around the larger plane but a lot less stress 
you wont be stepping over peoples feet all the time she

the food and drug administration is targeting 
six companies for its first action to enforce a policy barring food 
makers from labeling their products with cholesterollowering 
claims 
in letters to the six released thursday the agency said the 
claims for bran products are not backed by scientific evidence and 
must be removed from the product labels 
the foodlabeling policy proposed last february but being 
enforced as an interim rule until one is formally adopted allows 
companies to make only limited health claims about their products 
linking brans dietary fiber to lower cholesterol is not among 
the permitted claims but an official of one of the companies 
warned says the claim is scientifically legitimate 
we feel the excellent studies that have been done more than 
qualify these products to make cholesterollowering claims said 
curt rocca chairman of pacific rice products of woodland calif 
officials of his company plan to discuss the studies with the 
fda in hopes of persuading the agency to allow claims that eating 
vita fiber rice bran daily can reduce cholesterol levels in the 
blood 
in its letter to pacific rice the fda said the claims were 
false and misleading in that they are not supported by the 
1988 surgeon generals report on nutrition and health and the 1989 
national academy of sciences report on diet and health 
similar warning letters were sent to ralston purina co of st 
louis for oat chex cereal and continental baking co of st 
louis for oatmeal goodness bread wheat oatmeal 
letters also went to j amp j snack foods corp of vernon calif 
for toasted oat bran shake health valley foods inc of 
irwindale calif for oat bran fruit jumbo cookies and select 
origins inc of yaphank ny for rice bran oil 
in its letter to ralston purina the fda said labeling of oat 
chex was false and misleading because the claims suggest 
that a serving of the product provides a nutritionally significant 
amount of fiber and particularly soluble fiber which is contrary 
to fact 
patrick farrell spokesman for ralston and continental baking a 
ralston subsidiary said its our belief that all of our 
products comply with regulations concerning label requirements 
the companies have 10 days to respond to the fdas warning 
the fdas draft policy allows specific health messages on 
products if they fall within a narrow range of claims regarding 
relationships between diet and health benefits that are outlined in 
the recent reports by the us surgeon general and the national 
academy of sciences 
those areas have been limited to calcium and osteoporosis 
sodium and hypertension fats and cardiovascular disease fats and 
cancer dietary fiber and cancer and fiber and cardiovascular 
disease 
the fda had said that if other links between diet and health are 
scientifically shown they could be added to the list 
because there have been conflicting scientific reports as to 
whether dietary fiber reduces cholesterol the fda is not allowing 
that claim to be made on food products 
the fda told the companies that if corrective action is not 
taken it could seek court action to remove the products from 
stores

in some cities a college football fan might 
have access to a dozen televised games on a saturday the federal 
trade commission doesnt think thats enough 
asserting that television viewers arent getting a full 
selection of games because of restraints on competition the ftc 
said thursday it will try to change the system 
the college football association and capital cities which owns 
abc and espn are unhappy about it and are set to fight the ftcs 
administrative complaint 
we want to have the marketplace determine what games are 
shown and when said kevin arquit director of the ftc bureau of 
competition 
we think the system is operating to the benefit of 
consumers said lewis engman the cfas lawyer and former ftc 
chairman cfa is not a cartel we are not interested in 
restricting output we are trying to get more and more games on 
tv 
the cfa was created as a bargaining agent for the major football 
schools and began marketing games in 1984 after the us supreme 
court ruled that the ncaa violated antitrust law by selling 
national tv contracts for the games 
but arquit said the current system with the cfa negotiating a 
network contract for its 64 member schools is not in the best 
interests of consumers schools or television networks 
he argued that the supreme court ruled that restrictions arent 
necessary and the same reasoning holds for the cfa practices but 
engman said the circumstances are different because the ncaa would 
not let individual schools sell television rights to their games 
and the cfa does 
thats a far cry from the present situation engman said 
every cfa member school has the right to sell every one of its 
games if it wishes 
notre dame for instance sold rights to its home games 
beginning in 1991 to nbc eliminating those games from the cfaabc 
package that is to start next season 
engman called the proceeding a royal waste of taxpayers 
money im not aware of anyone complaining that theres not enough 
football on television he said any cfa member can sell 
television rights to its games to local cable or syndicated 
stations 
but schools cant sell to national networks or on cable to 
espn which is 80 percent owned by capital cities and with which 
the cfa also has an exclusive deal stations that purchase games on 
their own may not show them late saturday afternoon when the 
network is showing the game to which it has exclusive rights 
arquit said the ftc also is concerned about contractual limits 
on the number of times certain schools can appear on television 
an administrative law judge will rule on the allegations of 
anticompetitive practices after a hearing nov 13 the decision 
can be appealed to the five ftc commissioners and ultimately to the 
us court of appeals 
this years contracts will not be affected 
if the ftc charges are upheld arquit said existing contracts 
could be rescinded and future anticompetitive contracts would be 
barred asked if each school would have to negotiate tv contracts 
on its own in that case arquit said he didnt know 
in a statement abc sports said the arrangement with cfa is 
entirely lawful and in the public interest the agreement is 
designed to offer a broad selection of college football games to 
the widest possible audience the number and quality of games 
available to viewers will benefit viewers advertisers and college 
football 
right now abc has a contract with the big ten and pacific10 
which are not part of the cfa the cfas 64million fouryear 
contract with cbs expires after this season and abc has a 
fiveyear 210 million deal with the organization 
arquit said the ftcs investigation began two years ago but 
refused to say what triggered it usually such probes are spurred 
by a consumer complaint or a congressional inquiry engman said no 
cfa member had complained and said he did not believe any networks 
had approached the ftc

against subway robbers is memorialized with graffiti in a 
schoolyard where the teenager accused of stabbing him once taught 
youngsters handball 
the name brian watkins spraypainted in bright red orange 
purple and blue towers over the courtyard behind junior high 
school 189 in the citys queens borough 
i gave that tribute to him said papo love i feel sorry 
for him because he lost his life for defending his mom 
love and other youths who knew murder suspect yull gary morales 
19 of queens gathered by the decorated wall thursday and talked 
about the penalty morales should face if convicted of seconddegree 
murder 
police say morales alleged that watkins ran into his knife 
sunday night in a manhattan subway station after his father was 
robbed of 200 and his mother was knocked to the ground watkins 
22 fought back and was stabbed 
morales known as rocstar on the street and seven other 
youths were charged monday with killing watkins as they tried to 
raise money to go dancing 
next to loves tribute to watkins someone spray painted 
rocstar be cool man also written was rest in peace may 
god be with you and a peace symbol 
the watkins family came to new york from provo for the us open 
tennis tournament held in the same area of flushing queens where 
members of the street gang morales cofounded fts often hang out 
the youths charged in the killing all were members of fts a 
posse a menacing gang or a group of friendly youths who like to 
dance and scrawl graffiti depending on who describes them some 
locals said fts was an obscene acronym others said it stands for 
flushing top society 
a member of another street group the sanford boys who refused 
to identify himself said of morales hes our friend we dont 
believe he did it intentionally but he did it and hes wrong

the discovery of two genes that cause dangerous 
thickening of the heart should help doctors spot youngsters who 
inherit the defect and risk death during strenuous exercise 
the research conducted at harvard medical school and published 
today reveals the precise genetic error that underlies familial 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the leading cause of sudden death 
among young athletes 
loyola marymount basketball star hank gathers who collapsed and 
died during a game in march had cardiomyopathy although doctors 
are unsure whether it resulted from the newly discovered genetic 
mixup 
the research marks the first time scientists have pinpointed the 
precise genes responsible for an inherited abnormality of the heart 
itself 
the scientists found that the condition is passed through 
families when errors occur in two sidebyside genes that oversee 
the production of an essential heart protein 
victims are prone to suffer heart failure or heart rhythm 
problems that can lead to cardiac arrest 
cardiomyopathy causes thickening of the walls of the heart 
while familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is rare affecting 
about three in 100000 people other forms of the condition are 
common side effects of a variety of diseases including high blood 
pressure 
by untangling the precise cause of the inherited form of the 
disease experts also hope they will shed light on the mysterious 
origins of the far more common varieties of cardiomyopathy and 
help scientists design treatments 
it has significance far beyond this relatively rare disease 
said dr christine seidman well gain significant insights in 
the secondary causes of hypertrophy thickening which is a very 
common phenomenon 
seidman is senior author of the research which is being 
published in the journal cell 
parents with cardiomyopathy have a 50 percent chance of passing 
it on to their children the harvard researchers studied two 
families with the disorder and found that it was caused by genes 
that make proteins called myosin heavy chain polypeptides which 
are essential for muscle contraction 
each gene contains about 30000 bits of information in one 
family the disease resulted from a mistake in just one of those 
bits of code in the other family people with the disease 
inherited an extra gene that was a hybrid of the two heart protein 
genes 
seidman said defects in these genes are responsible for some 
but not all inherited cases of the ailment other research 
suggests that mixups in genes elsewhere in the bodys genetic 
library can also trigger the condition 
tracking down the genes that underlie common conditions has 
become a highly competitive area of medical research just this 
week other teams announced the discovery of one faulty gene that 
can cause some cases of arthritis and another that results in 
creutzfeltjakob disease an illness marked by rapid mental 
deterioration 
finding the genes that cause inherited cardiomyopathy has been a 
goal of researchers at several labs in the united states and canada 
for several years 
the work is extremely important said dr neal epstein who 
had been working on the disease at the national heart lung and 
blood institute in bethesda md 
he noted that some people who carry one of the faulty genes show 
no outward signs of their condition even though they may suffer 
its consequences knowing the precise genetic defect should enable 
physicians to determine whether or not they are at risk 
it also can help parents who are unsure whether more than one of 
their children also have the disease 
if you had a child die suddenly while running to catch a bus 
this can cause tremendous emotional strain said seidman do 
you let your other children run or play sports

the ousted kuwaiti government joined 
saudi arabia today in pledging to help the united states bear the 
cost of the military buildup set up since iraq invaded its country 
more than a month ago 
secretary of state james a baker iii flew to this royal 
mountain retreat to see kuwaits exiled monarch jabir alsabah 
whose regime already has pledged to compensate turkey for losses of 
up to 2 billion from the shutdown of an iraqi oil pipeline 
alsabah said his government would contribute to the cost of the 
american military buildup in the persian gulf region in order to 
restore my country to what it was before 
speaking through an interpreter the exiled kuwaiti leader said 
we will not spare any amount or any value we will give whatever 
is necessary 
the emir asked when he would return to his homeland said he 
could not predict baker interjected however the sooner the 
better 
later today baker goes to abu dhabi for a meeting with president 
zayid of the united arab emirates us warplanes are deployed in 
the persian gulf country to shield that country from iraqi attack 
as well 
we are facing the first real crisis of the postcold war 
world baker told reporters as he left jiddah saudi arabia with 
a multibillion dollar commitment from the wealthy monarchy that is 
hosting 60000 us military men and women 
senior state department officials said they were confident all 
the allied gulf countries would participate in what baker calls a 
responsibilitysharing operation 
treasury secretary nicholas brady is also seeking financial 
support from south korea and tokyo but has yet received no firm 
commitments 
saudi arabia promised several billion dollars thursday toward 
defraying the staggering cost of the us forces protecting the 
kingdoms oil fields from iraqi aggression us and saudi 
officials announced 
the commitment came in response to a direct appeal by baker 
there was a meeting of the minds a senior saudi official 
told reporters after baker met twice with prince saud the foreign 
minister and for two hours with king fahd 
clearly pleased us officials said the saudis would at the 
minimum pick up all fuel water and transportation costs for the 
american troops now stationed in saudi arabia earlier this week 
baker told congress the us presence which also involves some 
40000 forces at sea would cost about 6 billion by years end 
both us and saudi officials declined to provide a specific 
price tag for the commitment but the senior saudi diplomat said 
the united states will not be disappointed in what saudi arabia 
is willing to do 
other persian gulf countries and japan also are expected to 
pitch in providing assistance along with saudi arabia to poorer 
arab and other countries feeling the bite of the usled economic 
boycott of iraq 
at a joint news conference today in jiddah both baker and saud 
ruled out compromise with iraqi president saddam hussein 
there is really nothing to compromise baker said of the 
us demand for iraq to reverse its aug 2 invasion of kuwait and 
to restore the kuwaiti emir to power compromise is not the word 
to use he said 
still baker said our desire and wish is to find a peaceful 
way out of the persian gulf crisis we cannot rule out any 
options 
however he offered no prescription to accomplish that goal 
baker acknowledged there has been some small leakage in 
imports to iraq but he said the usled embargo on exports was 
holding firm 
baker attributed the breach to a dispute on whether the aug 6 
embargo approved by the un security council permits food and 
medicine to get through to the iraqis 
baker said a un sanctions committee was weighing the issue 
but he said there should be no exemption for commercial food sales 
to iraq 
earlier a senior us official said the saudis were reaping 
what could be considered a windfall from expanded oil production 
following a decision by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries to partially make up for oil from iraq and kuwait 
since iraq conquered kuwait and the united nations placed an 
embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti petroleum saudi oil production has

million barrels giving the saudis nearly 100 million a day in

a judges ruling has made it more difficult 
for an art gallery and its director to fight obscenity charges for 
displaying robert mapplethorpes sexually graphic photographs a 
defense lawyer says 
hamilton county municipal judge david j albanese on thursday 
ordered the contemporary arts center and director dennis barrie to 
stand trial sept 24 on one misdemeanor count each of pandering 
obscenity 
defense lawyers contend the 175picture mapplethorpe exhibition 
mostly portraits and pictures of flowers isnt obscene when 
viewed as a whole but albanese granted a prosecution request to 
let a jury see only the five pictures that depict sex acts 
im disappointed but im not surprised barries lawyer h 
louis sirkin said after the hearing it certainly doesnt help 
us 
albanese said in a 12page ruling that each photograph is a 
separate work he said prosecutors will only have to prove that one 
is obscene to obtain a conviction 
the court believes the retrospective is a vehicle for 
displaying the five sampm photographs said albanese referring to 
the shots as sadomasochistic 
barrie did not attend the hearing he was at a washington 
fundraiser to help pay the gallerys legal bills 
he and the gallery already were scheduled for trial sept 24 on 
charges of using children in material involving nudity albanese 
said the combined trial could last 10 days 
the child nudity charge is based on separate photographs in the 
exhibition of a boy and a girl with their genitals exposed 
each charge carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and 
a 1000 fine for barrie and a 5000 fine for the gallery 
albanese rejected a defense argument to dismiss the obscenity 
charge on the grounds that state obscenity law exempts legitimate 
art displays 
the charges were filed april 7 the day the exhibition opened to 
the public the exhibition attracted 81000 people before closing 
may 26 
the mapplethorpe exhibition opened aug 1 at the institute for 
contemporary art in boston on wednesday a court clerk in that 
city refused a request to file obscenity charges 
defense lawyer marc mezibov asked albanese whether he was aware 
of the boston ruling mezibov said it indicated the pictures have 
artistic value that makes them immune from obscenity charges 
albanese said he had not read the ruling but he noted that 
massachusetts obscenity law differs from ohio law and said the 
boston decision would have no bearing on the cincinnati case 
for all i know the photographs may be in a different 
arrangement a different order they may even be different 
photographs the judge said

members of a white house task force have been 
asked to explore new options in their efforts to devise a plan 
to balance protection of the northern spotted owl and timber jobs 
in the pacific northwest 
clearly the principals are not satisfied that they have come 
up with the best solution steve goldstein spokesman for 
interior secretary manuel lujan said thursday night 
he said task force leaders told the panels working members in a 
meeting this week to begin exploring new options 
secretary lujan believes there are better options goldstein 
said 
goldstein denied a report in todays washington post that the 
task force had tentatively agreed to back a controversial proposal 
by forest service biologist jack ward thomas and other government 
scientists to ban logging on millions of acres of oldgrowth forest 
inhabited by the owl 
coming back with the jack ward thomas plan would mean they 
members of the task force did not fulfill their mandate 
goldstein said 
goldstein declined to say more about the new options being 
explored 
kelly shipp spokeswoman for agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter has also denied that any decision had been reached 
shipp said working members of the task force have made several 
recommendations through the entire process but a decision has not 
been made yet 
she said she hoped the plan would be fully formed sometime next 
week 
the interior and agriculture departments are the governments 
two forestmanagement departments most of the land involved is 
managed by the agriculture departments forest service some is 
managed by interiors bureau of land management 
a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
said white house chief of staff john sununu told yeutter wednesday 
night that the thomas report is simply unacceptable because of 
its economic impact the source said sununu wants the panel to come 
up with an owl protection plan similar to the one being implemented 
by the bureau of land management a plan that would have less 
economic impact but which is opposed by environmentalists 
another congressional source said thursday night the task force 
is leaning toward adopting the thomas report as an interim measure 
and would recommend that president bush and congress work out a 
permanent plan over the next year 
an administration source who asked not to be identified said the 
task force has concluded it will be more difficult to save timber 
jobs than the task force originally had hoped 
the thomas plan called for setting aside large tracts of 
oldgrowth forest where logging would be banned 
logging interests argued that this would cost 150000 jobs the 
government however estimates the thomas plan along with other 
industry changes would cost 20000 jobs by the year 2000

the soviet union would be willing to provide 
troops for a un peacekeeping force in the persian gulf if they 
were under a joint command that included soviet generals a foreign 
ministry spokesman said today 
a joint ussoviet military force under a united nations banner 
would be a historic first for the superpowers who have been on 
opposing sides of nearly every other global crisis since world war 
ii 
ussoviet cooperation in the gulf crisis will be topic no 1 
on sunday when presidents bush and mikhail s gorbachev hold a 
hastily arranged summit in helsinki finland spokesman for both 
sides say 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said the 
un security council should revive article 47 of the united 
nations charter which provides for a military staff committee 
comprising representatives of the five permanent council members 
we must put life into the military staff committee 
gerasimov said in an interview the committee would be made up of 
the five permanent members and not by one member 
this committee will have military forces at its disposal and 
of course we will be ready to participate he said 
asked whether one purpose of the proposal was to make sure 
soviet generals were in command of soviet troops to prevent 
unilateral military action by the united states gerasimov said 
yes 
in the past however the united states and britain have said 
they would not place their troops under un command 
the military staff committee inactive since 1946 consists of 
senior officers from the united states soviet union china 
britain and france 
the soviet union voted with the united states on security 
council resolutions condemning iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
ordering economic sanctions against baghdad and authorizing 
military means to enforce them 
the soviet union has two warships in the gulf region but they 
are not playing a direct role in the usled naval interdiction of 
ships carrying goods to and from iraq 
in tokyo today soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
urged us troops not to take unilateral action in the gulf saying 
the superpower summit will seek ways to resolve the crisis 
peacefully 
i dont think that us troops would be well advised to take 
some unilateral onesided punitive action he said 
shevardnadze also confirmed there were about 180 soviet military 
advisors in iraq but he said the contingent is being reduced 
in recent years united nations troops have been deployed only 
to separate warring sides monitor ceasefire lines and try to keep 
the peace 
not since the korean war of 195053 and congo rebellion of 
196064 have un soldiers undertaken a police action to 
reverse aggression or put down a civil war 
and in the congo and korea at the height of the cold war the 
united states and the soviet union were fiercely antagonistic 
gerasimov dismissed a proposal by iraqi president saddam hussein 
to link the withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait to israels 
pullback from occupied territories

one month after the un embargo of iraq 
the once bustling shipping business in the port of aqaba is in the 
doldrums and the thriving tourist trade has disappeared from the 
palmdotted shores 
much of the trade through aqaba has been blocked by sanctions 
against iraq heavily dependent on trade through jordan but most 
people interviewed in the port expressed loyalty to iraqs 
president saddam hussein 
they blamed washington for the embargo that threatens the 
livelihood of workers in the port that is jordans only outlet to 
the sea 
what about the human rights you are always talking about 
one shopkeeper eid alsharari asked an american visitor you are 
going to murder me by stopping all the food from coming in 
jordan has appealed for international aid to save its strapped 
economy further stretched by the un embargo and the thousands of 
arab and asian refugees crossing the border from iraq 
alsharari said many prices have doubled since the embargo began 
a month ago and supplies of rice sugar and other staples were 
running low 
tourists have been frightened away from aqaba a stopoff point 
for the ancient ruins of petra 65 miles away and a preferred skin 
diving spot tensions in the middle east have emptied hotels 
we had calls from italy with people saying why are you still 
there we heard aqaba was occupied by the americans said 
mohammed zghoul an assistant desk manager of one hotel 
the port at the head of the gulf of aqaba a finger of the red 
sea between arabia and the sinai peninsula is an outlet for iraq 
as well as for jordan 
since us warships began monitoring vessels in the persian 
gulf traffic has dropped from more than six ships a day to two or 
three said awad altal the port director 
insurance rates have shot up and now include a 1400 surcharge 
on each 40foot cargo container and 35 per ton of cargo as of aug 
25 with so few ships calling on the port there are not enough to 
carry goods out 
phosphate is a major export to asian markets but is now being 
stored in aqaba altal said only half the monthly average of 
650000 tons was exported in august he said 
there are 2400 permanent employees and 1000 to 1500 who work 
on a daily basis the port director said 
we havent fired anyone yet he said 
but the overtime that supplied much of the income here has been 
eliminated and altal said there might be layoffs soon 
the port was expected to handle 18 to 19 million tons of cargo 
this year altal said of that 30 percent was exports of 
phosphate potash concrete and other material while 40 percent 
was imported goods such as meat sugar grain electronics and 
automobiles 
the remainder altal said was transit trade mostly to and 
from iraq but also saudi arabia and jordans tarifffree zone 
the director port employees and residents of aqaba say no iraqi 
goods are being transported now in accordance with king husseins 
decision to abide by the un embargo there were no evident 
violations of the sanctions 
western diplomatic sources said that if severe violations were 
discovered western support for aid to jordan could erode they 
said minor violations were inevitable 
for truck driver mohammed ali trade had almost stopped 
since this started nothing has come into my pocket said 
ali who has nine children and was expecting 45 for his first load 
in a month 
stopped beside the narrow asphalt strip through the desert that 
connects aqaba to amman he prepared a lunch of lambs liver in the 
shade of a rig belonging to a friend said khaleed 
khaleeds truck was broken and he was fixing it himself an 
allday job because he had no money to pay a mechanic 
both men spoke of their hostility toward the us government and 
fierce loyalty to hussein 
were looking for death as youre looking for life said 
ali were praying to allah that nothing happens but if it does 
we dont care

a pennsylvania man has bought four 
descendants of the famed miniature pony misty and will move them 
from their chincoteague island home prompting an outcry from their 
keeper 
theyre just saying nothing matters no tradition no misty 
ruth calvo said thursday what i care about is the history its 
being destroyed 
misty was made famous in the 1947 childrens classic misty of 
chincoteague by marguerite henry the book was the first of a 
series of tales she wrote about the herd of wild ponies that live 
on the island in the atlantic ocean off virginias eastern shore 
each year the horses are forced to complete a swim of 10 to 15 
minutes across a quartermilewide channel for auction on the 
shore thousands of people gather to watch 
michael pryor of blue ridge summit penn said thursday he 
bought mistys descendants from paul merritt who owns the misty 
museum and pony farm which ms calvo manages pryor planned to 
move the four ponies to pennsylvania as soon as today he would not 
disclose the purchase price 
pryor said he already owns eight of mistys descendants he also 
is leasing stormy mistys daughter and the stuffed carcass of 
misty 
i know that we upset some people in taking the ponies off the 
island of chincoteague pryor said the ponies will be there 
during tourist season thats where they should be 
i live in pennsylvania but im a chincoteaguean at heart 
he said 
he said he travels with his horses to state fairs schools for 
handicapped children hospitals shopping malls and craft shows 
none of the horses travel more than once a week pryor said 
pryor who said he also owns a restaurant said he runs a 
nonprofit organization with the ponies mike pryors pony 
outreach the money raised pays veterinarian bills and buys food 
for the horses with the rest going to handicapped children he 
said 
ms calvo said she hated to see the four ponies taken away she 
once owned the misty site but has not been able to make payments 
since april so now manages it for merritt 
pennsylvania is a nice state i have nothing against it but 
it isnt chincoteague she said 
ms calvo also disputed ownership of two of the ponies she said 
she owns one wings of mist because he was born while she still 
owned the museumfarm ms calvo said she gave the other pony to a 
plumber who did extensive work for her and that he asked her to 
keep him at the farm 
merritt said he owned all four horses 
no one is sure how the herds of wild ponies got to the island 
the most commonly accepted theory is that they are descendants 
of horses hidden on the island by early settlers who wanted to 
avoid paying taxes on the animals another theory has the ponies 
washing ashore from shipwrecks during colonial times

14165 yen the low for the days trading was 14000 and the high 
was 14100 it was the lowest closing value for the dollar since 
14155 yen on oct 25 1989 
dollar sales by life insurance companies drove the dollar down 
one trader said on condition of anonymity 
shortcovering kept the dollar from sinking below the 
psychologically important 140yen level in the morning and a rumor 
that hussein had fled to libya unleashed sharp selling in the 
afternoon 
but nobody took a longdollar position said the trader 
traders said the currency could drop below the 140yen barrier 
next week reflecting wide pessimism about the us economy 
the trend could accelerate especially if us unemployment 
figures for august scheduled for release tonight tokyo time show 
a rise in joblessness pushing interest rates down 
i expect the dollar to trade between 13850 and 14150 next 
week said yoshikazu kuroda a currency trader at fuji bank 
on the tokyo stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues recovered from the lowest intraday trading of the 
year to close at 2396207 up 15016 points or 063 percent an 
estimated 440 million firstsection shares traded hands in moderate

dampened morning optimism centering around the yens appreciation 
against the dollar dealers said 
the price of benchmark brent crude for october delivery opened 
in london at between 3110 and 3130 a barrel today 
dealers were also worried about the outcome of the weekend 
summit between president bush and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev in helsinki arbitrage trading and the rapid fall on the 
bond market which heralded higher interest rates also drove the 
market down traders said 
several rumors mostly unfounded shook the jittery afternoon 
market they said 
in the afternoon one rumor said that hussein had fled there 
was another rumor of a coup detat followed by a sharp rally 
according to yoshiro inoue an analyst at nomura securities both 
rumors were unfounded 
the market mood also improved on speculation that the nihon 
keizai newspaper would review the list of industries represented in 
the 225stock index to reflect changes in the economy and a new 
average would curb price volatility 
the newspaper did announce after the markets closed that it 
was forming a committee to study the makeup of the average and 
hoped to introduce a more accurate average next summer 
other stories circulating on the trading floor suggested that 
the ministry of finance might be moving to boost the market and 
that a major brokerage house was going to lay off traders because 
of recent market losses neither rumor has been confirmed 
brokers and institutional investors feel anxiety about the 
direction of the marketsaid isao takahashi a trader for james 
capel pacific some felt the market needed support as it headed 
toward 23000 inspiring a small technical rebound effect still 
he said most brokerages and dealers are very bearish

without a shooting war most gi 
casualties in the saudi desert have been due to diarrhea heat rash 
and other ailments common to americans moving to a foreign country 
but the us military has been building more than a dozen 
hospitals in case the shooting began 
military doctors said in interviews that few of the 100000odd 
us troops have suffered from training accidents or illnesses 
caused by the harsh desert environment 
weve had some colds some gastroenteritis said lt col 
jim mattis who commands a marine brigade encamped in the desert 
nevertheless the us military is erecting a sophisticated 
network of medical facilities including 15 hospitals capable of 
providing virtually any type of surgery and care to injured 
americans should combat break out 
we are fully capable of providing the best medical care in the 
world said capt richard mayo head of a 500bed navy field 
hospital housed in 24 air conditioned tents each about 20 feet by 
100 feet 
hundreds of doctors and nurses mayos hospital will have 800 
medical personnel alone are either here or are on their way from 
the united states 
their skills are so varied and the equipment is so sophisticated 
that they will be able to perform neurosurgery heart surgery and 
orthopedic surgery 
field hospitals have laboratories xray facilities operating 
rooms dental clinics and psychiatric units 
all supplies from narcotics to hospital beds have been sent 
from the united states 
us military officials say troops in the oilrich kingdom are 
in a defensive posture but the range of medical technology sent to 
the saudi desert underscores the degree to which officials want to 
prepare for combat injuries 
for the time being doctors have been preoccupied with treating 
training injuries and lesser medical complaints 
army officials said 14 people have been evacuated for medical 
reasons including three people who broke bones and two who 
experienced psychological problems 
but maj jack wright of fayettville nc a physician with the 
44th medical brigade that controls hospitals for the army said 
most complaints have been less serious 
its usually run of the mill kinds of thing wright said he 
sees about 40 people a day at an army clinic 
the most prevalent complaint is diarrhea usually brought on by 
a change in the water or the food the army regularly tests the 
water to make sure it is safe to drink he said 
the stomach problem usually lasts about 24 hours and is 
treatable with overthecounter drugs 
colds and heat rashes are also common medical authorities said 
despite scorching temperatures few soldiers have come down with 
dehydration partly because the military has drilled into them the 
importance of drinking enough water some men drink up to four 
gallons a day 
fever is particularly dangerous in a hot climate so when 
soldiers get one they are often given liquid intravenously to 
prevent dehydration 
in the desert the big problems are sanitation and sand mattis 
said 
we have to keep the food out of the sand he said and we 
have a wash rack built so people can wash their hands 
before coming to saudi arabia soldiers were given shots to 
prevent cholera meningitis and hepatitis 
the environment also plays havoc with medical supplies 
according to maj mike calder chief nurse at the 28th combat 
support hospital 
the 200bed bubble facility blownup rubberized tubes that 
look like giant caterpillars is being set up in the desert 
the heat tends to shorten the shelflife of drugs meaning it is 
unlikely that unused medical supplies will be taken back to the 
united states when operation desert shield ends

crime in czechoslovakia has risen 
by 41 percent so far this year and part of the increase is due to 
the democratic changes that swept the communists from power the 
government news agency ctk reports 
speaking to parliamentary deputies interior minister jan langos 
on thursday confirmed has risen considerably both due to the large 
number of prisoners amnestied in january and the newly gained 
freedoms of the population 
the past period can be characterized by an increased activity 
of criminal elements and the broad tolerance shown by the 
population toward subjective interpretation of rights and freedoms 
of the individual langos was quoted as saying 
czechoslovakia is preparing for communal local elections in 
november in an effort to strengthen the hold of prodemocracy

the head of the 15nation south pacific forum 
today attacked us plans to burn off chemical weapons at johnston 
atoll accusing washington of treating pacific residents as 
coconuts and guava 
secretarygeneral henry naisali said four ministers from forum 
countries whose governments represent about 25 million people 
will travel to washington sept 1719 for talks with us officials 
on the issue 
the trip comes shortly before a deadline to transfer usowned 
chemical weapon stocks from west germany to johnston a remote 
atoll 700 miles southwest of hawaii for incineration at a 
specially built facility 
i want the united states president and his advisers to please 
listen and try to accomodate the fears and concerns of the 
territories of the south pacific and their peoples naisali told 
a news conference 
he cast doubt on us assurances that the incineration process 
at johnston would be safe and shrugged off claims that similar 
plants would be built on the continental united states where most 
american chemical weapons are stockpiled 
why bring them to our front yard in the pacific mr naisali 
asked referring to chemical weapons 
you know why because they dont class us as human beings in 
the pacific they class us as breadfruit as coconuts and guava 
tapiocas and taros 
washington had given no absolute guarantee that the 
incineration would be safe and the forum had no way to monitor the 
burning he said 
he likened american safety claims to french assurances on their 
underground nuclear test site at mururoa atoll an independent 
environmental report released last week said the atoll is leaking 
radioactivity 
are we going to believe the americans when we now know that 
the french statement was wrong he said the same thing will 
happen at johnston island 
the americans are playing cheap politics with the people of 
the south pacific he said 
some 100000 rounds of nerve gas projectiles are to be shipped 
to johnston atoll over the next few months the us army plans to 
store them at the facility and destroy them in an incinerator that 
is still being tested 
the weapons from west germany would add 100000 rounds to the 
300000 rounds of nerve and mustard gas stored at johnston atoll 
since 1971 
the tests on the incinerator are to be completed late next year 
and fullscale destruction of the weapons is not expected to begin 
until 1992 
the army has said moving the weapons across the ocean and 
destroying them at johnston atoll would have minimal public health 
safety and environmental effects

the slayings of five students by a 
killer who may still be on the loose have cast a pall over 
festivities for the university of florida football opener normally 
a high point of the new school year 
the gators play oklahoma state on saturday a sellout crowd of 
more than 72000 is expected but football was secondary as the 
murder investigation continued 
canceled was the coming out party for steve spurrier a former 
star player who returned to his alma mater as coach nine months 
ago as the father of two daughters who attend the school he is 
trying to keep the game in perspective and prepare the team to play 
this has just been a sad sad thing for the whole community 
spurrier said 
but again as school president john lombardi said this 
week we cant be held hostage by this situation weve got to go 
on with university life he said 
instead of joining hands at pep rallies and attending parties 
some students are attending grief sessions with counselors to learn 
how to cope with a tragedy psychologists say could affect the 
campus for years 
usually theres excitement in the air with everybody talking 
about the first game now its gloom and doom senior tight end 
kirk kirkpatrick said id be lying if i said it hadnt affected 
our concentration were football players but were students 
also 
four women and a man all students at the university of florida 
or santa fe community college were slain last month in three 
attacks 
norm carlson an assistant athletic director has worked for the 
university for 27 years and cant remember a time when the mood 
before a game was as solemn 
whats happened has really thrown everybody for a loss he 
said its been downright depressing around here the students 
seem to be doing a little better now theres a lot of activity 
around the stadium and you can sense them getting excited again 
there were other indications thursday that students have 
regrouped and are eager to get on with normal campus life 
music blared from dormitory windows and long lines formed at the 
student ticket window outside the football stadium 
a few blocks away a huge banner advertised a postgame party at 
a fraternity house and campus bookstores prepared for the increased 
business football saturdays bring 
the mood is a little bit subdued but i think its picking up 
more and more each day senior associate athletic director jeremy 
foley said

forget wood and brick try a 
house built of coal 80 tons of it 
when david myles a former coal operator retired in 1961 he 
didnt want to leave behind the black mineral entirely 
i just thought it would be pretty myles 84 said of his 
coal house 
myles wife quindora and others werent sure it could be done 
everybody thought he was crazy when he started she said 
but he put a white roof and white trim on it and it looked pretty 
good everybody loves it now 
on the inside the home looks like any other drywalled and 
painted with carpeting and windows but the outside is made of 
eightinchthick blocks of coal varnished every five years so it 
wont crumble from exposure to oxygen 
myles said he cut the blocks with an electric saw which soon 
broke workers finally discovered that sharp hatchets did the 
trick he said 
the sixroom house started in 1961 took six months to build 
myles later added a threeroom addition for an elderly uncle 
at the time the house cost less to build than it would to build 
a brick home but today it would be much too expensive myles said 
there are benefits as theres no need for air conditioning or 
heating because since the coal is so thick mrs myles said 
visitors frequently if the couple is afraid their house will 
ever catch fire 
the myles say its highly unlikely because of coals 
highignition temperatures

pope john paul ii toured a burundi 
hospital crowded with dying aids victims today and said he shared 
their suffering 
i know the moment is difficult he told 650 patients at the 
princeregent charles hospital on the last day of his threeday 
visit to this central african nation 
i think especially of those among you who are afflicted by 
aids for which there is still no effective cure but i want to 
tell you in the name of faith that you have reason for hope and 
you are not alone in your ordeal 
the pontiff who toured the hospital before flying to 
neighboring rwanda on the third leg of his 10day african tour was 
told by doctors that 85 percent of patients in two wards suffered 
from aids most were in an advanced stage of the disease the 
doctors said 
john paul visibly moved stopped at the bedsides of about 40 
men and women patting their heads and touching their foreheads in 
the sign of the cross 
at the end of the visit he instructed archbishop giovanbatista 
re the vaticans undersecretary of state to write out a check for 
10000 as a donation to the hospital 
there are no reliable estimates of aids cases in this former 
belgian colony of 6 million people but health officials say up to 
40 percent of young urban adults in some areas could be infected 
with the aids virus 
the world health organization estimates that 5 million africans 
are infected 
it was the third time the pope has spoken about aids during his 
african pilgrimage in tanzania last week he called for a global 
effort to combat the virus and reaffirmed the churchs rejection of 
the use of condoms as a means to check the spread

from burundi and three from neighboring zaire during a mass 
attended by tens of thousands of pilgrims in a sprawling meadow on 
the outskirts of the capital 
the new priests clad in green capes knelt one by one at the 
pontiffs feet to receive his embrace 
the ceremony marked a record number of ordinations in burundi a 
predominantly catholic country that only three years ago emerged 
from a bitter conflict between church and state 
under the previous military regime that president pierre buyoya 
toppled in 1987 foreign missionaries were expelled local priests 
were detained and some churches were closed 
buyoya a catholic restored full freedom to the church in his 
efforts to unify a nation long scarred by ethnic bloodshed 
after his visit to rwanda a former belgian protectorate the 
pope will travel sunday to the ivory coast on the last leg of his

israels phonetapping scandal widened today 
amid reports that private investigators illegally tapped phones of 
more than 20 journalists and possible witnesses in an investigation 
of a cabinet official 
interior minister aryeh deri is being questioned on suspicion of 
illegally funneling public funds to religious institutions that he 
controls he is a member of the ultraorthodox shas party 
israel army radio said today that police would complete their 
investigation in about two weeks and were expected to recommend 
charges against deri the report did not name the possible charges 
if deri stands trial it could rattle the government of prime 
minister yitzhak shamir a coalition led by shamirs rightwing 
likud bloc has a 62seat majority in the 120seat parliament and 
needs the five seats of shas to govern 
police believe three private investigating firms tapped phone 
lines in municipal officials in jerusalem and newspaper offices in 
jerusalem and tel aviv according to todays media reports 
but a tel aviv police official denied the stories saying they 
were nonsense she spoke on condition of anonymity 
the bugging scandal surfaced last week with reports that five 
people had been arrested on suspicion of tapping the phone of 
mordechai gilat an investigative reporter for the yediot ahronot 
newspaper gilat had written a series of exposes on deri in june 
a tape allegedly containing a recording of a conversation 
between gilat and police commissioner yaacov turner was discovered 
earlier this week reports said turners phone may have been bugged 
as well 
deri meanwhile suggested the leftofcenter labor party was 
responsible for the investigation he indicated it could have 
started as an attempt to prevent the formation of shamirs 
coalition on june 11 
somebody decided to torpedo the formation of a rightwing 
government deri told the weekly newspaper kol hair 
only six days before the formation of the new rightwing 
government did police start to investigate accusations against me 
only one day before the new government was presented investigators 
confiscated material from the interior ministry deri said 
shas was responsible for toppling the previous likudlabor 
coalition on march 15 during the subsequent wrangling for power 
both labor and likud tried to lure shas onto their sides

treasury secretary nicholas brady winding up a 
global fundraising mission said today japan and south korea have 
given new assurances of support for the massive economic and 
military campaign against iraq 
but no specific dollar figures were provided following bradys 
talks today with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu or in an 
earlier meeting in seoul with south korean president roh taewoo 
brady met for an hour with kaifu after which he said we have 
a very serious problem it is gratifying to know of japans 
support 
a japanese official briefing reporters after the bradykaifu 
meeting said japan will make the utmost contribution we 
have to do what we have to do 
however the official refused to provide any specifics of how 
that pledge would be translated into additional contributions 
japan earlier announced about 1 billion in support 
bradys meeting with kaifu was the final stop on a fourday 
18500 mile journey that took him from paris to london to seoul to 
tokyo however in none of the cases did the world leaders provide 
any specifics about how much they would contribute saying in most 
cases that they needed more time to review the requests 
however it appeared that a second fund raising mission headed 
by secretary of state james a baker iii was having more luck 
while no figures were given officials said that saudi arabia 
had committed several billion dollars with an offer to pick up all 
fuel water and transportation costs associated with maintaining 
the 60000 us troops now stationed in saudi arabia 
brady talking to reporters in seoul after his meeting with roh 
said he had not expected an immediate answer to the american 
request for help in defraying the cost of the us military buildup 
brady also was seeking aid for jordan turkey and egypt whose 
economies have been severely hurt by the united nations supported 
trade embargo against iraq he said the united states was hoping to 
get funds flowing to the socalled front line states by the end of 
this month 
there have been reports south korea is reluctant to commit 
significant resources to the campaign against iraqi president 
saddam hussein because of fear of jeopardizing construction 
contracts in both iraq and kuwait worth well over 1 billion 
brady said roh raised these concerns in a tangential way 
during their meeting but he said he pointed out to the south korean 
leader the huge stake his country has in keeping the price of oil 
from escalating 
every 10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil means a 
25 billion cost to the korean economy brady said 
brady insisted that he has received strong words of 
encouragement at every stop and he questioned the accuracy of 
reports that various countries are balking at the american aid 
request 
there are particular problems that every country has but the 
logic is compelling we want to make sure these sanctions work 
he said 
still bradys highlevel delegation appeared to be having a 
tougher selling job than the baker mission to oilrich middle east 
countries

commodity markets have been buzzing for days 
about the possibility of a credit arrangement for moscow when 
president bush and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev meet this 
weekend 
the administration favors liberalized trade and would like to 
see the united states grant mostfavorednation or low tariff 
status to the soviet union but this would depend on moscow 
changing policies to allow free emigration of its citizens 
for nearly two decades the soviet union has been a major force 
in us agriculture a lucrative but sometimes erratic customer 
japan is a larger buyer of total us commodities but the 
soviets annual grain orders stir excitement around the world farm 
exports to japan last year were valued at nearly 82 billion 
compared with 36 billion for the soviet union 
many farm leaders want mostfavorednation or mfn status for 
the soviet union and a solution to the hangup over immigration new 
credit deals would sprout helping sell more us wheat corn and 
soybeans 
whether this comes up between bush and gorbachev at their 
meeting in helsinki finland on sunday is conjecture at this point 
the crisis in the mideast is paramount 
but just in case the recent bread shortages in moscow prompt 
gorbachev to ask about an emergency loan to buy us grain it 
would be warmly applauded by american wheat farmers who have seen 
prices plummet in the wake of a bumper harvest this summer 
don lipton of the american farm bureau federations office here 
said thursday the organization favors mfn status for the soviet 
union and realizes that emigration policies are a stumbling block 
however he said if the white house works out a special 
arrangement for bush to present in helsinki it would be 
something we would support conditionally if it met all the 
legal specifications 
leland swenson president of the national farmers union said 
from his denver office that his members support mfn for the soviet 
union 
but swenson added that many other factors come to bear over the 
longer pull including the question of longterm credit subsidized 
sales of grain and other issues that affect ussoviet relations 
the united states has been selling millions of tons of grain to 
moscow at cutrate prices under the agriculture departments export 
enhancement program or eep since it was authorized five years ago 
as of aug 30 the soviet union had bought 213 million metric 
tons of wheat under the eep subsidy arrangement 
no dollar estimate was available but the monthly report showed 
the soviet wheat deals under the program accounted for 28 percent 
of the fiveyear total sold to all eligible foreign countries 
the soviet union banged into the world grain market as a major 
importer in 1971 with a 150 million purchase of us corn barley 
and oats 
traditionally except for a few times in the mid1960s the 
soviet union had been a net exporter of grain suddenly russia was 
on the loose as a major buyer 
the conventional wisdom in usda at the time proved correct the 
soviets indeed wanted to boost food production and needed to import 
more grain to do it but the department grossly underestimated the 
magnitude of moscows needs 
on july 8 1972 thenpresident nixon announced a 750 million 
credit arrangement for the soviet union to buy us wheat and feed 
grains it was only the tip of an export iceberg 
secretly private grain traders sold millions of tons of us 
grain mostly wheat to moscow for cash while the nixon credit 
deal was being worked out by august it was apparent that the 
russians had bought about 19 million tons of grain during the 
summer of 1972 and at subsidized prices in effect at the time 
the transactions carried out by large multinational grain 
companies led to congressional investigations and accusations that 
usda insiders had worked with the private trade in the dealings 
grain prices soared contributing to higher food costs for 
american consumers eventually congress insisted on daily and 
weekly public reporting of larger commodity sales to foreign 
buyers a system in effect today 
meanwhile the soviet union used most of its 750 million line 
of credit announced on july 8 1972 but the authorization ran out 
with about 200 million left on the books the equivalent of 
around 600 million at current prices 
since those beginnings almost 20 years ago the soviet union has 
paid more than 25 billion for more than 231 million tons of us 
wheat and corn 
the total since the 1972 credit deal included 784 million tons 
of wheat and 1528 million tons of corn this years entire us 
wheat crop was about 736 million tons and the corn crop is 
estimated by usda at 1994 million tons

the federal government has been ordered 
to pay more than 770000 in damages to a man whose arm was bitten 
off by a 500pound 11foot alligator in a national forest 
us district judge robert e varner in a ruling made public 
thursday awarded more than 650000 to kermit h george jr for 
his pain and suffering along with sums for medical costs and other 
damages 
the award of damages followed an april 30 ruling in which varner 
found that the us forest service had received complaints about 
alligators in the conecuh national forest but had failed to post 
signs warning of the danger 
on july 26 1986 george was swimming in a public pond in the 
conecuh forest not far from his hometown of florala when the 
alligator attacked him 
george who was 42 at the time was an experienced electronics 
engineer who also did land surveying and construction consulting 
part time he had been riding his bicycle and had stopped at a 
ropedoff swimming area to cool off he was in chestdeep water at 
the time of the attack 
george was with his dog a part doberman pinscher the dog 
wasnt on a leash and the government argued that george had 
attracted the alligator by letting the dog run free in violation of 
the parks leash law 
varner said it was unlikely the dog had attracted the alligator 
even though alligators enjoy dog meat 
the preponderance of the evidence shows that alligators are 
not discriminatory in their tastes and are well known to dine on 
whatever is convenient the judge wrote in the april ruling

the nations unemployment rate rose in august 
for the second consecutive month climbing to 56 percent for the 
highest jobless rate in two years the government said today 
last months rise in the civilian jobless rate up from julys 
rate of 55 percent brought unemployment to its highest level 
since the 57 percent rate posted in march 1988 the labor 
department said the nations jobless rate had also hit 56 percent 
in august 1988 
analysts said the report showed fresh evidence that the us 
economy is either already in a recession or about to topple into 
one 
its becoming clear that we are sliding into a recession 
said martin regalia chief economist at the national council of 
savings institutions if its not quite flatlined its time to 
get the jumper cables out and do something 
the weak employment report would probably renew pressure on the 
federal reserve to lower interest rates to spur the economy 
private economists said 
the rise in unemployment was largely caused by the economys 
failure to produce many new jobs last month the government said 
in fact all business payrolls actually fell by a total of 75000 
but much of that was caused by the thousands of federal census 
workers who were laid off the government said 
still private industries overall lost 12000 jobs as well with 
the slump in the construction and manufacturing sectors continuing 
analysts had been bracing for weak payroll numbers in august 
which they blamed in part on the middle east crisis saying it 
probably had unnerved businesses and kept them from hiring new 
workers 
however the us economy has been sluggish for months the 
middle east conflict has not had time yet to fully impact the 
nations economy analysts said 
its really a question of whether the oil shock is going to 
tip it over said robert dederick chief economist at the 
northern trust co of chicago 
the economy had reached a virtual standstill will this now 
push it down into negative territory dederick asked 
the nations jobless rate is derived from a household survey 
but most economists consider a separate survey of business 
establishments from which the government gets its figures on how 
many new jobs were created in a given month a better barometer of 
economic activity 
the nations manufacturing slump continued in august as factory 
jobs posted a 45000 loss it was the 16th time out of 17 months 
that manufacturing jobs declined 
since reaching a postrecession peak in january 1989 the 
manufacturing sector has lost 455000 jobs the government said 
industries with the largest losses include electronic equipment 
which has lost 100000 jobs motor vehicles which has lost 80000 
and apparel which has posted a 55000 job loss 
meanwhile in august the construction industry continued to 
suffer as well those payrolls fell by 40000 jobs after a 
seasonal adjustment posting the sixth consecutive decline to 
reflect continued weakness in the housing market the construction 
industry has lost nearly 100000 jobs in the past three months 
alone 
the service sector which until a few months ago had been adding 
huge numbers of new jobs and virtually carrying the rest of the 
economy continued on its recent trend of showing weakness service 
sector jobs increased by a relatively low 17000 jobs 
health services which had added an average of 50000 jobs each 
month in the first half of this year continued to show robust 
gains posting a 44000 jobs increase last month 
labor costs which have been rising and are being blamed for 
worsening the nations inflation problems rose only moderately in 
august 
average hourly earnings posted a 02 percent rise last month to 
1009 up from the 1007 the average worker earned per hour in 
july 
the labor departments household survey showed that overall 
total civilian employment was about 1177 million in august down 
from the 118 million employed in july 
the jobless numbered 7 million up from 68 million unemployed 
in july 
the average manufacturing work week was 41 hours in august up 
from the 409 hours in july manufacturing overtime was 39 hours 
in august a slight increase over julys average of 38 overtime 
hours 
before july and august of this year the jobless rate had held 
relatively stable for much of the past year fluctuating within a 
narrow range of 53 percent many analysts have said the 
unemployment rate was able to stay relatively low despite the 
sluggish economy because fewer americans are entering the labor 
force 
the unemployment rate among major demographic groups last month 
were 
adult white men 43 percent up from 41 percent in july 
adult white women 42 percent up from 40 percent 
white teenagers 132 percent up from 123 percent 
all blacks 118 percent up from 113 percent 
adult black men 106 percent down from 107 percent 
adult black women 99 percent up from 94 percent 
black teenagers 35 percent up from 312 percent 
hispanics 78 percent down from 79 percent 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states the august 
jobless rate was 55 percent up from the 54 percent in july but 
still better than augusts civilian rate of 56 percent

trial today on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder 
bertram harper 72 of loomis calif faces possible life 
imprisonment if convicted of the aug 19 death of his wife 
virginia 69 
romulus district judge henry zaborowski who presided over 
harpers twoday preliminary hearing said he agreed with 
prosecutors claims that there was a conspiracy to end mrs 
harpers life 
he also ordered harper tried on the murder charge because no 
evidence showed she consented to her death at the time harper 
pulled a plastic bag over her head and secured it around her neck 
suicide is selfdestruction zaborowski said there is no 
law that gives a person a license to help another person in this 
destruction 
zaborowski allowed harper to return to california but scheduled 
arraignment for sept 21 in wayne county circuit court 
the hemlock society a suicide rights group is paying for 
harpers defense 
in his statement to romulus police harper said his wife 
diagnosed with cancer of the breast and liver swallowed about a 
dozen pills washed them down with coffee liqueur and lay on their 
motelroom bed while she pulled a clear plastic bag over her head 
afterward harper told reporters that he his wife and 
stepdaughter shanda mcgrew would not have come to michigan if the 
state had a law making it illegal to help someone else die 
wednesdays hearing included testimony from five witnesses four 
of the five related accounts of mrs harpers death given them by 
mcgrew 40 who traveled with her mother and stepfather from 
california to michigan ms mcgrew is an unindicted coconspirator 
in her mothers death but has not been charged 
assisting in a suicide in california is a felony punishable by 
up to five years imprisonment michigan has no specific law 
prohibiting people from assisted in suicides but some prosecutors 
have contended that the practice is still illegal in the state 
under the general law against murder 
harper said their decision wasnt influenced by publicity over 
the socalled suicide machine case involving dr jack 
kevorkian an outspoken advocate of death on demand for the 
terminally ill 
the suburban detroit pathologist is under investigation but has 
not been charged in the june 4 death of janet adkins 54 of 
portland ore 
adkins was said to have had alzheimers disease when she and her 
husband flew to michigan met kevorkian and drove with him to a 
park about 40 miles north of detroit there kevorkian fitted 
adkins with an intravenous tube and she pressed a button on a 
machine he invented and it delivered a fatal dose of heartstopping 
drugs

not one to tamper lightly with tradition 
the farmers almanac suggests nonetheless that the date designated 
for thanksgiving is a turkey 
in its 1991 edition just off the presses the venerable 
publication says americans should consider celebrating the holiday 
the fourth thursday in november earlier in the fall 
an earlier date would rid thanksgiving of prechristmas 
overtones allow for more favorable travel weather and line it up 
more closely with the harvest whose bounty it is meant to 
celebrate the almanac says 
the almanac says the second monday in october the date on which 
canada celebrates thanksgiving might be an appropriate 
alternative almanac editor ray geiger invites readers to offer 
their own ideas 
were only suggesting that we examine this thing were not 
bold enough to say do it geiger said in an interview 
thanksgiving commemorating the feast held by members of the 
plymouth colony in massachusetts in december 1621 to celebrate that 
years harvest has been observed at various dates over the years 
it has remained at its current date since 1863 except for a brief 
period when president franklin d roosevelt reset it for the third 
thursday in november 
thanksgiving is a sacred holiday what makes it sacrosanct is 
not that it is observed on a certain date each year but rather 
what it means the almanac says when one ponders the real 
reason for thanksgiving the date of celebration seems immaterial 
geiger said the principal reason for change would be to separate 
thanksgiving from the overlapping demands posed by the start of the 
christmas season 
youve got football youve got christmas pressing and you 
dont know whether youre celebrating thanksgiving or christmas 
he said 
an earlier holiday would reduce the chances that travelers would 
encounter ice or snow while heading to family gatherings geiger 
said and it would shift the holiday to a time closer to the end of 
the harvest when the woods still are ablaze with colorful foliage 
he said 
by contrast fields and orchards are bare in late november and 
trees have lost their leaves when we celebrate thanksgiving 
under these conditions we seem to have lost our sense of timing 
the almanac said 
the date change could mark the start of a new crusade by the 
174yearold almanac which in years past has prodded the 
government to restore city names to postmarks and eliminate the 
ninedigit zip code 
geigers almanac is not to be confused with the old farmers 
almanac the 198yearold new hampshirebased publication geiger 
claims a circulation of about 5 million for the 48page 
publication sold to banks insurance companies and other 
businesses that distribute it to customers as a promotional tool 
last years campaign promoting the introduction of a coin it 
calls the columbus dollar as a replacement for the 1 bill is 
making progress geiger said and bills introduced in the house and 
senate are enjoying increased support 
that proposal along with the shuffling of thanksgiving does 
not mean that the almanac is abandoning its longstanding profession 
of traditional values 
tradition is a must for us but were not blinded by it 
geiger said 
almanac traditions include calendar data puzzles household 
hints inspirational messages oneline jokes and flavorite 
recipes 
another tradition is weather data this years edition predicts 
a harsh winter chilling news to households concerned about rising 
energy prices brought on by the crisis in the persian gulf 
its going to be a rough winter rougher than last year with 
more snow and more cold weather in january and february geiger 
said 
but its not going to be a prolonged winter its going to 
ease off early in march geiger said the almanac forecasts a 
mild spring and summer that wont be too hot 
the forecasts are prepared by caleb weatherbee who calculates 
them in accordance with a secret formula based on sunspots the 
position of the planets and the tidal action of the moon geiger 
said 
his track record has been excellent getting better every 
year

contribute to the burdensharing in an independent and direct 
manner and not to the expenses of a separate country even though

the crisis in the persian gulf could be 
settled peacefully if iraqi president saddam hussein got his teeth 
fixed the personal dentist to the late guru osho rajneesh said 
friday 
swami devageet said rajneesh the mystic who was expelled from 
the united states in 1985 and died in january discovered a year 
ago that mans animal past including his aggressive instincts 
are mysteriously stored in the human dental structure 
in a telex from the commune that rajneesh founded in poona 
devageet said saddam could become a blissful human being instead 
of a blistering warmonger if he submitted to toothcentered 
character analysis 
it may sound absurd but its a lot cheaper than a third world 
war devageet said

three new hampshire democrats are trying to 
turn the states financial woes into a political plus as they seek 
to end eight years of republican domination in the governors 
office 
gov judd gregg faces token opposition from a nudist camp owner 
in tuesdays primary 
the three democrats fighting for the chance to run against gregg 
are counting on voter unrest to sway independents who comprise 
just under onethird of registered voters to vote democratic in 
november 
new hampshire has a dismal economy and a budget deficit despite 
recent tax hikes but most believe it will be an uphill climb for 
any democrat to unseat gregg 
the governor already has more than twice the campaign 
contributions his opponents have raised collectively and leads 
comfortably in polls 
gregg 43 a former fourterm congressman is seeking his second 
twoyear term in the gop primary he faces robert bonser 69 who 
decided to run to protest having several mobile homes hauled out of 
his nudist park in a zoning dispute 
former state democratic chairman joseph grandmaison 47 state 
senate democratic leader robert preston 61 and state rep paul 
blacketor 63 have focused their campaigns for the democratic 
nomination on gregg accusing him of mismanaging the economy 
grandmaison says greggs shortterm fixes will result in a 
giant past due bill arriving next january 
adds preston i have never seen such chaos in state 
government our economy is floundering the ship of state lacks a 
skipper at the helm 
gregg and legislators enacted a package of tax and fee hikes and 
spending cuts in february that werent enough to prevent a deficit 
when the fiscal year ended june 30 a further decline in revenues 
prompted gregg last month to make additional budget cuts 
gregg says hes acted decisively and that the 160 million fix 
in february means the budget concerns we now face are 
manageable 
preston and blacketor also have attacked grandmaison who leads 
them in recent polls as being too closely tied to gov michael 
dukakis of massachusetts whose popularity has plunged since he ran 
for president 
grandmaison directed dukakis first gubernatorial campaign and 
has received contributions from more than 40 current or former 
dukakis campaign workers as well as 100 from dukakis 
preston who says he represents a conservative wing of the party 
able to win in november wants voters to link grandmaison with 
massachusetts derisively called taxachusetts by some new 
hampshire residents 
frankly i think granite state citizens will resent the fact 
that massachusetts politicians and their fat cat contributors will 
try and influence the outcome of a new hampshire election 
preston says 
mike dukakis is my friend he gave my campaign 100 
grandmaison responds i dont know why bob preston finds that 
so upsetting 
abortion is an important but not pivotal issue partly because 
gregg vetoed prochoice legislation both this year and last 
preston and bonser oppose abortion while grandmaison and 
blacketor are prochoice the national abortion rights action 
league of new hampshire endorsed grandmaison believing he has a 
better chance of winning than blacketor 
however taxes overshadowed abortion in a poll of 900 potential 
voters in july by the becker institute inc of sudbury mass 
new hampshire voters traditionally reject candidates who refuse 
to take the pledge to veto general sales or income tax 
proposals but both grandmaison and blacketor advocate tax reform 
which has growing appeal to voters disenchanted that property taxes 
have doubled on average since 1983 
blacketor proposes an income tax earmarked for property tax 
relief while grandmaison has called for tax reform without being 
specific 
gregg has promised to veto broadbased taxes 
in the becker poll gregg topped grandmaison among prochoice 
voters 47 percent to 37 percent with 16 percent undecided 
grandmaison led gregg among those who favor enacting a state sales 
or income tax 45 percent to 38 percent with 17 percent undecided 
gregg held a wide lead over grandmaison among tax and 
abortionopponents and among those satisfied with the economy 
overall 52 percent picked gregg to 32 percent for grandmaison 
with 16 percent undecided gregg led preston by a similar margin 
the margin of error was about 5 percentage points 
an august poll conducted by the university of new hampshire for 
wmurtv had grandmaison leading his opponents almost 31 but more 
than half of those polled said they hadnt made up their minds

the last large deployment of us 
marines in the middle east ended with more than 240 of them killed 
by a suicide car bomber in beirut in 1983 
risks of such an attack are extremely low in a controlled 
society like saudi arabia but the us military says it is taking 
no chances 
the lesson we learned from beirut was a very hard one said 
spokesman lt col john olsen were taking a lot of care not to 
repeat that 
he would not comment on specific security measures but some are 
obvious journalists are barred from photographing sleeping areas 
for example 
the suicide bomber in lebanons capital believed to be a member 
of an extremist shiite moslem faction drove a truck crammed with 
explosives into a marines barracks building 
commanders were criticized for inadequate precautions that 
allowed the truck driver to make it through the gates 
marines in saudi arabia said beirut crosses their minds 
occasionally 
you always think nothings going to happen but you never 
know said sgt thomas hixson 23 of kingston tenn just like 
beirut it helps keep peoples morale up to ask them what they 
would do in a case like that 
the 2nd battalions commanding officer was more blunt 
were not going to allow terrorists to come in here and kill 
marines said col carl fulford of twentynine palms calif 
were not going to stack them up in one hotel waiting for someone 
to come blow them up 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
blunt talk by commanders makes good newspaper quotes and 
excellent television or radio sound bites the more it sounds like 
the movies the faster reporters try to get every nugget 
fulford is a particular favorite for sentences like if the 
iraqi were to come south wed give him all he can handle 
said one australian reporter after a fulford briefing they

the new diplomatic quarter in the saudi capital riyadh is a 
stunning enclave of parks and embassies executed by modern 
architects the shopping centers and apartment buildings were 
designed to resemble old saudi mud brick forts 
the landscaped park around the quarter consists basically of a 
high earthern wall with just a few entrances cut through for roads 
the idea was to allow up to 25000 foreigners living there some 
privacy for outdoor activities like jogging that the saudi public 
might frown on 
but in this time of crisis the iraqi siege of the foreign 
embassies in kuwait is more on everbodys mind than the careful 
design 
theyll have no difficulty sealing off this quarter joked

the question what should be done about iraqi president saddam 
hussein elicits a standard array of responses like hit him

faced with opposition from environmentalists 
and key lawmakers the bush administration isnt likely to weaken 
the endangered species act to save logging jobs in northwest 
forests where the threatened northern spotted owl lives 
congressional aides said friday 
bill calder press secretary for sen mark hatfield rore 
said a white house task force hasnt ruled out changing the act to 
soften the economic blow of protecting the owl but he said 
leaders of the cabinetlevel task force have indicated theyre 
moving away from that option 
the senator has always believed we should not be tinkering 
with the act calder said 
an aide to rep bob smith rore also said friday it appears 
unlikely there is enough support in congress to change the act 
there are too many powerful committee chairmen subcommittee 
chairman indeed the rankandfile members who say they are not 
going to change the act said press secretary dave redmond 
hatfield and assistant agriculture secretary jim moseley who 
works on the task force for agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
denied reports the panel backs a version of a controversial plan 
offered by government scientists in april that plan would ban 
logging on millions of oldgrowth forests in washington oregon and 
northern california 
its not the information we have received hatfield said 
moseley said in a statement that the task force has not 
completed its deliberations he said reports that the task force 
has concluded owl protection will cost 20000 jobs are 
speculative and conjectural 
the task force is working toward recommendations which will 
balance the economic and environmental concerns of the northwest 
moseley said 
hatfield said the recommendations made by the scientific 
committee are totally unacceptable job loss in the region 
under that proposal would range from 25000 to 50000 and revenue 
loss could total 600 million to 2 billion he said 
i can tell you that would be like sending a missile into the 
economy of the northwest hatfield said 
steve goldstein a spokesman for interior secretary manuel 
lujan denied a report in fridays washington post that the task 
force had tentatively agreed to back the april report 
lujan is a member of the task force along with the heads of the 
environmental protection agency the office of management and 
budget and the council of economic advisers 
goldstein said late thursday that the task force leaders told 
the panels working members this week to begin exploring new 
options 
clearly the principals are not satisfied that they have come 
up with the best solution goldstein said secretary lujan 
believes there are better options 
goldstein declined to elaborate on those options 
a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
said white house chief of staff john sununu told yeutter on 
wednesday that the april report is simply unacceptable because 
of its economic impact 
an administration source who asked not to be identified said the 
task force had concluded it will be more difficult to save timber 
jobs than the task force originally had hoped but that no plan has 
been backed 
the fish and wildlife service declared the owl a threatened 
species in june

there are rabbits ducks doves raccoons and other animals 
living there morton said

attention republicans mention strength 
vision and hard work when talking about yourself use 
pathetic liberal and criminal rights when talking 
about democrats 
gopac a conservative political action committee this week is 
distributing scores of suggested words and phrases that can help 
gop candidates burnish their own images and revile their opponents 
the washingtonbased group whose general chairman is rep newt 
gingrich of georgia sent the list and a few helpful hints to some 
6000 republican officeholders and candidates across the country 
gingrich is not one to ignore his own advice 
in an august speech to the heritage foundation gingrich packed 
four words from the gopac list into just two sentences the loaded 
words are indicated in capital letters 
congress is a broken system it is increasingly a system of 
corruption in which money politics is defeating and driving out 
citizen politics congress is a sicker and sicker institution in an 
imperial capital that wallows in the american peoples tax money 
democratic national committee spokeswoman ginny terzano used few 
words in responding to the gopac circular 
while the democrats are dealing with issues republicans are 
playing scrabble she said 
the recipients of the gop list arent yet running for congress 
but gopac hopes they will 
this list is prepared so that you might have a directory of 
words to use in writing literature and mail in preparing speeches 
and in producing electronic media gopac tells its members in 
introducing the key words 
the words and phrases are powerful read them memorize as 
many as possible and remember that like any tool these words 
will not help if they are not used 
in all there are 131 selections to choose from half are called 
positive governing words that candidates can use to outline 
their vision of the future and of their own philosophy they 
include flag prosperity common sense and reform 
the others are called contrasting words that attempt to 
identify and label the democratic enemy in terms voters can 
understand they include waste corruption traitor 
and decay 
gopac offers a whole host of anti words handy for use 
against opponents antiflag antifamily antichild 
antijobs 
the word list is the product of months of research by gopac 
staffers in focus groups across the country according to gingrich 
gopac chairman howard bo callaway said the group hopes the 
vocabulary list instructional speaking tapes forums and other 
programs it offers will help correct a flaw in the political 
system conservatism he said is popular but that isnt being 
reflected in the results of local elections sometimes 
conservatives lose because they dont use the right buzz words 
language really does matter how you say things and the 
semantics callaway said

vehicles for carcrazy los angeles by 1995 the city department of 
water and power and southern california edison co announced 
thursday 
it is essential that we move ahead on clean air said city 
councilman marvin braude an advocate of electric car development 
we must find alternative fuels to oil and electric power is the 
fuel of choice 
the car will be designed by clean air transport a 2yearold 
firm based in sweden that beat 18 american and foreign bidders for 
the contract 
dubbed the la 301 the clean machine would carry four 
passengers have a range of 150 miles between charges and a top 
speed of 70 mph designers say it will accelerate from zero to 30 
mph in nine seconds

toxic and radioactive discharges from 
oil fields are contaminating southeast louisiana wetlands possibly 
upsetting the delicate ecological balance and disrupting the food 
chain says a state report 
the department of environmental quality study released thursday 
said high levels of volatile organic compounds and radium are 
accumulating in estuaries and wetland sediment 
the contamination could spread if the sediment was disburbed by 
dredging a storm or even a passing tugboat state officials said 
and the pollutants threaten to diminish the seafood supply they 
said 
the more land we lose to coastal erosion the less we have 
left and the more we have to protect it said maureen oneill 
assistant secretary of the department theres a very serious 
amount of contamination going into the wetlands through these 
discharges and we have to get rid of it 
the sediment is being contaminated by produced water a 
virtual chemical stew that flows from oil wells 
companies separate the produced water from petroleum and release 
it into the wetlands such discharges amounting to 84 million 
gallons a day are allowed in southeastern louisiana but are 
prohibited in the northern part of the state oneill said only 
texas and louisiana allow the discharge of produced water the 
department said 
the report appears to add momentum to the campaign to ban such 
discharges the department has circulated proposed regulations to 
phase out the discharge of produced water in four years oil and 
gas companies have complained that the deadline is too short 
environmentalists have objected that it is too long oneill said 
industry could drill new wells and inject the contaminants into 
them but thats much more expensive than dumping them into the 
water 
its always cheaper to release contaminants into the 
waterways said oneill said but this wont put the oil 
industry out of business 
midcontinent oil and gas association the lobbying organization 
for the states oil and gas companies said in 40 years of 
drilling produced water has not harmed the environment or human 
health the threat has been limited to some bottomdwelling 
organisms in certain wetlands said spokesman larry wall 
he said a ban on such discharges could force the capping of less 
profitable wells the association has asked for eight years to end 
the discharges

soviet president mikhail gorbachevs planned visit 
to japan is another step to ease tensions between the nations but 
rival claims over an island chain keep relations cool officials 
said friday following four days of meetings 
it was unclear if the talks made progress toward resolving the 
45yearold territorial dispute over the islands seized by the 
soviets at the end of world war ii the issue has blocked closer 
relations with the soviet union while many other nations break down 
cold war barriers with moscow 
one thing i can confidently say is that the atmosphere has 
changed significantly during this visit said soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze before returning to moscow friday 
it was an extremely meaningful visit for both sides said 
foreign minister taro nakayama 
the agreement for the april 1991 visit by gorbachev highlighted 
the meetings between nakayama and shevardnadze 
japanese officials however stressed they will continue to push 
for the return of the kuril islands a sparsely populated 
archipelago north of the japanese island of hokkaido 
the islands in waters rich with salmon and other marine 
resources were claimed as historically russian territory japan 
contends they were ceded by a 19thcentury agreement 
the two countries have yet to sign a postworld war ii peace 
treaty because of the kuril dispute 
i could not find any practical change in the attitude of the 
soviet union on the territorial issue nakayama said 
but some analysts say they expect the soviets to seek a 
resolution to the territorial issue in order to gain access to 
japanese economic aid and investment 
i think the time is ripe to take a big political step forward 
it is time to discuss fundamental issues between the two 
countries said shevardnadze 
our basic policy remains unchanged said kazuhiko togo 
director of the foreign ministrys soviet union division we have 
asked the soviet side to consider the question seriously squarely 
and straightforwardly 
it is not clear whether japanese officials will discuss the 
kuril dispute with gorbachev who earlier threatened to refuse a 
japanese trip if the issue would be raised 
shevardnadze also met with emperor akihito and invited him to 
moscow 
akihito declined to reply immediately saying it is for the 
two governments to decide according to an imperial household 
agency official 
on wednesday the two governments issued their first joint 
statement on an international issue the declaration condemned the 
aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait and demanded an immediate 
withdrawal of its troops

the government of president 
carlos menem signaling it will not bow to pressure by organized 
labor has sent soldiers to the state telephone company to replace 
striking employees 
it was the harshest action yet by the government against the 
unions that helped put it in office 14 months ago a crew of about 
20 officials from the army navy and air force went to work 
thursday at the telephone companys center for international 
communications in downtown buenos aires 
the director of the state company entel said it was necessary 
to protect company property and restore service after 350 strikers 
were fired the boycott by the 25000 union members in the capital 
threatened to spread nationwide 
the jobs not covered by normal operators are going to be 
covered as of today by personnel of the armed forces maria 
julia alsogaray told reporters after meeting with menem 
the menem government has been plagued by strikes in recent 
months many brought on by salary demands as real wages have been 
shrunk by inflation 
bus drivers walked off the job monday just before the evening 
rush hour the next day 40000 doctors and nurses at public 
hospitals stayed off the job to protest the layoffs of 2000 
colleagues most were rehired 
train crews were to strike beginning thursday but the 
government ordered mandatory conciliation for 20 days university 
professors have not given endofsemester exams since july grade 
school teachers are threatening to revive classroom boycotts held 
months ago 
the government claims some of the strikes are political 
statements against its policies of budget austerity and a reduced 
role for the state in the economy 
unions that represent entel and state airline employees admit 
they fear job and wage cutbacks when the companies are sold formal 
transfers of ownership are set for oct 8 
privatizations and deregulation as well as budget austerity have 
been policy centerpieces since menem took office in july 1989 amid 
hyperinflation recession and a nearly bankrupt treasury 
he lifted controls on foreign exchange and prices allowed 
foreign companies access to state oil fields reduced import 
tariffs and export taxes cut back subsidies to private businesses 
and provincial governments seized bank deposits to throttle 
speculation and hiked public service rates to what it costs to 
provide them 
midway through this year monthly inflation neared single 
digits central bank reserves topped 23 billion and the austral 
regained stability 
however inflation in july crept up to 108 percent and last 
month reached 153 percent the austral began to devalue 
menems response was to announce the layoffs of 130000 contract 
employees and civil servants close down the moneylosing national 
mortgage bank and pay state suppliers owed 8 billion with bonds 
that come due over 10 years

jesse jackson is campaigning to become the 
district of columbias unpaid shadow senator using the same 
personal salesmanship skills that earned him 7 million votes for 
president in 1988 
jackson is favored to win one of two shadow senator 
nominations in tuesdays democratic primary after spending months 
preaching the gospel of statehood for the district 
the two senators will serve as lobbyists pressing congress 
for dc statehood district voters also will elect a shadow 
representative this year to advance the districts uphill effort 
to become a state 
it is jacksons first bid for an office other than president 
and he is using the same articulate personal campaign style that 
he employed in his 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns 
while four years ago he was stumping in iowa wheat fields and 
east los angeles soup kitchens jackson now works coffee klatches 
and neighborhood meetings around the nations capital 
jackson in person is very persuasive in that sense it is the 
same as his presidential campaigns said longtime jackson aide 
frank watkins 
statehood was dead buried and had a couple shovel loads of 
earth on it when he started talking about it and now all the 
mayoral candidates say it is one of their top priorities 
if jackson wins one of the senator nominations on tuesday a 
victory in novembers general election is a nearcertainty given 
that democrats outnumber republicans by an eighttoone margin in 
the district 
jackson moved from chicago to washington last year and 
speculation that he would run for mayor increased with mayor marion 
barrys muchpublicized legal problems linked to drug and perjury 
charges barry who was convicted of a misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charge decided not to seek reelection 
but jackson declined to run for mayor prompting a new round of 
criticism from those who have maintained he is unqualified to be 
president because he never has served in elective office 
jackson says he chose to seek the shadow senators job because 
my quest is not employment its empowerment 
why dc statehood why not mayor because my life commitment 
is to expand democracy he told a group of democratic women this 
summer 
some critics have faulted jackson for a weak understanding of 
local issues and questioned whether the world traveller will 
commit himself fully to the goal of statehood 
freeing dc residents from colonial bondage will require more 
commitment than his threeday rescue mission to damascus or 
baghdad the local city paper said in a recent article on 
jacksons campaign 
aides say statehood remains jacksons top priority even as he 
continues to be involved in a host of foreign policy and civil 
rights issues 
last week he traveled to the middle east where he interviewed 
iraqi president saddam hussein for a syndicated television show a 
week earlier he stood before microphones and television cameras to 
urge minorities to boycott nike products because the athletic wear 
giant has no blacks on its board of directors 
the commitment is there said bernard demczuk a labor 
liaison with jacksons national rainbow coalition whether it is 
in the middle east or mississippi he is saying that the number 
one civil rights priority is statehood for the district 
dont forget he can travel the country getting the people 
who voted for him in 1988 to pressure their elected 
representatives to support statehood watkins said 
the shadow senator concept first was employed by the tennessee 
territory prior to its admission to the union in 1796 
the districts shadow delegation will have no voting rights and 
only one official mission to encourage congress to make the 
nations capital the 51st state the city council originally wanted 
to spend 13 million for the delegations salaries and expenses 
but dropped that plan because of budget problems 
the lack of voting authority and a salary hasnt diminished 
jacksons enthusiasm for statehood or his penchant for relentless 
campaigning 
hes been to forums ward events quite a few house parties 
just like last time around watkins said the only difference 
here is the travel is a lot easier any stop we have to make here 
can be done in 20 minutes or less without getting on a plane

for president bush the helsinki summit offers 
a chance to demonstrate truly global support for his persian gulf 
policy for mikhail gorbachev it presents an opportunity to remind 
his people the soviet union remains a major player in world affairs 
as for specific actions there are a number of possible steps 
bush and gorbachev could take to signal united disapproval of 
saddam husseins invasion of kuwait 
administration officials sought to lower expectations for any 
major initiatives from either side 
but even a joint statement reiterating the call for an iraqi 
rollback from kuwait would be significant it would mark the first 
time the cold war rivals have spoken in tandem on a major 
international issue other than arms control in more than four 
decades a strong message us officials say they assume would not 
be lost on saddam 
the two leaders will also use their sunday summit to attempt to 
prod armscontrol negotiations in hopes of nailing down a treaty on 
conventional force reductions in europe by years end 
administration officials say 
and they could announce at summits end whether they will accept 
invitations to attend german reunification ceremonies in berlin on 
oct 3 
the white house expectationlowering effort followed a familiar 
pattern in advance of superpower summits 
as the president has indicated it is an unstructured 
agenda said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
still at last decembers summit at malta the white house said 
essentially the same thing and bush proceeded to lay out in 
careful detail a full 16point program 
here are some steps that could be taken at helsinki if the 
leaders decide to go beyond a simple statement on iraq 
although it seems unlikely moscow could agree to send forces 
to bolster the un military operation a senior administration 
official briefing reporters at the white house on friday on the 
condition of anonymity said it would be useful if the soviets 
would send ground forces bush seems likely to convey this 
message to the soviet leader at sundays session 
gorbachev could announce the withdrawal of all or some soviet 
advisers from iraq as pressed by the united states however such 
a step would mark a major concession on the soviet side and us 
official say they do not really except it to happen still you 
can be sure the issue will be discussed the senior official said 
the soviet union could agree to develop with outside help 
its vast oil supplies to help offset losses from the gulf 
fitzwater said energy supplies will be discussed and probably oil 
reserves in the soviet union however soviet oil production has 
been down in recent months 
some long range peace plan for the region could be proposed 
or at least an agreement to study the possibility 
it would have to be a common ground between the natolike 
military alliance proposed by secretary of state james a baker iii 
and the conference suggested by soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze to settle both the iraqi occupation of kuwait and the 
israelipalestinian conflict 
the soviets could be invited to play some mediation role in 
negotiating the withdrawal of iraq from occupied kuwait and us 
forces from saudi arabia us officials have played down these 
suggestions however 
the summit will give a bush a chance to respond to soviet 
misgivings about the us military buildup less than 1000 miles 
from the soviet border gorbachev has said the building up of 
military confrontation might lead to unpredictable consequences 
in the tense persian gulf 
also if bush is planning military action against iraq he would 
no doubt want to tell gorbachev of his intentions in advance us 
officials agree 
lost in the discussions says one administration official 
involved in the summit preparations is the fact that there is 
obviously a special relationship that the soviet union enjoys with 
iraq 
moscow had been baghdads prime arms supplier the soviets 
still have their advisers there they still have influence the 
official said 
the fact of the helsinki meeting itself sends a very strong 
signal to saddam the official said 
thus far despite its lukewarm support for the us military 
presence in the middle east the soviet union has tolerated it 
the summit will also give bush a chance to sound out gorbachev 
on what the iraq position is particularly in light of this 
weeks meeting between the soviet leader and the iraqi foreign 
minister the official said 
we will pass on what our intentions are and our goals are 
the official added 
many analysts say they doubt that any new initiatives will 
result from the summit if only because all sides seem to want to 
wait to see if the international sanctions are taking hold

i see before me a very disturbed individual circuit judge 
martin budnick said i see a great deal of acting out 
neurotic or psychotic behavior 
budnick ruled that humphrey is a danger to the community but he 
indicated he would consider another request for bond reduction and 
wanted to hear medical testimony about humphreys mental condition 
humphreys grandmother testified she didnt want to press 
charges and would welcome humphrey back into her home where 
humphreys mother also lives 
i want it dropped definitely elna hlavaty her right

teenagers appear to be using more 
bodybuilding steroids despite the health risks of the illegal 
drugs federal health officials said friday 
whats more the officials said that coaches teachers parents 
and other adults may subtly be encouraging the trend 
the assessment was contained in a report by the inspector 
general of the department of health and human services that 
estimated more than 250000 adolescents mostly boys have used 
steroids 
health secretary louis sullivan called the finding 
disturbing and said he was concerned that some adults who are 
charged with our young peoples welfare might be passively 
accepting or even tacitly approving use of the drugs that build 
up muscles and strength 
dick stickle executive director of a substance abuse program of 
the national federation of state high school associations said 
coaches can appear to condone steroid use with offthecuff 
comments such as everybody uses steroids now in sports or by 
telling a young athlete if you were a little larger a little 
stronger you could be a starter next year 
sullivan said an interagency task force has been formed to look 
into new approaches to stemming illegal steroid use also the food 
and drug administration is conducting an educational campaign 
targeted at young athletes and their coaches he said and the 
department is launching a public affairs campaign on the issue 
in the bestknown case of steroid use by an athlete canadian 
sprinter ben johnson lost his gold medal in the 1988 olympics in 
when he tested positive he was disqualified and barred from 
competing for two years 
the report by inspector general richard kusserow estimated that 
262000 students in grades 7 through 12 are using or have used 
steroids based on a 1989 survey by the national institute on drug 
abuse 
the report estimated 5 percent to 11 percent of teenage boys 
use steroids among girls the estimated range was 05 percent to 
25 percent 
the report based on interviews with 30 knowledgeable 
professionals and 72 current or former steroid users as well as a 
review of recent studies said steroid use among the young appears 
to be rising 
more than half the users questioned said they had started using 
steroids by age 16 85 percent said they had started by age 17 all 
but one said they used injectable steroids 
the effects of steroids can be physical as well as psychological 
users exhibit addictive behavior although it has not been 
proven that these drugs are habitforming the experts said other 
possible psychological effects are increased irritability violent 
behavior depression mania psychosis and suicide 
among the physical effects are acne fluid retention breast 
development in males masculinization in females reversible 
sterility in males increased cholesterol levels and high blood 
pressure the report said 
also because adolescents bodies are still developing they are 
at special risk for some adverse effects including stunted growth 
and longterm dependence on steroids the report said

prosecutors trying to crack the troubling case of 
charles stuart who allegedly shot his pregnant wife and later 
killed himself asked the states highest court friday to force his 
lawyer to talk 
suffolk county assistant district attorney thomas mundy argued 
before the massachusetts supreme judicial court that a grand jury 
will be deprived of potentially relevant information if 
attorney john dawley is not compelled to testify about his final 
conversation with stuart 
but attorneys representing the stuart family argued that the 
court will be setting a dangerous precedent by tampering with the 
agesold attorneyclient privilege 
chief justice paul liacos agreed that it would be difficult to 
make an exception to the attorneyclient privilege 
dawley met with charles stuart as his attorney on jan 3 the 
day before stuart drove to bostons tobin bridge and apparently 
committed suicide he apparently had learned that his 24yearold 
brother matthew had gone to police and implicated him in his 
wifes murder 
carol stuart 30 was shot to death oct 23 during what her 
husband had claimed was a robbery attempt by a lone black gunman 
after the couple had attended a childbirth class the stuarts 
prematurelyborn son christopher died 17 days later 
public interest in the crime was heightened by a dramatic 
taperecorded telephone conversation between stuart and an 
emergency dispatcher who tracked down the stuarts location in 
order to send an ambulance 
the crime shocked bostonians and aggravated racial tensions 
particularly after a black man was prominently named as a suspect 
the crimes hold on the public imagination grew greater still when 
it became clear that the prime suspect was stuart himself 
prosecutors are most interested in learning the extent of 
matthew stuarts involvement in the slaying in their arguments 
before the court prosecutors gave the first details in open court 
about matthew stuarts testimony before the grand jury 
mundy told the court that matthew stuart has told the grand jury 
that he was solicited by his brother to participate in an insurance 
scam 
matthew testified that he drove his car alongside his brothers 
the night of the shooting and was only 5 to 6 feet away from him 
when he was handed a bag of items including the murder weapon 
mundy said but matthew testified that he neither saw carol stuart 
inside the car nor noticed that his brother was injured mundy said 
the grand jury mundy said is faced with a question was 
matthew stuart a naive thief who was nearsighted or was he a 
willing participant in murder 
mundy argued that the sanctity of the attorneyclient privilege 
is designed to ensure the administration of justice and asked 
the court to consider making an exception in the stuart case to 
avoid a miscarriage of justice 
nancy gertner the attorney representing matthew stuart told 
the court that overriding the attorneyclient privilege would mean 
that attorneys could no longer be trusted with confidences 
if charles stuart and others had the slightest idea that their 
conversations would be disclosed down the line they would never 
want to talk said gertner 
attorney richard clayman who represents the rest of the stuart 
family said the attorneyclient privilege is sacred fundamental 
and never waived 
the court did not say when it will rule

the government must strike a delicate balance 
between its duty to clean up the savings and loan crisis and the 
need to protect sampl assets that have environmental value federal 
officials told a congressional panel friday 
the resolution trust corp the agency set up last year to take 
over and dispose of failed thrift institutions has under its 
control 1853 sampl properties believed to have important 
environmental historical recreational or scientific value the 
properties have a total value of about 340 million the agency 
says 
the agency must engage in a balancing act between 
environmental concerns and the obligation to resolve the savings 
and loan crisis at the least cost to the taxpayer said peter h 
monroe president of the rtcs oversight board 
monroe appeared as a witness before the house task force on the 
rtc the panels chairman rep bruce f vento dminn accused 
the interior department of delaying its effort to help the rtc 
evaluate the environmentally sensitive properties 
the rtc is charged with protecting taxpayers by getting as much 
money as it can for the thrift assets it sells restrictions 
against commercial development on land tend to reduce its market 
value sharply 
some environmental activists see the governments control of 
those lands as a rare opportunity for promoting conservation 
the lands range from natural habitats of endangered wildlife to 
pocket parks in cities to condominium developments located near 
scenic sites a group of properties for example lies in the 
balcones canyonlands an area west of austin texas that is home 
to several endangered songbirds and other species 
the 1853 parcels many of them situated in texas arizona 
california and florida are a small proportion of the 36000 or so 
sampl properties under the rtcs control but they have stirred 
interest in congress and the environmental community 
its plain old common sense for a landowner to learn the value 
of a property before it is sold vento told the hearing lets 
make sure the seller is beware too 
the us fish and wildlife service and the rtc have drafted an 
agreement under which the service part of the interior department 
would review the rtcs inventory of properties the service then 
would recommend conservation restrictions on the use of properties 
that are considered environmentally sensitive 
the agreement was scheduled to be signed by officials from both 
agencies on aug 3 but it was put on hold indefinitely 
what we dont need with regard to the sampl bailout is more 
delay vento said addressing interior department official scott 
sewell another witness youve been dillydallying with it for 
the last five weeks 
sewell said the agreement has been held up by reviews within the 
interior department the need for computer software and the fact 
that the information were dealing with at this point is still 
not specific 
i know it seems like a snails pace he said we are 
proceeding with all due haste to work through the process 
rep stan parris of virginia the panels ranking republican 
cautioned that the environmental issue should be kept in 
perspective 
the special properties should be protected he said but we 
must be careful to balance that very desirable goal with the 
primary purpose of the rtc 
burdensome requirements on the thrift agency could slow the sampl 
bailout and scare off potential buyers of assets parris said 
some of the properties were commercially developed when they 
were in private hands since the laws governing land use are 
relatively lenient when assets are privately owned 
now that they are under government control and subject to 
stricter regulations environmentalists and historic 
preservationists want to seize the chance to protect them and to 
attach some conditions to their future sale 
its the greatest opportunity of the century to protect 
important environmental lands richard lowerre a project 
director at the texas center for policy studies in austin said in 
an interview 
vento has said he is seeking compatible use of the rtc 
properties some could be sold to state and local governments he 
said while others could be bought by private developers with some 
protective conservation measures included as a condition of sale

a littleknown political and business figure was 
named friday to replace premier li peng as shepherd of chinas 
stumbling economy 
it was not immediately known how the loss of the economic post 
could affect li 61 who faced criticism for his strict fiscal 
policies and his role in the 1989 crackdown on the nations 
prodemocracy movement 
the china news service said li asked to be relieved as minister 
of the state commission for restructuring the economy so he could 
concentrate on his duties as premier li took charge of the 
commission in 1988 the same year he became premier 
li remains one of chinas top leaders and the main person in 
charge of government policy on a daytoday basis 
radio beijing and china central broadcasting said lis 
replacement was chen jinhua 61 the china news service said chen 
was a longtime leader in economic work who had been president 
of the china national petrochemical corp since 1983 and held 
several political posts in shanghai 
lis austerity program has reduced inflation which peaked at 
about 40 percent in 1988 but it brought the nation to the brink of 
recession and forced millions of small factories to close 
the program also halted many marketoriented reforms and 
returned much of the economic decisionmaking power to the central 
government local and provincial goverments had gained a greater 
say in economic affairs during the past decade 
li was in the forefront of officials advocating a hard line 
against last years studentled prodemocracy efforts which ended 
when tanks and riot troops were ordered into beijings tiananmen 
square 
he was an opponent of former communist party general secretary 
zhao ziyang who pushed rapid economic reform but was ousted for 
allegedly supporting the prodemocracy protests 
li spent many years as an engineer in various ministries before 
being elevated to full membership in the party central committee in 
1978 
in 1987 li became a member of the powerwielding standing 
committee of the politburo 
the national peoples congress standing committee whose 135 
members meet between annual sessions of the full congress 
concluded an 11day session friday 
from 1977 to 1979 chen was a deputy chairman of shanghais

mikhail s gorbachev carries a bag full of 
troubles to helsinki 
hes attending a summit full of hope with the united states and 
the soviet union united in opposition to the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait it is the first time they have been on the same side of a 
global crisis since world war ii 
but at home gorbachevs popularity is plummeting the soviet 
economy is defying predictions it couldnt get worse and most of 
the 15 soviet republics including mother russia have declared 
sovereignty or independence from the communist government that 
gorbachev heads 
after the summit gorbachev is expected to rush back to moscow 
to present economic reforms that are likely to strip central 
authorities of much of their domestic power and largely dismember 
the state planning apparatus that josef stalin assembled at the 
cost of millions of lives 
despite the tumult on the home front soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze has hailed the sunday summit in helsinki as 
a landmark soviet media are describing it as a new phase in 
superpower cooperation 
history could well be made in helsinki 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said in an 
interview friday that the soviet union would be willing to send 
military forces to the middle east under a military staff committee 
that included officers from the five permanent members of the un 
security council the united states soviet union france britain 
and china 
the aim he said was not only to help the united states enforce 
security council sanctions against iraq but also to impose soviet 
controls on any unilateral military actions against iraq by the 
united states 
the implication is that despite the collapse of the soviet 
empire in eastern europe and the malaise at home the soviet union 
retains its superpower status 
but that view is not universally held andrei kortunov a young 
soviet scholar at the usacanada institute publicly classified his 
nation as a regular rather than a super power last june his 
analysis has been embraced by a number of respected american 
sovietologists 
the soviet union is not still a superpower at least as 
pertains to its capability of projecting global power in a 
lowviolence conflict of course it still has vast nuclear 
arsenals said marshall shulman a columbia university professor 
who is visiting moscow 
a senior western diplomat was more cautious simply saying it 
has been a multipower world for quite some time now 
the diplomat who spoke on condition that he not be further 
identified noted that even the united states generally seeks 
accord with its allies before exerting military muscle 
bush at least in requesting the meeting with gorbachev 
appears inclined not only to acknowledge the soviet union as a once 
and future superpower but to recognize gorbachev as the de facto 
leader of the reform movement in the soviet union 
gorbachev faces the threat of eclipse by boris yeltsin who last 
may 29 was elected to the newly created post of president of the 
russian federation the largest soviet republic 
the russian congress of peoples deputies quickly declared 
sovereignty asserting that its laws take precedence over 
soviet laws on russian territory and that the russian rather 
than the central soviet government controlled the republics vast 
natural resources 
the declaration stopped short of the independence proclaimed 
earlier by the three baltic republics but it paved the way for 
radical sovereignty decrees by other republics including the 
ukraine 
the independence and sovereignty movements promise to transform 
the shape of the soviet unions borders and government structure 
yeltsin is also having his way with economic reforms beating 
the gorbachev team in preparing a radical package to transfer 
economic decisionmaking powers away from central authorities to 
the republics 
yeltsin introduced his reforms to the russian parliament last 
monday whereas gorbachev is due to propose his to the national 
legislature next week monday at the earliest 
public pressure appears to have forced gorbachev to jettison a 
moderate reform package advocated by his ally prime minister 
nikolai ryzhkov in favor of a more radical version drafted by 
economist stanislav shatalin who is also credited with writing 
the reforms proposed by yeltsin 
gorbachevs spokesman vitaly ignatenko said the two programs 
would be very similar 
widespread consumer shortages five years into the gorbachev 
administration are fueling public anger against the soviet leader 
and his allies 
reformist moscow mayor gavriil popov who quit the communist 
party in july renewed calls on friday for the resignation of 
ryzhkov 
gorbachev who in the west is considered a reformer is viewed 
increasingly in the soviet union as a moderate or even 
conservative yeltsin hs overtaken gorbachev in popularity 
according to some polls

three leftist radicals pleaded guilty friday 
to bombing the us capitol and conspiring to set off explosions at 
eight locations in a twoyear campaign of armed propaganda to 
protest government policies 
marilyn j buck linda s evans and laura j whitehorn each 
pleaded guilty to maliciously damaging the us capitol by setting 
off a bomb on nov 7 1983 that blew a hole in the wall outside the 
senate chamber 
evans 43 told us district judge harold h greene that the 
bomb was exploded to protest the american invasion of grenada five 
paintings were damaged and the door to democratic leader robert 
byrds office was blown off its hinges 
the three women also pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb the 
capitol and seven other buildings in washington and new york 
between 1983 and 1985 in what whitehorn called an effort to 
resist and protest the unjust policies of the us government 
the charges carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison plus 
fines totaling 20000 greene scheduled sentencing for nov 28 
as part of the plea agreement charges will be dropped against 
three codefendants 
whitehorn 45 also pleaded guilty to possession of equipment to 
make fake identification documents stemming from an fbi raid in 
1985 on a baltimore apartment she shared with evans and buck that 
charge carries a fiveyear sentence 
in addition to fake identification documents authorities also 
found typewritten bombmaking instructions bearing evans 
fingerprints plus 15 pocket watches similar to the type used to 
detonate the capitol bomb nine watches were altered to be timing 
devices according to a statement of evidence from prosecutors 
all eight bombs bore marked similarities to each other and 
were triggered by altered pocket watches made by the same 
manufacturer the statement said 
the group variously identifying itself as the armed resistance 
unit the revolutionary fighting group and the red guerrilla 
resistance claimed responsibility for each of the bombings in 
communiques to news organizations 
evans buck and whitehorn have participated in radical 
activities since the 1960s when they were members of the students 
for a democratic society according to their spokeswoman judy 
greenspan 
none of the eight bombings caused any injuries 
after the proceedings were recessed about 50 supporters stood 
up in the courtroom and applauded the defendants who saluted them 
with raised fists 
outside the courthouse demonstrators chanted free all 
political prisoners as prosecutors held a news conference 
but us attorney jay b stephens told reporters that law 
enforcement agencies will not tolerate terrorism to direct the 
policies of our government 
prosecutors said that after the defendants are sentenced they 
will drop bombing charges against susan rosenberg timothy a blunk 
and alan berkman 
the government had legal problems with those cases because of a 
supreme court decision last may on the issue of double jeopardy 
according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the three defendants claimed prosecutors could not use evidence 
that was the basis of earlier convictions to prove they 
participated in the four washington bombings 
all six defendants except whitehorn are serving lengthy prison 
terms for possession of explosives or firearms 
buck 42 is serving a 50year prison term for participating in 
a string of armed robberies including a 1981 holdup of a armored 
car near nyack ny in which two policemen and a guard were 
killed she also was convicted of helping convicted murderer joanne 
chesimard escape from a new jersey prison in 1979 
evans is serving a 40year prison for illegally purchasing 
firearms 
rosenberg and blunk are serving 58year terms for possessing an 
arsenal of explosives they were caught loading into a rented 
storage bin in cherry hill nj in 1984 
berkman who suffers from hodgkins disease is serving a 10year 
prison term for possession of explosives and munitions authorities 
found in a garage in doylestown pa that is also linked to the 
bombings authorities said 
a seventh defendant in the case elizabeth duke is a fugitive

the school board has approved a plan to relax 
racial balance guidelines despite opposition from civil rights 
activists who said it would resegregate schools 
school busing was a major issue in last years city elections 
when voters passed an initiative asking the school board to ban 
busing to achieve racial balance 
the new plan approved 43 tuesday night allows 75 percent of a 
schools racial makeup to consist of any one racial group 
including whites the plan replaces a requirement that no more than 
50 percent of a schools enrollment be from one minority group 70 
percent from all minority groups or 65 percent white 
the new plan means a school could be 100 percent minority for 
example enrollment could be 75 percent black and 25 percent asian 
the naacp will do whatever is necessary including lawsuits 
to prevent the resegregation of seattle public schools said 
larry steele president of the seattle chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
supporters of the plan said it would reduce mandatory busing by 
allowing more minorities who are bused in greater numbers than are 
whites to attend their neighborhood schools it would also give 
whites more school choices 
i never have and never will favor resegregating the school 
district said board member ken eastlack who wrote the proposal 
all i want is equity its interesting that people feel more 
choice will result in segregation i dont think that will happen 
the new plan takes effect immediately but would not allow 
students to switch schools immediately an estimated 3000 students 
on a waiting list will have a chance of attending their preferred 
schools this fall after officials review the attendance at each 
school

more unmarried couples are buying homes 
together than at any time in the past according to a survey of 
major lenders conducted by the mortgage bankers association of 
america 
eightynine percent of those surveyed reported more mingles 
purchasing homes as compared to five years ago said james w 
nelson presidentelect of the trade association 
i suspect its the result of greater social acceptance on the 
one hand and recognition of the economic benefits both in terms 
of mortgage interest deductibility and home ownership he told a 
news conference 
nelson president of eberhardt co in minneapolis added that 
growth in sales to unmarried couples also is recognition by lenders 
that many are qualified and capable of handling the financial 
aspects of buying a home 
nelson also said the persian gulf crisis has pushed mortgage 
interest rates up onehalf of a percentage point since the aug 2 
iraqi invasion of kuwait 
this translates into about 40 more per month on a mortgage of 
100000 he said adding that the rate increase and tighter 
mortgage underwriting will exacerbate affordability problems for 
many firsttime homebuyers 
sixty percent of the 20 mortgage companies in the survey 
reported more stringent lending standards because of government 
requirements economic downturns in some markets and increased loan 
delinquencies 
it is likely that mortgage rates will stabilize at currently 
higher levels over the next few months and in the shortterm 
adjustable rate mortgage rates will look more attractive nelson 
said 
however we expect longterm rates to come back down somewhat 
once the outcome of the persian gulf crisis is resolved he 
continued adding if the shooting starts all bets are off

south african president fw de klerk who 
this week invited representatives of all races to negotiate a new 
constitution will meet with president bush on sept 24 the white 
house announced friday 
the two leaders are to discuss the current negotiating process 
underway in south africa and ways it may be encouraged white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater said in a statement 
de klerks government has been engaged in negotiations with the 
african national congress on power sharing under a government that 
would do away with the apartheid system of racial separation 
a june visit for de klerk had been set up at bushs invitation 
but the south african president canceled it indefinitely 
african national congress leader nelson mandela did visit with 
bush at the white house in june and addressed a joint session of 
congress during a us tour in which he was greeted with accolades 
everywhere 
mandela freed this year by de klerk after 27 years as a 
political prisoner has said his group does not object to the 
bushde klerk meeting as long as the united states maintains its 
economic sanctions against south africa to protest apartheid 
the white house announcement follows de klerks call for a new 
constitution and comes against a backdrop of tension stemming from 
the south african armys involvement in a township shooting that 
killed 11 people 
no south african leader has visited the united states since 
apartheid was implemented formally in the late 1940s officials 
there said 
de klerk recently called south africas antiapartheid course 
irreversible 
the government opened talks this year with the anc the main 
black opposition group on halting antigovernment violence and

moscows radical mayor blamed the central 
government friday for shortages of bread and cigarettes in the 
capital and joined the calls for soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov to 
resign press reports said 
ryzhkov said on soviet television friday night that the nations 
economic problems were due in part to lack of discipline by workers 
and disruptive strikes he said the government would take severe 
measures against disruptive workers 
moscows bread shortage was the result of increased demand by 
returning vacationers and students as well as panicbuying 
ryzhkov said apparently trying to steer the blame away from the 
government 
the political clock has speeded up sharply ryzhkov said 
we are aware that the national economy is in a very serious 
situation and tensions are growing all the time 
president mikhail s gorbachev called together economic experts 
earlier friday to work on combining a radical economic reform plan 
with the moderate one that ryzhkov prepared the tass news agency 
reported 
gorbachev is expected to submit a reform plan after the soviet 
parliament convenes monday the plan will be drafted in large part 
by stanislav shatalin a reformer who sits on gorbachevs 
presidential council apparently bypassing the proposal by ryzhkov 
reformers such as russian federation president boris n yeltsin 
have been pushing gorbachev to adopt a more radical plan than 
ryzhkovs 
moscow mayor gavriil popov at a session of the russian 
parliament sharply denounced the soviet government and accused it 
of trying to retain full control over the countrys economic life 
tass said 
he called on ryzhkov and the rest of the council of ministers 
or cabinet to resign popov said pressure for ryzhkovs 
resignation was growing across the country and a similar call would 
be made at the soviet parliament next week by a radical wing of 
legislators known as the interregional group tass reported 
during his televised talk ryzhkov did not address the calls for 
his resignation but vowed to stand by his economic plan 
if i believe in my decision i am going to defend it 
ryzhkov said 
popov also blasted the cabinet for barring the moscow city 
council from selling cigarettes at freemarket prices the 
introduction of commercial prices helped relieve the tobacco 
crisis in moscow in recent days tass quoted popov as saying 
the official price of a premium pack of soviet cigarettes rose 
this week to 3 rubles about 480 and newspapers reported 
consumers grumbled about the increase the old price for a premium 
pack of cigarettes was about 90 cents 
the government later prohibited the increase 
popov said that intervention was a violation of the sovereign 
rights of the city as a part of russia and that moscow intends to 
disregard the ruling the independent interfax news agency quoted 
him as saying 
the soviet union has been gripped all summer by the worst 
shortage of cigarettes in decades its causes range from the 
closure of factories for repairs to a lack of hard currency to buy 
usual quantities of cigarettes from bulgaria angry smokers have 
taken to the streets in moscow leningrad and elsewhere staging 
strikes and venting their outrage at local officials like popov as 
well as the national government 
in recent days there has also been a shortage of bread in 
moscow for the first time in more than 25 years the press blamed 
it on the sudden rise in demand when muscovites returned from their 
traditional august vacations 
popov said he believes the city needs to set up 500 to 600 small 
bakeries perhaps using the resources of some of the nations 
defense plants to deal with the shortage interfax reported the 
city council suggested that these bakeries be privatized and turned 
into family enterprises

yoga is a form of new age mysticism that can 
lead to devil worship says a man who led protests that forced 
officials to cancel a citycounty sponsored yoga class 
the people who are signed up for the class are just walking 
into it like cattle to a slaughter said philip lawrence half 
of yoga is a branch of eastern mysticism and it has strong occult 
influences 
lawrence said he is opposing the yoga class as a christian he 
said other people opposing the classes are from baptist lutheran 
and church of god congregations 
the class sponsored by the toccoastephens county recreation 
department was scheduled to begin monday it was canceled aug 31 
after city and county commissioners received a number of complaints 
from church members in toccoa 
the different commissioners got together on the phone and the 
majority decided the class should be canceled mayor bill harris 
said some felt that they were under too much pressure 
leonard greenspoon a clemson university religion professor 
said yoga has become a secularized form of exercise and relaxation 
theres certainly no necessary connection between yoga and 
devil worship he said anybody whos equating eastern religion 
with devil worship has made a big mistake 
roger terrell program director for the recreation department 
said he met with yoga teacher carolyn davis to make sure the class 
would involve only simple stretching and relaxation techniques 
we cant be promoting religion or anything he said its 
strictly for health reasons 
some of the 26 people who had signed up for the yoga class say 
they wont let the matter drop this is not the end said 
deborah hartley this is just the beginning as far as im 
concerned 
she and katherine hodges another wouldbe yoga student 
complained tuesday to the county commissioners she said she also 
plans to fight for the class at the next meetings of citycounty 
commissioners and the recreation board

army scientists are readying a littleknown 
star wars test in the south pacific that critics say brings the 
antimissile program close to violating a 1972 treaty outlawing 
major missile defenses 
monday morning a boeing 767 equipped with a 3ton infrared 
sensor is scheduled to depart boeing field in seattle for a twoday 
trip to kwajalein atoll an army missile test range in the pacific 
near the middle of the month the army wont give the exact 
date for security reasons the aircraft will make its first 
attempt to track a mock warhead on an intercontinental ballistic 
missile fired from vandenberg air force base calif 
the ability to use sensors to track incoming missiles and to 
distinguish between warheads and decoys is a key element of star 
wars which the pentagon hopes will be ready for deployment within 
a few years the government has spent about 20 billion on star 
wars since thenpresident reagan launched the project in 1983 
this months kwajalein test will be the start of an 
aggressive intensive series of flight tests for the airborne 
sensor over the coming 12 months col gary m stewart who manages 
the aircraft program at the armys strategic defense command 
headquarters at huntsville ala said in an interview friday 
a key question in the debate over the aircraft known as the 
airborne optical adjunct is whether it could substitute for an 
antiballistic missile radar which is prohibited by the 1972 abm 
treaty between the united states and the soviet union 
the pentagon says the aircraft is purely experimental and will 
not be deployed as part of a star wars system 
john pike head of space policy at the federation of american 
scientists and a star wars critic said it appears to be the 
functional equivalent of an abm radar 
pike said the soviets may be justified in questioning whether 
the airborne sensor is a treaty violation 
if we saw the russians doing this kind of thing we would be 
pretty bent out of shape about it and if the russians were giving 
the explanation we are we wouldnt believe them pike said 
stewart said the army is certain there is no treaty violation 
we are totally treatycompliant he said there are no 
open issues to debate 
the army says the airborne sensor is not a prototype for an 
antimissile sensor system it also argues that the aircraft could 
not substitute for an abm radar because of technical limitations in 
its infrared sensor and its onboard computers 
the aircrafts first flight was may 11 when it began a series 
of tests to observe stars and track satellites stewart said those 
tests which were completed aug 28 went smoothly and set the 
stage for the missiletracking test at kwajalein

a 118yearold federal mining law being 
considered for an overhaul by congress was criticized thursday as a 
taxpayer giveaway to business 
mining interests defended it however as necessary to the 
discovery of new mineral resources 
the law is obsolete consumer advocate ralph nader told a 
house subcommittee it shows disrespect for taxpayer assets he 
called it a giveaway program 
representing the miners point of view donald fife a geologist 
and chairman of the national inholders advisory board said a way 
of life for hundreds of thousands of citizens and a national asset 
for america would be destroyed by imprudent changes 
an inholder is a property owner whose land is surrounded by 
government land 
cy jamison director of the interior departments bureau of land 
management acknowledged that parts of the law need changing but 
said that in general it has worked well as an efficient and 
predictable basis for one of the worlds most successful hard rock 
mining industries 
the three men were among 41 witnesses presenting opinions about 
a bill introduced by rep nick rahall dwva that would increase 
fees to the government from prospecting for minerals on federal 
land and make other changes 
rahall is chairman of the house interior subcommittee on mining 
and natural resources 
an even more extensive bill introduced by sen dale bumpers 
dark is pending in the senate however congressional aides say 
work on the legislation will not be completed in either body this 
session 
the 1872 law frankly aimed at promoting mining governs the 
extraction on public lands of minerals such as gold silver 
copper lead and oil shale just about anything valuable except 
coal natural gas and liquid petroleum resources that fall under 
other laws and on which the government gets production royalties 
the federal government is a major landholder throughout the 
west in some states owning a majority of all land 
when rahall introduced his bill he said he was trying to 
modernize some of the more archaic provisions of the law that 
thwart efficient mineral exploration and development 
the proposed changes pit environmentalists and taxpayer interest 
groups against the mining industry 
under the law anyone may prospect and file a claim the claim 
gives the prospector exclusive rights to prospect and mine 
to maintain the claim the holder must perform 100 worth of 
work every year a figure unchanged since 1872 
miners who can show that they have found valuable minerals and 
have spent at least 500 on the claim may also but are not 
required to acquire title to the mine land by paying the 
government 250 or 5 per acre the federal government has sold 
32 million acres in this way since the laws enactment 
once the title is granted the miner owns the land outright and 
there is no requirement that a mine be worked 
the general accounting office which does investigations for 
congress found that 20 properties passing into private ownership 
since 1970 were estimated in 1988 to be worth between 138 million 
and 479 million the federal government received less than 4500 
for the titles 
last week the gao reported that many holders were living 
rentfree on claims while participating in unauthorized activities 
like storage of toxic chemicals and marijuana cultivation 
rahalls bill would require among other things that claim 
holders pay rent to the government each year of 150 per acre 5 
after the filing of a mining plan 
existing claims some have been outstanding for decades would 
have to be converted to ownership or abandoned within three years 
after mining is finished the miner would have to restore the 
land

a man whose arm was bitten off by an 
alligator in a national forest has been awarded 772870 in damages 
in his lawsuit against the federal government 
us district judge robert e varner of montgomery ordered the 
forest service to pay the money to kermit h george jr of florala 
georges arm was bitten of by a 500pound 11foot alligator on 
july 26 1986 while he was swimming in the conecuh national 
forest not far from his home near the floridaalabama line 
in a ruling released thursday the judge awarded 655200 for 
georges pain and suffering he was awarded 117670 for medical 
needs and other damages 
the decision followed an april 30 ruling in which varner found 
that the forest service had failed to place signs warning of danger 
despite having received complaints about alligators in the national 
forest 
he rejected government claims that george encouraged the attack 
by allowing his dog to run unleashed into the pond in violation of 
national forest rules the judge acknowledged that alligators 
enjoy dog meat but added that they are not discriminatory in 
their tastes and are well known to dine on whatever is convenient 
george who was 42 at the time was an experienced electronics 
engineer who also did land surveying and construction consulting 
part time he had been riding his bicycle and had stopped at a 
ropedoff swimming area to cool off he was in chestdeep water 
when he was attacked

kuwaits ousted royal rulers pledged 5 billion 
friday to support the usled campaign against iraq urging the 
united states to set a deadline for ending negotiations with saddam 
hussein 
kuwaitis inside kuwait are living a nightmare said yahya al 
sumait the designated spokesman for the ousted royal family he 
said peaceful measures were unlikely to resolve the crisis 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the united states 
would not foreclose any actions but we are not going to put any 
deadline there 
emir jabar alsabah offered the 5 billion to baker at a meeting 
in taif saudi arabia where the monarch has taken refuge 
half the money would help defray the 6 billion the united 
states anticipates spending on its military defense of the saudi 
oilfields by years end the other half would go to countries such 
as turkey and egypt which are suffering economic hardships because 
of the united nations embargo of iraq 
also friday treasury secretary nicholas brady won a pledges 
from japan and south korea to increase their support for the 
operation however no specifics were discussed 
baker here for talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak 
said he was pleased with the kuwaiti offer which followed an 
unspecified pledge thursday night of several billion dollars from 
king fahd of saudi arabia 
their attitude was very very forthcoming baker said of the 
kuwaitis whose rule of nearly 250 years was swept aside in iraqs 
lightning aug 2 invasion of the persian gulf oil state 
baker also said sheik zayid bin sultan al nahyan president of 
the united arab emirates took a very positive and constructive 
attitude when the aid issue was raised at a meeting friday in 
sunbaked abu dhabi 
however baker told reporters he didnt receive a final 
number from the united arab emirates a federation of seven 
emirates which also is protected by us warplanes 
the kuwaitis took an especially tough line toward iraq which 
seized the oilrich country in a bitter dispute that challenges 
kuwaits right to survive as a nation 
al sumait the kuwaiti spokesman said a deadline should be set 
for a negotiated settlement after which military action may be 
needed to expel the iraqi invaders 
we dont want to speak of any military action for the time 
being he said knowing this man saddam and knowing his 
actions and his intentions i dont believe that peaceful actions 
will end in any result 
asked when the deadline should be imposed al sumait said if 
it were up to me i would like to see it tomorrow 
earlier friday baker went to the saudi desert to visit a hanger 
built to resist a chemical weapons attack and house part of the 
us war machine 
we have weapons we have guns we have our crew chiefs we are 
ready to go lt col tommy crawford 41 of roswell nm said 
as he stood in front of the camouflaged f111 fighter plane that 
bombed libya in 1986 
the plane is being prepared to attack baghdad should the persian 
gulf crisis come to that alongside was another version of the 
f111 equipped with jamming devices from home air force base 
idaho 
the location of the base is a matter of national security and 
reporters accompanying baker were told to say only that it is 
somewhere in western saudi arabia 
from the distance the hangar looks somewhat like a sand dune 
giving no hint of the firepower inside

charges will be dropped against 65 haitians 
arrested when riot police used nightsticks to disperse protesters 
demonstrating against a clothing store the state attorneys office 
said friday 
the disputed facts and claims of selfdefense make it 
impossible to prove a criminal charge against anyone beyond and to 
the exclusion of a reasonable doubt assistant state attorney 
jerald bagley wrote in a memo 
charges also will be dropped against four other haitians 
arrested outside the rapid transit factory outlet a week earlier 
after a fight between a haitian customer and the son of the stores 
owner 
by dropping the charges we are getting one step closer to 
reuniting the community said philippe brutus an attorney for 
several of those arrested to prosecute would have added salt to 
the wounds 
haitians long have claimed they are discriminated against in 
immigration policy because their political asylum requests 
routinely are rejected and boatloads of refugees intercepted by the 
coast guard are returned to haiti 
store owner luis reyes said state attorney janet reno told him 
of the decision not to prosecute anyone in a telephone call tuesday 
the controversy began with a june 29 fistfight at the store 
between customer abner alezi and joe reyes the 16yearold son of 
the owner luis reyes 
after police arrested alezi and three others on trespassing 
charges 200 demonstrators clustered around the store in a sixhour 
standoff more than 500 demonstrators showed up at the store the 
next day 
on july 5 as television cameras rolled during a third protest 
police beat several demonstrators and arrested 65 people to 
disperse the crowd that refused to leave the shopping center in

ajp taylor britains most popular historian 
died friday after a long battle with parkinsons disease he was 84 
taylor who pundits said was a historian who saw history as more 
muddle than ideology wrote at least 30 books of history and 
biography 
taylor given to humorous expressions and a bow tie gained 
audiences of millions through plainspoken journalism and riveting 
television lectures on the russian revolution and other modern 
conflicts he often stood before the camera without notes or 
teleprompter talking nonstop for up to an hour 
taylors history stressed the importance of what he called the 
irrational the unpredictable and the unique and said his 
historical philosophy was things happen because they happen 
said michael foot former leader of the opposition labor party 
no one ever knew better how to spur the excitement of history 
taylors study of history in a 60year career convinced him that 
events are often shaped by accident his argument that adolf hitler 
was an opportunist who did not plan world war ii but blundered into 
it caused international controversy 
other historians denounced taylors stand put forward in his 
1961 book the origins of the second world war but taylor said 
a historian must write without preconceptions and on the basis of 
events as they happened 
i set out with the firm conviction inherited from my prewar 
years that hitler planned the war taylor wrote later 
i discovered or thought i discovered that hitler though no 
doubt resolved to make germany a world power had no clearcut plan 
how to do it and moved forward with the changing situation some 
critics were shocked by this and attributed to me all kinds of 
wickedness apologizing for hitler or justifying the later 
appeasement of soviet russia 
i had no such aims my historians conscience simply carried 
me in an unexpected direction i do not think any historian is 
worth his salt who has not had a similar experience 
taylor participated in events as well as writing about them a 
lifelong radical he was briefly a communist party member in 1926 
but then joined the labor party he marched for the campaign for 
nuclear disarmament 
in his 1983 autobiography a personal history he defined 
his politics as extreme views weakly held 
his most enduring book is english history 19141945 in the 
oxford history of england series 
taylor put in his 600page account often curious footnotes 
describing actors on the political stage including 
king george v 18651936 second son of edward vii married 
princess mary of teck 1893 king 191036 changed name of royal 
family from saxecoburg to windsor 1917 his trousers were creased 
at the sides not front and back 
taylor wrote that the abdication of king edward viii in 1936 was 
an event of no historical importance and described sir winston 
churchill as the savior of his country the first englishman to 
be so hailed since alfred the great the anglosaxon ruler who 
died 1000 years ago 
historian david marquand said taylors english history was a 
story of muddle folly and incompetence in high places redeemed 
only by the patience courage and decency of ordinary people 
alan john percivale taylor was born march 25 1906 in birkdale 
lancashire the son of a cotton manufacturer he studied at oxford 
university and became a lecturer there in international history and 
modern and english history 
taylors lively skill in turning history books into bestsellers 
won the favor of canadian newspaper magnate lord beaverbrook who 
gave him a platform in his masscirculation sunday express 
that and the popularity of taylors books such as struggle 
for mastery in europe aroused the antipathy of academics 
particularly jc masterman warden of new college oxford in the 
1950s masterman and others blocked taylor from receiving an oxford 
chair of modern history and then prevented him from becoming regius 
professor of modern history at oxford 
taylor is survived by four sons and two daughters from two 
marriages and by his third wife hungarian historian eva haraszti 
funeral arrangements were incomplete

saturday after the saturday charter the number of stranded

a titan 4 missile blew up 
at a rocket test site friday killing one person leaving one 
missing and sending up a huge mushroom cloud over the desert 
authorities said 
the titan 4 booster rocket exploded at the testing laboratory at 
about 1045 am said staff sgt thomas morgan 
the blast left one person dead and one missing said lt col 
rick oborn a spokesman at the pentagon 
oborn said an initial report from the scene indicated that the 
blast was due to the explosion of one of the stages of a titan 
missile booster 
the spokesman said one of the rockets stages was being moved 
was somehow dislodged or dropped and exploded upon impact 
it appears to have been one of the solid fuel sections of 
the booster oborn said 
the resulting plume was moving away from populated areas at an 
altitude that posed no immediate threat to residents morgan said 
there was a big cloud of smoke it was really bright said 
roberta martinson clerk at a convenience store in boron 
base officials contacted the california highway patrol which 
closed a 30mile stretch of highway 58 the road which runs across 
the north side of the base was reopened a short time later 
there were no evacuations of the area 70 miles northeast of los 
angeles said capt chris angelo of the kern county fire 
departments boron station 
it was high enough that we felt it wouldnt come down 
angelo said 
titan 4s built by martin marietta corp are considered the air 
forces primary booster for launching its heavy payloads into space 
the second titan 4 built worth 173 million was launched june 
8 from cape canaveral fla carrying a secret surveillance 
satellite into orbit the first was launched on june 14 1989 
boosting what analysts said was either a missilewarning satellite 
or an electronic eavesdropping satellite 
ten launches had been planned during 199091 but six were 
postponed because of delays in preparing launch sites and taking 
delivery of the rockets as of june the air force said it planned 
two more titan 4 launches this year 
the pentagon also has said it plans to launch 10 titan 4s 
annually by 1995 
the air force initially planned to build only 10 titan 4s to 
complement the space shuttle as a way to launch heavy payloads but 
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle challenger and killed 
seven crew members prompted the pentagon to decide to obtain many 
more 
the shuttle can put a 52000pound payload into orbit the titan 
4 which stands 20 stories tall can lift a 39000pound cargo into 
low earth orbit or a 10000pound payload to a fixed orbit 22300 
miles high 
as of june the air force had let contracts for construction of 
41 titan 4s and had funds available for nine more the service 
planned to procure 100 titan 4s by the year 2000

republican us senate candidate lynn 
martin is willing to dip into her campaign funds to reimburse 
people confused by a national gop groups fundraising appeal her 
campaign says 
martin a fiveterm house member who is challenging democratic 
sen paul simon joined other top illinois republicans in 
questioning a recent mailing of 25 checks by the national 
republican senatorial committee the committee helps elect 
republicans to the senate 
cashing one of the checks authorizes the committee to withdraw 
1250 a month from the recipients checking account fine print on 
the back of each check says the person endorsing it also is 
authorizing the automatic electronic transfer of funds 
the fundraising letter was mailed to 700000 people nationwide 
martin campaign spokeswoman kathy lydon said thursday that 
martin sent the gop committee a letter encouraging it to use a 
larger disclaimer and to live up to its pledge of a moneyback 
guarantee to dissatisfied donors 
ms lydon said the martin campaign fund would reimburse anyone 
who does not quickly obtain a refund sought from the national 
senatorial committee 
gop gubernatorial candidate jim edgar said he disagreed with the 
way the committee solicited funds and said it should have made a 
more direct appeal for contributions 
republican gov james r thompson also criticized the letter 
saying if you want to ask people for money simply ask them for 
money

his partys nomination republican gov bob martinez launched a 
television commercial tweaking his democratic rival for retiring 
from the us senate 
bob martinez never quits and walks away the ad says a 
reference to lawton chiles decision in 1987 not to seek 
reelection to the senate 
julie fletcher a spokeswoman for the chiles campaign said 
martinez was picking up on a negative theme that backfired on us 
rep bill nelson in his attempt to defeat chiles in the democratic 
primary 
i think its also a notsothinly veiled slap at lawton for 
walking away from the senate she said 
the 30second commercial touting martinez as offering 
leadership you can count on debuted statewide thursday it 
portrays the governor as a fighter and leader who can be counted 
on although it acknowledges that he hasnt won all his fights 
to the extent his endurance and his being a fighter contrasts 
favorably with lawton having quit the senate thats a plus but

edward bowles an electrical engineer and 
microwave specialist who played a key role in spurring allied 
development of radar technology in world war ii has died at age 92 
bowles who died wednesday had suffered from parkinsons diease 
and a series of strokes his family said 
during the war bowles worked as a consultant to secretary of 
war henry stimson and became a liaison between washington and radar 
scientists working at the radiation laboratory at the massachusetts 
institute of technology 
bowles who specialized in microwave technology at mit set up a 
laboratory at langley field va where army air corps bombers were 
equipped with mitdeveloped radar 
british scientists were first to develop radar based on the 
theories of james clerk maxwell a british mathematician and 
physicist who predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves 
that travel at the speed of light 
in 1935 the british has developed pulse techniques to locate 
aircraft up to 17 miles away by 1940 englands groundbased radar 
stations were a decisive element in winning the battle of britain 
but in 1944 germany began attacking london with its jetpowered 
buzz bombs the first cruise missile and the british asked 
for us help 
langley had developed groundbased systems that could track an 
airplane or buzz bomb by radar plot its course and then tell the 
guns where to point and shoot in order to have the best chance of 
hitting the target said albert hill 80 a former radiation lab 
scientist and mit professor 
bowles then bypassed regulations that would have delayed the 
shipment of necessary equipment 
we were loading the requisite materials on ships the next 
morning bowles recalled in an interview with the washington 
university magazine a decade ago the result was that thereafter 
we destroyed above 90 percent of the buzz bombs 
a native of westphalia mo bowles received his bachelors 
degree from washington university in st louis and a masters from 
mit where he began teaching in 1921 
bowles pioneered the development of a method for maintaining a 
precise radio frequency using a tuning fork he began a division 
of electrical communications at mit in the mid1920s 
in 1945 he was awarded the distinguished service medal for his 
wartime service an honor usually reserved for military personnel

japan and south korea joined kuwait on friday in 
pledging to contribute to the massive costs of the economic and 
military campaign in the persian gulf 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and secretary of state james 
a baker iii solicited the promises on separate global fundraising 
expeditions 
they were seeking support for an american plan that needs more 
than 25 billion to defray the costs of the us troop buildup and 
to provide emergency economic relief to countries hurt by the 
unsponsored trade sanctions against iraq 
administration officials returning to the united states after 
bradys fourday whirlwind trip were upbeat about the chances of 
ultimate success although one conceded that full acceptance of the 
plan might take a little longer than we had hoped 
in saudi arabia kuwaits ousted royal rulers pledged 5 
billion while one us official said japan was being asked for 
billions of dollars 
none of the other world leaders brady lobbied this week provided 
any specifics on what they would pledge saying in most cases that 
they needed more time to review the request 
our principal message throughout this trip has been that there 
is a cost which all must share in maintaining a freely flowing 
source of oil at a price determined by market forces brady said 
the united states estimates it will cost about 1 billion a 
month to keep american troops in the mideast with 105 billion 
urgently needed to alleviate serious hardships in jordan egypt and 
turkey 
brady met for about an hour with prime minister toshiki kaifu as 
he tried to persuade japan to contribute more than the 1 billion 
package of military support it already has pledged 
i think japan will not disappoint you japanese foreign 
ministry spokesman yukio okamoto said after the meeting but 
offered no specifics 
in saudi arabia kuwaits exiled monarch jabir alsabah said 
we will not spare any amount or any value we will give whatever 
is necessary 
alsabahs regime already has pledged to compensate turkey for 
losses of up to 2 billion from the shutdown of an iraqi oil 
pipeline and the exiled leader also said his government would 
contribute to the cost of the american military buildup 
but a spokesman for the kuwaiti royal family also urged the 
united states to set a deadline for ending negotiations with saddam 
hussein 
baker said the united states would not foreclose any actions 
but we are not going to put any deadline there 
on thursday saudi arabia promised several billion dollars 
toward the operation protecting the kingdoms oil fields from iraqi 
aggression 
alsabah kaifu and south korean president roh taewoo joined 
french officials and british prime minister margaret thatcher in 
promising to help pay the costs of the military operation 
brady said he was pleased with the endorsements from japan and 
south korea 
before brady arrived japan announced it would provide an 
additional 12 million to assist the thousands of refugees fleeing 
the middle east and repeated a pledge to provide direct economic 
assistance to countries hard hit by the trade embargo 
officials traveling with brady who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said the total being sought from japan was higher than 
2 billion with one official saying the request was for billions 
of dollars 
a third american official said the japanese had a lot of 
questions about how the money would be used but added he 
wouldnt be surprised if we got very close to the figure being 
sought 
brady met earlier friday with roh in seoul south korea amid 
reports that country is reluctant to commit significant resources 
against iraqi president saddam hussein because officials fear 
jeopardizing construction contracts in iraq and kuwait worth more 
than 1 billion 
at a news conference in seoul brady said roh raised those 
concerns in a tangential way brady said he pointed out the 
huge stake south korea has in keeping the price of oil from 
escalating 
every 10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil means a 
25 billion cost to the korean economy brady said 
he said a similar increase would cost the japanese economy 
nearly 20 billion

least two assailants his girlfriend was in bed with him at the 
time of the shooting police said 
the mans companion her two children and a friend spending the 
night at the south belfast house were unharmed police said 
police detectives said the dead man identified as emmanuel 
shields had no connection to the security forces and they were 
afraid the killing was a random attack by protestant loyalists 
on wednesday the outlawed ulster freedom fighters threatened to 
kill catholic workers after the irish republican army shot and 
wounded two men on their way to work in county tyrone 
the apprentice boys of derry meanwhile said the rev ian 
paisley and four others had been expelled from the group a major 
northern ireland protestant organization because they publicly 
opposed asking for money from a fund set up under the angloirish 
agreement to build a heritage center 
the 1985 angloirish accord angered some of the leaders of 
northern irelands protestant majority by giving the roman catholic 
irish republic a consultative role in the administration of the 
british province 
derek miller general secretary of the apprentice boys said the 
five men had broken the rules of the 9000member loyalist 
organization of clubs which commemorate protestants shutting the 
gates of londonderry to the advancing catholic king james in 1688

the littleknown state representative 
battling political giant gordon humphrey for a state senate 
nomination charged friday that humphrey is splitting the party for 
personal political gain 
jack sherburne said humphrey who is retiring from the us 
senate and running for the new hampshire senate has fragmented the 
party with his ultraconservative views and call for a tax revolt 
he is the wouldbe head of a maverick republican wing with 
little or no social conscience sherburne said at a news 
conference he is so conservative that he has held himself aloof 
from the republicans in congress and been largely ineffective as a 
us senator 
humphrey 49 is known as a maverick during his 12 years in 
washington he has often clashed with republican congressional 
leaders because of his strong views he gave up almost certain 
reelection to stick to a campaign promise that he would serve no 
more than two terms in washington 
sherburne said he believes humphrey wants to use the state 
senate as a springboard to run for governor and eventually 
president 
hes got a national agenda in mind sherburne said hes 
the darling of the ultraconservatives and thats the role hes 
playing hes staying in government to become governor and then run 
for president 
humphrey has said he is interested in becoming governor but 
that he wouldnt challenge his friend gov judd gregg he hasnt 
mentioned presidential aspirations a call to humphreys washington 
office for comment was not immediately returned friday 
due in large part to his greater name recognition humphrey is 
favored in tuesdays primary but observers say an upset is 
possible in part because the candidates differ sharply on abortion 
humphrey is one of the senates staunchest opponents of legal 
abortion while sherburne is prochoice 
sherburne said humphreys call for a tax revolt in new hampshire 
is ridiculous he said new hampshire already ranks among the lowest 
states in per capita taxation while its personal income is among 
the highest 
here comes gordon humphrey the former virginia democrat a 
converted extremist from washington who wants a tax revolt a 
revolt against what sherburne asked

since they first darkened the world men and women have 
debated whether they should be permissible as a matter of 
conscience you argue they should not and many agree but many no 
doubt reluctantly do not agree 
we live in a democracy as do the americans and in a 
democracy the right way to deal with matters of conscience as law

a 22yearold woman apparently 
infected with aids while getting a tooth pulled urged stricter 
control of the health care industry friday the same day her 
dentists death was revealed 
david johnson acer 40 of stuart died monday of acquire immune 
deficiency syndrome but his family waited to make this 
announcement so they could privately grieve lawyer deborah 
sawyer said she refused to elaborate 
on tuesday the state health department released a letter acer 
wrote to former patients urging them to be tested for the deadly 
virus 
meanwhile the patient acer is accused of infecting came forward 
friday to urge stricter regulation of the health care industry 
kimberly bergalis 22 of fort pierce said she would sue the late 
dentists estate and her own insurance company for malpractice 
what weve gone through is an injustice said ms bergalis 
who in earlier court papers revealed only her initials if this 
can be prevented if new guidelines can be established to prevent 
this from happening again then i think thats what needs to be 
done 
the national centers for disease control reported last month 
that ms bergalis case marked the first time a health professional 
had passed aids to a patient she was apparently infected while 
having a tooth pulled in 1987 
ms bergalis was diagnosed in december 1989 with the virus that 
causes aids the illness forced her withdrawal from the university 
of florida and documents filed in state court in palm beach 
described her as being in the diseases advanced stages 
ms bergalis criticized the cdc saying she never heard back 
from the three officials who investigated her case 
i was watching the news she said i didnt know what to 
think i assumed either that they had dropped my case or they had 
found something and just never did disclose what they had found 
with me 
cdc officials in atlanta refused to comment citing 
confidentiality rules 
acer acknowledged in a letter dated aug 31 and made public 
tuesday that he was the dentist involved but said he had 
followed cdc safety guidelines including consulting his doctor 
before continuing his practice and wearing gloves and a mask while 
treating patients he said he doubted he was the source of 
bergalis infection 
but ms bergalis lawyer robert montgomery questioned the late 
dentists ethics 
i would like to know who his peers were that he consulted 
prior to continuing to treat patients with hiv positive 
montgomery said 
montgomery said he planned to sue acers estate and cigna dental 
health of florida on ms bergalis behalf he did not say when the 
suit would be filed 
cigna referred bergalis to acer who treated about 370 patients 
belonging to the dental plan 
health officials received more than 100 telephone calls after 
the state department of health and rehabilitative services released 
acers letter tuesday it was unclear how many he sent to former 
patients 
i am a gentle man and i would never intentionally expose 
anyone to this disease he wrote 
the letter did not say how long acer practiced after being 
diagnosed with aids 
the cleveland native graduated from the ohio state university 
dental school in 1973 and served as an air force dentist leaving 
as a captain in 1976 state records show he was certified to 
practice in florida in august 1976

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said 
friday he is willing to go to iraq to help settle the persian gulf 
crisis tass reported 
in an interview with soviet journalists while flying home from 
an official visit to japan he said he expected presidents bush and 
mikhail gorbachev would discuss at the helsinki summit sunday how 
to influence events in the gulf by working with other arab 
countries 
we expect that a substantial discussion will be held in the 
capital of finland relating to ways to stimulate the arab factor in 
order to overcome the crisis shevardnadze was quoted as saying 
by the official news agency 
we shall seek to combine the efforts of those with whom we 
have good relations and those with whom the united states has good 
relations in order to find a way out of the crisis he said 
shevardnadze again proposed an international conference on the 
gulf that also would take up the arabisraeli conflict and lebanon 
if the need arises i am ready to travel to iraq tass 
quoted him as saying 
shevardnadze first proposed the conference tuesday in 
vladivostok 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said he would consider 
participating in such a conference but emphasized his refusal to 
discuss the palestinian question at such a forum 
shevardnadze on friday again raised the possibility of such a 
meeting and suggested convening it in three stages tass said 
if only we succeeded in convoking such a conference with the 
participation of the conflicting sides un security council 
membercountries and maybe some others it would become possible 
to consider the persian gulf situation already at its first stage 
while devoting the second stage to the consideration of the 
situation on the occupied arab territories ie the whole set of 
problems relating to the arabisraeli conflict tass quoted him 
as saying 
the third stage of the conference would discuss lebanon and 
this conference would undoubtedly stress the role of the arab 
factor he said 
he said he knew secretary of state james a baker iii views his 
plan without much enthusiasm but i think one should not be 
scared by this idea 
israel has vehemently opposed soviet ideas to hold an 
international conference to resolve the arabisraeli conflict and 
shevardnadze acknowledged this 
it will probably be necessary to do some work with israel at 
the ministerial level he added but i want to reiterate there 
is no need to fear such a conference 
what needs to be feared is the consequences of an exacerbated 
conflict shevardnadze said according to tass 
shevardnadze said settling the crisis via the un security 
council is a top priority but he added if a more resolute 
action is needed the un military staff committee should be 
used according to tass 
earlier friday foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov 
said the soviet union would be willing to provide troops for a un 
peacekeeping force in the gulf if they were under a joint command 
that included soviet generals 
although iraq is a longtime ally of the soviet union gorbachev 
halted the flow of soviet arms to iraq after moscow condemned 
baghdads aug 2 invasion of kuwait

60s and sikaye ag ekawel director of a governmentsponsored food 
aid project in kidal

arrest of four men and the dismantling of an operation that 
distributed asian heroin 
the dea displayed the haul estimated to be worth up to 6 
million at a news conference attended by mayor david dinkins who 
has been criticized as failing to deal with crime in the city 
the total recovered in 28 bags some too heavy for one person to 
carry was in the 4 5 6million range said robert a 
bryden the federal agencys new york chief 
bryden said it would take four or five days to count all the 
money piled like bricks on conference tables and guarded by two 
agents carrying submachine guns

the multiagency operation 
its very easy for us in washington to declare the war he

the mayor said when that police department does not do well i 
clearly get the blame 
brown said the number of heroin arrests in the city had doubled 
over the past 18 months he called the high number of heroin users

continued high level of crack use

did not know where it entered the united states 
those arrested held for arraignment in brooklyn on charges of 
conspiring to distribute heroin were identified as ken lee sak

about 225000 egyptians waited friday 
at the iraqi border to cross into jordan but they were held back 
because jordan cannot cope with the 100000 refugees already 
stranded in its desert a border official said 
a un relief official warned the refugee problem could explode 
into a human tragedy 
four tons of canned beef from the netherlands were sent to 
laboratories for testing friday after tons of cookies powdered 
milk and dates sent to hungry refugees were deemed unfit for human 
consumption 
the worthless food was the latest in a series problems 
confronting the people trying to ease the misery of 45000 asian 
refugees packed into the makeshift shaalan i camp here 
fights have broken out in this and other camps jampacked with 
hungry refugees who fled iraq and kuwait after iraq invaded aug 2 
they scramble and jostle for a meager daily ration of a piece of 
bread a tomato and a cucumber 
red cross officials and others say some refugees have gone for 
up to three days with little water food or shelter 
the jordanian border official who requested anonymity said the 
egyptians were stranded in a huge camp just inside the iraqi border 
they are waiting under terrible conditions for permission to 
cross into jordan to continue their journey home the official 
said who cannot be named under regulations 
but we cannot cope with such huge numbers before the asian 
evacuees already inside jordan waiting for transportation to their 
homes are shifted he added 
he said 18325 crossed through this post during the day 
james n purcell director of the un international 
organization for migration appealed urgently for ships and 
aircraft to repatriate the asians squatting in hot and dirty camps 
before human suffering becomes a human tragedy 
jordanian officials are doing their best to stretch meager 
resources while awaiting international help to care for the nearly 
100000 refugees already in the country 
on wednesday jordan ordered 10 tons of dates returned to egypt 
after they were tested and found to be too old and hard to eat 
forty more tons were on the way to jordan and authorities said 
they too probably would be sent back 
rahib moussa an official with jordans ministry of supply said 
friday it would take at least a day for a laboratory to inspect the 
canned beef only the second shipment of outside aid received at 
shaalan i near the iraqi border 
india earlier donated 10000 sandwiches and 5000 barrels of 
water he said 
most of the refugees crammed into tents at the shaalan i camp 
are bangladeshi pakistani indian and sri lankan men many of the 
women and children are being sent to refugee camps in amman moussa 
said 
on friday at least 2000 people stood in a seemingly endless 
line that snaked through the hot sand those patient enough waited 
for hours under the scorching sun for a piece of bread slice of 
cheese and tomato provided by the government 
moussa said the government plans to speed up the distribution at 
the camp by creating seven feeding stations instead of just one on 
friday a nun from mother teresas order stood by offering words of 
encouragement and sympathy 
at a tent hospital set up by the red crossred crescent dr 
khaled issa said 2000 people a day come in for treatment most are 
suffering dehydration colds and other minor illnesses but in the 
harsh camp conditions minor ailments can rapidly become 
lifethreatening 
issa said those who are sick should drink 5 gallons of water a 
day much more than is available 
a fivemember delegation from the european parliament toured 
jordans camps and said friday they were appalled by the 
conditions one member of the delegation called on european nations 
to provide military transport planes to airlift the refugees home 
frances minister for humanitarian aid bernard kouchner 
speaking to reporters in amman said 10000 more people arrive 
every day in jordan from kuwait and iraq jordanian officials 
estimate the number of new arrivals at about 18000 nobody really 
knows 
official estimates say more than 250000 foreigners mostly 
asians have crossed the desert border post at reweishid since aug

christian brandos defense lawyer 
has asked a court to reduce the murder charge against him to 
manslaughter 
another motion filed wednesday in superior court seeks to 
suppress a taperecorded police interview of brando the son of 
actor marlon brando 
attorney robert shapiro will argue the motions before superior 
court judge robert thomas on sept 14 said sandi gibbons 
spokeswoman for the district attorneys office 
brando 32 pleaded innocent to firstdegree murder in the may 
16 shooting of dag drollet 26 the boyfriend of christians 
halfsister cheyenne he was found dead in marlon brandos hilltop 
bel air estate 
trial is set for oct 1 
shapiro argued unsuccessfully during a preliminary hearing that 
the murder charge should be reduced to manslaughter because there 
was no evidence brando intended to kill drollet 
the attorney cited statements christian brando made to police 
that the shooting occurred accidentally while he and drollet 
struggled for a gun 
prosecutors have cited reports that drollet was clutching a tv 
remote control device and other items when his body was discovered 
shapiro filed the motion seeking to suppress the recorded 
interview even though a judge has ruled the statements cannot be 
used because a police detective failed to advise brando of his 
right to a courtappointed attorney 
brando was released from jail last month after his father met 2 
million bail by posting the deed to his estate

throughout europe and the middle east with americans and american

iraq support for terrorist groups also endangers us 
interests in other regions although to a lesser extent the 
department said 
such attacks would become more likely if hostilities were to 
occur in the persian gulf region the united states would view with 
utmost seriousness any iraqisponsored terrorist attack 
the department said it would provide additional information to 
overseas travelers or other concerned parties if it received 
specific credible information on a threat to overseas american

iran

the international league for human rights said three of its 
unapproved delegation of five were prevented from taking part in 
the weeklong seventh congress on crime in havana cubas capital

havana residents 
yndamiro restano is a member of the cuban commission for human

officials and may suffer reprisals after the conference 
concludes 
it quoted league board member robert cox another of its 
delegates in havana as saying the five were harassed 
intimidated and threatened throughout the meeting and that 
state security groups appear to be out of control 
security guards challenged the delegates on the grounds that 
the three two of whom are lawyers and all of whom are experts on 
criminal justice in cuba were connected to human rights 
organizations in cuba that are not officially recognized by the 
government the league said 
it said one of the cubans was physically pushed out of the 
conference hall and all three were physically detained 
temporarily by security police in a hall off the conference site 
the league quoted cox as saying that security official felipe 
zilla intimated to him that mrs restano was in danger 
cuban acting foreign minister rolando lopes del amo threatened 
both cox and the league saying his government would oppose the 
leagues continued consultative status at the united nations the 
league said

british empire for denouncing rights abuses by rightwing military 
regimes during argentinas dirty war against suspected leftist 
subversives in the 1970s

that cough of camilles has been a siren song 
for some of the worlds bestknown actresses and singers from 
sarah bernhardt to eleanora duse to greta garbo to maria callas 
the consumptive courtesan who dies for love has been a staple on 
stage on screen and in the opera house 
but move over ladies everett quinton has made the role his own 
in charles ludlams giddy giggly adaptation of camille that 
resurfaced thursday at offbroadways ridiculous theatrical company 
ludlum who died in 1987 originally starred as camille 17 years 
ago in the troupes tiny sheridan square theater by all accounts 
his performance was definitive but quinton ludlums successor as 
head of the ridiculous theater is a worthy and very funny 
replacement 
in fact with this role quinton moves out from ludlums shadow 
and into the spotlight as a firstrate clown an expressive lead 
performer who knows when to go for pathos or a pratfall 
the actor has a quizzical comic face highlighted by a grand 
canyonsize mouth as camille he can be haughty even slighty 
malevolent but you know its all in fun here dressed in 
elizabeth frieds outlandish costumes and sporting a dark wig of 
what appears to be tightly coiled mattress springs he resembles 
agnes moorehead crossed with martha raye 
ludlums version of the alexandre dumas tearjerker veers all 
over the map from high camp to poignant melodrama but the 
adapter never lost sight of the basic story of a woman sacrificing 
herself for the man she loved and quinton who also doubles as 
director doesnt either 
he keeps a firm hand on the production not letting the play get 
too moist or too wild a menagerie of distinctive character actors 
offer some memorable portraits particularly stephen pell as 
nanine the everloyal maid hm koutoukas as a lascivious baron 
and georg osterman as camilles true love 
camille ranks as one of ludlams best efforts and quinton 
has managed to preserve the laughter and a bit of the tears and 
much of the fun comes from his own splendid performance

there is a certain grim fascination in watching money talks 
a fascination not unlike driving by an auto accident on the 
interstate and wondering how and why it happened 
this dumb comedy by edwin schloss which arrived thursday at 
offbroadways promenade theater is something the new york theater 
hasnt seen in a while a vanity production that seems to have 
been produced more for the benefit of the playwright than for the 
audience it never should have opened 
money talks which reportedly cost 500000 has an 
elaborate yet ugly set and a cast of 11 actors most prominent 
among them are dolores gray and helen gallagher two formidable 
musical comedy stars 
the plot revolves around several wealthy manhattan matrons who 
invest in the stock market the jokes died before vaudeville 
nature abhors a vacuum 
so does my cleaning lady 
the direction is nonexistent and the acting except for the 
unsinkable miss gallagher hard to watch 
the evening strings together a series of low points that reach 
death valley level in the second act when the matrons dressed in 
black for a funeral parade across the stage to ravels bolero 
where is bo derek when you really need her 
miss gray gets to sing a bit of an old irving berlin song 
marrying for love at the end of the show the diversion 
doesnt help but does remind audiences that the woman should be 
back in the musical theater instead of appearing in such disasters 
as money talks

gun control supporters are calling for a 
nationwide ban on bringing firearms within 1000 feet of schools 
but federal officials say it would be virtually impossible to 
enforce 
passage of this bill will enable our children and their 
teachers to travel to and from schools without an overriding 
fear for their personal safety cleveland police chief edward p 
kovacic said thursday 
he urged the house judiciary committees subcommittee on crime 
to approve the bill which is similar to provisions included in an 
omnibus crime package already approved by the senate 
bringing a gun within 1000 yards of a schoolyard would be 
punishable by a maximum fiveyear sentence under the measure 
the bill reflects growing concern over gun incidents on school 
grounds in recent years including multiple slayings of youngsters

it is peaceful in the seminary as it was 
through times of partition before the communists and after they 
fell and when rigid economics was left behind on the bumpy road to 
a free market 
the only sounds reaching the office are the gentle swish of long 
black robes as priests glide across the marble floor in sandals 
and the chirping of swallows that inhabit lush inner courtyards 
thick with ferns red petunias and lavender geraniums 
priestly routine in poland one of only five countries where the 
number of roman catholic seminary students has risen steadily the 
last decade bears little resemblance to the difficult uncertain 
life on the outside 
while the church generally faces a chronic shortage of priests 
the number in this country rose from 20234 in 1980 to 24678 in 
1989 according to the polish episcopate office 
that works out to one priest for 1280 church members compared 
with 1650 members per priest in the united states 
burundi rwanda zaire and india are the only other countries 
with net increases in recent years 
church officials give many reasons young men are attracted to 
the priesthood in poland where more than 90 percent of the people 
are catholics most obvious is a desire to follow the path of the 
polish pope john paul ii whose image is displayed over shop 
doors in cars even on key chains 
john paul is beloved everywhere but especially here said 
the rev szymon stefanowicz of the jasna gora monastery in 
czestochowa site of polands holiest shrine is it any wonder 
young men want to be like him he is such a good force in this 
world 
being a priest is a mark of prestige in poland enrollment of a 
son in the seminary is as much a cause for celebration as an 
american childs acceptance into law or medical school 
although church officials stress the compulsion to answer gods 
call some acknowledge the attraction also may be practical 
since world war ii families have had to wait decades for 
apartments telephones and cars until the economic reforms of 
january they had to spend hours in line for such essentials as 
milk and eggs 
in contrast seminaries offered secure housing intellectual 
opportunities and a chance to travel outside the soviet bloc 
several priests who spoke on condtion of anonymity said 
semimaries were havens of safety and comparative comfort through 
the bad times 
outside the dangers of communist rule now have been replaced by 
painful aspects of the shock therapy economic plan 
inflation is more than 170 percent so far this year and 
unemployment unknown under the communists has reached 4 percent 
in the west children are born with everything television 
computers and cars said brother marian laskowski a 24yearold 
monk from elblag in northern poland in poland we are born with 
very little 
laskowski said he chose the seminary because he is drawn to god 
but admitted to occasional doubts 
i see people come here wearing short sleeves and short pants 
and i am spending the best years of my life between these cold 
marble walls he said the monk dressed in a heavy robe was 
tending a stand at st johns cathedral in warsaw that sells icons 
and religious postcards 
brother maciek gaup also 24 said his decision was made at an 
early age poland is a very spiritual country he said our 
religion is very very strong and old 
even when the communists were in power poland moved to the 
rhythms of the roman catholic church 
in the soviet union those who worshiped openly faced 
persecution and the orthodox church was strictly controlled in 
poland the church withstood the repression and becoming a powerful 
rival of the regime 
during martial law in 198183 the pulpit was a bastion of 
dissent the rev jerzy popieluszko the solidarity priest 
murdered by secret policemen in 1984 is revered as a martyr 
worshipers fill churches each sunday construction of religious 
buildings in many predominantly catholic countries has all but 
stopped but nearly 1000 churches and other religious buildings 
have been erected in poland since 1985 
the rev henryk kietlinski deputy superior of the pallotines 
one of the countrys most popular religious orders interviews 
hundreds of young men who apply for adminission to its seminary 
each year 
many of them are very excited about passing on the pastoral 
word in todays world he said others want to give service to 
the world and others are excited about the possibility of 
missionary work in other countries 
those who become missionaries are able to live abroad and 
learn other languages promote culture in places like brazil 
central africa and asia 
poland is one of the few countries with enough priests to send 
some of them abroad 
travel by priests was almost unrestricted under the communists 
but they made it extremely difficult for most other poles to 
venture outside the soviet bloc 
now that poland is democratic a goal the church helped achieve 
some catholic officials fear growing western influence will deter 
young men from the priesthood 
records and videos of madonna whose catholic allusions the 
church calls blasphemous are best sellers sex shops and 
pornography once taboo are cropping up in all but the smallest 
villages 
more and more of todays youth is intellectually weak 
kietlinski said this comes from thoughtless television shows 
bad videos poorly organized free time and bad family attitudes 
the church he said intends to reverse the trend with a series 
of positive television programs developed by young priests in 
august the government announced the return of voluntary religious 
classes to primary and secondary schools a move largely prompted 
by church officials

andrew lanyi and his researchers study as many 
as 30000 earnings reports a year seeking what they hope will 
become bluechip investments but you wont find a single blue chip 
in their portfolio 
the reason lanyi tries to detect the faint hue of blue before 
it deepens to search out small growing companies that seem 
destined to become highquality stocks to discover tomorrows blue 
chips today 
somewhere out there are the new mcdonalds or hampr blocks or 
automatic data processings companies that developed repeat 
businesses that perfected repetitous production of products 
cookiecutters products he calls them 
by the time lanyis choices are true blue and highly visible 
they might have been removed from his portfolio sold for a very 
good price to the more traditional investors such as mutual funds 
replacing them will be other emerging companies young outfits 
with good products repeat business good management and good 
profits some of these too will become aone investments 
inevitably others will fade 
its a lot of work for lanyi seven days a week reading 
talking with management querying suppliers and all to discover 
perhaps eight prospects a year hard work is part of the job he 
says explaining that as an immigrant hungarian philosopher he was 
lucky even to get into the business 
sequent computers the biggest holding in the portfolio was 
purchased in january 1988 at about 725 rose to as much as 34 
and sold this week at about 24 
care plus bought at year ago at about 825 sold this week at 
about 18 occupational urgentcare health systems bought in march 
1989 at 612 sold this week at more than 20 after having 
reached a high of 2725 
wide price swings are in the nature of such stocks and it takes 
patience information and nerves to stay with them lanyi has 
stayed with all these stocks even though some are off sharply in 
recent weeks 
after a oneday decline of 3 pharmacy management services sold 
this week at about 8 lanyi checked it out found that growth 
rather than sales problems had cut profits and decided to stick 
with it hes an investor he said not a trader the decline made 
him more aggressive he said 
that sort of confidence is based on knowledge of the company he 
said and lanyi sometimes knows more about a company than some of 
its officers most of this research is done before he buys but 
some is done afterward too 
to even consider a stock it must have a dominant position in its 
market be undiscovered by wall street be recession resistant 
occupy a niche such as home infusion therapy and have earnings 
growth of 30 percent a year 
perhaps 300 of them meet the critieria lanyi and his 
researchers then telephone the company president who might be 
invited to new york to discuss prospects over the next five or six 
months about 100 get the invitation 
at least five of the companys suppliers and 10 of its clients 
are then interviewed lanyi himself might even talk to the 
companys printer asking how many boxes or brochures were being 
prepared compared with an earlier period 
if the printer says he is required to print more and more boxes 
lanyi is pleased he isnt pleased if the printer states even 
enthusiastically yes the companys giving us the same big order 
as they gave us last month 
hearing a response like that lanyi grows wary and his research 
team is put to work even harder conceivably it could be a sign 
that growth is topping out a very early warning signal to sell 
why wait for the earnings report

for reasons known only to students of a full 
moon vampire movies have hollywood flapping these days at least 
five are planned but tv also has a new dracula in the wings 
the syndicated dracula the series however arriving sept 
24 on 113 us stations is a little different from most versions 
of the transylvania necker 
its halfhour tales are being shot in the tiny duchy of 
luxembourg yes luxembourg 
and this dracula is not quite like the pioneering bela lugosi 
movie model of 1931 that still keeps impressionists telling their 
children drrrrinnk your soooop beforrre it congealllssss 
this dracula played by geordie johnson is a ruthless european 
mogul who seeks global domination through his conglomerate empire 
hes sort of like gordon gekko of wall street with a taste for 
type a positive 
perhaps hes the modern sort of vampirebusinessman hunting for 
a corporate takeover or a bare neck nearly 24 hours a day 
well in our bible of vampirology weve decided that hes 
found ways through modern technology sun block or whatever to 
operate during the day said david patterson the shows 
executive producer 
so he doesnt have to go off and hide in the crypt during the 
day on the other hand he has no vampirelike powers until the sun 
sets 
although pattersons dracula does wear a black cape now and then 
and develops the customary upper fangs when its time to go for the 
gusto traditionalists who see this mod version may say oh 
drat 
they may say worse when they learn the other regulars in this 
dracula include two american teenagers who get caught up in 
things while visiting europe with their mother 
the lads team up with another regular their uncle gustav to 
battle the shows dracula who goes by the name alexander lucard 
it helps that uncle gustav benard behrens proves to be from a 
long line of draculachasers and has some inherited wisdom in this 
matter dracula by pattersons estimate has been undead since the 
1400s 
the show specifies no european country as its setting that its 
filmed in luxembourg the sort of duchy where occasionally you may 
hear flemish spoken is due as much to lower costs as to 
transylvanialike scenery that includes medieval castles dungeons 
and caverns 
the luxembourg government has been going to great lengths to 
attract film and television production recently said patterson 
whose production company is based in toronto 
the us networks have no vampire efforts this season indeed 
the last memorable network series about vampires zombies and 
weirdos who howl in the night was in the halcyon season of 197475 
when abc aired the magnificent kolchak the night stalker 
that series starred darren mcgavin as a wisecracking wire 
service reporter whose bureau chief kept spiking his amazing 
stories of life in the undead lane 
that was an extremely welldone show and one that we 
certainly were aware of during the course of developing this one 
patterson said thats because we didnt want to be emulating 
anything that had been done 
his dracula which has an order for 21 episodes will be 
different in yet another way 
its intended for family viewing that means no lingering shots 
of punctured aortas or a bloodymouthed prince of darkness saying 
fangs for the the memory or whatever it is such princes say 
these days 
there will be draculacaused departures patterson said but 
we are sensitive to the fact that we cant allow the show to boil 
down to only bloodsucking and our heroes holding up a cross at the 
end of each episode 
when the shows modern dracula sips from his talking cup of 
life he said that will be alluded to but not graphically 
portrayed 
were talking family drama here we hope weve got a show that 
parents will be happy to see along with their 9 and 10yearolds 
we want it to be a family drama and we think it is

bob geldof musician is back 
not st bob the humanitarian of british tabloid headlines not 
sir bob knighted by queen elizabeth in 1986 nominated for the 
nobel peace prize that same year not author bob whos already 
written a bestselling autobiography is that it and not 
businessman bob who oversaw millions and millions of dollars in 
contributions for the starving third world 
geldof remains chairman of the board of trustees for band aid 
although he says the organization will cease to exist fairly soon 
but his main focus these days is the vegetarians of love his 
critically acclaimed second solo album 
this is no boomtown rats rock n roll extravaganza geldof has 
instead assembled a mostly acoustic band featuring accordion 
violins flute tin whistle mandolin and ukulele 
for me i suppose its simply a reaction to stuff i hear on 
the radio which i dont like basically house music and new kids 
on the block or kylie minogue geldof said in a recent interview 
for the new album geldof enlisted an old friend exrats 
bassist pete briquette and four traditional musicians hed never 
met they recorded 28 songs in five days any song that didnt 
click after three takes was thrown out geldof improvised many of 
the lyrics on the spot 
i came in on monday morning said hello to four guys i didnt 
know id bash out a song and say right ok lets go 
geldof recalled of the session 
theyd say what do you want me to play id say whatever 
you want to play theyd say where do you want me to play it 
id say wherever you feel its right and when does the song 
finish and id say when it stops its over 
the spontaneity shows on a gospel song geldof tells the 
band middle eight coming up during an instrumental break 
geldof asks at the start of another cut are we rolling and at 
the end of the great song of indifference the entire band is 
heard laughing loudly 
indifference is already a top 40 hit in britain the last 
thing everybody expected was this irish pub song and it became a 
big dance hit you know thirteenthcentury dance music says 
geldof laughing 
after almost a decade as front man for the new waveera boomtown 
rats geldof became a household name in 1984 by organizing the 
cream of british musicians to record do they know its 
christmas and raise money for african famine victims 
that was followed by usa for africas we are the world and 
the internationally televised live aid benefit for two years 
geldof met with heads of state and political power brokers the 
scruffy irishman was photographed with everyone from nobelist 
mother theresa to british prime minister margaret thatcher 
geldof looks back on those days with pride tempered by the 
realization there was only so much that could be done 
i mean i never said we were going to stop world poverty or 
world hunger i said it was a bandaid you dont put a bandaid 
on a gaping wound if i remember was the quote at the time 
said geldof 
that wasnt the function to stop world hunger it was to 
raise the issue to the top of the political agenda and we did 
that 
geldof is still the nominal head of the organization im the 
chairman of the board of trustees which requires me to go to a 
meeting once every two months in reality the buck still stops 
here 
but he says projects are winding down and the end of band aid 
could come in 1992 
we have a million pounds left which is contingency which we 
dont touch in case theres an emergency or a shortfall on a 
project said geldof when all thats finished about two 
years then we just close 
so geldof is back with his first love music hes not sure if 
vegetarians will be his longawaited commercial breakthrough 
and hes aware that theres no immediate market for his songs on 
us radio 
so what if it doesnt fit its still music says geldof 
for every 3 million people who love bon jovi theres a quarter 
of a million who cant stand it im not at all bitter im sort of 
philosophical 
the philosopher looks much the same as he did at live aid 
except for the bit of gray in his unruly mop of hair geldof 
considers the music scene today and he sees many of the same 
things flourishing which led to the punk scene 
i feel a real sort of betrayal now when i listen to the radio 
i understand that this is now a giant monolithic industry and i 
understand so many millions of people depend on their livelihoods 
for it and they play it safe said geldof

children in this biblical arab town 
used to copy stonethrowing palestinians of the occupied 
territories in a game called intefadeh now they play burn 
the american flag 
they are responding to what many adults in kufr kanna and other 
arab towns in israel have said since the usiraqi showdown began 
saddam hussein is a hero who will unite arabs against the united 
states and its ally israel 
most israeli jews have been startled by such wide support for 
the iraqi president among israels 800000 arab citizens liberals 
are disappointed and hardliners cry treason some even urging 
that arab citizens be expelled 
the arabs in israel are crossing a red line support for an 
enemy who is threatening to annihilate half of israel with chemical 
weapons said eliezer tsafrir arab affairs adviser to prime 
minister yitzhak shamir 
we used to say the majority of our arab citizens are loyal to 
the state we must go on saying that but im not sure any longer 
how accurate it is 
tsafrir said saddamania was further weakening jewisharab 
coexistence already hurt by israeli arab support for the 
33monthold palestinian intefadeh or uprising in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
support for saddam among israeli arabs springs partly from anger 
about their treatment by the jewish majority 
they were under military government until 1966 and today their 
communities get only about onequarter the government funds given 
to similar jewish towns 
moslem fundamentalism also plays a role the fundamentalists are 
angry that american infidels have been sent into saudi arabia 
near moslem holy places 
a study by givat haviva a leftwing israeli think tank found 
that israeli arab intellectuals initially condemned the aug 2 
invasion of kuwait by iraq but rallied behind saddam when us 
troops entered arab lands 
outspoken support for saddam is the rule in kufr kanna a 
hillside farming town of 12000 north of nazareth that is believed 
to be where jesus changed water into wine 
two weeks after iraqs invasion about 2000 people marched 
through town carrying banners with such slogans as saddam hit 
the americans and israel with chemical weapons 
the marchers burned an american flag and pictures of hosni 
mubarak president of egypt who has cooperated with the us 
defense of saudi arabia 
omar saeed a leader of the nationalist sons of the village 
movement said the demonstration inspired the childrens game of 
pretending to burn makeshift american flags 
saeed a selfproclaimed socialist sees saddam as a fellow 
revolutionary because he ousted kuwaits oilrich royal family 
saddam is leading the revolution of the poor he is the arabs 
robin hood saeed 30 said in the living room of his fathers 
twostory home overlooking the town 
he has an apartment in haifa where he is studying for a 
doctorate in pharmacology at an israeli university and said most 
of his jewish neighbors call him a traitor 
they are saying if you are with saddam you are against us 
but my professor said he would fight for my right to speak my 
mind said saeed who spent four years under house arrest and six 
months in prison for nationalist activities 
his 65yearold father radwan described saddam as a savior 
fighting to unite arabs in the tradition of the late egyptian 
president gamal abdel nasser 
radwan saeed who been under town arrest for 10 years because of 
nationalist activities pointed to a picture of nasser on the wall 
and said tomorrow well have a picture of saddam up there as 
well 
jews are shocked by such sentiments from arab countrymen who 
remained silent during israels wars with its arab neighbors 
i didnt expect to find them on friendly terms with such a 
dictator said yossi sarid of the leftwing citizens rights 
movement maybe they havent digested deeply the democratic rules 
of the game 
conservative israeli newspapers suggested the government crack 
down on arabs supporting saddam 
no one asks that they identify with israeli policy but no 
state that values its existence can accept the identification of 
its citizens with an enemy said an editorial in the daily 
maariv one does not play with fire 
on the extremist fringe usborn rabbi meir kahane of the 
antiarab kach movement said israeli arabs should be expelled 
i saw on television how the arabs of kufr kanna our 
arabs good arabs faithful arabs marched in support of this 
dictator kahane said at a rally friends if we want a common 
policy it is throw the arabs out 
tsafrir said there were no plans for action against israeli 
arabs unless they broke the law but noted that growing resentment 
by jews would make it more difficult to redress the imbalance in 
funding for arab towns 
in kufr kanna mayor aref hamdan said arabs were angry over 
separate and unequal policies under which a permit for building 
a factory had been denied the towns unemployment rate is about 25 
percent more than twice the jewish rate 
mohammed abbas unemployed after losing jobs in his field of 
biology and as a waiter said the jews think we are weak 
inferior people we have to explain ourselves to them all the time 
say that we are loyal to the state they never explain themselves 
to us

purple and red bougainvillea are 
back in bloom seaside resorts are open and cruise ships call again 
at most of the dozen caribbean islands battered by hurricane hugo 
st croix in the us virgin islands and the british colony of 
montserrat still are rebuilding but elsewhere there is little 
remaining evidence of the worst storm in a decade which killed at 
least 56 people and caused more than 2 billion in damage on sept 
1718 1989 
i think weve recovered better than expected said carl 
mitchell director of the economic secretariat of the sevenmember 
organization of eastern caribbean states in st johns antigua 
initially we had looked at the possible longterm effects and 
had indicated it was going to take three years before there would 
be full recovery he said but i think this may apply just to 
montserrat the recovery in the other islands has been quite 
startling 
nevertheless mitchell said the hurricane caused a drop in 
economic growth rates and a sharp rise in the cost of living in 
montserrat and the neighboring islands of antigua dominica and st 
kittsnevis 
on st croix where onethird of the homes were demolished or 
heavily damaged by winds of up to 200 mph life is returning to 
normal gradually 
two insurance companies went out of business leaving more than 
55 million in claims to 1000 homeowners and 200 businesses 
unpaid the territorial government has agreed to cover policyholder 
losses of up to 100000 each but hundreds of families are still 
waiting to have their homes rebuilt 
one million cubic yards of debris has been cleared from the 
island and restaurants and stores in christiansted the main town 
are operating the landscape once brown from defoliation is 
greener now 
the education department said all but one of the islands 10 
schools were reopening for the fall term after repairs made with a 
43 million federal grant 
thirtythree cruise ships are to resume port calls in october 
betty sperber president of the hotel and tourism association on 
st croix said 10 of the 15 major hotels would be open by then 
but the other five were closing permanently 
st croixs image as an american paradise suffered both from the 
hurricanes destruction and four days of looting that followed 
president bush sent 1100 military police to restore order they 
stayed for two months and the island was under curfew 
residents still have angry memories of news reports at the time 
about marauding gangs of blacks attacking wealthy whites with 
machetes 
police chief delroy richards says more than 100 people 
including some prominent residents were arrested on theft charges 
but none of the cases can i say were racially motivated 
i feel the looting is behind us he said people have 
condemned those persons who took items that were not needed 
st croix population 56000 was by far the hardest hit of the 
three main us virgin islands it has received the bulk of 750 
million provided to the territory by the federal emergency 
management agency known as fema 
hugo also heavily damaged st thomas whose population is about 
the same sparsely populated st john and the neighboring british 
virgin islands but all of them recuperated quickly 
puerto rico a us commonwealth of 36 million people 70 miles 
west of st croix returned to normal within weeks of the hurricane 
despite an estimated 13 billion in damage and lost production 
jose bravo the fema coordinator in san juan said 900 families 
still were living in temporary modular housing mostly in 
northeastern puerto rico and on the offshore islands of culebra and 
vieques 
he said fema provided 72 million to the commonwealth government 
for new housing but construction has been delayed by permits 
contracts and land development 
only 11 million of 142 million raised for hurricane victims 
by a 12hour simultaneous telethon in san juan new york and miami 
had been distributed by the end of august 11 months later 
luis davila administrator of the telethon fund said all 
applicants should have their money within three months she said 
the fund also would build 330 homes all expected to be ready by 
christmas 
montserrat a small pearshaped island with only 12500 
residents 200 miles south of puerto rico was all but flattened by 
the hurricane and remains far from completely recovered 
reuben meade the governments director of development said 
about 90 percent of the islands 4000 homes had been rebuilt and 
businesses had reopened in plymouth the capital 
electricity water and telephone services have been restored and 
the two major hotels have reopened he said but roads need 
repairs the port still uses a barge as its main jetty and little 
work has been done on government buildings 
in guadeloupe which has 340000 inhabitants and was the first 
island in hugos path wood and corrugated iron is heaped in places 
and schools and houses still are being rebuilt 
franklin mcdonald director of the pancaribbean disaster 
preparedness and prevention project in antigua said the french 
government responded quickly 
there are still housing repairs being done but to a great 
extent guadeloupe is back to normal he said

in the chronic crises of the middle east the 
cold war and its remnants always have shaped the moves and 
countermoves of the superpowers until now in this crisis the 
rules have changed 
that shows in the sudden summit meeting between president bush 
and soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
the framework of eastwest struggle is gone us and soviet 
leaders whose predecessors bristled and charged aggression when 
one side or the other made or backed military moves in the middle 
east now are allied against the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
bush stressed the joint effort not the limits and points of 
friction as he headed to helsinki for the brief summit he 
suggested about two weeks ago 
bush said there was no specific agenda for five hours of 
meetings on sunday but rather a need for freeflowing personal 
consultation on a wide array of questions with the middle east 
chief among them 
european security negotiations to limit conventional weapons 
there and other issues are due for discussion too as are the 
economic strains facing gorbachev at home 
the helsinki conference is a symbol of the basic changes wrought 
by the breakup of the soviet bloc and the passing of the cold war 
that remodeling of the world political map outweighs and will 
outlast the current crisis and others that certainly will follow in 
the middle east 
it has been a cockpit of eastwest struggle for the better part 
of 50 years and in a way the moscowwashington rivalry disciplined 
the recurring conflicts 
each side backed client states to counter the other and each 
side was able to rein its allies before their clashes escalated 
into a risk of superpower confrontation 
there is no more eastwest game said judith kipper a 
middle east scholar at the brookings institution it will make 
some people yearn for the cold war when there were rules 
secretary of state james a baker iii is proposing a new 
regional security system to seek stability and order in the middle 
east suggesting that there could be a longterm us presence in 
the area as part of such a system 
at the white house bushs spokesman said there was no way to 
know whether such an alliance might include the soviet union 
in another era the soviet union iraqs chief arms supplier 
might have been able to restrain saddam hussein short of the 
invasion of kuwait another middle east expert said 
this is the first middle east crisis in which the soviet union 
is essentially a secondary player said robert e hunter of the 
center for strategic and international studies 
hunter an aide and adviser to democratic administrations and to 
a congressional delegation just back from the crisis zone said 
moscow is preoccupied with internal economic and political problems 
but the administration has played up the soviet role and even 
suggested that it might now reconsider economic aid to moscow 
the white house was conciliatory on other points too while the 
soviet union has cut off arms shipments to iraq and joined the un 
trade embargo it still has about 193 military advisers there 
among about 1000 soviet citizens involved in training and 
maintenance 
baker has called their role inappropriate and there have been 
congressional demands that the advisers be withdrawn but white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater called it a marginal matter 
since the embargo is working 
theres no sense getting argumentative with the soviets on 
this issue he said 
on such points the rule is accommodation 
a new foundation for world order is being built and the 
spadework begins in helsinki fitzwater said 
the accommodating words are mutual after a soviet military 
leader complained that the us buildup in the gulf could get 
impede negotiations for weapons cuts in europe a foreign ministry 
spokesman disputed the idea 
gennadi gerasimov said the us deployment in saudi arabia was 
at the invitation of that government in a legitimate response to 
the invasion of kuwait 
only three years ago moscow was denouncing the us naval 
operation to protect persian gulf tanker traffic as a move that 
threatened war 
but that was the old order

family man premieres sept 22 
battling nbcs parenthood for viewers this wholesome new 
arrival could be called my three sons one daughter and no 
laughs 
it stars gregory harrison late of trapper john md now he 
essays a harried freshly widowed fire department captain left with 
three sons two of whom are teenagers and a kindergartenage 
daughter 
he also has a kindly fatherin law al molinaro in from new 
york to help him 
this southern california clan lives in a twostory spanishstyle 
home that appears to be the kind that costs maybe 300000 more 
than a fire captains salary could afford but heck maybe this 
smokeeater works in beverly hills 
but the firemans writers appear to have burnt down leaving 
this motherless family facing such emergencies as burnt pancakes 
stillwet socks and absolutely no funny lines whatsover 
sure theres a lot of warmth and also a sad moment that leads 
to a release of pentup grief by the youngest son but family 
man is one of the seasons most feeble entries 
all you can say of it is that the actress playing the tiny 
daughter has a great deal of peewee charm and appeal said actress 
ashleigh blair sterling why dont they call girls julie any 
more is not yet doubledigit in years but she has a fine sense 
of timing and will probably do well in later years 
she should not include family man on her dossier 
 
earth force premieres sept 22 with sept 16 preview 
billed by its makers as network tvs first actionecological 
series this one proves why environmentally concerned hollywood 
writers and producers should be banned as hazardous 
they threaten the world with deadly clouds of earnest dialogue 
the series is about a sort of ecological ateam funded by the 
sparenoexpense earth alert foundation the team is led by sturdy 
gil gerard he plays a brilliant surgeon whose background includes 
vietnam 
the team has five members one of them a beautiful woman four 
hold advanced degrees in such things as marine biology and 
anthropology one even has a double major nuclear physics and 
radical protest the fifth a raffish australian is a 
counterterrorism expert who also owns a c130 cargo plane a 
helicopter a cigar and a pair of driving gloves with the 
fingertips cut off 
the modest goal of the team is to save the earth 
in the shows preview theyre brought together by force in 
some cases by a wicked conglomerate president whose troubled 
nuclear power plant is approaching meltdown 
no government intervention no press the mogul says you guys 
take care of it and ill fund your projects forever 
the team discovers double trouble the plant is missing two 
kilograms of deadly plutonium stolen during the approaching 
meltdown and the meltdown was programmed by an insider but wasnt 
supposed to be for real it is though and as for the plutonium 
it to be sold to a mysterious middle east country 
this is bad enough but the dialogue is even worse 
try this about the potential effect of a nuclear meltdown 
you wont see a deer or rabbit around here for the next 500 
years or this in which the industrialists lovely aide 
describes a member of the planetsaving team 
hes the one who threw sheeps blood on your limo in new york 
last summer even greenpeace finds him too radical 
at the finale gerard reports that weve lived on this planet 
for 50000 years and in the last 200 weve damned near killed 
it whereupon the teams staff radical comes right out and says 
weve got to go after the slime that are dumping and 
polluting 
he may be right but if the twohour preview written by bill 
corcoran is any indication hed show more real concern for the tv 
environment if hed put earth force inside a tv producers

parenthood premieres sept 22 
based on the movie comedy of the same name this one stars ed 
begley jr as a financial analyst who with his collegeeducated 
wife jayne atkinson is raising a family of four 
this effort is not a onefamily adventure though there are 
three other families running loose here all related one includes 
a greatgrandmother the motherinlaw of begleys dad wellacted 
by william windom 
youll probably like begleys gruff old dad the best if only 
because he often gives the impression there is nothing more hed 
like to do than take a baseball bat and restore order in his gruff 
old way 
the shows point seems to be that theres much warmth heartache 
and confusion in family life this is not hot news and the monster 
cast tends to resemble a human gridlock that occasionally sits down 
to dinner 
matters could improve the cast is good but with less than 25 
minutes to play with each week the writers should be constantly 
advised of the excellent principle of kiss keep it simple 
stupid

haywire premiered sept 1 
this follows totally hidden video and can be called 
totally dumb television its full of the sort of stupid silly 
things people do when they get their first video camera only 
worse 
among other things the opening show dispatched a staffer to 
seattle to see what people would give him for free if he was from a 
tv show the take included handcuffs a monkfish and two blondes 
fox seems confused by haywire the premiere was hosted by 
matthew perry a new graduate of the bob saget school of home video 
show hosting but perry is out now fox says and alan hunter is 
getting a tryout 
hunter is identified as a former mtv veejay if he is still 
around by next week we will alert you by shouting bingo 
 
american chronicles premieres sept 8 
this is a unique show by twin peaks makers mark frost and 
david lynch the good kind that appeals to ears and eyeballs alike 
a beautifully photographed impressionistic look at the sights 
and sounds of america the first show narrated by richard 
dreyfuss examines mardi gras in new orleans from its humble 
beginnings in 1699 to the gaudy present 
the gaudy present here includes the baring of female bosoms 14 
times in this years french quarter frolic the baring is 
electronically blurred but its the thought that counts 
the video impressionism is nicely scored by billy barber 
usually with a sortofclassical music that goes from a whisper to 
a wagnerian roar with the morningafter finale done only with a 
wistful clarinet and banjo rendition of till i had you 
true the first video maestro of americana was jean shepherd 
his sardonic jean shepherds america series on pbs in the 70s 
remains one of the best tv looks at the nation ever to come down 
the airwaves 
but american chronicles may prove a very close contender for 
second place

thousands of freed slaves were wooed to 
farming after the civil war with political promises of 40 acres 
and a mule 
the pledge went the way of so many campaign comeons still 
farming was a trade that many of the newly freed blacks knew by 
the end of the century minorities had acquired 15 million acres 
for farming 
we never were given the 40 acres and the mule but a lot of 
people were allowed to buy said ralph paige executive director 
of the federation of southern cooperativesland assistance fund 
but now the number of minorityowned farms is dwindling 
drastically and members of congress are trying to stop the 
decline the 1990 farm bill includes provisions inserted by sen 
wyche fowler dga and rep mike espy dmiss that give special 
attention to the needs of the minority farmer 
i think the government should be concerned about all small 
farmers theyre the backbone of this country said paige who 
lobbied for the minority farming language in the farm bill 
minority farms are a different breed these are farmers who have 
the historical problem of discrimination 
only 45 million acres out 988 million are now farmed by 
minorities paige said 
he attributed the losses among minority farmers to 
discrimination in credit lack of access to markets and lack of 
knowledge about wills and other paperwork necessary to retain 
ownership of land 
years ago the severe losses of minority farms were blamed on an 
outmoded sharecropping system but in the 1960s the us 
commission on civil rights found systematic racial discrimination 
in the agriculture department in 1982 after noting that 
minorityowned farms were disappearing at 25 times the rate of 
whiteowned farms the commission recommended federal and state 
action to remedy the situation 
the farm bill passed by the senate includes more remedies for 
the decline in minorityowned farms than the house measure a 
congressional conference committee will begin work this month to 
resolve the differences on these and other provisions of the farm 
bill 
minority farmers traditionally have received less federal 
assistance than their white counterparts and have been more 
vulnerable to changes in agriculture said fowler when they 
hurt the communities around them hurt 
from 1978 to 1987 the number of minorityowned farms declined 
23 percent while whiteowned farms declined 71 percent said 
fowler 
that means nearly one in four minority farms disappeared in 
just one decade he said 
virtually all of this loss came from the ranks of black farmers 
though minority farmers include asians hispanics and american 
indians said the rural coalition in a report based on the 1987 
census of agriculture 
nine out of 10 of the failed black farms were in the south the 
coalition said 
the coalition reported that while a third of the white farms 
receive direct government payments less than half that percentage 
of minority farms do a white farm is four times more likely to 
obtain a loan from the federal governments commodity credit corp 
than a minority farm it said 
half of all white farms have sales above 10000 but just 30 
percent of minority farms have sales at this level according to 
the coalitions findings 
the house bill would expand outreach and education to increase 
minority participation in agriculture department programs 
the senate includes a similar provision and also would 
establish a national registry of minority farmers to monitor 
ownership 
assign extension agents to areas with high population of 
minority farmers to involve them in existing usda programs 
create demonstration programs for minority youth and beginning 
farmers 
direct the agriculture secretary to review the effectiveness of 
the current appeals process for discrimination complaints and 
affirmative action policies 
review the impact of the agriculture departments purchasing 
and contracting policies on minority businesses 
espy has offered a separate more farreaching minority farm 
bill it is unlikely to be acted upon this year

hull high premieres sept 30 preview aired aug 20 
hull high threatened to be another emptyheaded knockoff of 
the pretentious teen musical fame but turns out to be a 
bright funny musical comedy about a california high school thats 
beguiling from its first scene 
in addition to superior production values and an excellent cast 
hull high is wellwritten and tightly edited its directed by 
kenny ortega who choreographed dirty dancing and keeps things 
moving 
hull high opens with a housedancing production number and 
introduces the four rappers lads who function as a kind of greek 
chorus to the action adults will enjoy a bilious teachers 
jaundiced reaction to them 
theres a lovely teacher nancy valen who cant understand why 
her male students dont seem to comprehend the material the 
popular teacher will lyman sits in on her class and his fantasy 
becomes a production number on the figures of speech simile and 
metaphor were never so welldanced 
then theres the student mark ballou who falls for the 
wistfully beautiful transfer student cheryl pollak will the 
course of true teen love run smooth nah will they get back 
together go figure 
hull high is beautifully photographed its music is melodic 
and it keeps the teenage angst at an acceptable level 
its fun to watch filled with throwaway bits that are grace 
notes to the longer scenes its humor is suprisingly sophisticated 
and sometimes even subtle 
hull high celebrates people who are young and alive and 
about 16 years old with nary a thought in their heads it even 
admires the people who teach them 
 
lifestories premieres sept 30 preview aired aug 20 
nbc has great hopes for this medical series which looks at 
lifethreatening illnesses from the patients perspective 
its a clever idea for a drama and given current american 
attitudes toward the medical industry its probably all for the 
best that this is not a doctor show 
judging from its pilot episode however the patient is in 
trouble 
the episode is about colorectal cancer americas secondmost 
common cancer after lung cancer last year colorectal cancer 
killed 61000 americans it is preventable and if detected early 
has surprisingly high recovery rates 
introducing patients and their illnesses gives lifestories 
an inherently difficult exposition but writer jeffrey lewis 
resorts to a narrator robert prosky in the persona of an 
omniscient clinic founder 
proskys knowall narration gives us the facts on colon cancer 
explains peoples motivations and generally intrudes on the story 
its so sentimental and superfluous that it actually ruins the 
story and the acting 
in the first scene the narrator introduces us to don a real 
estate developer who makes the putt of his life and raises his arms 
in triumph freeze frame cut to dons gut special effect a 
sectional view where a single cell has started its perverse 
multiplication 
lifestories promises more freezeframe cutaway views of 
central characters and their innards tv characters walking about 
like medical textbook illustrations is not something to look 
forward to 
the very talented richard masur plays don lisa barnes plays his 
wife and kieran mulroney his son the three create a real sense of 
how a familys dynamics are altered when cancer strikes it 
yet when these people create a mood the narrator steps in and 
ruins it 
as information lifestories is good as entertainment it is 
not

true colors premieres sept 9 
its difficult to believe groundbreaking can be done so tamely 
or that the weblet which brought us the bundys and the simpsons 
would buy into this very mild sitcom about a biracial marriage 
true colors features nancy walker fresh from the paper 
towel races portraying an oldfashioned domineering 
wisecracking motherinlaw is this a stretch for her as an 
actress or what 
frankie faison plays a dentist the widowed father of two sons 
his new wife is played by stephanie faracy late of cbs his and 
hers a bubblysweet kindergarten teacher and mother of a 
teenage daughter 
the offspring are played by claude brooks as the elder son a 
joe cool materialist brigid conley walsh as a naive causeminded 
liberal and adam jeffries as a hiphoptalking 14yearold 
this is the most welladjusted group of human beings since the 
huxtables of the cosby show theres no real tension between 
the kids the parents are wonderful role models and consequently 
nobody is particularly funny 
only once does true colors obliquely refer to the tragedy 
that is its central theme when the police come to the family home 
on a mistaken burglary call miraculously nobody gets shot 
it would be wonderful if racism would just go away it wont 
though and theres no point in ignoring it simply because youre 
trying to do comedy 
 
parker lewis cant lose preview aired sept 1 premieres 
sept 9 
well maybe he can but it wont be his fault not a 
problem parker says repeatedly in this winning highschool 
farce its writers lon diamond and producer clyde phillips have 
done their homework 
corin nemec plays parker a bright wholesome basically decent 
teenage lad you might trust with your sister until you found him 
promoting her for the minimalist page in sports illustrateds 
swimsuit edition 
parkers pastime joy and fulltime hustle is to exploit his 
fellow students maximize profits and minimize the tedium of 
getting a high school diploma inevitably these traits put him at 
odds with the principal ms musso melanie chartoff a dragon 
lady determined to get parker expelled and yet helplessly unable to 
thwart his outlandish excuses scams and schemes 
the style of parker lewis cant lose is one of its most 
endearing qualities people dont just move quickly they whoosh 
the school bully doesnt just stand he looms like a mountain to 
the faint buzzing of flies 
as it stands parker lewis cant lose is a droll delightful 
fantasy if writers diamond and phillips put their minds to it 
they could make this show the greatest high school sitcom since 
the many loves of dobie gillis 
 
get a life premieres sept 23 
whats the matter with a 30yearold man who still lives with 
his parents and has a paper route absolutely nothing provided the 
aging adolescent is played by chris elliot 
one of the blither spirits to hit television elliott rose from 
the writing staff of late night with david letterman to portray 
the guy under the seats the fugitive guy and other very skewed 
80skindsofguys 
his first venture into series comedy is pretty good stuff he 
plays chris peterson a guy who simply chose not to have a career 
and a fulltime job he just kept his old paper route and lived in 
his old room 
his longsuffering parents are wonderfully played by chris real 
father the comedian bob elliott and the lovely june lockhart 
they rejoiced when their son said he wanted to move out then he 
moved into an apartment over their garage 
chris best friend larry is played by sam robards larry 
bought into the rat race and his frequent second thoughts about 
being a grownup make him easy prey to chris schemes and adventures 
robin riker plays larrys wife who has less than no use for 
chris 
get a life is about an immature selfish narcissistic peter 
pan who refuses to grow up and take life seriously the frightening 
thing is that he may be right

fresh prince of bel air premieres sept 10 
an amiable but not memorable exercise 
this sitcom has rap music star will smith as a streetwise 
teenager from a tough black section of philadelphia sent to live 
with wealthy relatives in the posh bel air section of los angeles 
his new family consists of his sympathetic aunt her stuffy lawyer 
husband three kids two of em teenage twits and a butler who 
insists on calling the newcomer master william 
this clash of cultures has promise but its opening round is 
tame mainly because it lacks comic tension instead of being 
suspicious of his new surroundings and the inmates thereof master 
william is ceaselessly goodnatured impish and decent 
the only time a point of view peeps out is when in an angry 
exchange with his stuffy uncle james avery he says i remind 
you of where you came from and where you used to be but you got 
soft you forgot who you are and where you came from 
there are a few funny moments in this look at the black upper 
crust in a predominantly white enclave example smith tells his 
preppy cousin carlton alfonso ribeiro that malcolm x is his hero 
then asks the lad who he admires my dad the preppie says 
and bryant gumbel hes darned good 
there also is a small surprise now and then as in a closing 
scene when smith quietly picks out a passage of classical music on 
the piano 
but theyd best put some more punch in this series or fresh 
prince will quickly become stale sitcom 
 
ferris bueller premieres sept 17 
this is a halfhour tribute to the proposition that anybody can 
write a realllllllly dumb sitcom 
based on the movie ferris buellers day off it mostly 
occurs in a southern california high school just like nbcs new 
hull high and foxs new class of beverly hills and parker 
lewis cant lose 
like parker lewis a distant sitcom cousin of ferris 
bueller nbcs show is about a glib charming student who aims to 
get through school with little work and much fun 
hes much like say a network comedy development executive 
charlie schlatter plays ferris a junior so cool he can 
computerhack false attendance records change the school menu or 
get a stretch limo for a ride to school 
with the push of a remotecontrol button he even can send his 
nemesis surprise surprise its the foreverfuming high school 
principal plunging through a trap door on the opening day of 
school 
the only thing ferris bueller cant do is get a funny script 
let us join hands now and pray for an end to sitcoms set in 
southern california high schools or at least an end to sitcom 
writers who attended southern california high schools

law amp order premieres in october date to be announced 
critics of longtime television producer dick wolf say he 
presided over the decline of miami vice as its producer and the 
demise of hill street blues as its executive story 
consultant 
he created help an actionadventure about a fictitious 
new york city firepolicerescue unit and it was last years 
lowestrated series his nasty boys a ninjanarcoswat action 
show sank without a trace 
still he persists and may have found a winning formula with 
his latest creation law amp order 
its a police procedural for its first halfhour starring the 
venerable george dzunda and christopher noth as a couple of new 
york city detectives they are patient dogged unglamorous and 
utterly believable 
the second halfhour stars the distinguished michael moriarty as 
a hardworking assistant district attorney richard brooks plays 
his colleague and stephen hill is the district attorney 
the pilot episode has teads 
to a release of pentup grief by the youngest son but family 
man is one of the seasons most feeble entries 
all you can say of it is that the actress playing the tiny 
daughter has a great deal of peewee charm and appeal said actress 
ashleigh blair sterling why dont they call girls julie any 
more is not yet doubledigit in years but she has a fine sense 
of timing and will probably do well in later years 
she should not include family man on her dossier 
 
earth force premieres sept 22 with sept 16 preview 
billed by its makers as network tvs first actionecological 
series this one proves why environmentally concerned hollywood 
writers and producers should be banned as hazardous 
they threaten the world with deadly clouds of earnest dialogue 
the series is about a sort of ecological ateam funded by the 
sparenoexpense earth alert foundation the team is led by sturdy 
gil gerard he plays a brilliant surgeon whose background includes 
vietnam 
the team has five members one of them a beautiful woman four 
hold advanced degrees in such things as marine biology and 
anthropology one even has a double major nuclear physics and 
radical protest the fifth a raffish australian is a 
counterterrorism expert who also owns a c130 cargo plane a 
helicopter a cigar and a pair of driving gloves with the 
fingertips cut off 
the modest goal of the team is to save the earth 
in the shows preview theyre brought together by force in 
some cases by a wicked conglomerate president whose troubled 
nuclear power plant is approaching meltdown 
no government intervention no press the mogul says you guys 
take care of it and ill fund your projects forever 
the team discovers double trouble the plant is missing two 
kilograms of deadly plutonium stolen during the approaching 
meltdown and the meltdown was programmed by an insider but wasnt 
supposed to be for real it is though and as for the plutonium 
it to be sold to a mysterious middle east country 
this is bad enough but the dialogue is even worse 
try this about the potential effect of a nuclear meltdown 
you wont see a deer or rabbit around here for the next 500 
years or this in which the industrialists lovely aide 
describes a member of the planetsaving team 
hes the one who threw sheeps blood on your limo in new york 
last summer even greenpeace finds him too radical 
at the finale gerard reports that weve lived on this planet 
for 50000 years and in the last 200 weve damned near killed 
it whereupon the teams staff radical comes right out and says 
weve got to go after the slime that are dumping and 
polluting 
he may be right but if the twohour preview written by bill 
corcoran is any indication hed show more real concern for the tv 
environment if hed put earth force inside a tv producers

parenthood premieres sept 22 
based on the movie comedy of the same name this one stars ed 
begley jr as a financial analyst who with his collegeeducated 
wife jayne atkinson is raising a family of four 
this effort is not a onefamily adventure though there are 
three other families running loose here all related one includes 
a greatgrandmother the motherinlaw of begleys dad wellacted 
by william windom 
youll probably like begleys gruff old dad the best if only 
because he often gives the impression there is nothing more hed 
like to do than take a baseball bat and restore order in his gruff 
old way 
the shows point seems to be that theres much warmth heartache 
and confusion in family life this is not hot news and the monster 
cast tends to resemble a human gridlock that occasionally sits down 
to dinner 
matters could improve the cast is good but with less than 25 
minutes to play with each week the writers should be constantly 
advised of the excellent principle of kiss keep it simpltupid

haywire premiered sept 1 
this follows totally hidden video and can be called 
totally dumb television its full of the sort of stupid silly 
things people do when they get their first video camera only 
worse 
among other things the opening show dispatched a staffer to 
seattle to see what people would give him for free if he was from a 
tv show the take included handcuffs a monkfish and two blondes 
fox seems confused by haywire the premiere was hosted by 
matthew perry a new graduate of the bob saget school of home video

a beautifully photographed impressionistic look at the sights 
and sounds of america the first show narrated by richard 
dreyfuss examines mardi gras in new orleans from its humble 
beginnings in 1699 to the gaudy present 
the gaudy present here includes the baring of female bosoms 14 
times in this years french quarter frolic the baring is 
electronically blurred but its the thought that counts 
the video impressionism is nicely scored by billy barber 
usually with a sortofclassical music that goes from a whisper to 
a wagnerian roar with the morningafter finale done only with a 
wistful clarinet and banjo rendition of till i had you 
true the first video maestro of americana was jean shepherd 
his sardonic jean shepherds america series on pbs in the 70s 
remains one of the best tv looks at the nation ever to come down 
the airwaves

as the soviet economy tries to switch from 
staterun to marketdriven the new york stock exchange is offering 
help in reviving an institution that flourished in st petersburg 
until the 1917 revolution 
a trip to moscow next month by nyse chairman john j phelan jr 
and other wall street leaders could help reshape the soviet 
economy but us experts say it will be years before profittaking 
and program trading become soviet lingo 
before creating a place to swap stocks and bonds the rigid 
central economy must be dismantled economists said stateowned 
firms must be turned into private companies and a banking system 
installed 
the soviets also must decide why they want a stock exchange for 
worker ownership of newly privatized enterprises to raise capital 
for moribund factories for trading speculation and profitmaking 
no matter what it would be a long way from lenin who after the 
october revolution denounced the grasping malicious frenzied 
filthy avidity of the moneybags inhabiting banks and exchanges 
the minute you allow the stock of soviet companies to be sold 
you have affected the way in which income will be distributed 
throughout society said paul gregory a soviet expert at the 
university of houston youre dipping into very fundamental 
issues 
as in other eastern european countries soviet officials are 
pressing ahead soviet president mikhail gorbachev and boris 
yeltsin president of the russian republic recently agreed on a 
plan for free markets within 500 days laws expanding private 
ownership rights and creating a banking system and stock market 
would be readied in the first 100 days 
at soviet invitation the nyse the largest us stock exchange 
is holding a seminar in moscow oct 810 on creating a soviet 
exchange sessions will touch on operations regulation and other 
issues 
what were going over to do is answer questions they have and 
share the experiences weve had the last 200 years in the evolution 
of our exchange nyse spokesman richard torrenzano said 
the soviets have history of their own on which to draw 
a fondovaia birzha thrived in st petersburg now leningrad 
from the early 1800s until lenin seized all private assets in 
december 1917 the stock exchange building on vasilii island in the 
neva river now a naval museum could be returned to its former use 
trading there occurred in many of the more than 2000 russian 
companies existing in 1914 as well as government and corporate 
bonds and foreign stocks russia was the worlds largest debtor at 
the time and bonds of its companies traded actively in paris 
commodity exchanges abounded with 82 in 1914 according to 
thomas c owen a louisiana state university historian writing a 
book about companies in czarist russia the first was formed in st 
petersburg in 1703 odessa had a grain exchange kiev a sugar 
exchange and kharkov an iron and coal exchange 
economic need forced a brief and tightly controlled revival of 
commodity houses and companies in the 1920s before a total 
abolition by stalin in 1928 the gap has made returning to a market 
system more difficult scholars said 
there is no culture of capitalism from which this generation 
can draw owen said thursday there is no cultural background 
for these european and american institutions 
hungary has the only functioning stock exchange in eastern 
europe but activity there is slight poland has approved 
legislation creating an exchange and czechoslovakia has said one 
will follow many other reforms 
david kemme an economist at the institute for eastwest 
security study in new york said a stock exchange is not the most 
important component its not even the most important part of 
capital markets 
before stateowned enterprises issue stock their assets have to 
be fairly valued presumably by commercial banks that could approve 
loans 
czechoslovak and polish reform plans possible models for the 
soviet union called first for prices to be liberalized allowing 
fluctuations and therefore markets for goods and services 
stateowned enterprises then could be converted into jointstock 
companies the state could own 51 percent of shares with the rest 
distributed to workers the population at large or foreign 
investors 
the ruble would have to be made convertible to attract 
foreigners experts said allowing its rate to fluctuate in 
relation to foreign currencies 
once commercial banks are able to assess companies 
creditworthiness the value of physical and intangible assets can 
be established and shares issued 
for an investor its going to be very tricky kemme said 
no ones going to have any clue what theyre buying 
there are other questions such as whether the new economy would 
produce the kind of power elite the revolution sought to crush 
they have to permit the possibility that some individuals will 
accumulate vast capital holdings in the means of production that 
were formerly owned by the government said judy shelton a 
research fellow at stanford universitys hoover institution and 
author of the coming soviet crash 
tomasz telma an economist with planecon research associates 
inc in washington said the sale of shares outside a company could 
be limited initially to stop foreigners or domestic parties from 
gaining too much control 
the bottom line is to allow workers to purchase stocks in the 
company they work for but not sell too many to prevent effective 
management telma said 
shelton said soviet leaders and citizens also must overcome the 
communist belief that a society of capitalists and workers is a 
recipe for exploitation 
in the back of their minds i think the russians will be 
receptive to the idea once they get over the stigma that this is 
capitalist she said adding that stocks may prove appealing 
because the people own the means of production

the specter of a sluggish christmas season has retailers 
thinking conservatively and shoppers may find abundant holiday 
bargains as stores try to boost business during the industrys most 
important time of year 
major retailers on thursday posted generally mediocre to poor 
august results 
analysts said retail sales could go into an extended slump for 
the rest of the year because concerns about us involvement in the 
middle east have made consumers who already had economic worries 
even more nervous about spending 
i think that the retail environment faces a challenging 
christmas season predicted jeffrey p luker of the andersen 
consulting division of arthur andersen amp co 
several national chains did adequately during the start of the 
traditional backtoschool period but overall the retail industry 
rang up sluggish revenue 
i would say that the list of retailers reporting disappointing 
sales is growing said analyst jeffrey edelman of barclays de 
zoete wedd we are in a consumer slowdown and before its over 
were going to have more disappointments and that list is going to 
grow 
he added the bottom line is we are heading into a recession 
if were not there already 
mindful of the economys weakness and the negative impact that 
the persian gulf conflict has had on consumer confidence retailers 
are planning to keep inventories as trim as possible in the months 
ahead most are cautious about how business will be during the 
christmas season when they typically look to make 50 percent to 
60 percent of their annual profits 
retailers are already cutting back on merchandise commitments 
as well as reducing expenses in order to protect profitability 
said analyst jeffrey feiner of merrill lynch amp co this will be 
another difficult christmas for most retailers marking the first 
time in awhile that weve had two poor christmases back to back 
the grim outlook for retailers could be good for customers 
shoppers may find merchandise marked down earlier than normal a 
season of brisk promotional activity is expected as retailers pour 
on the hype to boost sales 
but with inventories being kept lean retailers may not need to 
be quite as aggressive in moving merchandise as they were last 
year when financial problems at some chains triggered rampant 
price cutting 
in any event feiner said merrill lynch has reduced its earnings 
projections for retailers and now expects average growth this year 
of 5 percent to 7 percent rather than 6 percent to 8 percent 
forecast previously 
a few retailers bucked the trend in august one of the 
exceptions was walmart stores inc a rapidly expanding discounter 
widely believed to be on the brink of unseating the industrys two 
highest ranking retailers in size sears roebuck and co and k 
mart corp 
walmart posted a double digit gain in sales of stores open a 
year or longer as it usually does each month called comparable or 
samestore sales these results are considered the best guide to a 
retailers health they exclude the revenue that comes from opening 
new outlets 
total august sales for walmart jumped 30 percent from a year 
earlier while sales at stores operating at least a year were up 13 
percent 
sears the industry leader in terms of annual sales volume last 
year experienced a modest improvement in august from recent past 
months but sales still were only soso total sales rose 47 
percent from august of last year while samestore sales were up 41 
percent 
discounter k mart corp the second largest us retailer said 
parents shopping for clothing and merchandise for the new school 
year helped offset softness in electronics and other categories of 
expensive goods 
on a comparable store basis k marts sales edged up 16 
percent total k mart sales including stores opened in the past 
year grew 111 percent 
sales this year looked particularly poor for some retailers 
because they were compared to robust levels in august 1989 
jc penney co for instance said its store and catalog sales 
for the four weeks ended sept 1 slid 12 percent from a record 
amount in the corresponding 1989 period sales at stores open a 
year or longer slumped 24 percent 
penney chairman william r howell said the retailer was up 
against a strong 1989 performance when penney led all department 
store chains with a 144 percent increase in samestore sales the 
largest monthly gain for all of 1989 
there was evidence in the numbers thursday that new fall 
fashions havent captivated shoppers a leading specialty apparel 
chain limited inc often regarded as a barometer of the response 
to styles in womens clothing said its samestore sales inched up 
just 1 percent total august sales at limited rose 14 percent 
by contrast specialty apparel chain gap inc had brisk august 
business total sales grew 24 percent while comparablestore sales 
gained 14 percent

prodigy the home computer information service 
owned by ibm and sears says it hopes to gain a million subscribers 
by the end of 1991 and start turning a profit in a few years 
but some industry analysts are skeptical similar computerbased 
home shopping and information services with nearly as powerful 
backers failed to catch on and were closed in recent years 
on thursday prodigy announced it was available nationwide 
except alaska the service says it already has about 465000 
members in 42 major cities and now will be available in most areas 
prodigy is losing money but it should turn a profit in the 
early 1990s said its president theodore papes he declined to 
discuss specific financial figures 
analysts estimate the 5050 investment in prodigy by 
international business machines corp and sears roebuck and co at 
500 million to 800 million 
among prodigys 900 services are news sports scores weather 
reports childrens stories and other features as well as 
commercial services such as discount stock trading airline ticket 
purchasing and home shopping through sears jc penney co and 
other retailers 
prodigy also offers a messaging service between members and on 
thursday added several new services including an encyclopedia 
nearly every prodigy page has an ad at the bottom making it 
the only advertisersupported computer service papes said ad 
revenue helps limit subscription costs and eliminates the need for 
the perminute charges levied by some competitors 
prodigy costs 995 a month on an annual subscription basis and 
1295 on a monthtomonth basis 
subscribers also need prodigy software at 4995 the right 
kind of computer such as an apple macintosh or ibm or compatible 
models and a modem the device that connects a computer to the 
telephone prodigy sells a modem and software package for 17995 
prodigy says it has about 200 advertisers including the 
retailers and banking services available on the system 
prodigy was launched two years ago by that time cbs inc one 
of the original partners had pulled out since then it says it 
has been the fastestgrowing computer information service 
prodigys chief competitors are compuserve information services 
which is owned by hampr block inc general electric cos genie and 
quantum computer services said joshua harris president of jupiter 
communications co a new york research firm that follows the 
database industry 
harris said both compuserve and genie are highly profitable in 
part because they have invested much less and have fewer employees 
than prodigy which employs about 1300 workers 
compuserve the largest computer service at over 600000 
members is aimed more at computer buffs than prodigy harris said 
that could work in prodigys favor since it is attracting more 
female users that compuserve and women do more shopping than men 
he added 
harris said it would be difficult for ibm and sears to win back 
their investment 
as to prodigys growth prospects he said theres a finite 
pool of people with pcs and modems 
he also said that with current personal computer technology it 
takes more time to get at certain data in prodigy such as weather 
reports than it would to turn on the tv to an allweather cable 
channel 
prodigy executives say one of the biggest hurdles they face is 
getting customers to try the service there is a lack of knowledge 
of what it provides among the 20 million us homes with computers 
ibm is helping boost prodigy awareness by packaging it with its 
new home computer line the ps1 which it launched in june 
similar socalled videotex services offered by two newspaper 
companies knightridder inc and times mirror co were closed in 
the past few years after their parent companies grew discouraged 
with their prospects 
while prodigy is an information service its success may lie in 
its value to advertisers analysts say 
prodigy is an extremely powerful marketing tool says a 
report from yankee group a bostonbased research firm because it 
allows advertisers to know exactly how many people are reading 
their ads and in many cases provides demographic information on 
the viewers

regulators have expanded their charges against 
thomas spiegel a former thrift executive who had survival 
chamber bathrooms with bulletproof glass installed in the 
companys new headquarters 
the office of thrift supervision announced thursday that it 
added a new charge to its accusations against spiegel who had 
earlier been accused of squandering 19 million 
the thrift agencys latest accusation says spiegel caused a 
292 million loss to columbia savings amp loan association from the 
construction of a new headquarters without any attempt to limit 
costs the new building included a large multilevel gymnasium 
and the survival chamber bathrooms that also had an independent 
air and food supply the ots said 
columbia which is trying to sell the building has removed the 
gymnasium and the survival chambers the building cost columbia 
more than 547 and has a market value of around 24 million 
according to the ots 
it was not possible to remove the topquality limestone and 
marble stainless steel floors and ceiling tiles leather wall 
coverings and other accoutrements ordered by spiegel according to 
the regulators latest catalog of sampl excesses 
in a related development the ots said it has decided to open to 
the public hearings on the charges against spiegel and charles h 
keating jr a key figure in the savings and loan crisis nearly 
all the documents related to those two proceedings also will be 
made public the agency said 
the american taxpayer will be best served by open hearings in 
these cases ots director timothy ryan said in a statement 
with accurate reporting by the news media americans will have 
the opportunity to understand the importance of both of these 
enforcement actions by the agency 
spiegel was the chief executive officer of columbia a troubled 
thrift based in beverly hills calif in late july columbia agreed 
to sell its highrisk junk bonds for 3 billion to a canadianled 
investment group regulators had allowed columbia to continue 
operating even though it was insolvent while its managers tried to 
find a buyer for the bonds 
the new charge has been added to the regulators previous 
allegations that spiegel breached his duty to columbias 
shareholders and showed a reckless disregard for the law that 
resulted in excessive personal enrichment 
the ots alleges that spiegel used columbias funds to pay for 
trips he took with members of his family to among other places 
london rome milan and bologna italy frankfurt and munich west 
germany and zurich switzerland on four trips alone spiegel 
charged to the thrift around 70000 in hotel bills and other 
expenses that were unrelated to business according to an ots 
document 
spiegel also spent at least 91000 of columbias money to buy 
about 80 guns including uzi submachine guns rifles revolvers 
automatic pistols and shotguns as well as ammunition and 
accessories 
the ots has been seeking to bar spiegel from the financial 
institutions industry and to recover 19 million from him for 
restitution and a civil penalty of 5 million the 19 million in 
restitution would go to columbia while the 5 million penalty 
would be paid to the treasury 
the total of 24 million represents the largest civil case ever 
brought against an individual by thrift regulators 
the regulators accused spiegel in july of squandering 19 
million on various ventures some in partnership with his friend 
and financial ally junk bond pioneer michael milken spiegel 
angrily denied the charges which the ots made in a civil lawsuit 
under spiegels direction columbia had the thrift industrys 
largest portfolio of junk bonds 
on wednesday the justice department announced that keating had 
agreed to give notice of any large transactions and not to transfer 
assets out of the country those terms had previously been imposed 
on keating by the us district court in los angeles 
keating recently provided financial disclosure statements to the 
regulators but they will not be made public as part of the move 
announced thursday an ots spokesman said 
the governments case against keating stems from the collapse of 
lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif which 
keating controlled and has been accused of looting regulators 
estimate the failure may cost taxpayers 2 billion ranking with 
miamis centrust bank as the costliest sampl failures 
the ots has partially frozen keatings assets in connection with 
its efforts to recover 41 million from him and five associates 
keating denies any wrongdoing his case has attracted particular 
attention because of his 13 million in contributions to the 
campaigns of five senators republican john mccain of arizona and 
democrats alan cranston of california donald w riegle jr of 
michigan dennis deconcini of arizona and john glenn of ohio

national contracts between the united auto 
workers union and the big three automakers expire a week from 
today and talks are going well at the largest of the automakers 
union and company officials say 
uaw vice president stephen yokich directing the unions 
bargaining team with gm said thursday that talks with gm are 
progressing faster than past contracts 
he said negotiators would begin burning the midnight oil 
today and that weekend bargaining sessions were likely 
late last month the union chose gm as its bargaining target in 
talks with gm ford motor co and chrysler corp uaw contracts with 
the three automakers cover more than 450000 active workers each 
expires at midnight sept 14 one week from today 
if things go as the union plans a contract ratified by gm 
workers will be used as a pattern for agreements with ford and 
chrysler 
i think we are right down to the hard stuff now yokich told 
reporters thursday i think were way ahead of any past 
schedules 
he said company and union negotiators have reached tentative 
agreements on about half of the noneconomic issues before them 
typically economic issues including wages time off and job 
security are left for last 
gm spokesman john maciarz declined to estimate how far 
bargaining on noneconomic issues has progressed other than to say 
were still making good progress 
the members of the gm negotiating committee like where they 
are at this point of negotiations 
there has been a calm air surrounding the uawgm negotiations 
this year the only evidence of contention has come from bargaining 
on contracts at the 155 uaw locals at gm factories 
last month the uaw staged a sixday strike at a parts plant in 
flint that resulted in shutdowns at seven assembly plants and 
partial or complete shutdowns at more than a dozen component plants 
the walkout was settled when union members ratified a contract 
guaranteeing more than 2500 jobs for six years

two defunct penny stock brokerages and 15 
individuals in four states have been charged by federal regulators 
with a series of schemes that netted 207 million from investors 
in high risk securities 
the securities and exchange commission brought charges thursday 
against power securities corp a las vegasbased brokerage that 
went out of business in february 1989 and seven of its officers 
and employees 
the sec civil action filed at federal court in denver also 
charged allied capital group inc an englewood colo firm that 
ceased operations in november 1989 and six officers and employees 
the sec charged that the two firms had a secret working 
relationship in violation of federal securities law 
meanwhile two other former power employees have settled civil 
charges with the sec one of them agreeing to a 15month 
suspension from the securities industry

not traded on any stock exchange information about their price and 
performance is often sketchy and difficult to come by making them 
ripe for fraud schemes 
state securities regulators have estimated that american 
investors lose up to 1 billion a year on penny stock fraud 
the sec charged that between late 1987 and the fall of 1988 
various defendants excessively markedup the price of stocks sold 
through dealers engaged in insider trading manipulated the market 
for securities of new yorkbased star publications inc and 
denverbased art cards inc

us securities regulators have charged a 
former director of abb asea brown boveri ltd with making 26 
million in illegal trading profits on inside information about the 
swedishswiss companys acquisition of combustion engineering 
christian norgren was accused in a civil complaint thursday of 
illegal insider trading in combustion engineering securities 
through his company finacor anstalt a liechtensteinbased 
financial services company 
norgren a swedish citizen living in liechtenstein allegedly 
used confidential information about the thenupcoming 16 billion 
deal to buy combustion engineering common stock and call options 
contracts 
a call option contract is an agreement to buy 100 shares of a 
stock at a later datt price it is a trading strategy used by 
investors betting a stocks price will rise sharply 
the nov 13 1989 announcement of abbs takeover offer for 
combustion engineering at 40 per share drove the stamford 
connbased companys stock up more than 13 per share 
thursdays charges were the latest in a securities and exchange 
commission crackdown on alleged insider trading by foreign 
companies and individuals 
thursdays complaint filed by the securities and exchange 
commission at federal court in new york amended earlier charges 
brought late last year against finacor anstalt 
last december a federal judge froze about 3 million of finacor 
anstalts us assets 
a new york attorney representing finacor anstalt called the 
amended complaint an unwarranted effort to expand the charges in 
this case 
this case should have been settled long ago and could have 
been had not the commission adopted a rigid agenda unrelated to 
the merits of this action said finacor attorney thomas e engel 
adding that finacor has tried to resolve the matter without loss to 
combustion engineering share and options holders 
in addition to norgren and finacor anstalt the sec action also 
charges unidentified persons or entities who bought combustion 
engineering call options contracts through an account in the grand 
cayman islands of the caribbean and an account with an unidentified 
luxembourg bank 
in a related case a rancho mirage calif agribusinessman 
settled sec charges that he aided norgrens alleged illegal trading 
howard p marguleas head of a private agricultural concern 
settled without admitting or denying wrongdoing a separate 
civil complaint that he bought 200 call option contracts for norgen 
in november 1989 
the sec said marguleas tried to reverse the transaction and 
refused to pay for the securities after the tender offer was 
publicly announced 
the 229000 in trading profits reverted to a brokerage error 
account and as part of the settlement marguleas asked that the 
firm release the funds to the court said his attorney alexia 
morrison 
there was never any intent that howard going to benefit from 
this it was a trade made as a favor to christian norgren she 
said adding howard was a victim here

the federal government again has 
control of franklin savings association 
just six hours after the thrifts managers moved back into their 
offices thursday a federal appeals court temporarily set aside a 
court order issued wednesday that had returned franklin to its 
owners 
us district judge dale e saffels had ruled wednesday that 
regulators improperly seized the thrift the largest in kansas 
the appeals courts stay does not overturn saffels order but 
sets it aside for an undetermined length of time 
in response to the order issued by the 10th us circuit court 
of appeals in denver saffels ordered the office of thrift 
supervision to reinstate the resolution trust corp as conservator 
in charge of franklin the court made no comment on saffels 
decision 
the reaction is this is an order of the court and obviously 
well comply said roger stanton an attorney for franklin 
ernie franklin chairman ernest fleischer had a nice day seeing 
employees and customers they were all happy to see him back 
the ots seized control of franklin based in ottawa kan last 
february in a dispute over whether it was being managed prudently 
it placed franklin under management of the rtc the agency formed 
to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts 
franklins officers sued to regain control of the thrift and 
saffels held in a 93page opinion made public wednesday that the 
government seizure was arbitrary and capricious and had no basis in 
law 
ots attorney harris weinstein in washington reiterated wednesday 
after the ruling that the federal agency believes franklin had 
insufficient capital and was being operated unsafely before it was 
seized 
fleischer was talking to an employee in the thrifts overland 
park office when he received word of the stay on thursday he said 
it was not a setback 
the important steps are the district court decision and the 
appellate court decision he said you might want to think of 
this in terms of the reverse lets suppose the ots had won this 
case i would much rather have a district court victory and allow 
the appellate court whatever time it needs 
but he said he thought the sudden shift in control hurt several 
groups 
we do not believe that the change of control from the 
government to the management and back again to the government is 
good for the employees the public or for anyone fleischer said 
steven dimmick an ots attorney said the stay did not mean the 
fight between franklin and the government agency was over 
the government filed a notice of appeal with the appeals court 
thursday but has not yet presented its case to overturn saffels 
decision 
stanton said he anticipated it would take the court a week to 
two weeks to review the case 
an ots statement said its director t timothy ryan reinstated 
the rtc as a conservator to retake control of franklin on thursday 
night 
fleischer and other board members had met with officials from 
the rtc thursday morning the deadline saffels had given regulators 
to return the thrift 
we waited for a couple minutes and then the order came in from 
timothy ryan to return the thrift to us and thats what they 
did said john scowcroft president of franklins holding company 
government attorneys filed a motion with the appeals panel 
shortly after the deadline asking for a stay earlier thursday 
morning saffels had denied a similar request for a stay

gov michael s dukakis arrived in germany today 
on a trade mission leaving massachusetts to an insurgent 
lieutenant governor who threatened to seize control of the states 
ailing finances while hes gone 
dukakis allies doubted that lt gov evelyn murphy lagging in 
the democratic primary to succeed her boss can do anything in her 
week as acting governor to solve a fiscal crisis more than 2 years 
old 
shes elevated murphys law to an art form said stephen 
crawford a dukakis spokesman whatever can go wrong shell make 
sure goes wrong 
murphy said dukakis and his aides are overreacting 
i dont understand what hes afraid of she said thursday 
dukakis delayed his trip after murphy said she intended to take 
over state government and push secret financial plans once he left 
he eventually decided to go he arrived in berlin this morning his 
office said 
i think the episode of the past 24 hours is really kind of 
pathetic dukakis told reporters before boarding his plane 
dukakis is scheduled to return sept 14 four days before the 
primary election he said he could cut short his trip if anything 
happened that affected the governments stability 
in massachusetts the lieutenant governor is elected 
independently of the governor murphy was a strong supporter of 
dukakis in his 1988 bid for the presidency but has been at odds 
with him before 
theres no good will here and certainly no mutual respect 
murphy said 
she said she was treated with disrespect wednesday in telephone 
conversations with dukakis and his chief of staff s stephen 
rosenfeld who demanded that she disclose her plans she said she 
would disclose the plans today 
to see the kind of overreaction by him and by his staff this 
kind of wildness i dont understand murphy said 
dukakis bitterly denounced murphy saying she was using a 
political maneuver designed to gain favor with voters in her 
gubernatorial bid 
murphy is well behind her two opponents in the sept 18 
democratic primary according to recent polls before this week 
she tried gently to dissociate herself from dukakis claiming she 
warned him in writing in the spring of 1988 that the state was 
headed for trouble 
the state had one of the nations strongest economies during 
much of the 1980s a fact dukakis touted in his presidential bid 
but by the time he returned after losing to george bush the 
economy had begun slipping 
now the state has the lowest bond ratings in the country and 
just today the federal labor department announced that the states 
unemployment rate in august soared to 67 percent up from only 41 
percent a year ago the national rate stands at 56 percent 
the legislature has approved three tax increases including one 
this year that is the largest in state history 
lawmakers this year also ordered 265 million cut from the 
states 134 billion budget dukakis learning that tax revenues 
were below expectations on tuesday ordered his cabinet to make an 
additional 150 million in cuts 
murphy insisted quicker action was needed but she didnt 
immediately give specifics 
murphys actions caused a defection within her ranks william 
currier a campaign coordinator resigned this week because of her 
moves against dukakis 
currier dismissed murphys maneuver as show bizzy 
its almost an attempted bloodless coup he said

a former director of a defunct wall street 
brokerage firm has been accused of obstructing an insider trading 
inquiry and lying to securities and exchange commission 
investigators 
a federal grand jury returned a threecount indictment thursday 
against charles howard 45 of bedford nh former director and 
first vice president of thomson mckinnon securities inc us 
attorney wayne budd said 
the indictment charged howard with conspiracy to obstruct an sec 
investigation obstructing an sec investigation and perjury in the 
secs 1987 inquiry of alleged insider trading 
the 1987 sec investigation followed the announcement that 
suffield savings bank of suffield conn and coastal savings bank 
of portland maine planned to merge 
howard was a key figure in a fourstate investigation of the new 
yorkbased thomson mckinnon that led last march to 320000 
penalties against the brokerage firm to be paid to connecticut new 
hampshire vermont and maine 
howard was accused of conspiring with others to conceal from the 
sec the names of investors with inside information who had bought 
coastal stock before the july 9 1986 announcement of the merger 
plans 
the indictment also alleged that howard tried to influence 
obstruct and impede the secs investigation of the trading of 
coastal stock and that he committed perjury before the sec 
if convicted of all the charges howard faces a maximum 15 years 
in prison and a 750000 fine budd said he said arraignment had 
not been scheduled 
howards attorney steven m gordon of concord said thursday 
that howard has known for several years that federal investigators 
were probing his dealings he is in some respects relieved that 
he will now be provided with the specifics of the allegations 
against him and be permitted to fully contest the charges in a 
court of law gordon said in a statement 
howard will not comment on the case until he sees the evidence 
against him gordon said 
investigations into suspicious trading of stock in at least 10 
new england banks revolved around howard who had close ties to the 
suffield bank and a former executive robert digennaro 
digennaro former chief executive of the suffield financial 
corp was convicted on insider trading and obstruction charges 
last year investigators traced a lead of privileged information 
from digennaro through a simsbury developer to a hartford 
stockbroker 
days before its chairman was indicted suffield filed a 24 
million lawsuit against howard for the losses the company sustained 
buying back stock under the brokers direction

president bush arrived at 
budget negotiations with congressional leaders today saying he is 
committed to working out a 50 billion deficitreduction program 
for next year 
nothing has transpired anywhere that makes me less interested 
in getting this budget deficit under control once and for all 
bush said as he arrived at andrews air force base outside 
washington the site of the talks 
some lawmakers have said that with the weakening economy and the 
uncertain situation in the persian gulf a smaller 
deficitreduction plan could avoid pushing the economy into a 
recession 
asked if the figure of 50 billion in savings is carved in 
stone the president responded yes 
bush said he was somewhat optimistic that a budget deal 
could be worked out quickly i am pleased with the 
cooperative attitude that exists up there now on capitol hill 
bush told reporters on leaving the white house i am hopeful that 
this spirit of cooperation will be the catalyst in getting the 
budget agreement thats long overdue 
bush remained at the negotiations for about a halfhour the 
budget negotiators ending a fiveweek break for congress august 
recess hoped to work out a deal by monday 
but the president acknowledged that democrats and republicans 
have a large gap to bridge before finalizing a compromise 
big differences remain he said its going to take 
compromise 
congressional negotiators said foreign payments for american 
military forces in the persian gulf would help their efforts to 
reduce the deficit 
i think the fact that some allies are being helpful will help 
us rep newt gingrich rga said as bargainers gathered at 
andrews air force base in maryland outside washington 
obviously we have to take into account the cost of the desert 
shield operation said house majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo referring to the us operations in the middle east to 
the extent those costs can be offset by our allies around the world 
that makes our job easier 
officials announced that saudi arabia the ousted kuwaiti 
government japan and south korea have pledged to help the united 
states bear the cost of the economic and military campaign against 
iraq 
well put a plan on the table said sen pete domenici 
rnm from what i understand the democrats will put their plan 
on some time this morning and then well start negotiating 
democratic and republican negotiators said they agree on the 
amount of deficit reductions they need but disagree strongly over 
how far to cut military spending 
the new fiscal year begins oct 1 without some combination of 
spending cuts and tax increases the administration estimates the 
budget gap will approach a record 250 billion republican 
officials said 
unless a budget deal is enacted by then the grammrudman law 
will impose about 100 billion in spending cuts in most domestic 
and defense programs as a result the bargainers hope to wrap up a 
deal by monday to give congress time to enact it 
leaders of both sides said they want to aim for packages cutting 
red ink by 50 billion next year and 500 billion over five years 
since iraqs aug 2 conquest of kuwait and the resulting oil price 
increases some lawmakers have cautioned that the firstyear figure 
should be lower for fear of driving the weakening economy into a 
recession 
gop officials speaking on condition they not be identified 
said their first offer would be similar to the 53 billion 
deficitcutting measure the administration drew up in july 
it would include new taxes on alcoholic products and defense 
cuts of about 7 billion several billion dollars less than 
democrats prefer 
i suspect the defense figure will fare better than it 
otherwise would have had there not been a crisis in the middle 
east said house minority leader robert michel rill 
democrats talked of a package that would take a deeper slice out 
of the pentagon more akin to their earlier proposals of 9 billion 
to 16 billion cuts they said they were reluctant to add the costs 
of the us middle east military buildup about 1 billion monthly 
into the longrange spending plan 
it comes more under the head of emergency conditions than of 
regular planning for the future said house speaker thomas foley 
dwash 
foley house majority leader richard gephardt dmo and senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine said they wanted a budget 
plan that also encouraged economic growth protected social 
programs contained progressive taxes and pushed the united states 
toward energy security 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said he favored energy 
production incentives domenici ranking republican on the senate 
budget committee said new taxes and tax incentives on energy were 
a possibility 
divisions remained within gop ranks gingrich the no 2 house 
republican continued to call for tax cuts to spur the economy

oil prices dipped this morning but stayed above 
30 per barrel as traders sold futures to pocket their profits from 
thursdays price surge 
i dont really think theres anything in terms of hard news 
said william byers an analyst with bear stearns amp co i think 
theres simply some profit taking after the market ran up 
yesterday 
in late morning trading on the new york mercantile exchange 
light sweet crude was down 70 cents to 3074 per barrel on october 
contracts on thursday oil had shot above 30 per barrel on the 
merc for the second time during the middle east crisis that began 
aug 2 
the merc had previously not seen 30 oil since november 1985 
unleaded gasoline was down 22 cent to 9485 cents per gallon 
this morning for october delivery while home heating oil was down 
184 cents to 8640 cents for october delivery 
natural gas was down to 1501 per 1000 cubic feet after 
closing thursday at 1530 
other contract months for petroleum futures were also trading 
lower today 
a broker with shearson lehman brothers inc said todays selling 
was partially attributable to a report that the saudis would be 
able to vastly increase their crude production by the end of the 
year 
a multinational military force has assembled in saudi arabia to 
protect it in the wake of iraqs invasion and occupation of 
neighboring kuwait 
anticipation that president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev would issue a joint statement on the persian gulf after 
their summit sunday in helsinki finland also depressed prices 
the shearson broker said 
the soviet union has been an ally of iraq so a joint 
ussoviet statement would show its not the united states 
versus iraq but its more the world versus iraq said the 
broker who did not want his name used 
the continued airlifting of hostages out of territory controlled 
by iraq was also calming traders this morning the broker said

renault vehicules industriels sa has 
sweetened its offer and agreed to buy all outstanding shares of 
mack trucks inc that it does not already own in an 81 million 
deal the truck company said 
mack said thursday it had agreed to be sold to the parisbased 
renault for 625 per share renault had previously offered 6 a 
share 
renault owned 445 percent of macks 29 million shares prior to 
the merger agreement as of late wednesday renault had received an 
additional 45 percent of macks shares under terms of its initial 
bid 
the tender offer has been extended until sept 20 said renault 
spokesman bill catacosinos thursday 
the french car company has been trying to buy the 
allentownbased truck company for several months saying it was 
making the offer because of the continuing deterioration of the 
financial condition of mack and the need to restructure the 
companys debt 
mack lost a record 1854 million last year and 972 million 
for the six months ending june 30 1990 
net sales for the first half of 1990 were down 22 percent to 
7939 million from just over 1 billion in 1989 
the companys fiveyear financial plan in july projected a net 
loss of about 130 million for the year ending dec 31 1990 at 
the time mack officials said they did not expect the company to 
show a profit before 1992 
in the past year mack had tried to reduce business costs and 
conserve cash amidst a slowing market for heavy trucks and 
negotiated an agreement with the united auto workers for employees 
at macks winnsboro sc truck plant 
mack is one of north americas largest producers of heavyduty 
diesel trucks

ibm corp and metaphor computer 
systems plan to ease a bottleneck in the computer industry by 
developing software that could be used to write other software 
the new venture patriot partners will start work immediately 
on software that would allow most applications programs to work 
with major operating systems including multiple versions of unix 
and os2 
ibm and metaphor said thursday the project probably would take 
two or three years the venture to be based in mountain view will 
be jointly staffed and financed and is expected to employ up to 200 
people 
the personal computersoftware industry has been hampered by the 
cost and difficulty of writing new programs and converting them to 
different formats 
but ibm and metaphor predicted their new venture will help ease 
that problem and make it easier to include such sophisticated 
features as stereo sound and fullmotion video and let the programs 
work together on networks of different kinds of computers 
we think a whole lot of brandnew thinking will come out of 
this said joseph guglielmi president of ibms 
applicationssolution division 
analysts said the effort could have a major impact on the 
software industry provided that patriot partners can do what it 
promises 
theres a lot of questions as to whether they can pull it 
off said nancy mcsharry an analyst with international data 
corp a market research company in mountain view 
several years ago software pioneer mitch kapor founded a 
company for a similar project but his firm on technology has 
become a developer of applications for the macintosh computer 
it was mitch kapors initial thought and then he realized how 
huge the task was and he came up with much less ambitions plans 
said bruce lupatkin an analyst with hambrecht amp quist in san 
francisco he called the new project a bit like searching for the 
holy grail 
but metaphors president david little said the new venture 
differed from kapors plans 
he had four guys and a little venture capital liddle 
said we have a battlehardened organization we have ibm as a 
partner and accept that its a big activity were going to have to 
do 
metaphor was founded in 1982 by liddle chief executive and 
president of the new venture and other former xerox corp 
executives who worked with star computer that project pioneered 
the idea of controlling personal computers with a mouse pointing 
device and set of visual prompts technology that helped popularize 
apples macintosh 
metaphor originally sold its own computers but now chiefly sells 
dataanalysis software that incorporates its graphical user 
interface in 1988 ibm paid 10 million for an 8 percent stake in 
metaphor and the two companies jointly market metaphors 
dataanalysis software

winstonsalem nc ap rj reynolds tobacco co is using an 
old name to introduce a new lowcost premium cigarette 
company spokesmen say they think theres a niche for their 
sterling cigarette which will sell about 3 a carton below the 
price of premium brands and 1 to 2 above savings blends 
but industry analysts say its a tricky move for the tobacco 
company which also sells such premium brands as camel and winston 
its a very tricky piece of marketing said david goldman 
an analyst at nomura research institute in new york if youre so 
successful with this brand then youve created a conception in 
the consumers mind that highquality brands can be had at a lower 
price 
despite that risk goldman says he thinks the cigarette will be 
successful 
its innovative he said my feeling is its going to be a 
very successful brand more importantly it might be the beginning 
of a brandnew cigarette segment 
some smokers may remember the old sterling a luxury smoke 
touted as a cigarette for a growing segment of the population who 
appreciate the finer things in life as a news release stated 
but similarities end at the name said reynolds tobacco spokeswoman 
peggy c carter 
the tobacco blend and the packaging are different she said 
sterling to go on sale oct 1 will have a metallicgray 
package with burgundy and diagonal stripes teal and gold on 
menthol packages cartons will have coupons that consumers can peel 
off at the checkout counter and get 3 off the price 
we do believe sterling will enhance our portfolio because its 
a whole new dimension in our pricing structure here ms carter 
said it is targeted to people who are looking for a 
premiumquality cigarette with a price advantage there is a niche 
of people looking for this type of cigarette as a midpoint price

bethlehem steel corp said friday it will 
make 100 million in improvements at its johnstown production plant 
if it obtains concessions from the united steelworkers of america 
sufficient concessions would allow the company to make major 
improvements including a new continuous caster and modernization 
of an existing bar mill to permit rod production said bethlehem 
chairman walter williams 
the bar rod and wire division headquarters plant in johnstown 
employs about 2000 workers while plants in lackawanna ny and 
sparrows point md each employ 350 workers 
the current labor contract which expires july 31 1993 calls 
for modifications to the agreement for plants having financial 
difficulties and the bar rod and wire division is one of 
them said company spokesman henry von spreckelsen 
he would not indicate what form of concessions the company is 
seeking and would only say the division has lost millions of 
dollars since its formation in 1983 
it must be competitive on its own terms he said in this 
case were saying for an unprofitable operation to survive requires 
a reduction in production costs through a reduction in labor 
costs and more efficient facilities 
weve made some progress but it hasnt been sufficient he 
said

facing a debt of 5 million new 
england monthly magazine will cease publication this month its 
editors announced 
richard todd editor of the 6yearold publication told the 
magazines 30 employees thursday that the september issue will be 
the last 
its been a tough year for everyone in the magazine 
business todd said for us it proved fatal 
consumer magazine ad pages are down overall this year and the 
tough ad climate has already led to the demise of woman magazine 
and the regional magazines southpoint and 7 days 
earlier this week frances hachette sa said it would end 
regular publication of its memories magazine with the october issue 
and publish only two issues of it in 1991 because of the weak ad 
climate the news nostalgia magazine had been published every other 
month and had planned to go monthly this fall 
according magazineweeks ad monitor ad revenues for the first 
seven months of 1990 at new england monthly were down 75 percent 
from 1989 
from its first issue in april 1984 the magazine attracted a 
base of 120000 subscribers but it was unable to turn a profit 
industry observers said the magazine and the target audience 
were not specific enough to draw large amounts of advertising in 
several critical categories such as home furnishings food and 
retailing 
i think what it did best werent always sexy issues said 
geoffrey wolff a rhode islandbased writer who was a regular 
contributor to new england monthly 
new england monthly twice won the national magazine award for 
general excellence it won the same award from the american society 
of magazine editors 
new england monthly was founded by texas monthly veteran robert 
nylen and editor daniel okrent todd succeeded okrent as editor 
last october 
the magazine was threatened with closing 18 months ago but 
given a new lease on life when it was bought by telemedia inc 
canadas largest publisher of consumer magazines 
the new owner pledged to pour working capital into new england 
monthly but todd said the magazine faced an outstanding debt of

the beleagured advertising giant saatchi amp saatchi 
co plc announced friday it does not have enough reserves at hand 
to pay a dividend 
the shortage follows saatchis sale of two consultancy 
businesses for less than the expected amount 
saatchi is in the process of selling all its consulting 
businesses as it tries to focus on its advertising and marketing 
businesses saatchi grew rapidly in the 1980s and owns the new 
yorkbased ad agencies saatchi amp saatchi advertising and backer 
spielvogel bates 
in june saatchi sold peterson amp co a litigation support 
management company to petersons management for about 22 
million saatchi paid 79 million for the unit in september 1987 
atchi sold the hay co consultancy to a group of 
investors and management for 90 million in cash and notes it 
bought that company in 1985 for an undisclosed sum 
the londonbased advertising agency took a writeoff of about 76 
milllso in june saaion on the sales and cited them for its inability 
to pay the 
dividend 
a saatchi spokesman said that although there are funds to pay a 
dividend it would involve getting the permission of bond holders 
and paying a high price to obtain that permission 
we didnt think it was prudent to squander the funds at the 
moment said the spokesman who requested anonymity 
the spokesman also said that the problem was largely 
technical and that payments would yment was a 
reflection of the fact that they have a balance sheet which is in 
a fragile state 
it saves them 6 million pounds about 11 million a year 
which is a sensible move at this point in time sheppard said 
losses are also expected from the sale of the gartner group 
inc a stamford connbased consultancy being sold to an 
investment management group for 55 million in cash and 15 million 
in notes and other obligations saatchi bought the group in june 
1988 for 86 million

even minor disruptions of gasoline supply 
channels could cause shortages at gas pumps this winter because of 
the persian gulf crisis oil industry leaders and analysts warned 
friday 
the problem isnt just that the cutoff of iraqi and kuwaiti 
supplies has reduced flow by nearly 2 million barrels a day its 
that the replacement oil mainly from steppedup saudi arabian 
production is heavier and contains more sulfur 
that means less of the lighter petroleum products like gasoline 
jet fuel diesel and home heating oil can be extracted from each 
barrel and the coking and cracking units that break down the 
heavier oil are already running at near capacity the experts said 
in a series of interviews this week 
we are really on the razors edge with no margin for error 
said george baker an energy analyst with merrill lynch research in 
new york 
as we go into the fourth quarter theres a potential for it 
getting tight said lodwrick m cook the chief executive of los 
angelesbased atlantic richfield co 
their worries followed warnings by bush administration officials 
and other private analysts this week that oil shortages could 
develop out of the mideast crisis 
baker said shortages at the pumps might be caused this winter by 
something as minor as the fire that recently knocked out part of 
shells refinery in deer park texas 
he noted that during last years fourth quarter at least two 
such events occurred a fire at an exxon refinery in baton rouge 
la and hurricane hugos assault on an amerada hess facility in 
st croix virgin islands 
any prolonged outages would change it from the razors edge of 
balance to a situation where people actually might not be able to 
get gas baker said 
he and cook shied away from using shock words from the 70s 
like gas lines but baker suggested that some form of 
rationing such as shorter hours of operation or 10gallon limits 
might be seen at gas pumps during the fourth and first quarters 
cook said it was too early to make predictions but he finds the 
situation worrisome although gasoline use drops as winter 
approaches use of heating oil rises he noted in an interview 
home heating oil also is one of the lighter products made from 
crude oil 
if you look at purely the arithmetic we ought to be able to 
get through but theres a lot of other factors cook said the 
unknowns include whether suppliers at any stage hold back hoping 
for higher prices later panic buying by drivers could also could 
cause problems he said 
if people decide to hoard supplies if people decide to top 
off their tanks there could be problems cook said 
another chief executive robert mcclements jr of sun co in 
radnor pa rearranged his agenda at a meeting with analysts in 
new york last week to address the problems caused by the heavier 
crude hed been scheduled to talk about the cleanair legislation 
making its way through congress 
mcclements estimated the cutoff of iraqi and kuwaiti crude oil 
and refined products may produce a shortfall equivalent to 195 
million barrels of crude a day even if higher prices cut demand 
the shortfall is likely to remain at 15 million barrels per day 
the heavier oil on average will yield 8 percent or 9 percent 
less of the lightend products such as gasoline than the light 
sweet crude oil it is replacing mcclements told the analysts with 
refineries already operating at near capacity it will be hard to 
compensate for that he said 
the message was the tight markets out there already refiners 
are at very high levels of utilization said timothy r hughes 
sun cos director of investor relations 
products like gasoline and distillates such as home heating 
oil are going to be very tight he said 
its possible that wed get back to gas lines or rationing in 
some form if this keeps up hughes said

tokyo watering holes 
but at this cozy bar water is the hardest thing on the menu in 
fact its the only thing on the menu 
designer water in dozens and dozens of brands has flooded the 
japanese market with imports expected to more than double this 
year and at aqua bar they drink it straight 
the bar on the sixth floor of an upscale seibu department 
store is near boutiques for designer brands chanel and piaget 
we get maybe 100 or 120 customers in here a day said 
bartender masamitsu matsumoto they may not know their water very 
well but they know this is the fashion 
according to yoshio yamamoto executive director of the japan 
mineral water association the market this year is expected to be 
about 1034 million with imports forecast to go up 137 percent 
from last year 
sales of domestic brands which make up about 85 percent of the 
japanese market are expected to increase roughly 20 percent he 
said

kazuhiro uda head of the tokyo waterworks departments water 
quality section disagreed mineral water is just a fad 
but he acknowledged that legal requirements for chlorine tend to 
create somewhat smelly water 
each summer we also have some problems with mold and i 
suppose some people have begun to lose confidence in us he said

the british government is preparing to fight off 
any overseas bid to attract the international coffee and cocoa 
organizations officials said thursday 
the uk government wishes to keep the organizations in london 
and is doing everything possible to get the best deal possible on 
rents said an official from the ministry of agriculture 
speaking anonymously 
her comment followed a statement by dutch officials attending 
the first day of international cocoa organization talks here that 
their government was considering offering the 41nation body a new 
home in the netherlands 
in june the west german government said it was likely to 
support a bid being drawn up by the state of hamburg to attract the 
73nation international coffee organization away from london 
neither government has yet made formal bids for the two 
organizations which provide a forum for producing and consuming 
countries to discuss matters of mutual concern 
in the past the organizations have also operated 
pricestabilization treaties for both commodities 
the lease on their present shared headquarters in central 
london which is held by the british agriculture ministry expires 
in may 1991 the landlords are seeking a rent increase 
both organizations are eager to keep down costs to member 
governments 
the ministry of agriculture has appointed agents to negotiate 
the rent and look at cheaper alternative headquarters in the 
capital 
last year the british government guaranteed rent subsidies to 
the international wheat and sugar organizations in a successful bid 
to persuade them to remain in london in the face of offers of 
alternative accommodation in paris brussels belgium and 
amsterdam the netherlands 
commodity industry sources said the departure of the coffee and 
cocoa organizations would damage londons prestige as the worlds 
commodity center

usx corp returned to its roots friday to 
launch a 250 million investment in a historic steel mill saying 
the project will ensure the survival of steel in the industrys 
cradle 
the company broke ground for a continuous slab caster at the 
115yearold edgar thomson mill andrew carnegies first steel 
plant in the depressed monongahela valley region near pittsburgh 
in continuous casting molten steel is poured into a caster that 
shapes it into slabs up to 36 feet long the process eliminates 
several steps in making flatrolled steel saving time and money 
and improving quality 
in marking the start of this construction project we are also 
marking the beginning of a new era in steelmaking in the mon valley 
region said usx chairman charles a corry 
the company is undertaking this large investment on the 
premise that worldclass quality steel products can be produced at 
competitive costs in the mon valley he said 
the caster which will be completed in mid1992 will have an 
annual capacity of 26 million tons 
the company is building the caster under terms of a labor 
agreement reached with the united steelworkers of america in 1987 
it plans to begin renovating the hot strip mill at its nearby irvin 
plant later this year for another 250 million millions more are 
being spent to renovate the nearby clairton coke ovens 
some years ago corry said there were serious questions about 
whether the companys steel division would still be operating in 
the valley in 1990 let alone investing a quarter of a billion 
dollars for modernization 
while this project is not without risks we are confident that 
with the dedicated support and cooperation of our employees and the 
community we can succeed he said 
there arent many steelworkers left in the mon valley an area 
hit hard by plant closings in the 1980s 
the caster will mean the loss of an unknown number of jobs but 
union and business leaders agree the improvement means job security 
for most of the 4000 people who work at thomson and the two other 
usx plants in the valley 
the project will create about 550 construction jobs and civic 
leaders hope the casters will draw other industries to the area 
bethlehem steel corp joined usx in hailing the improvements 
friday the company said it will invest 100 million in its 
johnstown production facility if it obtains labor concessions from 
the steelworkers union 
sufficient concessions would allow the company to make major 
improvements including another new continuous caster and 
modernization of an existing bar mill to permit rod production 
said bethlehem chairman walter williams 
the bar rod and wire division headquarters plant in johnstown 
employs about 2000 workers while the divisions plants in 
lackawanna ny and sparrows point md employ 350 workers 
apiece 
the current pact which expires july 31 1993 calls for 
modifications to the agreement for plants having financial 
difficulties and the bar rod and wire division is one of 
them said company spokesman henry von spreckelsen 
he would not indicate what form of concessions the company is 
seeking and would only say the division has lost millions of 
dollars since its formation in 1983 
it must be competitive on its own terms he said in this 
case were saying for an unprofitable operation to survive requires 
a reduction in production costs through a reduction in labor 
costs and more efficient facilities 
weve made some progress but it hasnt been sufficient

the government did not intervene in the foreign 
exchange markets to support the dollars value from may through 
july the first time in four years it has refrained from taking 
action during one of its quarterly reporting periods officials 
said friday 
federal reserve system officials said the dollars slide against 
the german mark british pound and japanese yen during the quarter 
was not seen as a threat 
this does not mean were out of the intervention business or a 
change in policy or a change in approach said sam y cross 
executive vice president of the new york federal reserve bank 
which manages foreignexchange operations for the fed 
during the three months ended july 31 the dollars value 
declined 8 percent against the yen 5 percent against the mark and 
12 percent against the pound cross said at a news conference 
it was the first time since augustoctober 1986 that the 
nations central bank refrained from selling or buying dollars to 
affect the value of the currency during a quarter the fed said 
the fed attempts to regulate the value of the dollar against 
other currencies either by selling or buying dollars in foreign 
exchange markets where various currencies are bought and sold much 
like soybeans or barrels of oil 
if the central bank believes the dollar is undervalued it will 
buy dollars to limit their supply on world markets in the hope that 
will prop up their value if it believes the dollar is too strong 
it will sell dollars from its reserves to try to lower their value 
through the law of supply and demand 
such interventions are not always successful but they can 
change the dollars value over the short term particularly when 
central banks of other nations join in 
a strong dollar makes imported goods cheaper but makes us 
exports more expensive on world markets a weak dollar conversely 
makes imports more expensive but benefits exporters 
cross said the fed did not view the dollars decline against 
other major currencies during mayjuly to be a major threat to the 
economy or that the dollar was being pushed inappropriately one 
way or another 
he also said there was no panic movement of the dollar in the 
markets that may have prompted the fed to intervene 
we certainly do not try to keep the dollar at a rigid level 
he added 
he said domestic issues in japan germany and great britain were 
in large part responsible for the rise in those currencies against 
the dollar however the dollar also was weakened later in the 
threemonth period by signs that the us economy was 
deteriorating he said 
the fed was not completely out of the foreign exchange market 
however on behalf of the treasury it sold 1 billion marks for 
dollars on the open market and sold another 1 billion marks for 
dollars directly to another central bank cross said 
but these transactions were timed to have little or no impact on 
the dollars value he said they were undertaken as part of the 
treasurys exchange stabilization fund to adjust balances and to 
enable the fund to eliminate some of the foreign currency it stores 
with the fed 
the treasury earned a profit of about 330 million from the 
currency dealings cross said

a surprise audit of 30 radio and tv stations 
indicates most apparently were overcharging for political 
advertising a federal communications commission official said 
friday 
roy j stewart chief of the fccs mass media bureau said the 
charges were not necessarily deliberate and that the commission 
would not impose sanctions pending further investigation 
i would prefer to think they broadcasters are not aware of 
their full range of responsibilities in carrying out the law 
stewart said he said no more audits were planned and that no final 
determinations had been made regarding any violations by individual 
stations 
instead the fcc will increase its efforts to educate station 
executives in the intricacies of political advertising laws 
stewart said 
broadcasters said they were making goodfaith efforts to comply 
with complicated rules 
historically the commission has not done a good job of 
educating broadcasters to the various nuances in this important 
area said edward o fritts president of the national 
association of broadcasters 
the fcc can impose sanctions ranging from a letter of admonition 
to fines totaling 250000 in april the commission fined an 
indianapolis television station wxin 10000 for violating the 
political ad rules 
the july 1617 audit indicated widespread overcharging at 16 of 
20 tv stations and four of eight radio stations two other radio 
stations sold no political ads during the time audited 
at one tv station candidates paid 5500 to run a 30second ad 
in a time slot that cost commercial advertisers no more than 
3000 stewart said 
stewart would not identify any of the stations that may have 
been in violation he said they first would be given a chance to 
respond to the commissions inquiries before a final determination 
of any violations were made 
the audit reviewed the stations compliance with federal rules 
requiring that candidates have equal opportunities commonly 
referred to as equal time to appear on stations and that stations 
sell ads to candidates at the lowest rates fr specific time slots 
political advertising rates are a sore spot in congress where 
proposals are pending to guarantee that candidates get the lowest 
rates without fear of being preempted by commercial advertisers who 
later offer to pay higher prices 
the bureau said broadcasters sales techniques encouraged 
candidates to buy higherpriced classes of time 
it appears from the audit that certain industry practices are 
not in compliance with the law and that political candidates have 
paid higher prices than commercial advertisers at a majority of the 
stations the bureau said 
besides the pricing problems the audit found many stations 
werent keeping adequate records to allow candidates to determine 
whether they should be getting equal time with opponents 
one proponent of tougher political ad rules sen john danforth 
rmo said the fccs audit confirms what candidates have known 
for some time that broadcasters routinely ignore the law on ad 
pricing 
the inspections the first of their kind were carried out in 
cincinnati dallasfort worth philadelphia portland ore and 
san francisco the commission said the stations were chosen because 
of their diverse locations and because they serve large areas 
jeff rosser general manager at one of the stations kdfwtv in 
dallas said officials there thought they had been complying but 
found problems when they conducted their own audit 
one could argue that we did overcharge not by design but by 
not being totally aware of the small print and the intricacies of a 
very complicated rule rosser said friday 
dirk brinkerhoff general manager of ktxatv in dallas and 
charles d schwartz general manager of wwdbfm in philadelphia 
said their stations would be found in compliance 
jim wood general manager of wwnkfm in cincinnati said his 
station did not sell political ads during the audit period 
the other audited stations were

oil prices fell friday as traders sold futures 
to pocket their profits from thursdays surge over 31 a barrel 
but crude stayed higher for the week amid fears of supply shortages 
this winter 
there was really no news to go on said ed kevelson a 
trader with dean witter reynolds inc it was a friday so people 
were more likely to take profits 
light sweet crude for october delivery fell 139 to 3004 per 
barrel on the new york mercantile exchange later contract months 
also fell 
for the fourday trading week shortened by the labor day 
holiday october crude was up 272 per barrel following 
speculation that the persian gulf crisis may drag on prices also 
gained in response to government statements that supply shortages 
could be on the way 
unleaded gasoline for october delivery dropped 201 cents to 
9306 cents per gallon on friday later contract months were also 
down 
home heating oil fell 426 cents to 8398 cents per gallon for 
october while later months were also down 
gasoline was down 326 cents for the week while heating oil was 
up 809 cents over the fourday period 
fridays fall in oil prices helped boost the stock market the 
dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 2326 to 261955 
finishing the week with a gain of 519 points 
kevelson said oil made a steadier rise above the 30perbarrel 
threshold this week than it had two weeks earlier when it hit that 
level for the first time in nearly five years 
although no major news or rumors were moving the markets friday 
the bits of news that traders were watching tended to help keep 
prices down 
fridays selling was partly attributable to a report that the 
saudis would be able to increase vastly their crude production by 
the end of the year 
anticipations that president bush and soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev would issue a joint statement on the persian gulf 
after their summit sunday in helsinki finland were also helping

president bush and 
congressional leaders resumed budget talks friday as lawmakers said 
foreign payments for us troops in the persian gulf would ease 
some but not all pressure on the deficit 
after a fiveweek break for congress summer vacation 
negotiators returned to work in the main bar of the base officers 
club 10 miles from the capitol 
their goal was to finish by monday a 50 billion package of tax 
boosts and spending cuts for next year and 500 billion in savings 
over the next five years reporters were confined to another 
building on the base about two miles away in an effort to reduce 
interruptions 
democrats and republicans swapped plans friday afternoon as the 
bargaining began said officials who asked to not be identified 
the administration proposal calls for 525 billion in savings 
next year and 5132 billion over the next five years one official 
said it is similar to the budget bush proposed in january and to 
a july administration plan never formally released but revealed by 
gop bargainers 
the proposal calls for 4 billion in defense cuts and 155 
billion in reductions in benefit programs including medicare 
it seeks 204 billion in new taxes including levies on alcohol 
and limits on the deduction allowed for state and local income 
taxes it also calls for a cut in the capital gains tax rate which 
bush says would raise money by encouraging the sale of real estate 
and other property 
fewer details of the democratic proposal were known an official 
said it relied heavily on defense cuts and taxes including levies 
on energy the plan took no account of the costs of us military 
operations in the persian gulf the official said 
democrats have argued that the costs of operation desert shield 
are similar to a onetime emergency and should not be counted in 
the governments longrange budgeting 
unless lawmakers and the administration enact a deal by oct 1 
the grammrudman law will impose about 100 billion in cuts to most 
defense and domestic programs most participants on both sides say 
slashes of that amount would be so harsh that they could not be 
allowed to stand very long 
bargainers want to finish their work at andrews by monday to 
give congress a chance to write the plan into law 
as the talks began bargainers reaffirmed their goal of slicing 
50 billion off of next years federal deficit 
nothing has happened anywhere that makes me less interested in 
getting this budget deficit under control once and for all bush 
told reporters as he arrived at the base for a 30minute visit to 
the talks 
if we needed a budget agreement five weeks ago we need one 
more today said house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
since the talks recessed in late july the economy has shown 
signs of weakening and iraq and the united states have faced off in 
what may be a longterm standoff in the persian gulf 
legislators welcomed the news that saudi arabia the exiled 
government of kuwait japan and south korea would be paying the 
united states billions of dollars to defray the costs of american 
forces in the middle east 
it helps out a little said rep silvio conte rmass 
but with us military expenses in the gulf expected to run 
about 1 billion per month barring largescale fighting conte 
and others cautioned that there was no reason to expect that the 
foreign help would put a major dent in the federal deficit 
the administration has estimated that unless some savings are 
found next years deficit would be a record 250 billion fiscal 
1991 begins oct 1 
republicans have been optimistic that because of the 
confrontation with iraq cuts to the 290 billion defense budget 
will be limited 
i think well have an orderly defense builddown now said 
sen phil gramm rtexas i think were not going to have the 
defense meltdown some people thought 
democrats have sought defense cuts more in the 9 billion to 16 
billion range 
other important differences remained between democrats and 
republicans 
sen pete domenici rnm said republicans were hoping for a 
package that would rely slightly more on spending cuts than on tax 
increases in the first year democrats want the two components to 
be equal in size 
domenici gramm and senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
all from energyproducing states said they wanted a plan that 
encouraged energy production with enticements such as tax credits 
democrats said they want a package that encourages the united 
states to move toward energy independence with some officials 
saying privately that they have discussed some sort of new taxes on 
energy 
big differences remain bush said its going to take 
compromise

eaglepicher industries inc has been 
financially devastated by liability for asbestos disease claims and 
faces insolvency by the end of 1992 a courtordered report 
released friday said 
the report by former federal judge marvin e frankel marked a 
major step in implementing a national class action for thousands of 
lawsuits filed against companies with insufficient assets to pay 
asbestos claims 
the 24page document was a stark portrayal of a company 
struggling under the weight of asbestos claims which form the 
biggest product liability matter in us history eaglepicher 
based in cincinnati is a maker of industrial products that used 
asbestos widely for years 
frankel said eaglepicher has more than 64000 asbestos claims 
pending with another 20000 being filed annually the companys 
1988 forecast of 613 million in asbestos liability was too 
optimistic he said and it faces a cash shortfall of up to 75 
million by 1992 
there is in a word a clear danger for disaster for 
eaglepicher within the next two years the report said there 
is a strong prospect of insolvency by the end of 1992 
frankel also said there is a clear risk the company will not 
be able to pay future claimants seeking to recover for asbestos 
injuries or deaths inhaled asbestos fibers can cause lung cancer 
and other respiratory ailments many years after the fact 
at this time eaglepichers options appear limited frankel 
said aggressive settlement of claims and aggressive litigation 
both require cash flow beyond current expectations 
frankel was appointed as a special master in the case last month 
by us district judge jack b weinstein frankel said eaglepicher 
met legal requirements for its claims to be converted into a class 
action 
weinstein has said he plans to pool the resources of 
eaglepicher and up to five other companies that dont have the 
money to fight cases in court or pay present and future claims 
weinsteins effort is part of a threetiered plan to resolve 20 
years of contentious litigation and clear state and federal courts 
nationwide of some 90000 asbestos lawsuits 
the judge has said he expects to combine funds from eaglepicher 
and the other companies with money from the manville trust to 
settle claims 
the manville trust formed after manville corp reorganized in 
bankruptcy court is in the process of being overhauled a plan for 
manville corp to inject up to 520 million in new money into the 
trust was announced friday 
frankel said eaglepicher has paid out 5990 per claim to 
settle about 64000 claims to date sharply higher than 1988 
estimates it also doled out 35 million on legal expenses last 
year while generating 27 million less from operations than 
projected 
eaglepicher has been forced to sell off businesses to meet its 
asbestos claims but even the recent divestiture of three divisions 
fell short by 123 million also its remaining insurance for 
fiscal 1990 and 1991 is just 8 million 17 million less than 
anticipated 
the result is a picture that is fraught with risks going 
to the companys very survival let alone its ability to meet its 
asbestos liabilities frankel said 
in addition to the fund created by eaglepicher and the other 
companies a second part of the national asbestos plan called for a 
group of healthy companies facing claims to form a settlement fund 
in cleveland 
but that attempt was struck down by the 6th us circuit court 
of appeals in cincinnati which said federal judge thomas d 
lambros did not have the right to consolidate cases outside his 
jurisdiction 
the third phase of the plan a class action of cases that would 
go to trial is proceeding before federal judge robert m parker 
in beaumont texas where a hearing is set for next friday

copper futures prices soared more than 7 cents a pound to their 
highest levels in nearly a year friday reflecting renewed concerns 
that labor and production problems will lead to further tightening 
of supplies 
on other commodity markets precious metals were mixed oil 
futures fell sharply grains and soybeans were lower and livestock 
and meat futures were mixed 
copper futures settled 39 cents to 725 cents higher on new

finished 695 cents higher at 13035 a pound 
the rally followed an advance of 205 cents in the september 
contract on thursday making for a twoday gain of 93 cents or 
about 74 percent 
analysts said the surge in buying interest was prompted in part 
by reports of production setbacks or labor problems in a number of 
copperproducing countries including chile peru zambia and zaire 
frederick demler metals analyst with painewebber inc said two 
key developments were the shutdown due to environmental problems of 
an exxon corp copper smelter in chile and the rejection of a 
contract offer by striking copper miners in peru 
there are a number of production problems around the world and 
there are still relatively low worldwide inventories demler said 
tom blaney metals specialist with balfour maclaine corp said 
fridays stronger stock market and steep drop in oil prices 
bolstered confidence in the economy and contribued to coppers 
gains 
the japanese were heavy buyers of copper analysts said 
speculative funds also bought large amounts after the december 
contract surpassed 126 a pound previously a point of a 
resistance

board of trade amid profittaking and fading expectations that the 
united states will grant agricultural export credits to the soviet 
union soon 
forecasts for rain this weekend in the mississippi delta region 
where soybeans have been stressed by dry hot conditions also 
weighed on the soybean complex said pat oconnell grains analyst

government bond prices rose friday as an oil 
price drop dampened inflation fears and an employment report 
offered some signs of a weakening economy 
the bellwether 30year treasury bond gained rsqb point or 375 
per 1000 face amount its yield declined to 891 percent from late 
thursdays 895 percent 
prices fell in morning trading after the government said august 
employment data showed weakness in the labor market but not 
enough to induce the fed to foster an economic revival by lowering 
interest rates 
the report said the civilian unemployment rate increased to 56 
percent in august from 55 percent in july nonfarm payroll 
employment dropped by 75000 jobs after a revised decline of 
89000 in july 
a slight upward revision in the july payroll figures suggested 
to credit market participants that conditions in the job market 
while bad werent as severe as previously thought 
that left an ambiguous impression about the economys health 
which led some bond traders to believe that the fed will refrain 
from acting until a clearer picture emerges 
but market sentiment later shifted in large part because oil 
futures prices declined reducing the fear of worsening inflation 
light sweet crude fell 139 to 3004 per barrel on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
inflation is bad for the bond market because it erodes the value 
of fixedincome securities 
scott winningham a market analyst at stone amp mccarthy research 
associates inc in princeton nj said bond prices had been 
following the oil market in lockstep until focus shifted to the 
employment report earlier this week 
after the report was released the focus again returned to oil 
he said 
fed policy issues apparently are on the back burner as market 
participants concluded they are not going to ease imminently 
winningham said 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm governments gained about 332 point intermediate 
maturities rose about 532 point and longterm issues were up 
about rsqb point according to telerate inc a financial information 
service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer gained 197 to 114670 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 760 percent as the 
discount declined 1 basis point to 737 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills rose to 771 percent as the discount added 1 basis 
point to 733 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 772 
percent as the discount dropped 1 basis point to 721 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 percent down from 8lsqb 
percent late thursday

subsidies by european governments to airbus 
industrie maker of the airbus models of large commercial jet 
aircraft threaten the competitiveness of the us aircraft 
industry according to a study prepared for the commerce department 
released friday 
on the average 74 percent of the cost of developing airbus 
models has been provided by the governments of france britain 
west germany and spain commerce said 
member companies in the airbus consortium have received or have 
been pledged more than 13 billion in direct government suppport 
and if they had been required to pay interest at commercial rates 
the value of that support would be 25 billion today the 
department said 
by the year 2008 airbus will have paid out 30 billion more 
than it will have received the departments summary concluded 
if the subsidies continue competing us manufacturers will 
suffer reduced profits either through lost sales or lower prices 
commerce said 
the study was prepared by the consulting firm of gellman 
research associates 
the us office of the european common market said in a 
statement it had not had time to study the report but it was 
released in the middle of negotiations on the subject between the 
united states and the common market and was therefore untimely 
and unhelpful 
commerce says the us aircraft industry earned 12 billion last 
year in overseas sales after deducting the value of imports 
airbus principal competitors are boeing corp of seattle and 
mcdonnelldouglas corp of st louis which makes planes at long

two top british mineworkers leaders will be 
charged with improper accounting following an inquiry into union 
finances during the 198485 miners strike a court official said 
friday 
john richman a sheffield magistrates court clerk said he had 
issued nine summonses against arthur scargill president of the 
national union of mineworkers and union general secretary peter 
heathfield as well as against the union itself 
the charges were brought by trade union certification officer 
matthew wake a union watchdog responsible to the department of 
employment following the inquiry 
the charges are failure to keep proper accounting records 
failure to maintain a satisfactory system of accounting control 
and failure to submit true and fair accounts in the return for 
1989 the two men face fines if convicted 
we have done nothing wrong and we shall contest the action all 
the way scargill said in response 
this is the latest in a long line of attacks on the national 
leadership of the miners union from the establishment who have 
never forgiven us for what we did in the 198485 miners strike 
he said 
scargill led the bitter and futile showdown with the government 
over the closure of unproductive mines the union which had 
235000 members at the time now has 50000 and 98 mines have been 
closed 
in july the union sued scargill to recover 14 million pounds 
or about 26 million that had been donated by soviet and other 
east bloc miners to help the british miners during the strike 
the court granted the union a delay while it sought to settle 
the issue by negotiation and on monday a union delegation heads 
to the paris headquarters of the international miners organization 
to determine control of the funds
