there were at least six rapes of female 
students or recruits at the orlando naval training center during 
the 18 months ending june 30 but the navy has not prosecuted 
anyone for them according to a published report 
citing a navy inspector generals report it obtained friday by 
request the washington post said 24 rapes or sexual assaults were 
reported during the 18month period and that navy law enforcement 
officials substantiated or resolved eight of the rape cases and 
five instances of sexual assault including indecent exposure and 
attempted rape 
the report in mondays editions of the paper said only one of 
the 13 cases an assault case resulted in courtmartial 
proceedings 
the post said the investigation found that some alleged 
offenders often instructors of supervisors of the women involved 
were returned to their jobs and continued working near the victims 
it said others were transferred from orlando or released from the 
navy avoiding prosecution an that some victims may have been 
so intimidated by investigators that they did not press charges 
the ig report was quoted as saying that the navys failure to 
move against offenders in numerous sexrelated cases has 
contributed to an atmosphere at the florida facility that makes 
women feel like they are secondclass members of the navy 
the post quoted vice adm john s disher the navys chief of 
education and training as characterizing the problems cited at 
orlando as occurring throughout the entire navy and saying 
much more must be done to solve the problem 
rep beverley b byron dmd chairman of the house armed 
services military personnel and compensation subcommittee was 
quoted as blaming the problems at the training center on a 
breakdown in leadership and oversight of the leadership 
the post said she received a copy of the report under a navy 
policy that requires such reviews to be provided to congress 24 
hours before they ar released to journalists 
the paper quoted vice adm michael boorda the navys personnel 
chief as saying ive looked at the numbers they certainly are 
not pleasing but the problem is not being ignored the training is 
being done and the people are aware of the problem people are 
being found guilty and punished is the punishment fair or not 
fair that is a personal judgment

libyan leader moammar gadhafi on sunday 
threatened to throw his forces into the battle against 
antigovernment rebels in sudan unless the rebels end their revolt 
within a year 
gadhafi said he would attempt to persuade rebel leader john 
garang whose rebellion gadhafi supported in the past to suspend 
his sevenyear fight now that sudan has proposed adopting a 
libyanstyle government 
but gadhafi said libya will have no option but to stand by the 
sudanese people and government against garang if a ceasefire is 
not reached by oct 21 1991 
the rebels operating in southern sudan mostly christians and 
members of traditional african religions are seeking economic and 
political reforms from the moslemdominated government and greater 
autonomy for three southern sudanese provinces 
gadhafis comments were made during the closing session of a 
sixweek conference that recommended sudan copy libyas 
jamaheriya or republic of the masses system of local 
and provincial councils instead of elected officials 
military ruler lt gen omar hassan elbashir who led a coup 
last year to oust a civilian government is expected to ratify the 
recommendations by the 1000member conference 
gadhafi a principal advocate of a panarab state said libya 
sudan and egypt should forge a political and social union 
sudan egypt and libya constitute the heart the main body of 
the arab nation the movement of which control the movement of the 
other arab states said gadhafi whose speech was televised 
throughout sudan 
egypt which follows a parliamentary system has rebuffed 
gadhafis earlier calls for unity 
gadhafi has unsuccessfully attempted to unify libya with most 
arab nations since taking power in 1969 he said peaceful rallies 
would be staged in all arab countries beginning jan 1 to support 
panarab unity 
libya has had close relations with sudan since a 1985 uprising 
that overthrew the prous president gaafar nimeiri elbashir 
banned political parties and dismissed the elected parliament 
gadhafi admitted libya trained and armed the rebel peoples 
liberation army but said he stopped assistance after nimeiris 
ouster

democrats and republicans narrowed differences 
sunday over new taxes on the rich gasoline levies and medicare 
cuts even as bush administration officials angrily stalked out of 
deficitreduction talks 
congressional leaders of both parties negotiated until about 
1130 pm sunday over a 250 billion package of tax increases and 
spending cuts in agriculture student loans and dozens of other 
programs they said they would resume talking monday 
weve made good progress in many areas said senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine but he conceded the remaining 
areas of disagreement are important ones 
weekend bargaining saw the two sides move toward each other in 
several areas including the question of how and how high to 
raise taxes on the rich 
the talks proceeded on the eve of what lawmakers hoped would be 
congress last week before adjournment for the year in the scant 
time left house and senate leaders say they would still like to 
tackle bills dealing with civil rights air pollution and child 
care 
budget negotiators seemed willing to raise the incometax rate 
on the wealthy to 31 percent up from its current 28 percent they 
were also close on proposals to limit the deductions the wealthiest 
taxpayers could claim 
but democrats were insisting on a 75 percent surtax on incomes 
exceeding 1 million annually the proposal if adopted would 
allow democrats to claim that rates on millionaires were raised 
substantially 
we think its good public policy and fair said mitchell 
republicans were adamantly against that idea and instead wanted 
higher limitations on millionaires deductions 
white house chief of staff john sununu accused democrats of 
being too divided to respond to the latest gop offer 
were not going to negotiate with democrats who cant come to 
an agreement among themselves he said as he left the capitol 
with white house budget chief richard darman and treasury secretary 
nicholas brady this was a great offer 
but mitchell denied that saying i can say to you democrats 
are unified 
despite the standoff over taxes the two sides moved closer in 
other areas said a democratic congressional official who asked to 
not be identified 
democrats offered to raise the gasoline tax 5 cents above its 
current 9centagallon level republicans were seeking a 7cent 
increase 
democrats were offering to reduce medicare by as much as 44 
billion 3 billion less than republicans were demanding 
in addition democrats were seeking to boost the 51300 wage 
cap from which medicare taxes are deducted to 125000 republicans 
want to increase the cap to 98000 the 145 percent medicare tax 
is part of the social security deduction 
republicans have been fearful of late that democrats have made 
the taxtherich battle cry their own barely two weeks from 
election day earlier in the day white house aides said higher 
levies on the rich were on the way 
this is one of the alltime false issues the richpoor 
thing said administration budget director richard darman this 
compromise in the end will tax the rich 
working against a wednesday deadline when stopgap spending 
authority expires bargainers were trying to find middle ground 
between separate deficitreduction plans approved by the house and 
senate last week the senate bill preferred by bush had more 
moderate tax increases on the wealthy took a bigger bite out of 
medicare spending and doubled the gasoline tax 
we feel very strongly there should be a surcharge and a rate 
increase on higherincome levels house speaker thomas foley 
dwash told reporters 
its got to move in the direction of being fairer in terms of 
taxes in other words asking the wealthiest americans to pay their 
fair share said house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
who like darman appeared on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley program 
darman said bush would accept a 31 percent rate on the rich up 
from 28 percent if the rate on those slightly less welloff was 
reduced from 33 percent to 31 percent that tradeoff eliminating 
the socalled bubble would increase taxes for 700000 people and 
reduce them for 5 million others while raising an estimated 7 
billion in additional revenue 
but mitchell said democrats would not accept that offer alone 
it obviously would have to be accompanied by other measures 
so people whose taxes were cut would be required to pay something 
to offset that reduction mitchell said on nbctvs meet the 
press program 
were not hung up on any one formula but rather the principle 
of fairness mitchell added 
the senate approved a bipartisan budget friday shrinking the 
growth of medicare by 49 billion over the next five years 
including 17 billion to be directed at the elderly and handicapped 
served by the program 
the house plan which attracted only 10 gop votes limited those 
cuts to 43 billion of which participants would bear 10 billion 
in reduced benefits and higher costs 
the house would leave the 9centagallon gasoline tax alone 
while the senate would raise it gradually to 185 cents 
democrats have conceded that the final compromise is likely to 
include some increase in the gasoline levy they also have said 
another feature of the house bill likely will be dropped a 
oneyear delay in inflation adjustments on incometax brackets and 
the personal exemption which would have caused slight increases in 
the tax bills of everyone who pays income tax 
virtually certain to emerge in the final product are several 
other features the two bills had in common including higher taxes 
on alcohol tobacco airline tickets and luxury items such as 
yachts and jewelry 
spending cuts would be administered to agriculture student loan 
and veterans programs 
the deficitreduction bill combined with other savings mainly 
defense cuts and reduced interest payments on the debt would 
lower the deficit by 40 billion for the fiscal year that began 
oct 1 and 460 billion more over the next five years 
the budget stalemate cost the government 16 million when 
agencies shut down over the columbus day weekend earlier in 
october the general accounting office said in a report 
the government had closed because in an effort to keep pressure 
on budget writers bush vetoed emergency spending legislation after 
federal authority to spend money had elapsed

after taking a back seat to worries about 
taxes the economy and the middle east abortion is reemerging as 
a potentially decisive issue in the final days of the 1990 election 
season 
its one of the few issues thats still out there that 
distinguishes people said harrison hickman a pollster for 
abortionrights causes i would predict youll see a lot of 
people using it at the last minute to try to push undecided 
voters 
conventional political wisdom has held that abortionrights 
candidates had the upper hand this year and that opponents of 
abortion were on the defensive after a 1989 supreme court ruling 
revived the issue electoral losses for abortion foes in 1989 
contributed to that view 
yet abortion hasnt proven to be the silver bullet for 
abortionrights candidates in the words of democrat donald 
avenson a prochoice candidate for iowa governor and abortion 
opponents point to races where their candidates have stood firm and 
are leading including governors races in ohio pennsylvania 
texas and iowa 
its not the issue some thought a year ago on the other hand 
its more salient this year than it has been in the past in a lot 
of states said doug johnson legislative director for the 
national right to life committee 
as a result some thought abortion was fizzling this year as an 
issue 
but strategists for abortionrights campaigns say there will be 
a flurry of lastminute advertising pushing the abortion issue in 
some races its already begun 
sometimes the push will be on television but in other cases it 
will be more selectively targeted toward young women voters through 
directmail or telephone 
people are thinking this is a dead issue i think thats just 
a fundamental misunderstanding of this issue said celinda lake 
who has conducted polling for abortionrights candidates around the 
country 
its a lastminute issue she said its something you lay 
out in the last weeks of a campaign 
abortionrights strategists say their target audience younger 
voters typically does not pay attention to campaigns until the 
final stages 
lake says polling shows that increasing economic worries and 
lack of trust of democrats on the economy has caused a dropoff in 
support for democrats among younger women she said abortion may 
lure them back 
its a big drop off 10 points she said because of that 
youll see more prochoice directmail geared toward that audience 
at the end 
in north carolinas senate race both antiabortion sen jesse 
helms and his democratic challenger harvey gantt have been airing 
ads on the issue 
but in most states its the abortionrights candidates who have 
been using the issue in television ads 
in oregon democrat harry lonsdale has drawn even in his 
challenge to gop sen mark hatfield according to recent polls 
after airing ads that attack hatfields opposition to abortion 
among other issues 
one race where abortion hasnt been the factor that was expected 
is in florida where former sen lawton chiles is challenging gop 
gov robert martinez who opposes abortion chiles who supports 
abortion rights has found the issue uncomfortable for him and 
isnt airing ads despite martinez seeming vulnerability on the 
issue 
the issue is important in iowas senate race where democratic 
incumbent tom harkin has a doubledigit lead over antiabortion 
challenger rep tom tauke according to recent polls 
harkin has been the abortionrights pointman in the senate and 
he led the fight last week to oppose an amendment requiring 
teenage girls to notify their parents before getting an abortion 
parental consent on abortion tends to gain strong support in most 
polls but harkin said the overall abortion issue helps him 
the last thing my opponent wants to talk about is the choice 
issue harkin said im watching my tracking polls and the 
number of people viewing his position as extreme is going like 
this he added pointing upward 
the senate adopted the parental consent provision on a 4848 
vote but the amendment was expected to be deleted in later 
congressional action harkins side was surprised it drew 48 votes 
that vote has become an issue in california where both 
candidates for governor are trying to appeal to abortionrights 
supporters democratic candidate dianne feinstein blasted her gop 
rival sen pete wilson for missing the vote while campaigning 
abortion opponents have the upper hand in several races 
in kansas democratic gubernatorial candidate joan finney has 
had difficulty explaining her antiabortion position recently but 
she still leads gop gov mike hayden an abortionrights supporter 
in the polls 
antiabortion republican george voinovich has the lead in ohios 
governor race where democrat anthony celebrezze has been 
criticized for a startling flipflop in which he dropped his 
longstanding opposition to abortion 
a september poll by the university of cincinnati found that the 
issue was helping voinovich more than celebrezze voinovich led 
among the 13 percent of respondents who said abortion was the 
single most important issue 
in iowas governors race democrat avenson is running 
abortionrights ads but has yet to catch up with antiabortion gop 
incumbent terry branstad 
abortion opponents in idaho were angered by gov cecil andrus 
veto of a restrictive abortion bill this year but he is in strong 
shape in his reelection bid 
its become more of an issue in idahos senate and house races 
however 
idaho republican senate candidate larry craig surprised his 
antiabortion supporters when he was asked in a debate what he 
would do if his wife became pregnant as a result of rape 
he responded that it was her decision which seemed at odds with 
his opposition to legal abortions democrat ron twilegar jumped on 
the response saying he wanted all women to have that choice but 
craig seemed to want it only for his wife craig says he was 
misinterpreted and hasnt strayed from his opposition to abortion 
abortion also is an issue in about a dozen congressional races 
in northern virginia for example democrat james moran is 
airing abortionrights ads against gop rep stan parris 
democrats see the issue helping moran the alexandria mayor 
since the district was won by gov doug wilder in an important 
abortion test last year

sen warren rudman was wearing a big smile and 
he didnt mind showing a guest the reason why 
walking to a tall window in his senate office the new hampshire 
republican pointed to the unremarkable looking uhaul parked on the 
street below 
see that truck he said thats davids belongings his 
buddies in new hampshire said well load it up for you and send 
it down and there it is 
david of course is david souter the newest supreme court 
justice as souters longtime friend and mentor rudman suggested 
that president bush nominate him then guided the protege through 
his senate confirmation 
but more than pride was behind that smile there was relief the 
truck was evidence rudman was at last losing the houseguest hed 
put up since the nation was introduced to david souter on july 23 
and he could use the break rudman 60 a likeable secondterm 
senator has found himself caught in a swirl of major battles 
besides shepherding souter through the senate hes been near 
the center of budget debates that bear his name and hes the top 
republican on the senate ethics committee that is weighing the fate 
of five senators involvement in the savingsandloan scandals a 
decision with enormous political potential 
im just on the thin edge rudman said its been an 
unbelievable time im ready to just go on top of a mountain in a 
log cabin thats what im ready for 
its been a very intensive satisfying in many ways three 
months he added in some ways its been very unsatisfying 
rudman a moderate republican was swept into office with ronald 
reagan in 1980 
he unseated democratic sen john durkin who four years earlier 
had blocked president fords appointment of rudman to a top agency 
post rudman won the gop nomination over a wide field that included 
john sununu who later became governor and now is bushs chief of 
staff 
rudman is far more affable and far less ideological than sununu 
that souter was rudmans protege and not sununus was of intense 
comfort to many democrats and in no small way eased his 
confirmation 
rudman is jewish and during the confirmation hearings souter 
sought to display his sensitivity on civil rights by mentioning 
their private discussions of the discrimination rudman has felt as 
a result of his religion 
souter and rudman go back more than 20 years when rudman was 
attorney general of new hampshire and souter worked for him few 
brothers are closer rudman says on his office wall are pictures 
chronicling the intertwined careers of rudman and souter and the 
other member of their trio tom rath a new hampshire lawyer and 
republican activist 
it was incredible very satisfying to me rudman said 
after all hes one of my closest friends very very close hes 
someone who i set on his path 20someodd years ago i told him he 
ought to be a judge to watch him being sworn in was just 
enormously satisfying to me 
less satisfying he says is the crisis over the budget 
he is the rudman of grammrudman a law written with sens phil 
gramm of texas and ernest hollings of south carolina that is the 
nations shorthand for budget crisis 
the law imposed the deadline for deficitcutting that has 
triggered political brinkmanship and brought the government to 
potential shutdown 
rudman is blunt without being a bully as sununu is often 
called he points to blame within his own party for the deficit 
mess and particularly faults house republicans for refusing to go 
along with new taxes 
i dont meant this to be funny i truly understand the new 
politburo in the soviet union better than i understand the 
republicans in the house of representatives he said i dont 
understand what theyre doing i truly dont understand it 
divided government is bad enough he said when you have a 
divided party within a divided government it is even more 
frustrating 
rudmans background as an attorney general helped earn him the 
unenvied seat on the ethics committee which investigates and 
prosecutes senators caught in scandal or misdeeds 
the panel is now deciding what to do about five senators the 
socalled keating five accused of improperly intervening with 
federal regulators on behalf of charles h keating jr whose sampl 
was near insolvency keating contributed 13 million to the 
senators campaigns or groups affiliated with them 
rudman says he doesnt know when the panel will decide but 
acknowledges the job draws political heat 
oh sure this is still a political institution everything we 
do has some political aspects that relate to it he said up to 
now i cannot say ive seen politics enter into the ethics 
committee well see how this plays out

japanese coast guard boats have turned back two 
taiwanese vessels carrying politicians and athletes toward a group 
of tiny uninhabited islands claimed by both nations officials 
said 
the taiwanese had sought to land the delegation on the islands 
called the senkakus in japan and diaoyutai in taiwan on sunday to 
reinforce their claim to the territory and promote a sports event 
taiwans premier hau peitsun said he was displeased by the 
japanese intervention and stressed that his nation will stand by 
the claim to the islands about 120 miles northeast of taiwans 
capital of taipei 
athletes had planned to plant flags of taiwans nationalist 
chinese government and run a torch relay on the main island before 
returning sunday night they also intended to publicize the annual 
taiwan athletic championships that are scheduled to begin on friday 
in their country 
the premier said the nationalist government would seek 
diplomatic means to solve the 45yearold territorial dispute 
kiyoshi harada of the maritime safety agency japans coast 
guard said the taiwanese vessels entered 12mile territorial 
waters claimed by japan despite warnings from patrol boats and 
helicopters 
he said the two boats turned back about two hours after entering 
the waters harada declined to say how many patrol boats and 
helicopters were involved or give other details of the incident 
in taiwan the fishermens association in suao about 35 miles 
southeast of taipei said a radio message indicated about 12 
japanese vessels and two helicopters interdicted the taiwanese 
boats about seven miles from the islands 
the two boats had set out earlier sunday with a flotilla of 30 
fishing boats 
the islands were claimed by japan in 1895 but the nationalists 
who claim to be chinas legitimate government say the islands came 
under chinese sovereignty in 1945 when japan was defeated in world 
war ii 
the united states took over administration of the islands after 
the war and returned them along with okinawa to japan in 1972 a 
year earlier the communist government in china laid claim to the 
islands 
japans kyodo news service said japan tightened patrols after 
about 300 chinese fishing boats approached the islands in 1978 and 
claimed territorial rights 
the latest dispute followed reports that a japanese rightwing 
political group received government permission to renovate a 
lighthouse on one of the islands hau said last week that the 
nationalists would not tolerate japans occupation of the 
territory

on the face of it the united states government 
and environmentalists may seem an unlikely alliance but allied 
they are in their opposition to the resumption of commercial 
whaling in iceland in the second of two stories ap science editor 
paul raeburn examines the efforts to blunt icelands contentions 
that its whales are not endangered 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a whale is the most beautiful animal 
i have ever seen the poet wh auden wrote during a visit to 
iceland in 1936 to see it torn to pieces with steam winches and 
cranes is enough to make one a vegetarian for life 
that kind of revulsion has helped make the global 
savethewhales campaign one of the most dramatic successes of the 
environmental movement an international moratorium on commercial 
whaling was instituted in 1986 and environmentalists now are 
pushing for a permanent ban on all whaling 
we would certainly be against whaling until we could 
definitely show it would not affect the whale stocks says 
kevin chu if there is any doubt we want to err on the side of 
conservation 
thats tough talk and it doesnt come from an 
environmentalist chu is a foreign affairs officer in the us 
state departments bureau of oceans and international environmental 
and scientific affairs 
asked to describe the us position on whaling chu says the 
united states is against it 
the perhaps unusual consensus among the government and 
environmental groups is fueled by two things concern that whales 
are in danger of extinction and the kind of sentiments evoked by 
auden 
the government takes a strong antiwhaling stance because the 
only voices we hear are the voices of the environmentalists chu 
said 
iceland one of the three major whaling nations along with 
norway and japan argues strenuously that the whales it wants to 
hunt are not endangered and that it should be allowed to resume 
commercial whaling 
but even if scientists eventually agree the populations are 
indeed not endangered the campaign to save the whales is unlikely 
to die 
politically it comes down to a relatively simple thing 
said william evans the us representative to the international 
whaling commission there are a number of countries and 
scientists that believe there is not a justification or 
need for any country to continue to harvest these animals 
im completely of the mindset that we have to protect oceans 
for our own survival and the whales are a component of this 
ecosystem said sally shoup of greenpeace we have to stop this 
devastation of the other creatures on the planet if we want to 
protect ourselves 
i think whales are special she said i think they are 
intelligent creatures i think icelanders can understand that as 
well 
the savethewhales campaign began in 1972 when the landmark 
un conference on the environment in a 530 vote passed a 
resolution calling for a 10year moratorium on whaling whalers 
killed 46000 whales that year 
the united states immediately proposed the moratorium to the 
whaling commission which rejected it but the us continued to 
push in 1982 the commission finally approved a moratorium 
beginning in 1986 
what we were going to do was take five years of no whaling 
said evans the us representative to the commission well we 
havent had five years of no whaling because iceland invented 
scientific whaling 
a clause in the international whaling convention allows the 
killing of whales for scientific purposes iceland exploited it 
you have the same boats and the same people and you take the 
same whales and you sell it to the same people and you call it 
scientific whaling said roger payne a noted whale expert and 
president of the long term research institute in lincoln mass 
its a joke 
johann sigurjonsson senior whale specialist at icelands marine 
research institute vigorously disagreed those who have been 
following what were doing understand the seriousness of what were 
doing he said 
in 1985 the last year of its commercial whaling operation 
iceland killed 344 whales it caught 116 in 1986 and the number 
declined to 68 in 1989 this year iceland shut down its whaling 
operation entirely but it continues to press vigorously for a 
resumption of commercial killing of fin sei and minke whales 
congress has passed several laws that allow the united states to 
impose economic sanctions against countries that violate whaling 
commission regulations 
icelands critics have argued that the scientific whaling is 
merely commercial whaling under another name and have pressed the 
united states to impose sanctions the united states might be 
reluctant to do so however because iceland is the site of a 
strategic nato base 
payne said the methods used to estimate whale populations are 
highly imprecise and that the icelandic scientific research has 
shown us nothing we didnt know before 
it could take as long as 100 years to know how many whales can 
be captured without reducing the size of a given whale population 
he said 
the international whaling commission has stopped releasing 
estimates of whale populations as it undertakes new assessments 
because it fears its previous estimates could be wildly inaccurate 
said martin harvey the commissions executive officer 
the old estimates suggest that since the advent of whaling the 
population of fin whales has been reduced from 548000 to 120000 
while sei whales declined from 256000 to 54000 
the commission completed its assessment of minke whales this 
year and concluded that about 28000 are in icelandic waters 
which we think is not too far from the number there ever was 
said ray gambell a whale biologist and the commissions secretary 
some 600000 minke whales live in antarctic waters 
sigurjonsson calls the debate over population numbers a stalling 
tactic 
you can set catch limits very cautiously he said but to 
reject any catch because you dont know the exact figure thats a 
difficult question and it may take you years to find out the exact 
number 
part of the problem were having with iceland is what is a 
reasonable doubt said chu of the state department 
the scientific committee of the whaling commission did say a 
take of 200 minkes would probably not harm the stock chu said 
it was the probably that first catches ones attention were 
simply not prepared to let the moratorium lapse at this point 
even if the moratorium was lifted or modified iceland couldnt 
resume commercial whaling until at least 1992 gambell said the 
commission cant decide until may at the earliest to allow 
iceland to proceed and any such decision would not take effect 
until 90 days later too late for the 1991 season 
chu said one alternative might be for the whaling commission to 
allow iceland to resume hunting whales up to a quota rather than 
have iceland withdraw from the commission as it has threatened to 
do if iceland withdrew it no longer would be bound by the 
moratorium 
im afraid the conservation of whales will suffer if we take 
too strong a stand said chu who said he was expressing his 
personal views not those of the state department on the other 
hand i think the united states is not in a position to allow them 
some sort of a quota it would be extremely difficult to bend the 
moratorium 
icelands whalers also may be facing problems on a new front 
at home 
the opinion of the icelandic public is changing said 
gudmundur hermansson who covers whaling for morgunbladid 
icelands largest daily newspaper 
in 1986 probably 80 percent to 90 percent of the public 
supported the government hermansson said but that figure is 
dropping he said 
opinion polls show clearly this support was getting less and 
less every year hermansson said i dont think whaling will be 
taken up again

rescue workers have found only one fatality from 
a powerful earthquake that hit northwest china but heavy snowfall 
hampered their search for casualties the central seismology bureau 
said sunday 
at the moment we have one dead and two injured but i believe 
there will be more said li qianghua of the bureau 
the temblor measuring 62 on the richter scale hit central 
gansu province saturday afternoon another quake measuring 51 
struck 32 minutes later 
thirty percent of the buildings in the area collapsed and nearly 
all the others sustained damage making them too dangerous to live 
in li said 
provincial rescue workers arrived in the area during the night 
but were confronted by a heavy snowfall the area is between 6600 
and 9900 feet above sea level li said 
the quakes epicenter was near the tianzhu tibetan autonomous 
county 124 miles northwest of the provincial capital of lanzhou 
and 750 miles west of beijing aftershocks were felt as far away as 
lanzhou 
li said the area was not heavily populated 
a severe earthquake last april hit an area less than 124 miles 
away in neighboring qinghai province killing 126 people 
aftershocks from that quake also were felt in lanzhou 
the richter scale is an openended gauge of the energy released 
by a quake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
an earthquake measuring 6 can cause extensive damage in a populated 
area

burmas rebellious buddhist monks their 
monasteries ringed by troops appeared sunday to have given in to 
an ultimatum by the countrys authoritarian rulers to end their 
boycott of the military 
reports reaching the burmese capital from mandalay the center 
of the defiance campaign said the monks would end their refusal to 
minister to soldiers in a formal announcement later sunday 
armed troops cordoned off buddhist monasteries in the central 
burma city saturday after the military government said it would 
dissolve monks groups involved in the boycott 
a state radio announcement repeated throughout the day saturday 
interspersed with martial music said illegal monks 
organizations had been participating in politics against the rules 
of buddhism 
such illegal organizations will be dissolved from 
midnight tonight and members of such illegal organizations are 
not eligible to be members of the sangha rangoon radio said the 
sangha is the main religious governing body in predominately 
buddhist burma 
at least six major mandalay monasteries were surrounded by 
troops and police and closed their gates 
but witnesses contacted by telephone said the gates were opened 
and monks came out on their morning alms rounds sunday without 
interference from the troops monks traditionally receive offerings 
of food from the faithful in the early morning 
it was not clear whether action would be taken against the 
monks who began their boycott after troops put down an 
antigovernment demonstration in mandalay last august the boycott 
spread to other areas including rangoon located 350 miles south 
of mandalay 
western observers in rangoon said the monks refusal to minister 
to the soldiers was the equivalent of excommunication 
the government said such organizations have jeopardized the 
peace and stability of the country and threatened the breakup of 
the central sangha organization by various means including 
threats blackmail and boycott 
a western observer in rangoon said any move against members of 
the sangha is bound to cause some kind of popular reaction he 
spoke by telephone and on condition of anonymity like other 
observers who commented on the situation 
about 85 percent of burmas 40 million people are buddhist and 
some 300000 monks live in monasteries around the country in 
buddhist societies monks are regarded as spiritual leaders of the 
community and also play a key role in popular celebrations and 
various rites 
another burma expert said the government is challenging burmas 
religious soul and going against traditions that revere the monks 
its going to be very difficult for the soldiers to fire on 
the monks if ordered to shoot it will really bring into question 
how reliant the soldiers are said josef silverstein a us 
political scientist in new jersey 
if they shoot defenseless monks who are only withholding 
religious services as a moral weapon there could be enormous 
street protests this is morality vs weapons whats left for 
people whose vote has been rejected by the military 
the groups singled out by the government included the young 
monks organization in mandalay on sept 6 the organization 
announced a boycott of religious ceremonies for soldiers and their 
families after troops broke up an antigovernment protest in the 
city a month earlier 
during the aug 8 demonstration troops killed four people 
including two monks according to western diplomats in rangoon 
from mandalay in central burma the monks boycott spread west 
to the district of monya and to some monasteries in the capital 
rangoon 350 miles south of mandalay 
monks emerged at the head of antigovernment protests during the 
1988 prodemocracy uprising in which the army killed thousands of 
people 
a western source said about 160 monasteries in the capital have 
taken up the protest involving about 15000 monks a quarter of 
those in the city however it appeared the boycott was most 
widespread in mandalay where there are about 20000 monks he 
said 
mandalay was a major center of unrest during the 1988 uprising 
and monks took over the city administration for several weeks 
the military government held a national election may 27 that was 
easily won by the national league for democracy the main 
opposition group but the government has refused to hand over power 
and has arrested the main opposition leaders

a retired palestinian high school principal was 
found gagged bound and stabbed to death saturday in the occupied 
west bank and arab villagers said he was suspected of 
collaborating with israel 
three israeli jews including a police officer died in a 
stabbing attack sunday in a jerusalem neighborhood army radio 
reported 
the radio said police apprehended one suspect but it was not 
clear if he was an arab or jew according to the radio the 
attacker first stabbed to death a woman in her 20s then ran down a 
major street and stabbed two other people including the policeman 
in the west bank stabbing death villagers said musleh halaf 
50 was kidnapped five days ago by four masked men in the main 
street of jenin halaf had been appointed a councilman by the 
israeli authorities but had resigned the post villagers said 
assuming halaf was slain as a collaborator his death raised to 
282 the number of palestinians killed by fellow arabs since 
december 1987 when the uprising against israeli rule began most 
were killed on suspicion of working with israeli authorities 
since the uprising began 761 palestinians have been killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians and 48 israelis have died in the 
violence 
in jerusalem meanwhile about 100 israeli women urged 
international intervention to protect palestinians in the occupied 
territories 
the protest followed a decision by un chief javier perez de 
cuellar not to send envoys to investigate the killings of at least 
19 palestinians in jerusalem unless israel changes its mind and 
cooperates with the panel 
more than 140 palestinians were also wounded on oct 8 when 
israeli security forces fired on protesters on the temple mount 
the protesters had thrown rocks at jews praying at the nearby 
western wall about 30 israeli police and civilians were injured 
the killings on the mount known to moslems as haram essharif 
were condemned in a resolution passed unanimously by the un 
security council despite israels attempts to persuade its chief 
ally the united states to veto it 
the women dressed in black and holding placards with slogans 
opposing the israeli occupation held a silent vigil across from a 
police prison in the center of town 
police had earlier barred the women from holding their vigil in 
arab east jerusalem saying it could incite violence one woman was 
arrested when she and others began shouting slogans 
we have to demand pressure from outside because weve seen a 
drastic swing to the right inside israel and our effect is becoming 
less and less said judy green who moved to israel 10 years ago 
from little rock ark 
most of us here believe that this occupation is destroying 
israel and is destroying the morality of israelis she added 
israel captured the west bank and gaza strip from jordan and 
egypt during the 1967 middle east war 
what we are asking for is some kind of odsend from outside to 
shake this country back into its senses said ruth cohen as she 
held a poster reading down with the occupation

death a staunch supporter of ousted gen michel aoun and his wife 
and two small sons at their home east of beirut police said

son of the late president camille chamoun 
the slayings came a week after syrian and government troops of 
president elias hrawis army crushed aouns mutiny in lebanons

that election on grounds it was held in syriancontrolled

government troops captured a strategic 
coastal village in northern sri lanka killing 20 tamil rebels in 
an air naval and ground operation officials said sunday 
the reported capture of mawaddipuram village on saturday opened 
a passage to kankesanthurai a vital rebelcontrolled port one 
mile away 
there was no immediate response to the government claim from the 
rebel militia the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
military officials who cannot be identified under briefing 
rules said three soldiers were killed and many more were injured 
in the taking of mawaddipuram 195 miles north of colombo 
they said 20 rebels were killed but did not give further details 
of the fighting 
with mawaddipurams capture the military now claims to control 
a wide swath of the western coast in the jaffna peninsula a mainly 
tamil area and a rebel stronghold 
the military launched the offensive in the peninsula the 
northernmost part of the island on wednesday by saturday it 
claimed to control at least eight rebel camps 
officials said more than 100 militants and 14 soldiers had been 
killed in fighting until saturday the militia disputed the claim 
rebel leader lawrence thilaker said on friday that 50 soldiers 
and 15 militants were killed 
both sides are known to have made exaggerated claims of the toll 
in the past the latest report could not be independently confirmed 
because communication with the north is cut off 
fighting is also going on in the east where troops killed six 
rebels after ferreting them out of a hideout in kirankulam village 
saturday military officials said 
the latest round of civil war started in august ending a 
13month ceasefire in the sevenyearold insurrection for a 
separate tamil homeland in the north and the east more than 14000 
people have been killed 
the separatist demand stems from the militants complaint that 
the islands sinhalese majority discriminates against the tamils in 
jobs and education 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
and control the government and the army tamils account for 18 
percent

benazir bhuttos opponents might bar 
her from office even if she gets the most votes in next weeks 
election or she could let them take over and risk political 
disaster in the economic crunch ahead 
its not everything that i be prime minister ms bhutto 
told a reporter during a break in the campaign 
why should i raise prices by 40 percent which is what they 
said theyll have to do after the elections theyll have egg on 
their faces and well come back smiling next march they wont last 
six months 
economists say pakistan is in for hard times because of a large 
debt dwindling reserves higher oil prices and a sharp decline in 
exports 
whether ms bhutto will be permitted to resume office has been a 
nagging question ever since she was ousted aug 6 
president ghulam ishaq khan used his constitutional power to 
dismiss her 20monthold government on charges of corruption and 
abuse of power he called elections three years ahead of schedule 
suspicion has grown that martial law will be declared to keep 
ms bhutto out of power although top generals deny it the army 
and the president wouldnt kick her out just to let her return 
three months later the argument goes 
after 11 weeks of namecalling and nearly a dozen unresolved 
court cases 50 million voters will be eligible to deliver their 
verdict wednesday 
despite increasing economic and social problems in this moslem 
nation of 110 million people ms bhutto has been the only campaign 
issue 
her pakistan peoples party and its smaller allies are pitted 
against the islamic democratic alliance a loose coalition spanning 
the ideological spectrum and united only by opposition to ms 
bhutto 
at stake are 217 seats in the national assembly the lawmaking 
lower house of parliament that elects the prime minister 
pakistani campaigns usually are noisy but this one has been 
relatively quiet reflecting the cycnicism of an electorate that 
has seen too many promises broken and democracy derailed too many 
times in the countrys 43year history 
few disagree that ms bhuttos administration was disappointing 
her inexperience and alleged widespread corruption in her 
administration drained the large reservoir of goodwill that made 
her the first woman to lead a modern moslem nation 
more than anything both critics and supporters say her 
downfall stemmed from growing reliance on middlemen and a policy of 
giving party supporters jobs contracts and other rewards 
we made mistakes no doubt about it ms bhutto said in the 
interview any government is going to have differences of 
perceptions but its in the national interest that they be 
resolved 
getting her out of office was easy enough but the president and 
caretaker government made serious miscalculations afterward 
ms bhutto 37 was dragged from court to court in an attempt to 
prove she was pakistans most corrupt and incompetent leader her 
husband and dozens of supporters were arrested on what they claimed 
were trumpedup charges 
her opponents portrayed her as a bad moslem a traitor who gave 
state secrets to india and sympathized with israel 
their main accomplishment was to deflect attention from ms 
bhuttos dismal record revive memories of the military overthrow 
in 1977 and subsequent execution of her father prime minister 
zulfikar ali bhutto and cast her as the martyr 
her opponents were plagued by internal rivalries and growing 
impatience in the military indicated things werent going as the 
generals had planned 
most analysts predict neither side will win a decisive majority 
giving the civilian and military establishment room to form a 
coalition government that will keep ms bhutto out of power 
still her political organization could emerge as the largest 
single party as in november 1988 
analysts predict the pakistan peoples party will sweep sindh 
the former prime ministers home province and possibly win punjab 
her opponents stronghold and the largest and most populous 
province 
the party has been perceived as the party of the poor and 
downtrodden since ms bhuttos father founded it nearly 30 years 
ago ms bhutto inherited his mass support 
she still faces the threat of disqualification because of the 
halfdozen court cases pending against her 
ms bhutto predicted the caretaker government would make a 
lastditch attempt to pressure the special tribunals to exclude her 
from politics 
even if they succeed she said there is still her mother to 
contend with 
these little guys think its that easy to get rid of the 
bhuttos she asked with a grin they shouldnt forget the name

war and rumors of war are bad for 
business at the suez canal 
when politics get sticky revenues go down in the waning weeks 
of 1990 politics are sticky indeed 
when the world is happy the suez canal is happy when things 
go wrong somewhere else they go bad here said capt adel abdel 
salam the canals chief pilot 
oil the black gold of the middle east has been the savior and 
bankroll of the suez canal since the late 1940s 
as the strategic connection between western oil consumers and 
middle eastern oil producers the canal felt an immediate impact 
when iraq seized kuwait on aug 2 
warships steaming to and from the persian gulf keep the waterway 
busy but they dont pay much money tankers ferrying oil to europe 
pay a lot but fewer are coming through 
egypt debtridden and deeply involved in the gulf crisis 
desperately needs the dollars the canal should be providing 
its most lucrative revenue source is the paychecks sent home by 
egyptians abroad that is dwindling with the return of about 
350000 workers from the gulf many of them penniless 
the assassination of a leading egyptian politician oct 12 in 
downtown cairo devastated an already reeling tourist industry 
until aug 2 tourism was egypts secondbest source of money 
for ordinary egyptians a problem at the suez canal is a 
personal misfortune they view it as a monument to national pride 
much as ancient egyptians viewed the pyramids and sphinx 
we dug the canal with our lives our skulls our bones our 
blood president gamal abdel nasser said in announcing on july 
26 1956 that egypt was taking the canal from a britishfrench 
concession 
the united states had little interest in the canal until its 
troops found themselves defending north africa in world war ii 
afterward a burgeoning consumer society demanded more oil ores 
and rubber from the east and they came cheaper via suez 
trouble never has been far from the 101milelong ditch linking 
the mediterranean and red seas via egypts bitter lakes and the 
gulf of suez 
as many as 20000 laborers are thought to have died digging the 
canal which was inaugurated in 1869 in an orgy of opulence that 
nearly bankrupted the country 
during the 20th century suez often has been at or near the 
center of conflict 
russian warships passed through it in 1905 en route to 
catastrophic defeat by the japanese off korea in world war i 
german uboats tried to sever england from its colonies east of 
suez by keeping cargo ships from using the canal 
in 1939 italian dictator benito mussolini used it as a pathway 
to conquer ethiopia 
field marshal erwin rommel germanys world war ii military 
genius was unable to capture the canal and the persian oil fields 
beyond germany bombed it 64 times stopping traffic for 76 days 
ships sunk during egypts 1967 war with israel blocked all 
traffic for eight years 
canal business soured during the 1980s because of the iraqiran 
wqar in which hundreds of oil tankers were attacked in the persian 
gulf 
for egypt which owns the canal iraqs invasion of kuwait was 
far more than a problem between arab brothers 
both countries were good customers of suez each year shipping 
seven million tons of oil westward the un embargo ended that 
oil that would have passed through the canal to europe is being 
consumed east of suez by forces sent to confront iraq 
through august the canals monthly tanker tonnage averaged more 
than 135 million tons in september the first full month under 
embargo the tonnage was 11 million 
war makes civilization go faster but on the suez canal 
things slow down said abdel salam the chief pilot its not 
devastating but yes were suffering 
how much became evident in september ezzat adel chairman of 
the suez canal authority said the gulf trouble ould cost 400 
million in the fiscal year that started a month before the 
invasion in 1989 canal revenues brought the government nearly 
14 billion 
the crisis brings into focus two persistent irritants for the 
canal authority neutrality and nuclear ships 
under the 1888 constantinople convention the suez canal must 
accept all ships but egypt interprets one clause as allowing it to 
deny access to those likely to endanger egypts security 
that was the basis of a ban on ships flying israels flag until 
1979 when egypt signed a peace treaty with the jewish state and 
on vessels either carrying nuclear weapons or powered by nuclear 
energy 
iraqi ships now use the canal despite egypts strong antiiraq 
position in the gulf crisis if war began egypt probably would ban 
them 
the nuclear ban is so politically sensitive that nobody will 
talk about it 
in august as the united states built up its forces to face 
iraq the nuclearpowered aircraft carrier dwight d eisenhower 
passed through the canal to the red sea then returned two weeks 
later 
egypt did not ask about the carriers propulsion system

the two greatest minds in chess sit on the stage 
in a newly refurbished theater near times square agonizing over 
each move in absolute silence 
but just a short walk uptown about 30 chess aficionados of all 
stripes are gathered in a cramped rundown lecture room 
secondguessing each move the masters make as the thumpthumpthump 
from a nearby exercise studio reverberates through the open 
windows 
is karpov really taking this long or is it the computer 
asks one woman as they wait for the next move to be relayed from 
the theater to their board at the manhattan chess club 
thats a very old opening someone else complains cant 
they come up with something original 
as world champion garry kasparov battles anatoly karpov in the 
world series of chess hardcore fans are getting nearly 
instantaneous playbyplay analysis at chess clubs across the 
country 
game 5 of the bestof24 world chess championship series will be 
held monday after kasparov took one of his three allowed timeouts 
friday karpov used one of his timeouts after losing game 2 the 
other three games ended in draws making the score kasparov 2 
karpov 1 
the two are playing for the crown and the winners share of a 3 
million purse the first 12 games will be in new york the rest in 
lyons france 
watching the match at a club with a direct link to the hudson 
theater where the series began oct 8 is the next best thing to 
being there maybe better fans say 
talking is encouraged at the clubs and most have arranged for 
grandmasters to explain the intricate strategies as each game 
unfolds 
here you can ask questions said ruth cardoso an 
international master from brazil sometimes its a stupid 
question but you get an answer 
its cheaper too tickets to the match run up to 100 a game 
while the show at the manhattan chess club is free for members 10 
to nonmembers 
the world championship is played every three years but this one 
is an especially intense grudge match 
karpov is trying to regain the title that kasparov the 
highestrated player in the history of chess won from him in 1985 
everybodys excited even though its only two russians 
playing each other said grand master pal benko who provided 
commentary for game 4 last week at the 113yearold chess club 
no american like bobby fischer a club member from the 1950s 
the game 4 crowd mostly men included players of all levels 
retired computer programmers sat next to longhaired students in 
jeans and carrying backpacks businessmen in welltailored suits 
outnumbered the stereotypical chess nerds in plaid polyester 
jackets 
almost everybody is holding his or her own minichessboard or 
writing down the moves as they are announced in chess notation 
entertainment is part of it but its a different kind of 
entertainment said russ garber the clubs director 
people like to be able to say i predicted that kasparov 
would play this move so they feel like i too can think like a 
world champion its an ego thing 
on the wall at the front of the room is a 6by6foot chessboard 
with magnetic pieces benko stands at the front and rearranges the 
markers sometimes even before the computer operator runs in with a 
new move 
i put already the bishop here he says i know the next 
move 
hes right 
whites pawn looks vulnerable 
can he take it or is it a trap someone asks 
benko explores several possibilities before deciding its not a 
trap 
for most nothing can match the excitement of watching the two 
best players in the world not computer glitches shabby 
surroundings or dance music pulsating loudly outside 
chess is a religion to some of us said bruce albertson a 
national master this is what we wait for

an increasing number of states now have laws 
that make it a crime to knowingly expose another person to the aids 
virus 
since 1986 22 states have passed laws making it illegal to 
engage in conduct that could transmit the human immunodeficiency 
virus or hiv believed to cause acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome according to the aids policy center at george washington 
university 
the idea of trying to prosecute somebody for attempted 
transmission of hiv is increasingly almost alarmingly common 
said lawrence o gostin director of the aids litigation project of 
the us public health service and a professor at the harvard 
university school of public health 
but he said when somebody is actually having sex with 
somebody i think the risk is significant enough that prosecutors 
are well within their rights to prosecute 
while the number of aidsrelated prosecutions nationwide is not 
known the military seems to be having the best success with such 
cases the experts say 
last week the supreme court rejected without comment an appeal 
by nathaniel johnson jr an air force sergeant who was convicted 
in a military court of aggravated assault because he had homosexual 
relations at mcchord air force base wash while knowingly 
infected with the virus 
the air force court of military review said at least six 
previous courtsmartial had been convened based upon aidsrelated 
assaults such conduct it said can be analogized to attempting 
to put poison in the drink of a victim 
the outcomes in civilian courts so far have tended to be 
different gostin said 
it is enormously problematical to try to reach into the 
bedroom and create a criminal prosecution around it and the only 
ones who have been successful in doing that are the military 
gostin said 
part of reason is because most civilian cases involve biting 
spitting or splashing blood rather than intercourse 
it is virtually impossible if not impossible to transmit 
the virus that way gostin said it appears to me to be much 
more punitive than effectuating any clear public policy 
most of the cases of infected men sleeping with people are 
military cases said gostin who is also executive director of 
the american society of law and medicine often the charge is 
willful disobedience of a military order sometimes it is assault 
or even attempted murder 
in civil court it is very difficult to get a conviction on 
those kinds of cases he said if your intention is to kill 
somebody else having sex with them is a highly indirect modus 
operandi 
gostin said most cases in the state courts are brought under 
general criminal laws rather than specific aidsrelated 
legislation he said he had not found one such case in which hiv 
was transmitted 
james r klimaski a washington lawyer who specializes in 
ilitary law said the military has an easier time with sexual 
cases because it is a much more controlled environment 
the defense department and each service have regulations 
governing sexual conduct by service people who know they are 
infected with the aids virus 
under navy policy a sailor found to have the virus is given 
counseling and ordered to avoid unsafe sexual practices said lt 
beci brenton a navy public affairs officer 
the sailor signs a statement saying he understands the order 
and any violation is prosecuted as disobeying a commanding officer 
in johnsons case he was dishonorably discharged and sentenced 
to six years in prison his lawyers contend he was never told about 
an air force policy that hivinfected military members could be 
subjected to disciplinary action for engaging in unsafe sex 
but klimaski said it had become pretty settled law that 
knowingly having unprotected sex while hivinfected can be 
prosecuted as assault under the uniform code of military justice 
according to the aids policy center intentionally exposing 
someone to the virus is a felony in arkansas california colorado 
delaware florida georgia idaho illinois indiana kentucky 
michigan missouri ohio oklahoma south carolina texas and 
virginia 
it is a misdemeanor in alabama and maryland the center said 
nevada mississippi and louisiana passed similar laws without 
specifying whether the offense was a felony or misdemeanor 
the laws vary as to the circumstances in which they apply 
aids attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers it is most 
often transmitted through sexual contact mostly between homosexual 
males

harvey gantt isnt worried about watching a 
large lead evaporate on election day he doesnt have one 
other black candidates have seen their comfortable cushions 
vanish at the polls but gantt the black former mayor of 
charlotte nc says his deadheat race against republican sen 
jesse helms is different he maintains hes the one with hidden 
support among white voters 
everybody keeps saying dont you think you need a 15point 
lead because people are going to lie to pollsters said gantts 
press secretary susan jetton no because why would somebody who 
voted for jesse helms three times in the past lie about voting for 
him a fourth time 
its more likely under the gantt camps theory that a white 
rural conservative voter would feel uncomfortable telling people he 
supports gantt so hed say helms but pull the gantt lever 
were not worried about the fudge factor jetton said any 
fudge factor on one side might be balanced by a fudge factor on the 
other side 
the fudge factor can be defined as a poll respondents tendency 
to hide out in the undecided column or give an answer thats 
socially acceptable but dishonest 
it was illustrated last year by the elections for virginia 
governor and new york city mayor black candidates won both races 
but only by fractions of the margins they were expected to get 
neil newhouse a republican polltaker said it would be a 
mistake to assume that all preelection polls involving minority 
candidates are unreliable 
i dont think its correct to try to extrapolate what happened 
in two polarized races black vs white abortion vs 
antiabortion to cincinnati ohio or waterbury conn he 
said black republicans are running for house seats in those two 
cities 
newhouse predicted race would play little or no role in the two 
contests particularly the heated cincinnati competition between 
democratic mayor charles luken and former mayor kenneth blackwell 
who is black 
hes been elected citywide he has a track record newhouse 
said of blackwell im positive youre not going to see any kind 
of turnoff by white voters 
in connecticut former democratic congressman toby moffett is in 
a competitive race with black republican gary franks an alderman 
from waterbury 
white voter turnoff was behind last years unexpectedly narrow 
wins for virginia gov l douglas wilder and new york mayor david 
dinkins wilder had a 9point lead in the polls and won by a 
halfpoint while dinkins was ahead 16 points in voter surveys and 
won by 4 points 
another variation of the fudge factor was evident this year in 
strong showings by two unconventional primary candidates considered 
socially unacceptable in some circles 
outspoken democrat john silber won his partys gubernatorial 
nomination in massachusetts by a 9point margin though polls showed 
his opponent with an 11point lead and exklansman david duke 
garnered 44 percent of the vote in the louisiana senate primary 
not enough to win but far greater than the 26 percent indicated in 
the last major poll before the election 
undecided voters tilted to duke and silber swelling their vote 
totals in contrast virtually all of those who were undecided 
right before the new york and virginia elections shunned dinkins 
and wilder in favor of their white opponents 
that would ordinarily spell bad news for gantt since the 
undecided voters who will determine the tight north carolina race 
are almost all white 
but geoff garin a democratic pollster said his research in 
north carolina indicates there is some reason for gantt to believe 
he can get an even break on the undecided vote there 
the undecided voters in north carolina are not secret helms 
voters he said they are people who dont like jesse helms and 
havent figured out exactly what to do 
helms an outspoken conservative has hammered at gantt for his 
extreme liberal values and criticizes his support for a womens 
right to an abortion gantt depicts helms as an ideologue who votes 
against the interests of his state particularly on education and 
the environment 
helms pleads with his supporters meanwhile to help him out of 
the fix im in by turning out to vote in large numbers said a 
key helms adviser carter wrenn its looking right now like 
thats going to be the deciding factor

june recently lost a relative and her 
sorrow would not abate then she read an article about a hospitals 
daylong program on depression and found herself among 150 
neighbors in need of help 
douglas g jacobs of quincy psychiatric associates said his 
unusual session which he hopes will be a model for programs 
nationwide provided potent evidence of the wide reach of 
depression 
in fact three of the people who came to the free session held 
earlier this month at quincy city hospital were immediately 
hospitalized because they were in the midst of a suicidal 
crisis 
jacobs was concerned but not surprised he said statistics show 
fewer than 30 percent of depressed people ever get help although 
most people who do seek counseling can recover in six to nine 
months the recovery period involves severe bouts of stress and 
disruption at home and work 
fifteen percent dont recover they commit suicide jacobs said 
at any time 7 million to 10 million people suffer from 
depression jacobs said many depressions go unrecognized and 
the ultimate loss is suicide were trying to encourage people to 
identify depression in themselves 
jacobs a psychologist who specializes in suicide research has 
been on the harvard medical school faculty for 12 years he 
developed the idea of the oneday program at the hospital as a way 
to familiarize people with the symptoms of depression and to 
encourage treatment 
this is not a substitute for a psychiatric evaluation this is 
to learn about depression to learn about the signs and symptoms 
jacobs said im going to propose this to be conducted statewide 
and perhaps nationally that will take a lot of planning 
about 15 participants in the session contacted him or another 
mental health professional for followup treatment and in all 
at least 50 percent could have benefited from treatment jacobs 
said 
mental health professionals say doctors need to be more familiar 
with the symptoms of depression which often manifests itself 
physically 
many have depressed patients and dont know it said melvin 
sabshin medical director for the american psychiatric association 
in washington 
a lot of people who have depression start with physical 
symptoms said sabshin loss of sleep physical problems of 
other kinds fatigue general lack of energy headaches gastric 
problems they suffer from sexual problems too 
jacobs called the apa for some guidance on the program and the 
national organization couldnt name a similar endeavor 
the program that jacobs had in quincy was excellent 
sabshin said last week it could be a prototype that we could 
consider for a program on a national basis 
every october the apa promotes national mental awareness week 
sabshin said once he receives jacobs data and discusses the 
program with his 75 district branches a national program may be 
established next fall 
the oneday session in this city just south of boston consisted 
of three twohour sessions including a halfhour lecture by 
jacobs a videotape of depressed people discussing their condition 
informational literature and a questionnaire each participant 
also got a brief session with a counselor 
the set of questions wasnt the kind of test you wanted to pass 
but june who asked that her real name not be used joked about it 
it was a very good questionnaire she said unfortunately 
i did pretty well because of my bereavement im still going 
through the grief process 
june realizes that the loss of a loved one is an unavoidable 
part of life but people often need help accepting and coping with 
such inevitabilities 
i had gone to two counselors but i felt i needed more help 
she said some people have depression all of their life and they 
dont always know it 
jacobs stressed that programs such as the one at quincy city 
hospital arent the longterm solution to depression but in a 
world of disappointments of varying degrees every bit helps

a boycott on ministering to soldiers after government troops 
surrounded their monasteries defiant monks were also threatened

martial law to bring monks before military tribunals for activities 
deemed disruptive to buddhism official rangoon radio said 
sentences dispensed by such tribunals range from a minimum of 
three years in prison to a maximum of death

christian lacroix brought spring into bloom sunday 
in a joyous riot of summer shades and shapes at his luxury 
readytowear fashion show 
the young designer from the south of france continued his trend 
of favorite silhouettes in luscious expensive styles and added 
some new tricks as well 
the multicolored striped jersey tshirt outfits mainly short 
with some long pants thrown in came out with original panels of 
sequined provencal flowers on shirts and skirts 
lacroix also stepped in line with some other designers here 
bringing out clinging bodysuits and bathing suits a few sported 
little ruffled skirtlets 
a new swirly abstract print called le marquis was mixed all over 
the place in pique cotton suits and flowing silk crepe outfits 
silhouettes ranged from simple pants and beach shirts to the 
favorite lacroix trapeze coats and babydoll dresses 
though every color of the rainbow showed up in his line lacroix 
strongly favored reds from orange to poppy to shocking pink he 
sometimes combined solids with a wide gridiron pattern or fuzzy 
stripes in pants or the modified bubbleshaped skirts he loves 
lacroix simplified a few outfits using solids only buttercup 
yellows lavender pastels or purple but often he mixed up bright 
solids on pockets sleeves and lapels 
the lacroix exuberance stayed mostly under control slipping 
only a bit in certain flounced mixedprint outfits rimmed and 
underlined by black lace petticoats 
they looked a bit too flowerchild for lacroixs sophisticated 
clientele who pay high prices for his clothes 
issey miyake scored a solid hit saturday for artistry and 
versatility with his individual approach to fabric and draping not 
always wearable the clothes always intrigued as objects 
in his sporting line yellowandblack stretch suits in abstract 
designs gave a futuristic cast to the current rage for body 
stockings 
with customary wit miyake sometimes added real handbags with 
the purse growing right out of the glove 
dinosaur jackets with pointed folded sleeves in sandy shades of 
gazar silk looked anything but prehistoric marching out over 
finelypleated white skirts 
another wild idea featured bicolored tunicsuits in a crimped 
fabric when held above the head the rounded arm shapes looked 
like cheery commas 
dressy clothes for the beach were a strong item at enrico 
coveris show on sunday the beaded sequined or embroidered beige 
fishnet trapeze minis maxis or pants outfits could look nearly 
nude or fine enough for a sunny terrace restaurant 
as usual coveri used plenty of strong color from flowered body 
suits to matching sheer duster tops raw silk in sizzling shades of 
orange cornflower yellow amethyst and shocking pink came out in 
fitted shortie suits some with sleeveless vests or jackets 
other options included solid short satin trench coats shorts 
beach wraps and bush jacket styles in african colors and patterns

the six jurors who helped 2 live 
crew beat an obscenity rap say their not guilty verdict was 
almost as instantaneous as it was unanimous 
the moment they took the case behind closed doors and sat down 
to a predeliberation lunch they discovered a common opinion not 
only was the miami rap groups music a form of art it was fun 
we found many of the things very humorous said beverly 
resnick 65 a mother of two who gathered briefly with the other 
jurors to discuss the verdict after court was adjourned saturday 
our feelings were the musicians in the band were telling the 
public how they felt inside of themselves and they were doing it 
with music we thought it had some art in it 
band leader luther campbell and members mark brother marquis 
ross and chris fresh kid ice wongwon each faced up to a year in 
jail and a 1000 fine had they been convicted on the onecount 
misdemeanor of staging an obscene performance 
assistant state attorney pedro dijols said after the verdict 
that he was unsure whether a similar case would be prosecuted in 
the future but he said the verdict showed broward authorities 
needed to do a better job of gathering evidence jurors had noted 
that the recording police made of the disputed concert was 
difficult to hear 
the charges stemmed from an adultsonly show at a nightclub in 
nearby hollywood on june 10 on june 6 a federal judge in broward 
county ruled the groups album as nasty as they wanna be was 
obscene and on june 8 a merchant was arrested for selling the 
album which includes references to oral and anal sex and sexual 
violence against women 
the jurors said that although they took more than two hours to 
finish their meal elect a foreman wrap up their debate and fill 
out the verdict form their feelings about the music were never in 
doubt 
it was humorous said juror david gilliland 26 a mechanic 
and i do believe humor is an art form 
the jurors also said they didnt think race was an issue 2 live 
crew is a black group and part of their defense was that their 
music represented their culture using timehonored devices such as 
exaggeration humor and bawdiness 
i like the music and my kids like the music said gertrude 
mclamore 61 a retired cook and the only black on the jury 
juror helena bailie 76 a retired sociology professor said the 
bands performance in the face of threatened arrests may have been 
an act of political defiance 
maybe the band felt threatened and they were thumbing their 
noses back she said 
foreman david garsow 24 said prosecutors made a mistake in 
playing tinny garbled tapes of the concert again and again 
although the words were barely discernible because of the poor 
quality of the recordings made by police with pocketsized 
recorders 
it wore us down said garsow a onetime musician after 
we heard it once we felt like we didnt need to hear it a third 
and a fourth time 
but although the tapes just werent clear enough for us to 
decide what happened garsow said the jury heard enough to not be 
offended 
as the crosssection of the community that we are it was just 
not obscene he said 
charles freeman the recordstore owner convicted by an earlier 
jury of selling obscene material when he sold a nasty album to 
an undercover policeman lauded saturdays verdict calling it 
true justice 
milt hirsch freemans trial attorney said the cases were 
different because the prosecution in his had to prove only that the 
recording freeman sold was obscene in the bands case the state 
had no case at all since it lacked a videotape or other 
conclusive evidence to support the charges 
unfortunately in charles trial the only issue was the 
obscenity of the record itself hirsch said whether this will 
come back for consideration at charles sentencing is another 
question 
freeman faces sentencing on nov 2

gunmen killed a former soldier 
near a crowded roman catholic church police said sunday the irish 
republican army claimed responsibility 
the slaying saturday night was the fourth within a week 
resulting from religious and sectarian strife in northern ireland 
the victim was identified as david pollock 30 a protestant who 
left the locally recruited ulster defense regiment several years 
ago 
the gunmen using a car stolen from a family they had taken 
hostage rammed the vehicle being driven by pollock in county 
tyrone near the border with the irish republic police said 
the attack took place just a few hundred yards from melmount 
church where more than 1000 roman catholic worshipers were just 
leaving a service celebrating peace and reconciliation 
its a miracle that no one else was killed or injured said 
the rev patrick arkinson the church curate this killing 
was a direct contradiction of our faith and a violation of the 
fifth commandment thou shalt not kill 
dr charles sullivan a local doctor said he went to help the 
man but he was already dead the body slumped over in the drivers 
seat 
the gang fled on foot and then hijacked a second auto from a 
woman and her daughter driving home from the church said a 
spokesman for the royal ulster constabulary the provinces police 
force who by custom was not identified 
the mainly catholic ira which is fighting to end british rule 
in the mainly protestant province and unite it with the 
overwhelmingly catholic irish republic claimed responsibility for 
the attack in messages to belfast media 
leading politicians in the province were united in their 
condemnation of the shooting 
peter robinson deputy leader of the hardline protestant 
democratic unionist party said there is a tremendous need for 
the government to react to this increase in violence and we must 
have a resolute military initiative against the ira immediately 
seamus mallon deputy leader of the moderate catholic social 
democratic and labor party called it another pointless brutal 
murder which will be as futile and counterproductive as the almost 
3000 murders which have already taken place 
the ira campaign has become a war of attrition which can lead 
to nothing but further suffering 
dr john alderdice leader of the centrist alliance party said 
all the terrorists can offer is to go around destroying peoples 
lives and families 
i feel angry about it and distressed for the family who is 
going to suffer this loss

after he and a fellow dog handler were shot by an ira gunman in 
central belfast

economy minister zelia cardoso de 
mello could fall victim to a scandal that already has cost the job 
of her romantic partner former justice minister bernardo cabral 
the economy minister denies any intention of resigning on 
friday president fernando collor de mello made a carefully staged 
public appearance with his embattled official in what was clearly 
meant as a show of support 
but ms cardoso de mellos job arguably the most important 
cabinet post in a country whose economy is reeling is the subject 
of much speculation 
news reports of the affair forced cabral to resign oct 13 few 
predict ms cardoso de mellos resignation is imminent but a 
concensus is growing that her days are numbered 
her position is extremely fragile said political consultant 
alexandre barros if i were a bookmaker id say there is an 80 
percent chance shell be gone within three months 
the scandal broke out in late september when ms cardoso de 
mello 37 years old and single was disclosed to be having an 
affair with cabral 58 who has been married for 35 years 
at a sept 19 birthday party for the economics minister the two 
danced cheektocheek at a posh brasilia club before hundreds of 
gawking journalists and dignataries 
political scientist walder de goes of the universty of brasilia 
said brazilian society is extremely sexist and that whispering 
and gossip about the ministers love life had greatly damaged her 
authority 
she can only save her job if she marries cabral he said 
otherwise shell be seen as someone foolish and weak who was 
used by an older man 
de goes said ms cardoso de mello appeared to come unglued 
during a senate hearing wednesday when cabral unexpectedly showed 
up during a brief break those in the chamber cleared the room to 
leave the two alone 
its obvious she is completely in love he said if the 
situation is not resolved she may be unable to concentrate on the 
countrys problems 
others say the cabral affair was merely the last straw and that 
brazils continuing economic woes are the primary reason for ms 
cardoso de mellos tenous hold on power 
prominent political analyst janio de freitas said collor has 
been angry with his economic minister since august when he 
announced inflation would be 3 percent based on a guarantee from 
ms cardoso de mello 
it was 10 percent and has gone up since then he said 
that along with the romantic scandal has her with one foot out 
the door 
he said that if monthly inflation was not in the single digits 
by january the ministers fate would be sealed september 
inflation was 1258 percent and little decline is expected soon 
especially with international oil prices soaring because of the 
persian gulf crisis 
barros said the only sign in ms cardoso de mellos favor was 
that her dismissal would be seen as a confession the presidents 
economic austerity policies had failed 
he said it would also weaken brazils position in its talks with 
foreign creditors 
if she goes everything gets very shaky he said that may 
at least delay her fall 
the ministers firmest show of support last week came from her 
mother 70yearold auzelia martoni cardoso de mello 
brazil needs to learn to pay attention to more important 
subjects and forget about my daughters personal life she 
said in a newspaper interview

israeliallied militiamen on sunday killed four 
lebanese guerrillas in a firefight north of israels 
selfproclaimed security zone in lebanon israeli army officials 
said 
the guerrillas were first seen by an israeli army patrol before 
dawn sunday near shaba a village in the zones eastern sector 
about a mile north of the israeli border a military official said 
on condition of anonymity 
the patrol fired and the guerrillas retreated to the north 
apparently planning to leave the security zone he said 
in the morning israeli soldiers backed by israelitrained south 
lebanon army militiamen found the guerrillas tracks and launched a 
pursuit the official said 
about four kilometers 24 miles north of the zone a south 
lebanon army unit came in contact with the guerrillas and killed 
them in a short firefight he said no militia casualties were 
reported 
the guerrillas were armed with the assault rifles and carried 
explosives the official said it was not immediately clear to 
which organization they belonged 
israel carved out the 2 to 10milewide security zone as a 
buffer protecting its northern border against guerrilla raids in 
1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its forees from lebanon after a 
threeyear occupation 
the zone is jointly patrolled by israeli soldiers and some 2500 
members of the mostly christian south lebanon army which is 
financed by israel

the discovery of 46 letters written by aldo moro 
while held by red brigades terrorists has reopened old wounds from 
the sensational 1978 kidnap and murder of the former prime 
minister 
while shedding little new light on the abduction and slaying 
publication of the letters was a chilling reminder of moros 
bitterness and frustration over the refusal of his christian 
democrat party to negotiate his release 
i have been killed three times by insufficient protection 
refusal to negotiate inconclusive politics he wrote 
moro kidnapped on march 16 1978 was murdered 55 days later 
and his bulletriddled body dumped in teh trunk of a car in 
downtown rome 
photocopies of 421 pages of moros letters to family members 
friends and political figures were discovered oct 9 in a milan 
apartment that served as a hideout for the leftist red brigades in 
the 1970s 
the safe house had reportedly been used by some of the 
terrorists who kidnapped moro police said the letters along with 
two guns 30 detonators and 50000 in cash were discovered by 
chance by workers who were restoring the apartment and found the 
material in a hollow space behind a wall 
political leaders however say they are convinced the letters 
did not turn up by accident they question how police could have 
missed the hiding place when they raided the apartment in 1978 and 
arrested three red brigades members 
some say they believe the letters were planted in the apartment 
later possibly very recently in an attempt to discredit certain 
political figures especially president francesco cossiga 
senate president giovanni spadolini who was a close friend of 
moro suggested friday that the sudden appearance of the letters 
was a maneuver to destabilize politicial institutions and leaders 
prime minister giulio andreotti said saturday he shared 
spadolinis suspicions and promised authorities would find out who 
is responsible otherwise he said someone will have to go a 
comment newspapers described as a threat to fire secret service 
chiefs 
the speaker of the chamber of deputies nilde iotti suggested 
that parliament hold a special debate to examine the circumstances 
surrounding the appearance of the letters 
political commentators said the main target of the alleged plot 
appeared to be cossiga who was interior minister at the time of 
the abduction 
in one of the letters moro criticized cossiga as being out of 
place hypnotized by andreotti and communist party leader 
enrico berlinguer 
cossigas office said he would not comment out of respect for 
the privacy of moros family which sought in vain to prevent the 
publication of the letters 
arnaldo forlani secretary of the christian democrats visited 
cossiga over the weekend to offer the partys solidarity 
the contents of the letters reiterate much of what had emerged 
earlier from other letters documents and trials other than the 
attack on cossiga the italian media have focused on moros jibes 
against other christian democrat colleagues 
moro wrote that andreotti who was also premier at the time 
moved with ease in relations with colleagues from the cia he 
described the then christian democrat leader benigno zaccagnini 
as the most fragile secretary in the partys history 
during his captivity moro sent numerous letters to his party 
and leading political figures asking them to negotiate an exchange 
of political prisoners with the red brigades the government 
rejected negotiations 
moro was kidnapped shortly after he arranged the historic 
compromise with the communist party 
the accord gave the communists a direct say in running the 
government for the first time since early after world war ii the 
deal collapsed after about nine months

enemy planes and artillery could not sink 
the battleship uss iowa but budget tightening and the costly 
damage left by a tragic explosion are sending the proud ship back 
into mothballs 
the decommissioning friday will be the third for the iowa since 
it sailed into combat in world war ii and crew members are looking 
on the event with sadness says the ships commander 
this crew today would like nothing more than someone to say 
thats it reverse course you are to make preparations to sail 
for the persian gulf said cmdr john p morse 
but that order is not likely to come 
in an effort to cut costs in face of a rising budget deficit 
the navy has decided the iowa is expendable the uss new jersey 
also is being mothballed leaving only two battleships in active 
service the missouri and the wisconsin 
in addition to the cost of operating a battleship more than 35 
million a year the iowa has another strike against it the 
expensive scars of the april 19 1989 explosion in one of its 
massive gun turrets that killed 47 sailors 
the navy concluded the explosion probably was sabotage by a 
gunners mate who died in the explosion but a congressional 
inquiry found the report to be lacking earlier this year the navy 
reopened its investigation 
the explosion did not seriously damage the ship itself but it 
would cost 13 million to repair turret no 2 
in its glory days in world war ii the iowas 16inch guns 
hammered shore fortifications on south pacific islands hurling 
2000pound shells more than 20 miles 
during the bombardment of the marshall islands in march 1944 
the iowa took two hits from japanese shore batteries 
henry schwartz was three decks down in turret no 2 when the 
first shell landed that month 
i didnt feel the impact one shell hit on the turret the 
other on the deck one guy got hit by a piece of shrapnel and that 
was it said schwartz 72 of indianapolis 
a fistsized dent high on the port side of the turret still 
marks the japanese shells impact 
when the war ended the following year the iowa entered tokyo 
harbor as part of the fleet accepting the japanese surrender 
we were all at general quarters wondering what was going to 
happen whether they really were going to surrender or what it 
was pretty tense said retired capt frank sellers jr 77 of 
san diego he served as the iowas gunnery officer in the closing 
days of the war 
the ship was put in mothballs following the war but was 
recalled in 1951 for the korean conflict it was retired again in 
1957 
with the planned buildup to a 600ship navy under president 
reagan the iowa was recalled and refitted as a launch platform for 
cruise missiles its 16inch guns were just an added benefit said 
capt fred moosally the ships commander at the time of the turret 
explosion 
its 17inch armor was thought impervious to any conventional 
weapons such as the type of missile that damaged several british 
ships during the falklands war with argentina and killed more than 
30 sailors aboard the frigate uss stark in the persian gulf 
any tinhorn dictator has access to those types of weapons 
said former secretary of the navy john f lehman jr the ship to 
send to a crisis area is a battleship we ought to have learned 
that from the stark and the samuel roberts the roberts was 
damaged by a mine in the gulf 
to morse the reasons for keeping the iowa in the navy are more 
visceral 
this ship has an excitement and a life to it and an emotional 
attraction to it more than any of the five ships on which i have 
served 
we are very mindful of the thousands of men who have come 
before us on this ship we try very hard to preserve their 
integrity and honor we think we have done that

senate majority leader george mitchell 
insisting only congress has the right to declare war said sunday 
congressional leaders are prepared to return from their break if a 
crisis flares in the persian gulf 
mitchell dmaine reiterated a position that has put congress 
at odds with top bush administration officials with more than 
200000 american troops based in saudi arabia lawmakers and the 
white house are tussling over which one has the constitutional 
right to commit the nation to war 
it is important to remember that under the american 
constitution the president has no legal authority none 
whatsoever to commit the united states to war mitchell said on 
nbctvs meet the press program 
only congress can make that grave decision he said and 
in this respect if the united states is to be committed to war it 
requires action by congress 
mitchell said he and house speaker thomas foley dwash have 
considered several measures that would bring congress back into 
session should that become necessary because of the persian gulf 
crisis 
congress is supposed to quit for the year after finishing the 
1991 budget probably this week and stay away until midjanuary 
secretary of state james a baker iii told senators last week 
that the administration would consult with congress if military 
action were needed in the gulf but he refused to commit the 
administration to getting any advance congressional approval for 
any action 
the administration contends president bush as the commander in 
chief of the military has the right to declare war moreover 
baker told the senate foreign relations committee that advance 
notification to congress could deprive the military of any surprise 
factor 
in an attempt to clarify the constitutional conflict after the 
vietnam war congress passed the war powers resolution in 1973 it 
requires the president to consult with congress before deploying 
troops into hostilities or when hostilities are imminent 
within 48 hours of deploying troops the president must file a 
report to congress additionally us forces must be withdrawn 
after 60 days if congress has not voted its approval 
meanwhile sunday the pentagon said it had no information about 
a report that iraqi troops tanks and armored vehicles have been 
pulling out of parts of kuwait positioning themselves closer to 
kuwaits major oil field in the matla region 
but lt col steve roy a pentagon spokesman said the report 
which appeared in the newspaper alkhaleej printed in the sharjah 
one of the united arab emirates was entirely possible because 
iraqi troops are continually repositioning themselves inside 
occupied kuwait 
us officials estimate the iraqis have put some 400000 troops 
in or around kuwait since iraqi president saddam hussein invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
in other gulf developments 
the pentagon confirmed the destroyer obrien fired a warning 
shot across the bow of an iraqi tanker in the gulf saturday us 
navy officials then intercepted the ship boarded it and allowed it 
to proceed there have been roughly a halfdozen warning shot 
episodes since aug 2

the second trial in the case of the central park 
jogger opens monday with the defense claiming that incriminating 
statements at the heart of the prosecutions case were coerced from 
mentally deficient boys 
but the prosecution will contend as it did in the first trial 
that the two teenage defendants voluntarily and knowingly made 
the admissions and that they convict themselves with their own 
words 
there are two defendants on trial this time kharey wise 18 
and kevin richardson 16 
there were among six teens who were charged with attempted 
murder and gang rape in the highly publicized attack on a female 
jogger in central park on april 19 1989 they also are charged in 
attacks on two male joggers that night 
in august the first trial ended in the conviction of three 
teens for rape firstdegree assault robbery and riot and 
acquittals on the charges of attempted murder and sodomy yusef 
salaam raymond santana and antron mccray all 16 received 
5to10year sentences the maximum for juvenile offenders 
the victim now 30 suffered brain damage and testified at the 
trial of the first three defendants that she has no memory of the 
attack that she has lost her sense of smell and that her sense of 
balance is impaired 
despite her lingering problems she has returned to her job at 
the salomon brothers investiment firm where she is now a vice 
president 
like the first trial the second will feature written and 
videotaped statements the youths made to police and prosecutors 
after their arrests 
in his statements to police richardson denied he attacked the 
female jogger he said he tried to help her and that she scratched 
his cheek when he got between her and the other youths 
wise made two videotapes in the first he admitted only that he 
was with a marauding gang of about 30 youths in the second which 
he asked to make he admitted he participated in the attack 
wises attorney colin moore said he and his clients mother 
dolores wise have rejected plea negotiations because they are 
convinced the teenager is innocent 
but moore was rebuffed friday when he asked state supreme court 
justice thomas galligan to allow expert testimony that his client 
is not intelligent enough to have knowingly and meaningfully waived 
his miranda rights against selfincrimination supreme court in new 
york state is a triallevel court 
moore said wise has an overall intelligence quotient of 73 he 
cited cases in which appeals courts held that defendants with an iq 
of less than 75 did not have the capacity to understand what 
waiving their rights would mean 
galligan said the motion was too late because by law it should 
have been made within 30 days of arraignment he said he saw no 
reason to waive that deadline 
richardsons lawyer howard diller has said similar things 
about his client at the teenagers arraignment diller told the 
judge that richardson is not what you and i would call all 
there 
wise 16 at the time of the attacks faces adult penalties that 
could total up to 57 years in prison if he is convicted on all 
counts 
richardson 14 when he was arrested faces the same five to 10 
years as the three youths in the first trial

the new german government will shut down the last 
sovietmade nuclear reactor in what was east germany because the 
reactor is unsafe an environment ministry spokesman said sunday 
the spokesman berthold goeke said in a telephone interview 
from bonn that the last operating reactor at the greifswald power 
plant in northeastern germany would be shut down by middecember 
three other reactors at the greifswald plant and another reactor 
at an older plant in rheinsberg just north of berlin were shut 
down earlier this year all are sovietdesigned plants 
sovietdesigned nuclear power plants throughout eastern europe 
have come under heavy criticism from western environmental 
officials for failing to meet safety standards 
the use of nuclear power is a sensitive issue in germany which 
has a powerful network of antinuclear groups the 1986 chernobyl 
nuclear disaster in the soviet union helped fuel the antinuclear 
movement 
goeke said it would be too expensive to modernize the greifswald 
plant to make it safe and would take nearly two months to shut it 
down 
the greifswald and rheinsberg plants also fail to meet european 
community nuclear safety standards that took effect when the 
germanys united oct 3 
goeke said security inspectors have found that the east german 
plants were not properly maintained and often were poorly 
constructed 
the environment ministers of both germanys had decided in the 
spring to shut down all nuclear power reactors in what was then 
east germany environment minister klaus toepfer informed the 
soviet government of the decision during a visit to moscow just 
after unification 
goeke said the german government had allocated 20 million to 
build an oilfueled heating plant in the greifswald region to make 
up for the loss of power when the reactor is shut down the 
oilfueled plant is scheduled to start operating in middecember 
in june officials shut down part of greifswald because of 
safety problems 
they said the plant management had permitted operation of a 
powerproducing block at the plant even though a leak had been 
discovered in what they called its cleaning system 
the magazine der spiegel reported in january that a nuclear 
accident had narrowly been averted at greifswald in 1976 when fire 
destroyed some electrical cables disabling all but one of 12 
watercooling pumps in one of the plants four powerproducing 
blocks 
the five states on the territory of east germany derive only 10 
percent of their electricity from nuclear power the majority of 
their power plants are fueled by brown coal which has seriously 
polluted much of eastern germany 
clouds of the noxious brown coal emissions also float into 
western germany prompting protests from environmental activitists

joseph ocain remembers lying on the parking 
lot unable to move as he watched his best friend stumble toward 
the grocery store door and collapse 
his friend darren jessie had been shot in the head fatally 
ocain also had been shot and left paralyzed from the waist down 
by a bullet in the spine 
two months after the march 31 shooting in rural theodore 
sheriffs deputies arrested a white convict who had been out of 
prison on parole only a few weeks before the incident they said he 
shot jessie and ocain because he hated blacks 
daniel amos pilot 34 goes on trial monday charged with murder 
in jessies death and attempted murder in the crippling of ocain 
district attorney chris galanos says the state will present 
evidence that the shootings were racially motivated but has 
provided no elaboration pilots lawyer says his client is not 
racist and was not at the shooting 
ocain says he and jessie 21 were listening to the radio 
sitting in a car belonging to jessies girlfriend and waiting for 
her to get off work the store is in a predominantly white 
unincorporated area on the western edge of mobile 
i never thought id be shot said ocain now 18 and 
struggling to adjust to life in a wheelchair and finish his final 
year at blount high school 
he said a man approached the car and asked them for marijuana 
we dont mess around with weed ocain said he shot me in 
the back and i just fell i never lost consciousness darren was 
walking toward the store already shot 
he said he didnt know his assailant but said he recognized 
pilot as the shooter 
some whites out there are good and some are bad some blacks 
out there are good and some are bad ocain said i dont want 
this hyped into some kind of prejudice thing 
cautious about being in the public spotlight ocain thinks his 
attacker should receive the ultimate sentence i think he should 
get the chair 
however the charges against pilot do not carry a death 
sentence but he is classified as a habitual offender having 
served prison terms in alabama and mississippi which could bring a 
maximum sentence of life in prison without the chance of parole if 
convicted 
state officials said pilot was paroled march 12 after serving 
about a third of a 12year sentence for receiving stolen property 
he reportedly was arrested based on information supplied to 
sheriffs deputies by an informant 
jim zeigler pilots courtappointed lawyer said theyve got 
the wrong man 
he said pilot planned to present an alibi he says he wasnt 
there and doesnt know anything about it 
the attorney also said pilot is not a racist and has affidavits 
from two black inmates saying he never hated blacks 
jessies mother catherine mccants said her son went to summer 
school to obtain his diploma from blount high school and had joined 
the army before he was shot she said he had been scheduled to 
leave for military service the month after the shooting 
jessie had worked at odd jobs around mobile while ocain hoped 
to become a brick mason a job that attracts many black craftsmen 
in this gulf coast area 
ocains mother jacqueline mcquay said that after her son was 
crippled they had to give up their apartment in a housing project 
because it had stairs that could not be negotiated with a 
wheelchair they moved in with a relative 
ocain has been going to physical therapy twice a week a van 
takes him to high school classes 
michael davis a counselor at the independent living center 
said hes just doing extremely well and not harboring any 
resentment

arkansas attorney general goes on 
trial monday in a case that could see judges legislators 
reporters and the governor called to the witness stand 
whether attorney general steve clark goes to jail may depend on 
whether state law required him to report expenditures on his 
stateissued visa card and to be accurate and honest when he did 
so 
there was no such law his attorney says 
and clark claims that discrepancies in his state expense account 
records are no more than bookkeeping errors 
clark 43 is charged with one count of felony theft by 
deception if convicted he could be sentenced to 20 years in jail 
and fined up to 15000 he was charged july 11 and released 
without bond 
he reported as business expenditures on his state credit card 
meals with people who say they didnt eat with him or that it 
wasnt business some who ate with him said they paid the tab 
the allegations forced clark in february to give up his 
candidacy for the democratic nomination for governor improving 
gov bill clintons reelection chances 
the state says clark was financially strapped but wined and 
dined family friends girlfriends and benefactors prosecutors say 
political contributions he sought at some of the meals ended up in 
his habitually overdrawn personal checking account 
a congressman a federal appeals court judge two state supreme 
court justices lobbyists former clark employees more than a 
halfdozen members of the little rock media and at least 14 state 
lawmakers are on the states witness list most of them were listed 
by clark as dining guests 
clark who is finishing his 12th year in office has admitted 
recordkeeping errors 
i made a mistake theres no doubt about it it was an honest 
mistake but i made a mistake clark said jan 31 the day he 
reimbursed the state 395129 i am sorry and i apologize 
he said records of the lunch and dinner meetings were 
reconstructed from notes his calendar receipts or memory he said 
he spent less than 30 minutes every 60 to 90 days attempting to put 
together the expense reports 
the attorney general whose job includes giving state agencies 
his interpretation of the state constitution and statutes said he 
wasnt required to keep those records 
state employees are required to report and itemize travel and 
meal expenses but elected officials who hold offices named in the 
constitution have long been thought to be exempt from that 
requirement 
pulaski county prosecutor chris piazza says clark entertained 
supporters on the taxpayers tab to generate campaign contributions 
that ended up in his pocket to support his lifestyle he would 
wine and dine some of his biggest contributors at the states 
expense piazza said at a pretrial hearing 
the attorney generals salary is 26500 among the lowest for 
the office in the nation as mandated by the arkansas constitution 
clark also gets 1250 a month in public relations money from the 
state with no itemized accounting required 
his deposits in a personal checking account for three years 
beginning july 1986 were at least twice as much as his net income 
a state auditor james ridgell said at a pretrial hearing clark 
deposited less money in each of those three years than he withdrew 
ridgell said 
the auditor said 28564 of state money was spent by clark on 
nonbusiness or personal expenses in the same three years 
he also said democratic national committee member ed miller of 
texarkana donated 14000 to clark or his campaign in the 
threeyear period the money was almost immediately put in clarks 
personal account to pay bills including an electric bill 18 months 
overdue 
miller us circuit judge richard s arnold and us rep tommy 
robinson rark are among the 249 people subpoenaed for the 
trial which is expected to last three weeks

an administrative judge for the federal 
nuclear regulatory commission has ordered the university of 
missouri to shut down a nuclear research project citing a 
possibility of danger to the public 
administrative judge peter b bloch said in an order issued 
saturday that the university had failed to comply with nuclear 
licensing regulations hence i presume that the activities are 
unduly dangerous to public safety he wrote 
bloch noted that a fire battalion chief had indicated he would 
respond to fires at the laboratory but might stand by while the 
laboratory burned because he had not been supplied with a 
firefighting plan 
bloch said that problem alone would have swayed him to stop the 
project 
the project involves efforts to separate the most longlived 
elements of nuclear waste from shortlived ones that will soon lose 
their radioactivity 
environmental groups and 10 individuals had challenged the 
universitys request to the nuclear regulatory commission for 
changes in its nuclear licenses the changes were needed for the 
project 
university spokesman mary still said lawyers for the school 
hoped to file documents or talk with the judge monday to end the 
temporary shutdown order 
still said the university had complied with all federal 
regulations regarding the project 
we have an excellent safety record she said 
mark haim director of the midmissouri nuclear weapons freeze 
said the judges order was good news 
we are very pleased it validates what weve been saying all 
along 
the project began about feb 1 and will take four years said 
truman storvick principal investigator for the project the 
university is working under a contract for the project with 
rockwell international an aerospace electronics and automotive 
technology corporation based in california 
the project is jointly sponsored by the us department of 
energy and japanese firms

this is marine lt steve 
kirtleys second time in a middle east crisis with no rotation date 
out but last time as a hostage in iran he was less confident of 
getting home 
i dont understand why some of the younger marines are so set 
on going home right away said kirtley of little rock ark 
shaking a closecropped blond head that is fit for a recruiting 
poster at 32 he leads a combat supply company 
on nov 4 1979 he was asleep at the marine guards quarters at 
the us embassy in tehran when 5000 iranians stormed the walls 
and seized all 52 americans inside 
as a young corporal he spent 444 days helping calm others while 
he was just as worried himself it has made him a better man he 
said but he still does not like waiting around 
i sit and i think about the waiting he said of his 
experience now in the desert its kind of like being a hostage 
were here and we dont know when the hell were going home but 
we have it a little better at least i know im going home 
kirtley who now oversees trucks learned the hard way what 
middle east deserts can do to machines during the hostage ordeal 
a us helicopter rescue attempt failed when three helicopters were 
disabled in a sandstorm and other aircraft were thwarted by dust 
the mission dubbed desert one was aborted when the blade of a 
helicopter fouled by sand struck a c130 transport plane and 
triggered a ball of flame which lit up the nighttime sky 
after iran he lectured to potential recruits he decided to be 
a drill instructor in san diego then he was accepted for officer 
training at the university of florida in gainesville 
he was stationed in hawaii and camp pendleton calif for the 
last 62 days he was been within striking distance of the iraq 
border with the 1st marine expeditionary force 
kirtley is a moviemakers marine 200 pounds of sculpted bulk 
with corncolored hair on a sunburned neck as a football player 
he played lineman for the university of florida in a gator bowl 
strict saudi customs dont bother him he doesnt drink anyway 
and says his wifes letters are all the female companionship he 
needs 
kirtleys past has made him a celebrity among the older hands 
for most younger marines americas last hostage crisis is vague 
history 
they want to know about it he said they ask what 
happened what i did how it was 
mostly kirtley is concerned with getting freight on the road 
his trucks move ammunition water food and fuel to marine units 
scattered across a wide sweep of arabian sands 
he speaks proudly how the service support group has driven 
500000 miles while moving 27 million pounds in two months 
sometimes the idea of imminent war seems to recede but kirtley 
knows the dangers in three days he noted the marines will 
commemorate the 1983 beirut terrorist bombing which killed 241 of 
their comrades 
kirtleys unit is better off than some with hot food and a 
small post exchange nearby 
outside his camouflagenetting tent a smaller shelter is 
jokingly labeled in large letters hbo available 
im luckier with a company to command he said i can sit 
around at night and worry about things it keeps me busy 
he also thinks about the occasions he is missing his birthday 
was oct 18 his wedding anniversary was aug 23 
asked if he had a word for his mother in little rock kirtley 
allowed himself a rare brief smile he replied 
tell her hi mom im doing a little better than the last 
time i was here and i hope to be home sooner

educators say evidence that fewer dropouts 
seek high school equivalency diplomas may threaten the nations 
economic future 
in a study of diploma candidates the american council on 
education found 683000 took the tests during 1989 7 percent less 
than in 1988 and less than 13 percent of the 43 million adults 
over 18 without a high school diploma 
the number of candidates aged 18 to 24 declined by 26 percent 
and only half of the drop may be due to the 125 percent decrease 
in the size of the us population within that age range during 
this period according to the study released sunday by the 
councils general educational development ged testing service 
if young people are choosing to work rather than complete 
their schooling the price may be high for both individuals and 
society individuals lose opportunities for additional training 
advanced education better jobs and higher wages while society 
loses the increased productivity of better educated more highly 
skilled workers said the study 
in order to qualify for training further education jobs and 
higher earnings these adults must have opportunities to earn high 
school diplomas 
earning diplomas were 376000 who took the tests which 
represents about 18 percent of all high school diplomas awarded 
that year said the study 
program director douglas r whitney and janet baldwin senior 
research associate said the study showed a great need for more 
outreach efforts to increase access to programs for high school 
completion 
the ged is the gateway to educational and economic opportunity 
for millions of americans said whitney its a matter of 
national concern that too many adults who would benefit from these 
opportunities find their paths blocked by obstacles that could be 
removed by more enlightened policies and programs to facilitate 
their participation 
since 1942 the ged program has been recognized nationwide by 
employers and colleges adults must surpass the performance of 
about 30 percent of a national sample of graduating high school 
seniors to earn equivalency diplomas and qualify for college 
enrollment training programs jobs and job advancement 
in other key findings the study showed 
about 200000 adults or 33 percent of candidates in 1989 took 
the ged tests primarily to meet educational admissions 
requirements compared with 291 percent in 1980 
the percentage of candidates who took the tests for employment 
reasons declined from 386 percent in 1980 to 322 percent in 1989 
the proportion of hispanic candidates increased from 68 
percent in 1980 to 112 percent in 1989 while the percentage of 
black candidates fell from 171 percent in 1980 to 142 percent in 
1989 
the percentage of ged candidates who reported having left 
school due to pregnancy or marriage tripled in 1989 one in five 
adults taking the ged tests 197 percent cited this reason as the 
most important compared with 64 percent in 1980 
in 1980 685 percent and in 1989 699 percent reported having 
completed 10th grade or higher before leaving high school while 
369 percent in 1980 and 386 percent in 1989 reported having 
completed 11th grade or higher 
about three of every four candidates reported having grades 
while in school of mostly c or better in both 1980 768 
percent and 1989 74 percent more than one in five candidates 
reported inschool grades of mostly b or betterin 1980 232 
percent and in 1989 215 percent

democrat lawton chiles has made his run for florida 
governor a crusade against bigmoney politics and now he may have 
to pay the price 
gov bob martinez has waged a 9 million campaign erased his 
opponents lead and is on the move with sharp attacks on chiles 
senate record 
weve gone up and my opponent has declined and the campaign 
is where it was about this time in 1986 said a delighted 
martinez four years ago republican martinez defeated democrat 
steve pajcic becoming only the second gop governor in florida 
since reconstruction 
chiles held doubledigit leads in the polls shortly after he 
joined the race last april he and running mate buddy mackay 
declared a campaign against the politics of special interests 
chiles has a selfimposed 100 limit on contributions some 
59000 people by far a state record have donated to his 
campaign but the approach has brought in just over 4 million 
the latest polls show the race a dead heat 
in recent days martinez has sought to capitalize on the federal 
budget mess calling chiles and mackay washington insiders and 
members of the liberal eastern establishment chiles was senate 
budget chairman when he retired and mackay is a former threeterm 
congressman chiles retired at the end of his third senate term in 
january 1989 
chiles suggests martinez is the insider and that its time for a 
change 
i think he senses that people are ready to turn the rascals 
out and hes trying to turn it away from himself chiles said 
both parties consider this a watershed election in the state 
with democrats still the majority party trying to come back after 
a decade of republican gains 
chiles is worried about martinez commercials 
two of them say chiles repeatedly voted against senior citizens 
in the senate 
i want you all to be my truth squad and go out and set the 
record straight chiles told a meeting of the american 
association of retired persons 
chiles says his votes reflect the dilemma posed by the federal 
deficit 
he says he helped start many senior programs and increased 
funding in most cases but did cast votes against some 
budgetbusters 
martinez says chiles will raise taxes 
chiles said fastgrowing florida will need to increase revenues 
but he first wants to see how martinez has managed 38 billion in 
a variety of tax increases since taking office 
the republican has turned down all but one oct 30 debate 
appearance 
the governor didnt want to be set up in debates sponsored by 
prochiles groups explained martinez campaign manager jm 
mac stipanovich 
chiles 60 used six debates against democratic primary foe rep 
bill nelson to help push aside questions about his vitality 
chiles who said he was burned out after three terms in the 
senate takes the antidepressant drug prozac 
both camps also are seeking bigtime help 
president bush made two campaign appearances for martinez the 
governors staff which includes presidential son jeb bush as 
campaign chairman hopes for another 
chiles is calling in georgia sen sam nunn to tour the 
militaryminded florida panhandle this week 
one issue that hasnt been central to the race is abortion 
martinez last year called an illfated special legislative 
session in hopes of further restricting abortion 
but chiles says he wont use what polls indicate could be an 
effective weapon 
most floridians identify themselves as for abortion rights 
chiles personally opposes abortion and has cast antiabortion 
votes in the past but he supports a womans choice after 
listening to a female supporter fervently ask him to highlight the 
abortion issue chiles threw his arms up and said no 
i have to do what my conscience tells me he said im 
comfortable telling people what my position is but im not 
comfortable in making a big deal issue about it

hollywood era another passing of a show business cowboy who 
personified the old west 
he was the last great a western film cowboy said john 
langellier director of the research center at the gene autry 
western heritage museum 
along with randolph scott and certainly a few others like john 
wayne and gary cooper he created the strong silent stereotype of 
the rugged western hero langellier said there will never be 
another like him his death marks the end of an era 
mccrea died saturday at age 84 in the motion picture and 
television fund hospital his wife of 57 years actress frances 
dee and son peter were with him at the time 
following private services mccrea will be cremated and his 
ashes scattered at sea peter mccrea said mccrea also leaves sons 
jody and david 
mccreas last public appearance was oct 1 with first lady 
barbara bush at a beverly hills fundraising dinner for republican 
gubernatorialcandidate pete wilson 
after her speech mrs bush went over to mccrea took his hand 
and said my hero said ac lyles a friend of mccreas for 
many years 
he lit up lyles said that summed up everybodys feeling 
about joel 
descended from pioneers one grandfather fought apache indians 
and drove stagecoaches mccreas early ambition was to own a 
ranch 
he loved the outdoors he loved the west and history of the 
west said producer walter mirisch who worked on six films with 
mccrea 
while most of his 87 roles were westerns mccrea also was adept 
at light comedy and drama he was the trenchcoatwearing reporter 
in alfred hitchcocks 1940 foreign correspondent 
he had the quality of childlike innocence and yet there was a 
strength of character that comes through said peter mccrea 
when the chips were down you felt he could handle a situation 
one of mccreas comedies sullivans travels was listed by 
the library of congress as one of 25 outstanding films worthy of 
historic preservation the 1941 film was written and directed by 
preston sturges 
i think one reason he appealed to sturges was his lowkey 
style peter mccrea said he wasnt a superstar and he 
wouldnt overwhelm the story he didnt try to be an actors actor 
he tried to play the part the way it would be if he were in that 
persons shoes 
in a 1985 interview mccrea said he always wanted to be the 
guy who rode off into the sunset to represent right over 
evil 
born in south pasadena he grew up in hollywood and got his 
start in movies as a volunteer horse holder for western stars 
tom mix and william s hart 
at 12 mccrea got his first paying job riding a horse in a movie 
mob scene 
they dressed me up in buckskins and for two days work i was 
paid 5 mccrea once said boy that appealed to my scotch 
blood i forgot about wanting to be a cowboy and decided to be an 
actor 
bob ward a friend who said he first met mccrea in 1947 said 
mccrea told him about a conversation he had with cowboy comedian 
will rogers who told him that he was not a very good actor so 
hed better buy some real estate 
in the 1930s mccrea and his wife bought a ranch in ventura 
county northwest of los angeles that eventually totalled nearly 
3000 acres 
mccrea later made millions of dollars when he sold off parcels 
to developers he kept about 300 acres 
in april 1969 mccrea was inducted into the hall of fame of 
great western actors in oklahoma city

the average worldwide surface air temperature 
was the warmest on record last spring a commerce department agency 
said sunday 
temperature readings recorded at 63 sites around the globe 
during march april and may averaged more than 15 degrees 
fahrenheit above the 30year average of 54 degrees said dr james 
k angell of the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations 
air resources laboratory 
the readings were about 05 degrees warmer than the previous 
highest temperature recorded in the marchmay period angell said 
he cautioned that his analysis should not be construed as 
confirming claims that global warming is occurring during the 
juneaugust period the global surface temperature was only about 
05 degrees above average 
he termed that a typical value for this season over the past 
decade 
the most unusually warm temperatures recorded in the marchmay 
period were in the arctic where temperatures were about 72 
degrees above average and 45 degrees higher than previously 
observed angell said 
at the same time the temperature in the 30000foot to 
60000foot altitude range was about 108 degrees below normal 
angell said 
he said scientists were trying to determine whether very cold 
temperatures in the stratosphere might also be associated with 
destruction of the earths protective ozone layer in the arctic 
region 
he said preliminary evaluation of ozone data in the arctic last 
spring showed concentrations 8 percent lower than the average of 
the previous decade and 2 percent lower than in th next lowest 
year 1986

a machine company has been ordered to stand 
trial on five felony counts of dumping thousands of tons of 
hazardous waste at an old navy shipyard 
judge charles james issued his ruling on friday after an 
11month preliminary hearing which is the longest conducted in an 
environmental case in california 
the civil action against triple a machine shop also is san 
franciscos first felony toxic pollution case said prosecutor 
steve castleman whos in the district attorneys environmental 
unit 
the prosecution is seeking fines of 5000 to 10000 for each 
day that hazardous waste remains on site at the hunters point navy 
shipyard a 500acre facility the company leased from the navy from 
1976 to 1986 according to estimates it could cost 100 million to 
clean up the site 
the district attorneys office alleges that the company dumped 
waste oil and acids polychlorinated biphenyls asbestos 
sandblasting materials contaminated with lead and copper and other 
hazardous wastes 
triple as attorneys fred blum and carmen trutanich said they 
considered the preliminary hearing a success since the number of 
felony counts pending against the company was reduced from an 
original 16 
trutanich added that the navy should be prosecuted in the case 
because it allegedly dumped hazardous materials at the site for 
years before triple a leased the facility 
its ludicrous that were going through this now without the 
navy sitting next to me in the defendants chair trutanich said

police to fire on attackers they also said the offduty policeman 
should have immediately shot the assailant dead instead the 
officer fired his pistol in the air then shot the attacker in the 
legs 
if someone attacks with intent to kill he should be killed on 
the spot agriculture minister raphael eitan said

palestinian uprising called for vengeance in these bloody days of 
total escalation

protesters and police on sunday traded accusations 
over who was to blame for violence that marred a demonstration the 
day before against britains controversial poll tax 
saturdays protest was the second violent antitax demonstration 
this year an demonstration in trafalgar square on march 31 turned 
into one of the worst riots in london this century 
home secretary david waddington demanded a report from police on 
the riot saturday that left six officers and six civilians injured 
and resulted in 120 arrests five shops were damaged 
the confrontation began after a a crowd estimated by police at 
2500 left a peaceful antitax rally at brockwell park in south 
london they marched to brixton prison to show solidarity with four 
prisoners jailed after the trafalgar square riot 
dave morris coordinator of the trafalgar square defendants 
campaign which organized the protest told a news conference 
sunday that police staged a preplanned attack in order to 
discredit the poll tax movement 
he accused officers of incompetence and brutality 
scotland yard said it stood by the comments made saturday night 
by deputy assistant commissioner john metcalfe who blamed the 
violence on the anarchist movement 
ive no doubt at all that the people who started the violence 
intended it and came to the demonstration intending it he said 
more than 2000 extra police were on duty to prevent a 
repetition of the trafalgar square riot that rioting left 331 
police and 86 civilians injured caused hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in damage and led to 341 arrests 
the poll tax is part of mrs thatchers crusade to wipe out 
british socialism by hitting at its last bastion local 
government instead of a tax on property owners the community 
charge is paid by every adult and the amount is determined by the 
local council 
critics say the tax is unfair because all adults in a district 
pay the same charge regardless of wealth

more than 30 russian groups united on sunday to 
form the nations largest political bloc opposing the communist 
party and the new movement demanded that kremlin leaders resign 
national legislators and key officials of the russian republic 
attended the twoday founding conference of the democratic russia 
movement the broadest grouping yet to openly challenge president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
but the conference glossed over sharply divergent views among 
the republics various groups and gave them the right to pull out 
of the movement the movements chances of becoming a unified 
political force were uncertain 
many small parties have been created since the communist party 
surrendered its constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power last 
february none including the new bloc have anywhere near the 
communists 18 million members the new movement joined 
christian democrats with labor unions scholars with peasants and 
red army officers with disabled veterans they united around a 
sweeping platform that called for russian sovereignty as well as 
the resignation of gorbachev and his prime minister nikolai 
ryzhkov 
the platform underlined growing disenchantment with the soviet 
leader 
the conference also formed a commission to organize civil 
disobedience if necessary it was not clear under what conditions 
civil disobedience would be used 
it delegated another commission to find ways to create a market 
economy in russia the largest and most populous of the 15 soviet 
republics 
a fledgling coalition between gorbachev and boris n yeltsin 
the reformist president of the russian republic fell apart after 
the soviet president balked at the radical economic program backed 
by yeltsin 
gorbachev finally showed that he has moved to the right by 
rejecting radical economic reforms last week prominent legislator 
yuri boldyrev told the 1272 delegates they met in a central 
moscow movie theater 
after his speech delegates voted by a show of hands to approve 
a draft declaration forming the democratic russia movement then 
applauded for nearly a minute in a standing ovation 
the task of the movement is coordination of the activities for 
the unity of democratic forces to carry out the progressive 
radical political and economic reforms in russia according to 
the draft published sunday by the independent postfactum news 
agency 
the movement will be run by a 21member coordinating council and 
will include a council of representatives and consultative body to 
make sure all members views are heard according to the 
declaration 
the draft also guarantees the independence of every associated 
member in choosing his strategy and tactics 
the final version will be published next week in the movements 
newspaper said oleg rumyantsev leader of the social democratic 
party of russia and member of the new coordinating council 
following the vote the celebratory air in the hall subsided and 
officials proposed several supplementary planks and dozens of minor 
resolutions 
in an indication of disagreements to come several delegates 
demanded that the initial call only for ryzhkovs resignation be 
expanded to include gorbachev others from the floor applauded the 
suggestion 
but we have no union so what does it matter whether the 
president resigns an official retorted a delegate echoed why 
demand either resign just create a market economy and the 
government will fall anyway 
the delegates changed the wording to include gorbachev and the 
resolution passed by a large majority 
cooperation among the various groups was not assured 
in a survey of 628 delegates taken saturday by the independent 
firm monitoring nearly a quarter said they would not subsume 
their own goals to those of the movement only 11 percent said they 
would follow the movement over their own party while 57 percent 
said they would seek a compromise position 
the poll gave no margin of error 
in a poll of support for leaders yeltsin was by far the most 
popular with 89 percent followed by leningrad mayor anatoly 
sobchak with 55 percent gorbachev received only 8 percent support 
the poll concluded that delegates were united mainly in their 
opposition to the communist party and in their support for yeltsin

tests for the aids virus will be conducted on 
unidentified blood samples taken routinely from newborn infants in 
pennsylvania without parents consent a newspaper reported sunday 
the program is designed to measure the presence of the virus in 
the general population 
the state department of health begins the federal program next 
month but the project will include about 50000 blood specimens 
taken from infants since july 1 and stored the pittsburgh press 
reported 
dr bobby jones epidemiology director for the state bureau of 
aids said the state didnt publicize the program because parents 
might have refused all medical tests on their new babies 
we dont want it to have an adverse impact on the metabolic 
screening we do jones said 
jones said there was no need for the state to announce the 
program because parents wont learn the results the tests will be 
performed on samples after they are stripped of the donors name 
and birth date 
some parents objected to the additional testing without their 
consent others did not 
janice stifter of plum said she was unaware the state was 
storing her babys blood 
but it wouldnt have bothered me if i had known she said 
her daughter laura was born aug 10 at magee womens hospital in 
pittsburgh 
they shouldnt be doing any tests without letting us know 
said duane szymanski father of 11weekold samantha theyre 
using her blood 
mothers complained of being kept in the dark about their babies 
health 
if my child had aids and i wouldnt know if seems kind of 
senseless said robbie wojciewchowski i really think they 
should let the parents know the results her daughter kimberly 
was born aug 22 at allegheny general 
state figures show 4226 people have suffered or are suffering 
from fully developed aids in pennsylvania since 1981 when records 
were first kept there are no statistics on people found to be 
carrying the virus without developing symptoms

prime minister mahathir mohamads 
ruling coalition was swept back into power in weekend elections 
defeating a loose grouping of opposition parties 
with all but one seat accounted for mahathirs national front 
coalition had 127 seats in the 180member lower house to 48 for 
the combined opposition four seats went to independents 
we are happy that the people have returned us to power with a 
more than twothirds majority this will enable us to give a 
strong peaceful and stable government said mahathir 64 
it was his third election victory since becoming prime minister 
in 1981the ruling coalitions lost a few seats overall in the 
voting 
polling started in remote areas of sabah and sarawak states on 
borneo on saturday the rest of the country voted sunday 
also at stake was control of 11 of the 13 state legislatures 
sabah and sarawak hold separate state elections 
the ruling coalition had controlled all 13 state bodies up to 
oct 5 when mahathir called the elections but the sabah united 
party a christian party defected from the coalition on oct 15 
in the weekends voting the ruling coalition also lost control 
of the legislature in kelantan the home state of tengku razaleigh 
hamzah a 53yearold former ally of mahathir who now heads the 
opposition alliance 
malaysia has been ruled by a multiracial coalition based on 
parties made up of different ethnic and racial groups since 
independence in 1957 
malays comprise about 53 percent of the population of 178 
million chinese make up about 32 percent with indians and other 
races making up the balance 
the national front includes the malaysian chinese association 
malaysian indian congress and seven smaller parties 
malaysia has had seven previous elections since independence 
but in those votes the fragmented opposition made little headway 
against the national front establishing only regional bases of 
power 
in the weekend vote however the electorate for the first time 
had an organized alternative representing the same ethnic mosaic as 
the national front 
but the campaign was largely devoid of issues focusing instead 
on personality attacks 
the opposition charged the national front with economic 
mismanagement corruption indifference to ethnic tensions and 
erosion of judicial powers none of these allegations made much 
impact the opposition also promised sweeping tax cuts 
mahathir claims credit for one of the fastest growing economies 
in southeast asia and he dismissed the other accusations as 
groundless he derided the promised tax cuts as the height of 
irresponsibility and money politics 
in two major upsets defense minister ahmed rithaudden was 
defeated in the kelantan state district of kota baharu and 
science technology and environment minister stephen yong lost in 
sarawak 
the twothirds majority won by the ruling coalition is necessary 
to amend the constitution and symbolic as a measure of the prime 
ministers power in the old parliament the coalition held 133 of 
the 177 seats the new one was enlarged by three seats 
voting was not compulsory and turnout of the 79 million voters 
ranged from 60 to 70 percent throughout the country 
fifty thousand police officers were on duty and 25000 on 
standby for election day authorities said no violence was 
reported 
no outdoor rallies or political processions have been allowed in 
malaysia since race riots after the 1969 elections left hundreds 
dead in the streets of kuala lumpur that bloodshed occurred after 
chinese parties made inroads on malay political dominance

four of egypts main opposition parties 
announced sunday they would boycott next months parliamentary 
elections to protest what they said were unfair voting conditions 
this would leave president hosni mubaraks national democratic 
party virtually unchallenged 
the opposition new wafd labor and liberal parties and the 
moslem brotherhood are protesting conditions they say encourage 
voterigging 
those include loopholes they said would allow the use of names 
of dead and absent voters and an emergency law that has led to 
arrests of thousands of opposition supporters 
the government denies their claims of election fraud saying the 
emergency law is only being used to combat terrorism and black 
market dealings in drugs and currency 
the staterun middleeast news agency quoted information 
minister safwat alsherif as saying the ruling party welcomed any 
dialogue that would help convince the opposition to participate in 
the elections 
at a news conference the opposition leaders declared that any 
opposition candidate who stood for election in defiance of the 
boycott would be expelled from his party 
the four groups held 95 of the 458 seats in the parliament the 
peoples assembly which was dissolved last week by a national 
referendum after egypts supreme constitutional court ruled it was 
elected under unconstitutional law 
the courts ruling was in may and the assembly had been in 
recess effectively suspended since june 
using his executive lawmaking powers in the assemblys absence 
mubarak decreed an election law that appeared to satisfy the 
courts stipulation 
the opposition argues that it was not consulted over the new 
law which it says is still far from satisfactory 
only the small leftist national unionist progressive party has 
announced it will participate in the nov 29 election there has 
been no word yet from four other small parties that have not run 
previously 
the emergency law allows wide powers to the police it has been 
in effect since the assassination of president anwar sadat in 1981 
on oct 11 a few days after the old parliaments suspension was 
decreed gunmen assassinated rifaat elmahgoub the speaker of the 
former parliament but his death apparently had nothing to do with 
the current dispute

officials from 13 southern states and puerto 
rico on sunday labeled their region the least educated in the 
nation and announced formation of the southern literacy forum to 
combat the problem 
there are thousands of individual literacy programs out there 
a lot of good is going on but its like dipping the mississippi 
river dry with a teaspoon former mississippi gov william f 
winter wrote in a report released at a news conference 
a center will help us coordinate on a regional basis what 
has to be one of the most important projects that anybody can be 
involved in he wrote 
in the 13 southern states at least 30 percent of adults are 
high school dropouts this is true in only three of the other 37 
states the report said 
the forum will be an offshoot of the southern growth policies 
board which southern governors created to develop their economies 
and people the agency is based in research triangle park nc 
the board received the report sunday from its chairman 
louisiana gov buddy roemer who also announced creation of the 
forum 
also attending the boards 18th annual meeting were north 
carolina gov james martin and officials from alabama arkansas 
florida georgia kentucky mississippi oklahoma south carolina 
tennessee virginia west virginia and puerto rico 
literacy would improve the quality of our work force lower 
the unempooyment rates and make our citizenry have a higher 
selfesteem roemer said it will be helpful to join with our 
neighbors and put together a plan to develop literacy opportunities 
for the region 
what the forum does is show which ideas are best and promote 
them martin said its sort of like blocking and tackling 
weve got to deal with the fundamentals 
the report literacy is everybodys business noted the very 
meaning of literacy has changed throughout the century 
todays literacy would seem like higher education to our 
grandparents it said in fact the education that was once 
sufficient to enable any ambitious adult to get ahead now cant 
even help him hold his place on the assembly line 
during world war ii a worker able to read at a 4thgrade level 
could manage entrylevel jobs an 8thgrade education was enough to 
get by in the mid1960s 
today even entrylevel jobs may require some college education 
and farming a crucial part of the southern economy needs more 
than a field hands skills 
once it was enough to read the ripeness of a tomato or the 
skys forecast of rain todays farmer is the chief executive 
officer purchasing agent personnel officer and financial manager 
of a rapidly evolving highly sophisticated business the report 
said 
at the same time he must be a scientist to select his seed or 
stock plants a computer operator to disburse the proper fertilizer 
to his fields or feedstuffs to his livestock a production expert 
to manage the harvest and a marketing whiz to sell his 
commodity it said 
the report estimated that literacy programs currently are 
attended by fewer than 10 percent of southern adults who need to 
improve their reading speaking and mathematics skills 
a regional partnership is needed to expand such offerings 
because no single southern state has the money or other resources 
to reach and teach all the people who need help the report said 
the southern literacy forum will help states put together such 
programs pay for or conduct research to improve them and provide 
information training and other help to local literacy programs 
the policies board has a 12 million budget 31 percent of it 
from state dues and appropriations and the rest from grants 
associate memberships and publications 
initial support for the organization will come from 175000 the 
board hopes to raise from foundations and private donors

you always have some incidents that occur as a result of hobo 
day the schools homecoming said university president robert 
wagner but friday and saturday nights events were the most 
extreme in many years he said 
several hundred people marched across campus toward downtown 
saturday tearing down signs and light poles small fires were 
started at two intersections near the campus and some students 
pelted police and firefighters with eggs and beer bottles 
on friday people clogged a street near the campus and

iraqs decision to ration gasoline and 
motor oil starting tuesday indicates the worldwide trade embargo on 
iraq is finally taking hold where it hurts most the petroleum 
industry 
although iraq now controls an estimated 20 percent of global oil 
reserves the rationing belies the fragility of iraqs main 
industry and brings into question how long it can keep its army 
running 
even the government admits that the sanctions are beginning to 
hurt 
day after day effects of the economic blockade being imposed 
on iraq conspicuously affect it the formula which was invented by 
the us administration for building economic political and 
psychological pressure on the iraqi people the ruling baath 
party newspaper althawra said sunday 
there is no doubt that this policy has direct impact on the 
individual and the family it said 
the party organs acknowledgment echoes what western governments 
have hoped for weeks the embargo would achieve 
we believe it is beginning to have an effect and that it will 
have an effect not only on the iraqi economy but on this massive 
military machine iraq has in kuwait us defense secretary 
dick cheney said thursday 
kuwaiti economist jassem alsaadoun estimated last week that the 
loss of oil exports alone costs iraq 54 million a day 
iraqs inability to sell its oil is the cornerstone of the 
embargo said alsaadoun head of the alshall financial house 
the rationing move constitutes an iraqi admission of its 
inability to refine oil on its own oil minister issam abdul rahim 
alchalabi ordered the rationing to conserve additives that iraq 
could no longer obtain because of the ban on imports 
the price of gasoline is being kept at the presanctions level 
of 26 cents per liter or about 1 a gallon but motor oil prices 
have increased in recent weeks 
for the moment food is less of a problem iraqi stores and 
markets are chockfull of fruits vegetables fish canned goods 
juice cooking oil wheat flour and rice much of it from abroad 
restaurants do a bustling business 
but milk sugar tea cooking oil soap and rice have been 
rationed for weeks and farmers have been urged to plant more grain 
on unused lands 
the twomonthold trade embargo has kept out machinery and spare 
parts oilproducing equipment and materials needed for 
construction and agriculture building projects have halted 
petroleum production is down 43 percent and people are being urged 
to cut back on electricity use president saddam hussein has even 
appealed to citizens to conserve their clothing 
my personal understanding is that the sanctions bite every 
day more and more says marjatta rasi chairwoman of the un 
security councils sanctions committee 
the functioning of the society will slow down because they 
cannot receive spare parts even though they have taken everything 
they could from kuwait she said 
while it is difficult to accurately quantify effects of the 
sanctions experts seem to agree that iraq cannot hold out more 
than a few months 
kuwaiti economist alsaadoun said iraq likely had consumer and 
industrial supplies stockpiled to last three months this means 
that six months of the embargo would be sufficient to have the 
country explode he said 
the government which first distributed food ration coupons for 
two months will issue them for six months starting in november 
psychologically this is important because the iraqi government 
is preparing the people for a long embargo a baghdad resident 
said 
the front line of enforcement are the naval ships implementing 
the twomonthold blockade 
western warships have intercepted about 2600 vessels boarded 
some 270 and diverted a dozen shipping aviation and military 
sources say the naval blockade is virtually impermeable 
us viceadm henry mauz commander of naval elements in 
operation desert shield said last week that a small quantity of 
goods were trickling into iraq through jordan some goods arrive in 
aqaba jordans red sea port and are repackaged and sent on to 
iraq he said 
jordan turkey and iraqs erstwhile archenemy iran have emerged 
as the weak links in the embargo chain 
soon after the trade sanctions were adopted on aug 16 a convoy 
of supplies sent by palestinians left jordan for iraq in a cheerful 
but flagrant violation of the un order 
smuggling mostly smallscale from turkey and iran began soon 
after the embargo and some turkish cargo sent to iran was diverted 
to iraq by iranian border guards 
but a senior turkish official said last week there had been no 
increase in traffic to iran indicating that iran is largely 
abiding by the embargo 
i dont think there is a great amount of smuggling said the 
un sanction committees ms rasi i dont think the smugglers 
want to take the risk for the iraqi currency 
the iraqi dinar is not covertible on currency markets and has 
been shunned in the wake of the trade ban 
the air embargo adopted in late september is enforced mainly 
in jordan where iraqs only commercially scheduled flights arrive 
they are checked by jordanian authorities as well as un 
officials

a veterinarian has developed a dog 
collar he says can silence chronic barkers with a highfrequency 
beep 
its not an electric shock collar it will not hurt the dog 
said jon hunter 48 an associate professor of veterinary 
physiology and pharmacology at texas aampm 
the device needs finetuning and its effectiveness is uncertain 
he said but the principle is simple 
when the dog barks a miniature microphone in the collar emits a 
burst of highintensity sound startling the animal into silence 
the sound is inaudible to most humans 
it will not be so effective that it will stop dogs from 
barking completely hunter said many people want their dogs to 
bark in order to warn them of intruders 
the people who have tested the collar have said the collar has 
had an immediate effect hunter said it causes the dog to 
become distracted from its barking 
hunters invention was inspired by his experience as an 
11yearold missouri farm boy 
we were milking cows and a thunderstorm occurred he said 
when the thunder occurred the cattle and dogs would seek 
shelter 
later in attempting to modify the behavior of animals i 
thought of different sounds that would change an animals 
behavior he said 
in three years of research hunter tried electronic simulation 
of thunder explosions and gunfire but a highpitched sound few 
humans could hear turned out to be the best antidote 
hunter said his collar is more humane than other solutions 
owners employ some fit their pets with electricshock collars or 
subject them to vocal cord surgery others may give them away or 
even destroy the animal 
hunter said he has a contract with a manufacturer whose name he 
wouldnt disclose and hopes to have a model on the market in six 
months 
but already hunter said he has been besieged by pet owners 
offering their yelping dogs as guinea pigs to test the collar 
i have people call me and say please give me a collar or 
ill have to put my dog to sleep hunter said were trying to 
help people as quickly as we can but they want the collar 
tomorrow

editors note associated press reporter salah nasrawi was among 
a group of reporters flown to kuwait and permitted to visit a 
hospital there sunday by the iraqi information ministry 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a senior iraqi official said sunday that 
allegations iraq has taken medical equipment from hospitals in 
occupied kuwait were false 
abduljabbar abdulabbas the iraq official in charge of hospitals 
in kuwait which iraq calls its 19th province told reporters that 
normal services continue at hospitals in the occupied emirate 
although medical equipment exceeds by far the needs of the 
population we did not move any of them to other places said 
abdulabbas a physician who heads baghdads health department he 
spoke during a tour of the main maternity hospital in kuwait 
the iraqi manager of the maternity hospital qais abdulsattar 
said the 500bed hospital is still providing services including 
health care to prematurely born babies who need to be kept in 
incubators 
the united states and the exiled government of kuwait have 
reported that iraq moved medical equipment to iraq including a 
large number of incubators causing the death of some kuwaiti 
babies 
reporters were flown into kuwait and given a tour of the 
hospital sunday in an attempt to dispel these reports 
abdulsattar showed reporters 12 babies in incubators in the main 
intensive care unit of the hospital which is staffed mostly by 
asian and nonkuwaiti arab medical staff 
why should we send incubators to our maternity hospitals in 
iraq we have plenty of them there said abdulsattar who was 
sent from baghdad to run the kuwaiti hospital 
reporters also visited alrazi hospital for bone disease in 
downtown kuwait where about 30 patients were being treated in the 
luxurious 295bed hospital built by the royal family in 1984 
kamal mustafa an egyptian specialist in bone surgery said most 
of the patients are suffering from injuries incurred in industrial 
accidents 
he said he was not considering leaving kuwait where he has 
worked for more than 25 years 
its my sacred duty to be near my patients as long as they 
need me and i am keen not to let them down at this hard time he 
said 
but many of the foreign and nonkuwaiti medical staff in the 14 
kuwaiti hospitals and 35 health centers left the small persian gulf 
state after iraq took over on aug 2 
abdulabbas was asked whether the departure of foreign medical 
staff will have have any adverse effect on health service 
it was extravagance why should a 500bed hospital have 400 
nurses he said 
ali abdulrahim alhawail a kuwaiti neurologist who heads the 
technical section at the newly set up health department agreed 
that the shrinking of the population by more than twothirds makes 
the remaining staff sufficient to run the hospitals and health 
centers 
i dont feel the medical service has been affected but hope 
they will continue with the same standard he said

a daredevil pilot who infuriated french authorities 
two years ago with stunt flights over paris left sunday on a 
private mission to try to liberate french hostages in iraq 
albert maltret 54 captured public attention in the summer of 
1988 when he made noctural flights over rooftops monuments and the 
champselysees in a tiny ultralight aircraft evading authorities 
for weeks 
his flight on sunday was more conventional as a passenger in a 
royal jordanian airways flight to amman jordan from there he 
planned to travel on to baghdad 
iraqi diplomats gave him his airline tickets 
im undertaking this mission on my own its purely 
humanitarian maltret said before leaving 
an estimated 400 french nationals are believed held hostage in 
iraq and occupied kuwait in the wake of the aug 2 iraqi takeover 
in 1988 police staked out airfields for weeks to bring down the 
pilot the press dubbed le baron noir the black baron finally 
captured maltret was fined and lost his pilots license for three 
years 
french authorities briefly jailed him in april for plotting 
physical violence to settle a family quarrel 
two weeks ago he volunteered to go to iraq as a hostage 
mediator he also at one point offered to serve as a mercenary for 
iraq but maltret downplayed that offer on sunday 
my image has been tarnished he said i need to regain 
some credit this mission will help me

would you believe oil prices falling more than 
40 percent next year how about interest rates in the 5 percent 
range by 1992 
probably not but those are only two of the predictions the 
budget writers in washington have manufactured to tout their 500 
billion deficitreduction plan 
all federal budgets are by necessity built on assumptions of 
how the ecoomy will perform because that determines how many 
dollars will flow into the treasury in taxes and flow out for costs 
such as unemployment claims 
but in trying to get the public to accept a huge package of tax 
increases and cuts in federal benefits congress and the white 
house have settled on assumptions that at the least strain 
credulity 
for example 
by the end of 1993 if the budget is passed the nation should 
be enjoying a balanced budget treasury bill rates will be 44 
percent and inflation 3 percent and the economy will be humming 
along with nearly 4 percent annual growth they agree 
from their mouths to gods ears said stan collender a 
budget expert at the accounting firm of price waterhouse who 
predicted the 500 billion in deficit reduction will look more like 
300 billion when reality unfolds 
the rate for 12month treasury bills was 762 percent last week 
the inflation rate soared to 95 percent on an annual basis in 
september up from a 62 percent annual rate in august the economy 
grew at a barely perceptible 04 percent in the second quarter of 
this year down from a 17 percent annual growth rate in the 1st 
quarter and down from a 25 percent annual rate in 1989 
even as congress was struggling to nail down the final deal over 
the weekend government data was emerging that showed the fragility 
of their house of cards 
on thursday the government said the cost of living increase for 
social security and other government entitlements will be 54 
percent in january 
last january the presidents budget assumed it would be just 
39 percent and the figure is nearly a point higher than most 
recent estimates translated into the budget government costs 
increase roughly 2 billion next year and 15 billion over the next 
five years 
budget negotiators have yet to find a source for that 15 
billion 
one of the reasons for the steep consumer price increases is the 
cost of oil which has soared to nearly twice the 2115 average 
assumed for this year the budget predicts it will fall back below 
25 next year and then below 22 the following two years 
oil prices affect the government directly too with military 
and civilian agencies operating huge fleets of airplanes trucks 
cars etc continued high oil prices could add billions more to 
those costs over the next five years 
economic assumptions aside some of the budget is just pretend 
the costs of the persian gulf operations 1 billion a month now 
and many times that if shooting breaks out doesnt get counted 
nor does the huge savings and loan bailout 
and one of the most questionable assumptions in the budget is 
that congress and the administration will abide by its restraints 
on spending 
this package will not have the effect on the deficit that the 
budget summiteers claim said jim miller former director of 
the office of management and budget there are just all sorts of 
loophole ways congress can get away with spending

iraq responding to a request from iran 
appears to have expelled members of a major iranian opposition 
group us officials say 
members of the peoples mujahedeen of iran the largest group 
trying to overthrow the clerical government in tehran have 
apparently started leaving iraq for paris and other european sites 
said the officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
however the assessment from the us officials was strongly 
challenged by mujahedeen spokesman farid soleimani who telephoned 
news agencies to insist that his group remained intact in baghdad 
and elsewhere 
we claim very firmly that none of our members have left 
baghdad involuntarily soleimani said there are comings and 
goings thats natural and it has nothing to do with expulsions 
the reputed explusion move would be in keeping with iraqi 
attempts to end its economic and diplomatic isolation by courting 
iran a onetime enemy with which it fought a disastrous eightyear 
war until 1988 
in recent weeks iraq has ceded many of its war gains sending 
back thousands of war prisoners withdrawing troops from areas it 
captured in the war and agreeing to share sovereignty over the 
strategically important shattalarab waterway 
in return iraq asked for permission to hook into a major 
iranian oil pipeline and circumvent the international naval 
blockade thats preventing the export of its oil the iraqis also 
asked iran for food and medicine 
iran has sent some truckloads of food but has not responded to 
the pipeline request us officials say 
were very watchful of what kind of relations saddam hussein 
is able to establish with iran said cia director william webster 
in an interview this week with the associated press so far iran 
is in a kind of winwin situation 
iran and iraq have restored diplomatic relations and restaffed 
their embassies in each others capitals 
the sense is that with this new understanding between iran and 
iraq an organization like that the pmoi is not welcome there any 
more said another administration official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
irans official news agency irna reported several times last 
month that massoud rajavi the pmois baghdadbased leader had 
asked his people to leave iraq and was himself leaving for germany 
the mujahedeen sent telexes and communiques from baghdad denying 
the reports as garbage allegations designed to discredit and 
destroy the organization 
but pmoi representatives in the united states who used to 
bombard reporters with phone calls interview offers and news 
conferences have all but disappeared in recent weeks repeated 
calls to their officials have not been returned 
the group did hold a news conference at un headquarters last 
wednesday to complain about irans human rights record but the 
officials refused to discuss their relations with baghdad despite 
repeated questioning 
the pmoi is no stranger to expulsions 
rajavi and his supporters fled to paris in 1980 after their 
former allies khomeini and his fundamentalist leadership turned 
on them in a bloody purge of leftists and liberals 
in 1986 france asked the organization to leave its territory 
under pressure from the iranian government and rajavi moved to 
baghdad 
there the pmoi was warmly received and encouraged to form its 
own military force the national liberation army the force 
launched incursions into iranian territory boasting 15000 
fighters but claims of the losses they inflicted on khomeinis 
troops could not be verified and were believed to be exaggerated 
although they continued to enjoy popularity and support in iraq 
the organizations power appeared to wane in recent years 
the pmoi was forced to stop its military activity when iran and 
iraq agreed on a ceasefire in 1988 thousands of its supporters in 
iran have been rounded up and executed 
iraq has expelled iranian opposition groups before the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini spent 15 years exiled in the holy iraqi 
city of najaf but was asked to leave in 1978 during a moment of 
detente in iraqiiranian relations

that it expected up to 40000 foreigners to flee iraq and kuwait 
soon and appealed to world governments for 135 million in 
contributions to repatriate them 
iom estimates that between 25000 and 40000 foreign residents 
of iraq and kuwait remain in need of international repatriation in

the 101st session 
 
budget and taxes 
the house and senate continue their search for a compromise 
deficitreduction package that can be accepted by president bush 
the government is operating on temporary spending authority that 
expires at midnight wednesday by which time both sides hope to 
have a final agreement 
the two sides continued to exchange proposed tax packages on 
sunday but hit a snag late in the day 
final passage is needed as well on the 13 appropriations bills 
financing government agencies in the new budget year which started 
oct 1 
 
artsobscenity 
an 117 billion appropriations bill that would reinstate strict 
antiobscenity restrictions on the national endowment for the arts 
is pending in the senate the bill would trim the agencys 175 
million budget request by 5 million opponents favor a 
houseapproved proposal to let the courts decide whether federally 
subsidized art works are obscene 
 
clean air 
members of a house and senate conference are nearing completion 
on compromise clean air legislation which would be the first major 
rewrite of the federal air pollution law in 13 years 
the conferees tentatively approved provisions sunday to sharply 
reduce pollution that causes acid rain the last major section of 
the 700page bill earlier the conferees tentatively agreed on new 
auto emission requirements to curtail urban smog and on reductions 
in toxic chemical pollution by industry 
several minor issues remained to be worked out by the conferees 
the compromise package also still would have to be approved in both 
the house and senate 
 
child care 
senate leaders and the bush administration have reached 
agreement on the broad outlines of legislation providing assistance 
for lowincome families but major differences with the house 
remain an obstacle to passage 
the latest senate version is a fiveyear 15 billion package 
most of the money would go for an expansion of earned income tax 
credits for lowincome working families with children 
 
assault weapons 
the senate has approved an omnibus anticrime bill that would 
ban the sale of nine semiautomatic assault weapons but the house 
version contains no such provision instead the house may vote on 
a bill to outlaw ownership or sale of semiautomatics the treasury 
department deemed not suitable for sporting purposes the 
politically influential national rifle association opposes both 
bills and house sponsors are clearly nervous over whether their 
measure could survive on the floor at this stage 
 
farm bill 
a compromise 408 billion farm bill covering government 
agriculture programs for the next five years awaits final passage 
by both the house and senate the bill would slash farm spending by 
135 billion over the next five years as part of a larger 
deficitreduction package 
 
usegyptian aid 
forgiveness of 67 billion in past military debt egypt owes the 
united states is part of a 155 billion foreign aid bill pending 
in the senate the move is badly wanted by president bush as a 
reward for the country that has led arab support for the 
multinational military deployment in the persian gulf crisis but 
bush faces a difficult choice over whether to veto the bill because 
it includes a sharp cut in el salvadors military aid that the 
administration strongly opposes 
 
keating investigation 
the senate ethics committee is pressing ahead with its 
investigation of senators who assisted charles h keating jr as 
his lincoln savings and loan was sinking toward collapse 
 
civil rights 
the white house says bush will veto the civil rights act of 
1990 which is aimed at overturning the effects of recent supreme 
court decisions reversing some affirmative action programs a veto 
override attempt could take place in congress once bush has acted

a roman catholic church leader 
on sunday praised us lawmakers decision to cut military aid to 
el salvador saying the reduction could help force both sides to 
end the countrys civil war 
the action on a foreign aid bill reflects the awareness that 
many things are not going well here and should change so that the 
peace process can end this conflict and establish new bases for a 
society in which human dignity is genuinely respected auxiliary 
bishop gregorio rosa chavez said 
peace cannot be built with weapons he told a news 
conference after the sunday homily which the influential 
salvadoran church frequently uses as a platform to speak out 
against human rights abuses and put forth its vision of how to end 
the decadeold civil war 
the senate on friday approved an amendment to halve the 85 
million in military aid to el salvador the us had budgeted for 
the 1991 fiscal year a similar version of the amendment was tacked 
onto a house version of the aid bill 
both bills contain a provision that would restore the aid if the 
rebels pull out of the negotiations or if they launch a major 
offensive another provision would eliminate military aid 
altogether if the government breaks off the talks 
rosa chavez said the senate vote would give more viability to 
the peace process 
so far all the peace negotiating sessions since president 
alfredo cristiani took office in june 1989 have ended in deadlock 
the next meeting between representatives of the two sides and a 
un mediator is to begin nov 4 in mexico 
the government has been demanding that the guerrillas stop 
fighting and participate in the countrys political life 
leaders of the farabundo marti national liberation front rebel 
organization want a political agreement on a number of reforms 
including prosecution of officers responsible for atrocities 
before agreeing to a ceasefire 
many of the wars 73000 victims have been civilians suspected 
of leftist sympathies slain by rightist death squads or the 
military 
congress was probably moved to act by the assassination last 
november of six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her daughter 
soldiers have confessed that they shot the priests on the orders of 
an army commander 
the house and senate bills will have to be reconciled in 
housesenate conference but the provisions are expected to be in 
the final version sent to president bush

prince sultan the saudi defense 
minister said sunday he was troubled by the suffering that trade 
sanctions were causing iraqis but convinced that was a far better 
thing than war 
it causes us deep pain to see the iraqi or any other nation 
facing a worldwide trade embargo the prince said to saudi 
newspaper editors but the premise for the embargo is peace not 
war perhaps it is meant to spare the shedding of iraqi blood 
prince sultan third in the saudi leadership after king fahd and 
crown prince abdullah said the foreign forces amassed following 
the aug 2 invasion of kuwait brought an umbrella of peace 
any solution to the conflict must include an unconditional iraqi 
pullout and the restoration of the alsabah monarchy in kuwait 
sultan said 
he denied any plans to form an arabwestern security alliance in 
the region it is not acceptable that an arab country enters into 
an alliance with a nonarab foreign power he said

gunmen burst into the home of a top 
supporter of christian gen michel aoun sunday and shot him his 
wife and two sons to death police said only an 11monthold girl 
survived 
the daybreak massacre of dany chamoun and his family in their 
suburban beirut apartment came a week after a syrian and lebanese 
government troops crushed aouns mutiny in lebanons christian 
enclave 
chamoun a maronite catholic and the son of late president 
camille chamoun was one of the most outspoken critics of president 
elias hrawi and syrias military presence in lebanon 
he also was at odds with christian warlord samir geagea whose 
lebanese forces militia fought a fourmonth war with aouns troops 
early this year for mastery of the christian areas of east beirut 
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the slayings 
which were branded by christian and moslem leaders alike as an 
attempt to block a plan to end the 15yearold civil war 
aoun took refuge a week ago in the french embassy france has 
granted him asylum but the lebanese government insists he stay and 
stand trial for alleged crimes including the theft of 75 million 
from the state treasury 
five uniformed gunmen using silencerequipped 9mm pistols 
riddled chamoun 56 his wife ingrid abdelnoor 35 and their 
sons tarek 7 and julien 5 with bullets according to police 
they said the 5yearold was taken to a nearby hospital and died 
a short time later of the family only chamouns daughter tamara 
escaped unharmed 
reporters saw the baby being cradled by her weeping lebanese 
governess at the apartment in baabda east of beirut 
i am shocked by the horrific slayings hrawi was quoted by 
several beirut radio stations as saying thats a crime against 
the state aimed at sabotaging efforts to reunite the country and 
army after aouns ouster 
radios said hrawi made the comment in damascus where he is 
talking with syrian president hafez assad on how to enforce an arab 
leaguebrokered plan aimed at ending the civil war between moslems 
and christians 
we have declared that the peace process is open to all to join 
after the end of aouns mutiny and that we should bury the past and 
begin a new era of fraternity hrawi was quoted as saying 
todays crime is a stab in the back 
in paris foreign minister roland dumas expressed horror at the 
slayings 
dany chamoun had opened a perspective toward reconciliation in 
lebanon dumas said its this chance they wanted to 
assassinate 
guards had been assigned to protect the chamoun family around 
the clock the assailants arrived at 6 am as the guards were 
changing shifts police said 
the assailants snuck in at the moment of change and forced the 
janitor at gunpoint to climb five flights of stairs to chamouns 
apartment said a police spokesman 
the governess answered a knock at the door and the assailants 
burst in firing instantly killing chamoun and his wife police 
said 
the gunmen then shot the two sleeping sons in bed in an 
adjacent bedroom said the spokesman who could not be named 
under regulations 
the governess who was uninjured gave police an account of the 
attack a family maid was also uninjured chamouns hunting dog was 
found whimpering over the bodies when rescuers arrived 
the britisheducated chamoun made his political debut soon after 
the outbreak of lebanons civil war in 1975 he was appointed 
secretary of defense of his fathers rightist christian national 
liberal party and commander of the partys tigers militia 
chamoun forged friendships with druse warlord walid jumblatt and 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafats security 
chief ali hassan salameh who was assassinated in moslem west 
beirut in 1979 
these friendships helped free scores of kidnap victims in 
beiruts moslem and christian sectors during the conflict 
chamoun who loved hunting sports cars and scubadiving 
often advocated diplomacy over the gunbarrel 
politics sucked him in although he hated politics said his 
former aide rudolf paulikevitch 
chamoun inherited the leadership of the christian national 
liberal party upon the 1987 death of his father who ruled lebanon 
from 1952 to 1958 
chamoun sought the presidency in 1988 but the parliament was 
unable to meet to elect a successor and aoun who then was army 
commander was named prime minister of a caretaker military 
cabinet 
hrawi was elected as the new president on nov 24 1989 but 
aoun rejected the election and called hrawi a syrian puppet 
aoun contended that his threeman cabinet remained the only 
legitimate authority in the country 
hrawi aoun and chamoun are maronites the largest christian 
sect and the dominant power in lebanon since it gained independence 
from france in 1943 
the syrian army entered the country in 1976 under an arab league 
mandate to smother the civil war now in its 16th year the syrians 
currently maintain 40000 troops controlling more than 70 percent 
of lebanons territory 
chamoun was dismayed when aoun fled his command headquarters in 
the presidential palace in baabda minutes after the airsupported 
attack of hrawis troops and the syrian army began oct 13 
i cant believe the general has done this to us chamoun 
said the next day may god help us 
chamouns first wife patti morgan an australianborn former 
fashion model lives in london with their daughter tracy 30 
family friends said

military rebels claim they are 
forming links with communists and other disaffected groups and 
planning a big bang to oust president corazon aquino before her 
term ends in 1992 
renegade maj abraham purugganan made the claim during a 
clandestine interview with filipino reporters last saturday by 
agreement of the reporters the interview was made public monday 
purugganan sought by the government for his role in a coup 
attempt last december said a new coalition the democratic front 
for filipinism would seek to launch a nationalist revolution 
to oust mrs aquino and establish a federal system of government 
with a unicameral legislature 
the philippines currently has a centralized system of government 
with a bicameral assembly 
definitely we will be moving fast before 1992 purugganan 
said we will just have one big bang 
purugganan said the alliance was formed oct 17 during a secret 
conclave in which a civilian with the pseudonym felix servando was 
named chairman 
the alliance includes the young officers union a military 
faction linked to the december coup attempt and members of various 
communist organizations 
mrs aquino has survived seven military revolts since she took 
power in the february 1986 people power revolution that toppled 
the late president ferdinand marcos 
in the most recent attempt military rebels led by col 
alexander noble seized military camps in two cities on the 
southernmost island of mindanao on oct 4 but surrendered two days 
later 
purugganan described nobles move as a tactical blunder but 
said it did not invalidate the rebel strategy of seeking to promote 
a series of uprisings that would inspire civilian support for the 
rebels

a fierce wind early sunday spread a 
500acre wildfire through parts of the san bernardino national 
forest but firefighters began to gain on the blaze later in the 
day when the wind ebbed 
the fire which began saturday night burned through brush and 
timber in the western part of the forest said hal seyden of the 
us forest service the cause of the blaze in an area ravaged by 
fire two years ago was unknown 
two firefighters suffered minor injuries and a house caught fire 
in the simi valley seyden said 
the blaze began in rugged lytle creek canyon and burned up 
5000foot san sevine ridge he said 
officials initially estimated that the fire had spread over as 
much as 2000 acres but later downgraded that figure to 500 acres 
said bill rolls of the us forest service 
blustery santa ana winds up to 50 mph roared through the 
mountain canyons pushing the fire through hundreds of acres 
overnight and grounding aircraft forcing crews to chop fire lines 
by hand 
by afternoon the winds had dropped and were helping contain the 
fire by pushing the fire back on itself earlier waterdropping 
helicopters and air tankers carrying fireretardant were aloft on 
bombardment missions 
the blaze halted its sluggish southern advance toward the towns 
of rialto fontana and rancho cucamonga 
thick smoke from the blaze 60 miles northeast of downtown los 
angeles could be seen on the beach in santa monica ash fell over 
parts of fontana some 10 miles south of the fire line

edge which was feeding on heavy droughtstricken brush and 
timber 
dirt roads rutted by recent rains were being widened and graded 
to help firefighters who worked mostly by hand said mary bowman 
of the forest service 
we have a lot of archaeological finds and they dont want to 
put the bulldozers up there unless they have to bowman said 
you see pottery shards arrowheads stuff like that we want to 
be careful 
the fire was burning partially in an area destroyed by a 
september and october 1988 fire that burned 5160 acres of national

former british prime minister edward heath 
said sunday he had won agreement from iraqi president saddam 
hussein for the release of sick and elderly british hostages 
during a threehour meeting saddam agreed to release an 
unspecified number of britons heath said adding he did not know 
exactly how many would be released they were to fly out of baghdad 
on tuesday heath said 
at this moment his staff and mine are discussing lists of 
names of possible people who will return to britain so therefore i 
cant tell you or anybody else of particular names heath said 
when he flew to baghdad on saturday the 74yearold expremier 
said he was on a private mission to win release of 53 british 
hostages identified as ailing or elderly he met with iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz saturday 
asked about the rest of the estimated 1400 britons who are 
trapped in iraq and kuwait heath said i dont think progress 
will be made there until there is a removal of fear of lightning 
attack by the americans or anybody else particularly the 
americans 
thousands of westerners are being held in iraq at strategic 
locations to deter a possible attack by the usled multinational 
forces 
heath said saddam placed very considerable emphasis on 
diplomatic action in the crisis in order to achieve a stable middle 
east 
saddam recognizes its intense danger and the disastrous effect 
warfare could have on the whole region and the crisis can have on 
the world economy heath said 
heaths trip has drawn fire in britain where the government has 
refused negotiations with saddam as long as he holds westerners 
hostage 
every hint that the west is prepared somehow to do deals or to 
move away from unconditional and immediate withdrawal is succor to 
baghdad said david howell a conservative member of parliament 
and chairman of the foreign affairs select committee 
but foreign secretary douglas hurd also speaking on bbc radio 
sunday said if heath succeeds in getting hostages freed i think 
everybody would be glad 
hes made it clear his mission is humanitarian that hes not 
speaking or negotiating or acting on behalf of the government

skid row liquor stores have thwarted a 
yearold effort to curb sales of cheap potent wine favored by 
street drunks 
los angeles county supervisor ed edelman proposed in september 
1989 that winemakers voluntarily stop selling such wines on skid 
row to combat alcoholism but many liquor store owners said the 
idea was a waste of time 
theyd just drink something else said jack simone owner of 
jacks market all this hullabaloo about alcohol being the 
menace when it is really crack cocaine 
a pint bottle of the wine sells for around 175 and is 18 
percent alcohol 
eampj gallo winery of california and canandaigua wine co of new 
york two of the nations largest producers of cheap wines agreed 
to halt sales to skid rows around the country 
the voluntary ban in los angeles was based on a similar program 
in san franciscos tenderloin district 
the ban has been a complete joke said mike neely director 
of the homeless outreach project the price went up thats about 
all that happened 
a consulting company found that in los angeles county at least 
the overall availability of fortified wines in general does not 
appear to have changed substantially 
many stores apparently stockpiled the wine anticipating the ban 
said virginia mclain rusk of the ernst amp young 
edelman said he favors a mandatory ban if the voluntary effort 
fails but neely said the best way to fight skid row alcoholism is 
to provide more counseling and treatment programs 
banning alcohol is not the solution said neely they 
tried that during prohibition what makes them think it will work 
in the 1990s

the colombian government plans to 
increase incentives for petroleum and gas exploration by foreign 
companies president cesar gaviria said 
the government will begin a rapid evaluation of the changes 
necessary to make exploration of inactive areas more 
attractive gaviria said saturday while inaugurating a new gas 
pipeline in central colombia 
gaviria did not specify what types of changes the government was 
considering the presidents comments were reported sunday by local 
news media 
current government contracts assign oil exploration to several 
multinational companies operating in colombia if petroleum 
deposites are discovered the government and the foreign companies 
share the cost of developing them 
colombia receives 60 percent of the petroleum produced while the 
foreign companies take the remaining 40 percent and pay taxes on 
their earnings 
the companies are pushing for a better deal because of the high 
risks involved in searching for petroleum in colombia 
one of the countrys leftist guerrilla groups the national 
liberation army or eln has repeatedly sabotaged oil facilities 
and kidnapped employees of foreign petroleum companies 
gaviria said saturday that the rebels should abandon the 
campaign and participae in next years assembly to rewrite 
colombias constitution and reform its democracy 
attacks by the rebels on petroleum facilities have caused 520 
million in losses and have produced a steep drop in exploration
