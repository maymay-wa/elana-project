hurricane lili and the remains of tropical storm marco locked 
pincers on the south on friday with a combination of powerful 
winds heavy surf and drenching rains at least 10 people have died 
in the storms 
lili lurked off the shore of north carolina a weakling among 
hurricanes spinning harmless 8foot waves into the outer banks 
its winds were clocked at 75 mph barely over the hurricane 
threshhold of 74 mph 
but the convergence of lili and marco plus the dying remnants 
of tropical storm klaus brought a third day of rain and dangerous 
flooding to parts of the coastal southeast 
we got so much rain so fast weve never had anything 
like this said pam smith director of the richmond county 
emergency management agency in augusta ga whose west side was 
swamped by floodwaters 
in south carolina where floods thursday carried caskets out of 
a graveyard state climatologist john purvis said some places had 
the most rainfall in a century 
at the national hurricane center in coral gables fla

projected to parallel the coast a little farther out

banks although the most noticeable signs of the storm were waves 
big enough to thrill surfers

sherer 18 of coinjock nc who was riding a skim board on the 
waves theyre sort of worried 
worried were going to get hurt added 16yearold mike 
vernon of currituck nc 
the real danger for the time being lay farther south in 
georgia where four people drowned in rising floodwaters that 
ravaged the augusta area the floods were blamed on the remnants of 
tropical storm marco which blew north out of the gulf of mexico on 
thursday 
the victims included an 80yearold man who drowned as he and 
his wife struggled to leave their car at a flooded railroad track 
north of augusta coroner thomas king said the man was swept away

in their homes people are hollering out for help through their 
windows some are on the rooftops there are people in their cars 
floating down the road 
emergency officials began evacuating families in the augusta 
area early friday morning

like an old ghost in a new house erich honecker 
is haunting the reunited germans 
toppled from power a year ago the 78yearold former communist 
chief is confined to a soviet military hospital near berlin 
guarded by stonefaced soldiers 
his health is the topic of nearly daily news reports some 
saying the ousted east german leader who is suffering from kidney 
cancer is well enough to be imprisoned and others saying he is 
not 
as germans forge their new country many are demanding 
punishment for despised members of the east berlin regime that ran 
the country into the ground honecker tops the list 
i think most germans would like to see honecker go before a 
court said a spokeswoman for berlins justice department jutta 
burghart 
prosecutors have had plenty of opportunity to bring honecker to 
trial having conducted investigations of deadly shootings at the 
berlin wall economic crimes and the harboring of terrorists during 
his government 
berlins chief justice jutta limbach hopes to decide within 
a few weeks whether there is enough evidence to arrest the small 
slight man with steely eyes and a ramrodstraight posture 
even if the answer is yes doctors will have to decide whether 
honecker is well enough to stand the rigors of germanys customary 
pretrial detention 
any resulting indictment trial and appeal could take years 
all of this will keep honeckers despised legacy alive almost 
indefinitely 
on thursday prosecutors in formerly communist east berlin 
handed their western counterparts the files from the investigations 
of honecker and his cohorts 
the honecker files alone take up about 400 thick spiral ring 
binders and a series of supplementary documents officials 
said 
their work has been hampered by the disarray of the documents 
while berlin officials look into the notorious shoottokill 
orders and economic crimes a local prosecutor in the southwestern 
city of karlsruhe is pursuing his own investigation 
gerhard klass has accused honecker of obstruction of justice for 
giving a safe haven to west germanys most notorious terrorists 
germans are still furious that honecker welcomed members of the 
leftist red army faction and reportedly provided homes to middle 
east terrorists as well 
there is a good chance the two criminal investigations will be 
merged 
doctors in the former east germany say honecker cant stand the 
rigors of prison he spent one night in a crumbling filthy jail 
last january 
officials in the nowextinct country said it would have been an 
injustice to put the aging exdictator on trial during east 
germanys brief existence as a democracy 
but those determinations will be reviewed by the new panels of 
legal and medical experts 
honeckers 82yearold former secret police chief erich mielke 
is already in prison and targeted for the same berlin investigation 
aimed at his boss 
a full color photo spread in this weeks stern magazine 
documented the ailing mielkes ambulance ride from an east berlin 
jail to one in the west 
will honecker ever stand before a judge ready to defend his 18 
hardline years in power or his masterminding of the berlin wall 
construction in 1961 
that will depend on the people who make the decision on his 
health condition prosecutor klass said 
germanys news media have been following every twist and turn in 
the case 
two days before the oct 3 unification the masscirculation 
bild newspaper ran a frontpage picture of honecker walking 
jauntily and unaided near the soviet hospital in beelitz 
bilds blaring headline honecker really too sick for the 
clink 
one open question is the ability of germans to get their hands 
on honecker anytime soon since he is in a soviet compound 
prosecutor klass jokingly says the soviets could complicate 
things by declaring honecker an honorary colonel in the red 
army in an attempt to put him beyond the reach of german law

legislation approved by the senate would bar 
teenage girls from obtaining abortions at most hospitals unless at 
least one of their parents was informed 
the requirement which still must go to the house would cover 
teenage girls under the age of 18 who seek abortions at any 
hospital that receives federal money 
that covers virtually all hospitals particularly public ones 
but abortions without notice still might be available at privately 
run clinics that shun federal dollars 
if enacted the provision would be the first federal requirement 
that parents be involved in abortion decisions by young people 
many states have passed laws requiring notice or consent by a 
parent or parents but some of them have been invalidated by court 
decisions 
the senate approved the parental notice provision friday as an 
amendment to a big appropriations billcovering the departments of 
health and human services labor and education 
the notice requirement was sponsored by sen william armstrong 
rcolo a fierce abortion opponent it passed on a voice vote but 
only after opponents failed on a 4848 tie vote to table or kill 
the measure 
the bill was approved on a 7615 vote it goes back to the 
house and probably will be sent to a conference committee to work 
out differences on the notification provision and other amendments 
sen tom harkin diowa who led the fight against the 
provision argued that it was probably unconstitutional he said it 
lackdd a socalled judicial bypass that would allow an incest 
victim or others unable to discuss the subject with parents to 
seek a courts permission to obtain an abortion without notifying 
one of her parents 
this is just too too rigid harkin said 
armstrongs amendment was added to a provision banning medicaid 
abortions for poor women except when the life of the mother is 
threatened or in cases of rape or incest 
president bush vetoed a similar spending bill last year because 
he opposed allowing medicaid abortions in any cases other than when 
the mothers life is in danger 
that abortion language has been the object of yearly 
congressional battles abortion rights supporters won house passage 
of the broader exemption for the first time last year then fell 51 
votes short of overriding bushs veto 
the senates latest version covering spending in fiscal 1991 
would allow federal money for abortions in cases of rape and incest 
that were reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public 
health service 
harkins support for abortion rights is an issue in his 
reelection battle this year against antiabortion republican rep 
tom tauke 
armstrong who is retiring from the senate after this year 
argued that abortion was an extremely cruel barbaric practice 
and intolerable in a civilized society he acknowledged that 
others disagree 
i dont think young women should have an abortion without the 
permission of one parent armstrong said he stressed that his 
provision requires notice not consent of one parent 
harkin said the effect would be to require notification for poor 
girls who cant afford private clinics while permitting the 
affluent to escape the restriction 
what this amendment provides is a twoclass system harkin 
said the end result of this amendment is very cold and very 
heartless 
the bill provides 183 billion in spending in fiscal 1991 for 
hhs as well as the departments of labor and education 
it includes money to partially fund a bill approved earlier this 
year to increase spending to combat aids and authorizing direct 
assistance to cities hardest hit by the disease 
the senate tabled a pair of amendments sponsored by sen jesse 
helms rnc that would have cut aids spending 
a measure adopted earlier this year authorized 600 million a 
year in aids spending but because of the budget problem the 
spending bill trimmed that figure to 159 million in fiscal 1991 
and earmarks 441 million for the following year

lawmakers are voicing concern that the level 
of military spending approved by congress in its budget resolution 
is too high for a nation facing an economic crisis 
this isnt about a war with the russians this isnt about a 
war in the middle east this is about the economic survival of this 
country said rep george miller dcalif prior to house 
approval friday of a 268 billion defense bill 
by a vote of 32297 the house adopted a military spending bill 
that cuts off production of the b2 bomber at 15 planes and slashes 
president bushs budget request for the strategic defense 
initiative 
the house bill meets the level of defense spending worked out by 
the house and senate last week in a budget resolution seeking to 
cut 500 billion from the federal deficit over the next five years 
final passage of the house measure didnt come however without 
a stiff challenge to the spending level for the fiscal year that 
began oct 1 
earlier this week the house appropriations committee added a 
53 billion package to the bill to meet the revised budget levels 
approved by congress 
liberal democrats and a handful of republicans sought to 
eliminate the addition with a measure imposing a 2 percent 
acrosstheboard cut on defense spending 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said the 
levels set in the congressionally approved budget resolution were 
ceilings not floors on spending we can achieve better 
savings he said 
rep john murtha dpa chairman of the appropriations 
subcommittee on defense warned that the cut would affect american 
men and women who are stationed in the persian gulf region to stop 
iraqi aggression 
although the bill does not specifically address the cost of 
operation desert shield expected to total 15 billion in fiscal 
1991 sea lifts and projects such as the m1 tank are key to the 
us buildup in the gulf 
anybody who thinks this does not affect them is wrong 
murtha said 
the amendment to impose a 2 percent cut failed on a 215201 
vote 
following house approval in september of a defense authorization 
bill that set spending ceilings the legislation approved friday 
cuts bushs proposal for sdi to 23 billion he had requested 47 
billion 
the appropriations bill provides no production money for the 
pentagons plan to place mx nuclear missiles on railroad cars 
instead the bill creates provides 618 million for the mx and 
midgetman landbased missiles 
the spending plan calls for a cut of 77000 us troops 
worldwide the bush administration has proposed a cut of 38000 
from the active duty troop total of 21 million 
the senate is expected to take up its version of the 
appropriations bill next week the package approved by the senate 
appropriations committee late thursday is markedly different from 
the houseapproved legislation 
the senate committee bill trims about 1 billion from bushs 
budget request for sdi funds the presidents request for the b2 
bomber and cuts us troop strength by 100000 
white house officials have said bush would veto the housepassed 
bill because of its wholesale cuts in his budget request for 
strategic weapons

principle to form a single team for the 1992 olympics and other 
international sports events news reports said saturday 
the national yonhap news agency said in a dispatch from 
pyongyang the north korean capital that the agreement was reached 
between south korean sports minister chung dongsung and his north 
korean counterpart kim yu sun on friday

for the 1992 olympics in barcelona and the 41st world tabletennis 
championships in nagoya japan in 1991 it said 
chung visited communist north korea at the head of a south 
korean soccer team which had an exhibition match in the norths 
capital of pyongyang on thursday it marked the first sports 
exchange between the two rival korean states 
chung and the south korean soccer team returned home saturday 
through the border village of panmunjom ending a fiveday trip to 
the north 
the two koreas bitter rivals since the division of their 
peninsula in 1945 have initiated talks on forming a single sports 
team several times in the past but failed to reach agreement over 
procedural and other matters 
the friendly soccer match came several days before the prime 
ministers of both koreas are to meet in pyongyang in a second round 
of talks the two ministers met in seoul early last month in the 
highest talks ever between the rival nations 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
the capitalist south at the end of world war ii in 1945 they 
technically still remain at war since no peace treaty has been 
signed since the 195053 korean war

planning a practice assault on the arabian coast soon as a trial 
run for a possible us invasion of kuwait 
in its last official count of us forces in the gulf area the

the senate finance committee approved a 
bipartisan budget package early saturday that would double gasoline 
taxes and do nothing about tax rates on high incomes or capital 
gains 
the plan was approved on a 155 vote shortly after it was 
endorsed by leaders of both parties it is one of the more 
middleoftheroad budget packages of the several circulating on 
capitol hill 
i believe it is a fair compromise said senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine 
the plan would raise the federal gasoline tax from 9 cents per 
gallon to 185 cents in three steps by 1992 raising 43 billion 
over five years 
nine democrats and six republicans voted for the plan while two 
democrats and three republicans opposed it the vote occurred 
shortly after midnight 
house democrats were lining up behind a soaktherich 
deficitreduction plan that also would cut capital gains taxes for 
middleincome families house republicans were drafting a rival 
plan of their own 
the house democrats plan put them at odds with president bush 
who has said he would accept such a trade only if taxes on the 
wealthiest americans were raised less and capitalgains rates cut 
more than the democrats are proposing 
an administration official following developments speaking on 
condition that his name not be used said bush could support the 
senate committee plan 
the senate finance committee plan would reduce medicare spending 
by 49 billion over the period of that 176 billion would come 
from increasing costs to the elderly and disabled in the program 
an example of one higher cost would be a doubling of the 75 
annual deductible for physicians fees to 150 next year 
information made available by the source who provided details 
did not include a total amount to be achieved for budget deficit 
reduction through higher taxes and spending cuts 
like other plans the senate finance committee package would 
raise taxes on cigarettes by 8 cents to 24 cents a pack by 1993 on 
liquor by 120 to 1370 per gallon on a sixpack of beer by 16 
cents to 32 cents on table win by 3 cents per bottle to 21 cents 
people earning more than 100000 would be ableonly 95 
percent of tax deductions they would otherwise get and wages 
subject to the 145 percent tax for medicare levied in the social 
security payroll tax would rise from 51300 to 89000 
the package also include 294 billion worth of tax breaks the 
bulk of them 168 billion for the poor through an increase in 
the earned income tax credit most of the rest appeared to be for 
business 
the new plan by the house democrats also would raise money by 
delaying taxpayers protection against bracket creep for a 
year however unlike other plans under consideration it would 
include no increase in the tax on gasoline 
meanwhile republican house members squabbled among themselves 
as they tried to come up with their own plan to find before next 
fridays deadline 500 billion in spending cuts and tax increases 
to reduce the federal deficit over the next five years 
bush seemingly unruffled as frustration grew on capitol hill 
said he was confident a sound budget agreement could be found 
just stay calm it will all work out he said 
bush said thursday he would accept an increase from 28 percent 
to 31 percent in the tax rate of the highestincome americans in 
return for a deep cut in the rate on capital gains from sales of 
stock real estate and other investments but he also said he 
didnt think congress would pass such a bill and he declared he 
would not accept the 33 percent top rate the house democrats 
propose 
republican members of the house were divided over whether to 
fight any kind of tax increase or support bushs call for a 
deficitcutting plan that includes some sort of higher taxes there 
was no conclusion but the antitax group seemed to carry the day 
were developing a house republican position said rep 
mickey edwards rokla were not stating the position of the 
president nor are we stating what we think democrats would vote 
for 
gop leaders were trying to piece a measure together arguing 
that republicans need to unite around a proposal but many 
conservatives were insisting that unless the plan reflected bedrock 
republican principles such as no tax increases of any kind it 
would be better to present nothing 
if the alternative is going down in flames anyway we ought to 
put out a republican progrowth antitax agenda not something 
like rostenkowski with a few less taxes said rep tom delay 
rtexas 
the heart of a gop plan under consideration would cut 
capitalgains taxes and raise tax rates on the wealthy but still 
produce a tax cut for the typical person with income above 200000 
a year 
a surprise entry in the liberal proposal is a provision to forgo 
next years inflation adjustment to tax brackets this would affect 
taxpayers at all income levels costing them 175 billion over the 
next five years 
the adjustment is designed to offset bracket creep under which 
inflation gradually pushes people into higher tax brackets when 
they get costofliving pay raises the annual adjustment in the 
personal exemption also would be foregone but the standard 
deduction would be increased as usual 
delaying bracketcreep protection allowed backers of the liberal 
plan to eliminate a proposed 12centagallon increase in gasoline 
taxes 
the liberal plan would raise taxes 160 billion over the next 
five years and reap 43 billion in savings from the medicare 
program only 10 billion of that medicare saving would come from 
beneficiaries 
well over half the tax increases in that proposal would come 
from higherincome individuals the biggest shot raising the 
maximum tax rate on the wealthiest people from 28 percent to 33 
percent the higher rate already is paid by some 
uppermiddleincome people 
people with incomes over 1 million a year would face a 10 
percent surtax 
also workers would have to pay the 145 percent medicare tax on 
their first 100000 of wages rather than 51300 under current 
law 
to encourage saving the plan would allow a person 25 or older 
to escape taxation on half of 200000 of certain capital gains in 
a lifetime these gains could include profits from the sale of such 
investments as real estate small businesses and timber but not 
corporate stock 
in addition a person with income up to 150000 could exclude 
another 1000 of such gains each year 
other parts of the democratic alternative include increased 
taxes on alcoholic beverages such as doubling the 16cent tax on a 
sixpack of beer adding 8 cents to the cigarette tax doubling the 
gasguzzler tax on new cars and requiring state and local 
government employees not covered by a public pension plan to join 
the social security system

the senate in a sign of growing discontent 
with americas proxy wars around the world has approved a 20 
million program for cambodia designed to supplant the bush 
administrations covert aid to cambodian rebels 
it is healthy for us to provide this aid in this form 
said senate intelligence committee chairman david boren dokla 
this is a policy question that should not be discussed behind 
closed doors boren said as the senate adopted the program as 
part of a 1991 foreign aid bill late friday it gives us an 
opportunity to involve the american people in an open public 
discussion of this matter 
borens committee voted in june to kill the 13 million us 
covert aid program that has provided military support for the 
noncommunist resistance groups fighting the vietnamesebacked 
communist government in phnom penh 
the noncommunist groups are fighting alongside the forces of 
the khmer rouge the infamous faction that was responsible for the 
deaths of more than a million cambodians during its fouryear rule 
in the late 1970s 
while us law bars the use of any aid to help the khmer rouge 
opponents of administration policy have charged that american 
dollars are in fact doing just that and boren alluded to the 
problem in supporting a policy change 
there is a strong likelihood that in the past some of the 
funds from the united states may have been used directly or 
indirectly to benefit the khmer rouge he said its time we 
had restrictions that are enforceable 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine disclosed that 
the united states has provided some 200 tons of excess pentagon 
supplies to the resistance since 1987 and noted that audits are 
unable to trace the supplies to their ultimate users 
there is an urgent need to improve accountability for us 
funds mitchell said 
the housepassed version of the foreign aid bill includes only 
7 million in humanitarian aid to the resistance the amendment the 
senate adopted friday apparently combines that amount with the 13 
million that had previously been provided secretly and converts it 
into a broader program of aid and development 
instead of being intended primarily to supplement us military 
aid the new program would be designed to reinforce diplomatic 
efforts now being led by the united nations mitchell said this 
aid program will demonstrate the united states commitment to a 
political process 
differences between the two versions still must be worked out 
after the senate bill wins final passage probably sometime next 
week 
this is a step in the right direction boren said it in 
no way turns our backs on the noncommunist resistance it opens 
the doors to the possibility that we might provide support for a 
broader spectrum of cambodian society in need 
sen john danforth rmo reminded senators of the horrors many 
fear if the khmer rouge now the strongest militarily of the rebel 
factions ride us aid back into power 
this is the killing fields danforth said the khmer rouge 
are still an active organization with pol pot their ruthless 
leader still in control and their methods if anything have 
become more sophisticated in their evil 
defection from the administrations policy was yet another 
example of discomfort on capitol hill with us support for covert 
wars waged by rebel groups in cambodia afghanistan and angola 
at the same time it eliminated the covert money for cambodian 
rebels the senate voted to cut about 100 million off the 
administrations 300 million request for the mujaheddin the 
rebels fighting afghanistans sovietinstalled government and an 
open debate is expected next week in the house about the 60 
million covert aid program for unita the guerilla movement 
fighting angolas marxist government 
with relations with the soviet union improving much of the cold 
war rationale has disappeared for the conflicts reducing them to 
the status of small regional wars and lessening their importance to 
members of congress

a university professor says he has 
solved the wherewazit mystery of christopher columbus first 
step in the new world now comes the hard part convincing other 
historians 
after four years of research john winslow says columbus came 
ashore 498 years ago friday at lignum vitae cay part of the berry 
islands in the northern bahamas east of miami 
historians agree columbus landed somewhere in the bahamas on 
oct 12 1492 during his first voyage to the new world but in the 
past 200 years nine other islands have been proposed as the 
landing site 
you know what a whodunit is this has been a wherewazit 
winslow said 
winslow who specializes in historical geography says he grew 
interested in the explorers landfall in 1986 when he was an 
assistant chairman of social sciences at the college of the 
bahamas 
he read theories on the two most accepted locations san 
salvador formerly named watlings island and samana cay but said 
they did not adequately fit descriptions in columbus diario of 
the voyage 
columbus original diary has been lost a 1530s transcription 
remains through the years it has been translated various times 
and at points is contradictory and vague 
winslow said he developed his theory on details from the journal 
and other historical writings 
he said freshly cut branches columbus reported seeing shortly 
before the land sighting would have been caught in the antilles 
current if they came from the bahamas and disproves the two 
accepted landfall sites 
its impossible for samana cay and san salvador because of 
their location the driftwood would have been on the other side of 
the current he said 
winslow said his is the only theory that places columbus stop 
in cuba at an area that matches the geographic descriptions 
reported in his diary 
im convinced that winslow is an outstanding scholar and 
thorough researcher said george daniels chairman of the 
department of history at the university of south alabama if he 
believes he knows the correct route of columbus he has good reason 
to believe that 
winslow has to convince others who have spent years researching 
their own theories and governments who have millions of tourism 
dollars at stake 
this week the landfall debate continues in jamaica where the 
society for the history of discoveries is holding its annual 
meeting the society which specializes in the history of 
geographic exploration does not endorse any theory 
i rather doubt that the landfall issue will be resolved to 
the satisfaction of everyone said john parker a longtime 
society member and curator of the james ford bell library at the 
university of minnesota it will be resolved to the satisfaction 
of some people but the contention will continue

the assassins bullet and other forms of 
political violence have been frequent methods of protest in egypt 
this century 
mostly the mayhem has been in the cause of egyptian and arab 
nationalism or islamic extremism moslem fanatics fired the bullets 
that killed president anwar sadat and seven people with him on a 
military reviewing stand in 1981 
since 1910 when a nationalist murdered prime minister butros 
pacha ghali violence motivated by politics has killed at least 30 
government ministers prominent egyptians and britons and ordinary 
civilians 
in 1985 a crazed egyptian border police sergeant in the sinai 
slayed four israeli children and three adults because he said they 
spied for their government 
egyptian authorities said the latest slaying the death friday 
of the parliament speaker on a cairo street could have been 
perpetrated either by nationalists or religious zealots 
the persian gulf crisis also could have been the motivation 
because egypt led arab opposition to iraqs takeover of kuwait 
authorities say iraqi agents sent to cause turmoil could have 
killed rifaat elmahgoub speaker of the peoples assembly and 
second to president hosni mubarak in the official hierarchy and 
four security men 
one possibility is an outside operation but the gangs for 
these operations are under control said interior minister 
abdelhalim moussa 
but when moussa reported last week the arrest of more than 35 
alleged terrorists sent by iraq to assassinate and cause general 
unrest he admitted that others remained on the loose he said they 
would be caught but no further arrests have been announced 
the four assailants who rode by on motorbikes when they killed 
elmahgoub also could have been our brothers of the gamaat 
moussa said the word arabic for groups denotes 
violenceprone moslem activist organizations 
it would be a great improvement in their effectiveness as 
terrorists compared with other outings in recent years 
moslem extremists were blamed for a bomb ambush last year that 
missed theninterior minister zaki badr they shot at two former 
interior ministers and a government magazine editor in 1987 only 
former minister abu basha was hurt seriously 
moussa did not mention a third possibility egypts revolution 
the government claims to have destroyed that arab nationalist 
group but the attack had some hallmarks of four of the groups 
actions in the mid1980s that killed two israelis and left six 
israeli and american diplomats wounded 
it also resembled in several ways an assault on an israeli tour 
bus last february by men speaking arabic with palestinian accents 
nine people were killed 
a roster of the centurys assassination victims in egypt shows a 
diverse group 
sixteen israelis they included people on the tour bus and two 
staff members of israels cairo embassy the jewish states only 
one in an arab country 
two british diplomats sir lee stack governorgeneral of 
sudan shot down by an egyptian nationalist in 1924 with egypts 
army commander and lord moyne of the wealthy irish guinness 
brewing clan by jewish terrorists in 1944 
prime minister ghali and two other officials were shot for 
collaborating with egypts british occupiers in the first half of 
the century 
in 1948 prime minister mustafa elnokrashy who doubled as 
interior minister fell to an assassins bullet while waiting for 
an elevator in the interior ministry 
the fundamentalist moslem brotherhood founded 20 years earlier 
in egypt was blamed 
in 1954 brotherhood member mahmoud abdellatif fired at gamal 
abdel nasser republican egypts first president as he spoke from 
the same alexandria balcony where two years later he would proclaim 
nationalization of the suez canal 
the fusillade missed nasser incensed banned the organization 
had six members executed and arrested thousands many of whom were 
tortured

vice president dan quayle said public 
resentment of government may lead to limits on the terms of members 
of congress 
oklahomas vote last month to put 12year limits on state 
legislative terms was just the beginning quayle said in a speech 
friday to the society of professional journalists 
similar ballot initiatives in colorado and california are 
expected to pass next month quayle said 
clearly term limitation is an idea whose time has come it 
reflects a widespread condemnation of the current system people 
rightfully feel that entrenched legislators are only interested in 
getting elected the vice president said 
i dont think that the movement to limit terms will stop at 
the state level i wouldnt be surprised to see americans calling 
to limit terms of the members of the us house of representatives 
and the united states senate and i hope they do he said 
quayle spoke scathingly of congress where he spent 12 years 
representing indiana in the house and senate the administration 
has been trying to portray congress as the obstacle to a budget 
agreement and to deflect criticism heaped upon president bush for 
indecisiveness on taxes 
quayle said a congressional elite has emerged bearing out 
the founders fears that life tenure would threaten our freedom 
by creating a new ruling class 
congress has exempted itself from its own laws on civil rights 
equal employment ethics privacy equal pay and freedom of 
information quayle said 
in effect congress has created two classes of americans 
those who make the laws and those who must obey the laws quayle 
said 
bush asked his view on the issue in a news conference on 
tuesday was less definitive 
the president noted that term limits were part of the republican 
party platform in 1988 and said he was certainly not opposed to 
it i havent decided exactly 
but whether i make that a prime mover in the political 
campaign that lies ahead in the nex few weeks i dont know 
but i think people want a change against the incumbents up 
there on the hill he said referring to congress

marilyn quayle and her daughter rode 
national park service horses in manassas national battlefield park 
a week ago when the park was officially closed to the public in the 
government shutdown

enforcement rangers were the only staff on duty and they 
accompanied mrs quayle and her 11yearold daughter corinne said

apschnikat said he closed the main gates the visitors center 
and two parking lots but otherwise made no attempt to keep people 
out of the park about 25 miles southwest of washington the park is 
the site of two famous civil war battles 
it would be very difficult to close the whole park and i made 
no attempt to apschnikat said 
the 4345acre park is crisscrossed by several major highways 
many visitors slipped under gates or climbed over fences the 
quayles arrived through a back entrance 
the quayle family frequently visits the park to ride the nine 
horses stabled there which are normally reserved for the rangers

inappropriate in the visit to the park

the odds of the tense situation in the 
persian gulf erupting into a fullscale war are about even say 
three former top government officials and the head of a major oil 
company 
james r schlesinger a former defense secretary and onetime 
cia director and joseph j sisco former undersecretary of state 
both said friday that they considered the likelihood of middle east 
military action to be 5050 
sol linowitz a former ambassador who worked on middle east 
peace negotiations and the panama canal treaty suggested that he 
believed the chances of war were 6040 not because theres no 
alternative but because we wont seriously have explored the 
alternative 
i think were finding now the sense in washington certainly 
that were moving inexorably toward military action that we are 
going to be faced with that linowitz added 
mobile corp chairman allen e murray said he was a little 
more optimistic than the others and suggested there is less than 
a 50 percent chance of war 
the four made their comments during a news conference after a 
closeddoor discussion of the persian gulf crisis with members of 
the business council as the 100 leaders of the nations top 
corporations held their semiannual meeting at this mountain 
retreat 
schlesinger now senior adviser for lehman brothers the new 
york investment banking firm said any military action would not be 
short 
a lot of people have used the metaphor the sixday war he 
said but almost every war has started with a prediction the 
war would be short at the outset and those predictions have 
regularly been belied 
sisco a partner in sisco associates in washington agreed 
adding if it comes to the use of force then both air power as 
well as ground forces will be necessary so that any notion of a 
four or sixday scenario just is unrealistic 
linowitz now senior counsel for coudert brothers urged fullest 
exploration of a negotiated path to be sure there is not some 
way we can get to where we want to be without going to war and 
without compromising basic principles that led us to take this 
action 
meanwhile panel members said the sanctions would remain in 
place for several months while diplomatic efforts continue toward 
an iraqi pullout of kuwait 
one has to say realistically however theres absolutely no 
indication on the part of iraqi president saddam hussein at this 
time that hes interested in getting out let alone on conditions 
laid down by the security council sisco said 
i myself see relatively little prospect that saddam will 
withdraw on our terms which is our diplomatic stance schlesinger 
said were asking him to capitulate that would be desirable but 
not likely

a research organization says a national poll 
it took last month showed that 21 percent of the respondents not 
51 percent as reported associated republicans with rich 
powerful moneyed interests 
a poll three years ago showed 18 percent making such an 
association and the big jump to 51 percent in the poll by the times 
mirror center for the people amp the press was widely published and 
frequently cited by political commentators 
times mirror blamed the incorrect figure on a computing error 
it said it also overstated the percentage of people who 
spontaneously said they associated republicanism with conservatism 
being business oriented and not being for the people 
scott sowry a spokesman for the republican national committee 
said the party was certain that the apparent jump was an error

the consumer product safety commission says it 
has taken the first step to ban infant bean bag cushions 
because of 30 reported cases of babies found dead on them 
the decision was made public friday a day after the commission 
voted to publish a notice of proposed rule making in which it will 
seek public comments to help it develop an accurate definition of 
the product 
the cushions are filled with plastic foam beads or other 
granular material that can conform to the body of an infant 
especially to the face when the infant is placed stomachdownward 
they have been promoted as resting or sleeping places for 
infants or devices to prop them upright but in at least 30 cases 
have led to death through suffocation 
the commission announced earlier this year an agreement with all 
known manufacturers of the cushions to recall them and not produce 
any more the recalls covering about a million cushions are still 
in effect 
the commission said consumers who have not already returned 
their infant cushions should stop using them return to the store 
or destroy them 
recall instructions can be obtained from a tollfree telephone 
number 18006382772 most manufacturers have offered refunds

the major maker of barium enema kits is 
recalling some products because they may be linked to severe 
reactions including nine deaths from the common medical 
procedure federal officials said 
ezem inc of westbury ny sent recall notices to customers 
a week ago saying evidence suggests watersoluble proteins in 
inflatable latex cuffs on the enema tips may be triggering the 
reactions 
the fda has received 150 reports of allergic reactions related 
to barium enema procedures in 1989 and 1990 fda spokeswoman susan 
cruzan said friday in nine cases the patient died she said 
the company makes 85 percent to 90 percent of the kits which 
are used to diagnose disorders of the intestines 
about 8 million to 10 million barium enemas are performed 
annually cruzan said 
the reports have been related to the companys enema kits with 
inflatable latex cuffs 
company officials did not return a telephone call for comment 
in light of the reports the fda asked radiologists and other 
health professionals to report any adverse reactions related to 
barium enema procedures that have occurred in the past 12 months 
the procedure involves injecting a bariumcontaining fluid into 
the rectum and colon which enables these organs to show up on an 
xray 
in some cases the reactions occurred after the enema tip had 
been inserted but before the barium had been introduced the fda 
said 
the fda said the cause of the problem is still unclear

biggles the terrier was headed for a reunion with 
his owner after two harrowing months as a hostage in kuwait and a 
daring desert escape 
he was scheduled to fly today from london to kuala lumpur 
malaysia where he was headed on aug 2 when iraq invaded kuwait 
the iraqis had refused a british airways request to allow the 
dog to leave said an airline spokesman 
if dogs could talk the lively bundle of white fur would have 
quite a tale to tell his owner identified by british airways only

company 
a british airways spokesman on friday did biggles talking for 
him as the 5monthold west highland terrier yapped and played at

leave because of the iraqi invasion 
the 367 passengers and crew were taken away to nearby hotels but 
the terrier was left in the main cargo hold without food or water 
said the airline spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity in 
line with official practice 
a few days later several british crew members were allowed to 
return to the aircraft to collect supplies and remembered that 
biggles was still in the cargo hold to their amazement he was 
still alive though badly dehydrated 
we are not sure exactly how long he was in there before he was 
rescued but he was very lucky to survive said the british 
airways spokesman 
the crew members took the terrier back to their hotel in kuwait 
where he was named biggles after the fictional 1930s pilot whose 
stories by we johns thrilled british school boys between the 
wars

of someone planning to flee from iraq by land into jordan the 
spokesman said 
biggles unnamed benefactor smuggled him across the border into 
jordan on monday and he was turned over to british airways staff at 
amman airport who arranged to fly him to london the spokesman

a parliamentary committee has proposed 
ending compulsory military service and allowing any conscript to do 
volunteer civilian work instead the nations largest daily 
newspaper reported 
spokesmen for the defense committee confirmed a proposal on 
military conscription would be made public tuesday but refused to 
comment on it 
all swedish males over 18 years old are now required to serve 
seven to 15 months in the military those accepted as conscientious 
objectors may do volunteer work 
the daily newspaper dagens nyheter said friday that some 
legislators believe the current law is unfair because it accepts 
some people as conscientious objectors but jails others who refuse 
military service 
about 50000 youths are drafted each year of these only 2000 
to 3000 are allowed to engage in alternative service for moral or 
other reasons dagens nyheter said

the senate finance committee approved a 
middleoftheroad budgetcutting plan early today that raises some 
taxes on the wealthy and boosts the levy on gasoline 
the panel adopted the plan on a bipartisan 155 vote leaving 
the senate in sharp contrast with the more fractious house 
in that chamber democrats have endorsed a liberal package 
containing sharper tax increases for the wealthy republicans are 
torn between a more conservative proposal bearing president bushs 
plan to cut the capital gains tax or perhaps offering nothing at 
all 
i believe it is a fair compromise said senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine just before the postmidnight 
finance panel vote 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan called the plan right 
and necessary and predicted its approval by the full senate a 
bush administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the president could support the measure 
the proposal is the latest congressional attempt to fashion 500 
billion in tax boosts and spending slashes for the next five years 
bush has demanded that lawmakers send him a deficitreduction 
package by next friday if they do not he has threatened to allow 
the government to close down once again the next day when its 
legal authority to spend money will expire 
the president whose wavering stance on the question of boosting 
taxes on the rich has sparked frustration and ridicule on capitol 
hill expressed confidence that a plan will be hammered together 
just stay calm it will all work out he said 
but there are so many different proposals in congress that it is 
difficult to foretell what the package will look like 
each plan contains common elements such as higher taxes on 
alcohol tobacco and luxury items such as expensive automobiles 
they would pare the growth of defense spending by close to 200 
billion over the next five years and limit increases in medicare 
by varying amounts 
but from there the plans differ 
the senate finance proposal would limit incometax deductions 
for people who earn more than 100000 per year it would apply the 
145 percent medicare tax to earnings of up to 89000 rather than 
the current 51300 
it would boost the 9centpergallon gasoline tax to 185 cents 
by 1992 and it would raise the 75 deductible medicare 
beneficiaries pay for doctors bills to 150 
the new plan by the house democrats would raise the incometax 
rate the richest americans pay from 28 percent to 33 percent an 
increase bush has promised to veto 
it would also raise money by delaying for one year the usual 
adjustment of tax brackets forinflation this provision would hurt 
taxpayers of all incomes however unlike other plans under 
consideration it would include no increase in the tax on gasoline 
house republicans debated a plan that would raise the tax rate 
on the wealthiest americans to 31 percent while cutting the 
capital gains tax rate to 15 percent the capital gains tax 
applied to sales of property like real estate is now treated like 
other income with a top rate of 33 percent 
house democrats said their plan put a fair share of the 
deficitreduction burden on the wealthy 
youre seeing the difference between the democratic party and 
what they want to do and the republican party and what they want 
to protect said house ways and means committee chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill 
but conservative republicans insisted that they were concerned 
not with protecting the rich but with fostering economic growth 
the republican party for 10 years has been united around the 
concept of growth said rep vin weber rminn 
the full house ways and means committee endorsed a compromise 
plan earlier in the week that left tax rates on the wealthy alone

under heavy bombardment rebel gen 
michel aoun fled the presidential palace to the french embassy 
saturday and ordered his troops to surrender ending a nearly 
twoyear rebellion 
i ask my chiefs of staff to take their orders henceforth from 
gen emile lahoud aoun said in a brief address to his 15000 
mainly christian troops broadcast by his radio station 
lahoud commands hrawis 20000 mainly moslem army which teamed 
up with thousands of syrians troops and hundreds of tanks in a 
threepronged ground assault on aouns enclave in lebanons 
cristian heartland 
the attack was spearheaded by two hours of syrian air and 
artillery bombardment of the presidential palace east of beirut 
where aoun had his headquarters 
aoun fled to the french embassy and first called for a 
ceasefire the government of president elias hrawi whose army is 
backed by an estimated 40000 syrian troops demanded his 
surrender 
the attack came hours after an assassination attempt against 
aoun 
aoun had considered himself the legitimate authority in lebanon 
since september 1988 when he was appointed a caretaker prime 
minister by outgoing president amin gemayel 
hrawi was elected president nov 24 to implement an arab 
leaguebrokered peace plan endorsed by parliament to end 15 years 
of civil war he then sacked aoun as army chief and interim prime 
minister 
aoun has rejected the peace accord because it does not contain 
guarantees for a complete syrian military withdrawal the syrians 
have had troops in lebanon since 1976 under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
the peace accord provides for sharing political power equally 
between moslems and christians ending the traditional dominance of 
the maronite catholics the main christian sect aoun and hrawi are 
both maronites

allegations that parents traded their 
childrens sexual favors for as a little as a pack of cigarettes 
have shaken a town trying to live down three civil rights murders 
26 years ago 
at least four children now ranging in age from 11 to 15 were 
sexually abused as long ago as 1985 by some of their parents other 
relatives and family friends authorities said 
twenty adults including one or both parents of each child are 
suspected and the case will go to a grand jury for consideration of 
rape charges investigators said 
police are investigating whether more children were involved 
said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity the investigation 
has spread from neshoba county to two neighboring counties 
the investigation is a difficult one in a town that was the site 
of one of the civil rights movements most tragic events the 
murders of activists james chaney andrew goodman and michael 
schwerner in 1964 
the activists bodies were found buried in an earthen dam near 
this rural farm town of about 8000 in eastcentral mississippi 
nine people including a neshoba county deputy sheriff went to 
prison for violating the workers civil rights 
weve come a long way since that happened said a resident 
who spoke on condition of anonymity all we want now is to get on 
with our lives we dont want other people to think we condone 
what was done to these children but we dont want any more bad 
news 
there is a fear that with philadelphias past history people 
in other areas of the country will think that all the people down 
here are doing this and thats definitely not the case said 
stanley dearman editor of the weekly neshoba democrat 
people here are disgusted and they hope that some kind of 
justice is brought to bear on those responsible he aid 
the investigation began in july when a telephone caller told 
police one of the victims an 11yearold girl confided to a baby 
sitter that her stepfather sexually abused her bobby anderson the 
towns chief police investigator said during preliminary court 
hearings 
the girl later told authorities the abuse also included her 
mother and others the girls mother denied that she sexually 
abused her daughter but said others had sexual intercourse with 
the child 
sometimes the parents would let them at the child for a few 
dollars or pack of cigarettes or some liquor anderson said 
before a judge slapped a gag order on people involved in the case 
the victims include two other girls age 11 and 15 and an 
11yearold boy something like this turns your stomach said 
sheriff glenn waddell its hard to describe the feelings you 
have when you sit down with an 11yearold girl in the physical 
shape she was in and get her to tell me all the things that she 
went through 
anderson said the case would be presented to a neshoba county 
grand jury nov 5

president bush was initially turned down by the white house will 
get his dream after all his family said 
bush decided friday to meet with 8yearold jimmy kilanowski 
after he personally learned of the boys wish to shake his hand 
the white house called the kilanowski family at their long 
island home in lake ronkonkoma to arrange the meeting scheduled 
for oct 23 in stamford conn where bush will be campaigning 
thats wow jimmy said when his mother laurie gave him the 
news 
he is so happy mrs kilanowski said we are all thrilled 
that the president came through 
jimmy who was given 1 years to live in april 1989 because of 
five brain tumors made his wish known through wish is granted an 
organization that helps terminally ill children fulfill their 
dreams 
the request was turned down by white house staff members who 
said the president was too busy 
the boy has called bush the most important man in the whole 
wide world new york sen alfonse damato stepped in thursday to 
see if he could help and successfully broke through the red tape 
that apparently had kept jimmys wish from reaching bush 
jimmy his mother father peter and 5yearold brother danny 
also will be treated to a white house visit during the christmas 
season 
they said that way jimmy can see the white house when its 
decorated like a fantasy land mrs kilanowski said 
it is white house policy to grant wish requests only through 
make a wish foundation a national organization not affiliated with 
wish is granted that apparently was the main reason jimmy 
initially was turned down by the white house 
when the president learned of this young boys wish he said 
he would do everything he could to try to make it a reality 
damato said 
i think jimmy is an inspiration the fact that when he was 
initially turned down he said well i still love the president

the government has suddenly switched 
to painful and politically risky capitalist reform raising fears 
of winters as cold and dark as those imposed by executed communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu 
it cut energy subsidies and credits to the countrys chronically 
inefficient governmentowned industries and said the same treatment 
was in store for private consumers 
on friday it said the countrys secondlargest automaker will be 
allowed to go bankrupt if it cant pay its debts 
officials also have put romanians on notice that 
statecontrolled prices will go up and that the country can afford 
no more acrosstheboard wage increases economics minister eugen 
dijmarescu warned that could cause civil unrest 
the country has lived for 40 years in an equal system of 
wages he told reporters these are crazy people because they 
dont know anything else we have to teach them that wages 
like profits are not assured and they must strive to earn them 
the national salvation front which dominated the interim 
government after the december revolution that toppled and executed 
ceausescu was at first mostly concerned with winning may 
elections 
it took the politically popular steps of shortening the workweek 
and raising salaries stopping food exports and lifting ceausescus 
heat and energy rationing it handily won the vote 
the grim results of the governments largesse were presented to 
parliament oct 10 by prime minister petre roman and anton 
vatasescu the minister of commerce and industry 
productivity has fallen about 20 percent compared to last year 
the decline has been felt especially in energy production which 
has become even more crucial since the persian gulf crisis began in 
august 
exports are down and imports are up the trade imbalance has 
grown to a projected annual 36 billion 
declining production and higher wages has led to a neartotal 
depletion of the meager stocks in romanian stores 
maintenance of the centrally controlled heavily subsidized 
pricing system has bred massive corruption many stores sell off 
most goods to speculators at prices above the official ones 
speculators resell the goods for even more often for hard currency 
only 
this has driven the black market rate of 100 leu to the dollar 
five times the official rate 
the governments solution roman announced was inevitably 
liberalization of prices which officials said was to be enacted 
within one month 
but the elimination of subsidies and price controls will have 
the unpopular effect of shifting high black market prices into 
state stores 
along with the devaluation of the leu which officials say is 
imminent this is almost certain to generate more demands for 
higher wages and possibly strikes further damaging production 
roman warned parliament that we cannot permit further pay 
raises 
the government has attempted to head off public discontent by 
assuring private consumers they will have enough heat and light 
this winter but many might not be able to meet the higher cost 
to shift energy from industry which consumes more than 80 
percent of it the government cut industrial energy subsidies and 
imposed special taxes on energy use by industry this more than 
quadrupled the cost to industry of some forms of energy 
the government said friday that the huge automotive joint 
venture oltcit would be allowed to go bankrupt if it cannot make 
good on debts of more than a billion dollars 
oltcit a romanianfrench joint venture would be the first 
company to be allowed to bankrupt signaling the governments tough 
new stand as it makes initial steps toward a market economy 
the manufacturer produced tens of thousands of cars that were 
replicas of an early 1980s model citroen it is romanias 
secondlargest car manufacturer after the dacia company which 
produces replicas of a 1970s model renalt 
the government also is looking to foreign investment to rescue 
romanian industry by injecting knowhow and money into its 
antiquated infrastructure in exchange for what dijmarescu called 
a capable and cheap work force 
foreign investment has been stifled by romanias poor 
international image the result of political and ethnic unrest 
since the revolution 
in march six people were killed in rioting between ethnic 
romanians and transylvanians in june another six were killed when 
police suppressed a 53day antigovernment protest and 
progovernment miners terrorized the capital for several days 
the government now hopes the negative effects on foreign 
investment will be reversed by romanias support for the west in 
the gulf crisis and new laws encouraging privatization and foreign 
ownership of local firms 
diplomatic and economic sources say there has been a dramatic 
increase in the number of foreign companies sending delegations to 
investigate business opportunities in romania

period of harmony between the two nations may be at hand they have 
also been holding talks in an effort to ease military and political 
tension 
the fiveday trip to north korea by 76members of south koreas 
soccer teams was only the second interkorean civilian exchange 
since partition a small family exhange was held in 1985

formation of a single interkorean team when they meet again in 
seoul in two weeks

refugees from iraq and kuwait was the first such exodus in nearly 
three weeks 
the pan am boeing 747 touched down at raleighdurham 
international airport on friday ending a long and tiring odyssey 
for 123 american citizens seven canadians and 127 passengers of 
unknown nationality 
about 103 on board were children many of them infants 
when the plane touched down in north carolina i hollered so 
loud thank god im in freedom city said mohammed issa a native 
of jordan and a us citizen 
the first group off the plane were women in middle eastern garb 
such as flowing robes and veils carrying sleeping children and 
some personal belongings as they came down the ramp north carolina 
national guardsmen escorted other children off the plane 
three people on board were in wheelchairs one was diabetic one 
was suffering from a blood disease and one was heavily sedated 
said joe dean secretary of the north carolina department of crime 
control and public safety and a member of a welcoming party allowed 
onto the plane 
the moment i reached usa i started crying and i cried not 
because of the crisis because it is hard when you see a friend 
treat you better than a brother said a palestinian mother of 
four who did not want to give her name or have her photograph 
taken 
issa returned to the united states with his wife and parents he 
said the trip from kuwait to baghdad was the most miserable trip 
weve ever taken 
there was no food a trip that was supposed to take 1 hours 
maybe two took 14 hours said issa a former us marine who was 
once stationed at camp lejeune nc 
he said a caravan of buses stopped in the desert for five hours 
but there appeared to be no mechanical breakdowns or other reason 
for the delay 
they were trying to break us down mentally to make us suffer 
some issa said they were trying to put some pressure on us to 
see if maybe somebody wouldnt do something 
when the caravan finally got to basra the last stop before 
baghdad issa was charged the equivalent of 72 for eight candy 
bars and four cartons of juice for his family

the operator of the hanford nuclear 
reservation says workers in the 1960s pumped almost 1 million 
gallons of radioactive waste and water into a tank that had leaked 
in the past 
westinghouse hanford said friday the tank leaked about 2400 
gallons of liquid in 1962 despite that leak about 780000 gallons 
of radioactive waste and 150000 gallons of cooling water were 
added to the tank between 1963 and 1967 said richard raymond a 
westinghouse manager 
the presumption is that some amount of cooling water leaked 
out of the tank and took some waste material with it he said 
how much we dont know 
another damaged waste tank at hanford may have leaked 800000 
gallons of radioactive cooling water into the soil the energy 
department said thursday the department reported a year ago that 
tank had leaked 5000 gallons of liquid since it ruptured in a 1965 
explosion 
the two underground singleshell tanks are about five miles 
apart on the 560squaremile nuclear reservation in southcentral 
washington 
the 1965 explosion caused tank 105a to leak and the radioactive 
wastes inside to overheat the new estimate shows 832000 gallons 
of cooling water were pumped into the tank between 1965 and 1978 
when the work stopped 
the energy department estimates 40000 to 200000 gallons may 
have evaporated through vents leaving 632000 to 792000 gallons 
still in the soil 
provost said the state needs precise leak data so it knows how 
much work is required under a 30year federal plan for cleaning up 
the entire hanford site which westinghouse hanford began operating 
for the energy department in 1987 
hanford waste engineer johnnie newsom said officials are still 
combing old records to determine how much waste was leaked the 
energy department has agreed to turn over any additional records to 
the state 
the tank filled with nearly 1 million gallons of waste and water 
was pumped dry in 1980 and is no longer in service it cannot be 
determined how much of its contents may have evaporated or leaked 
but a westinghouse investigation continues raymond said 
recent monitoring of the soil beneath the tank indicates that no 
radioactive cooling water reached ground water or traveled away 
from the vicinity westinghouse hanford said 
hanford has 177 underground waste storage tanks they were used 
to store radioactive waste generated in four decades of producing 
plutonium for nuclear weapons

a illinois supreme court ruling knocked a third 
party slate of candidates off the november ballot and the partys 
rejected candidates vowed retribution against the democratic party 
on election day 
the democrats continue to dig a very deep hole for themselves 
in the november election david reed chairman of the harold 
washington party said friday we know who the adversary is 
the state high court voted 43 along party lines friday to 
reject nominating petitions filed by the predominantly black party 
the four democratic members of the high court ruled that the 
party had failed to collect enough signatures for its candidates 
and had illegally used the harold washington party label 
the three republican justices said the majority was needlessly 
strict in interpreting the election code 
the party named after the citys first black mayor had sought 
to put 19 candidates on the nov 6 ballot for offices in cook 
county which comprises chicago 
the washington party contended that the democratic party was 
behind the ballot challenge 
democrats who feared they might lose large numbers of straight 
party voters to the party contended that republicans were behind 
the third party effort they tried to disassociate themselves from 
the ballot challenge fearing a backlash from black voters 
the high court upheld a ruling sept 20 that removed all the 
partys candidates from the ballot circuit judge eugene l 
wachowski ruled that although the party had gathered sufficient 
nominating petition signatures from chicago it fell short of the 
legally required minimum for each of its suburban candidates 
the party is appealing wachowskis ruling in us district 
court

former double agent oleg gordievsky says the kgb 
backed mikhail gorbachevs rise to power in the early 1980s 
believing he could save the soviet economy according to extracts 
published today from the exspys book 
the book also tells of unsuccessful kgb efforts through 
political contacts and the news media to hamper the reelection of 
former president ronald reagan 
gordievsky 52 who fled to britain in 1985 makes the claim in 
a book kgb the inside story of its foreign operations from 
lenin to gorbachev he wrote the work with christopher andrew a 
cambridge university intelligence historian 
serialization of extracts from the book began today in the times 
of london and will continue next week the book will be published 
in britain and the united states on oct 19 
the book as serialized said that in the closing months of 
1984 gordievsky was the deputy kgb chief in london and the 
agencys local head of political intelligence he had been working 
for britains mi6 espionage agency for more than 10 years 
gordievskys book stated it was clear to the london residency 
kgb branch that the kgb was backing gorbachev for the succession 
to the increasingly moribund communist party general secretary 
konstantin chernenko 
without a change in the soviet leadership the kgb saw no end 
to the problems of the soviet economy and no end either to 
western attempts to exploit them 
in the months before chernenkos longexpected death in march 
1985 the kgb put great care into briefing gorbachev in a way that 
would allow him to impress the rest of the politburo with his grasp 
of soviet and world affairs 
the former spy said however that kgb support was only one 
reason that gorbachev won election as communist general secretary 
in march 1985 he said the kgb saw the election nonetheless as 
a major victory 
in describing the purported antireagan effort the book says 
that the kgb told its agents in the united states to begin 
planning to thwart reagans bid for reelection in november 1984 
although arms control negotiations were still going on in 
geneva kgb leaders felt there was no chance of agreement any 
other american president democrat or republican would therefore 
be preferable to reagan 
the former spy said kgb agents in the united states were 
instructed to acquire contacts on the staff of all possible 
candidates and inside both parties 
it did not explain how they planned to try to manipulate these 
contacts but added simultaneously residencies throughout nato 
were told to popularize the slogan reagan means war 
the book says the kgb branches around the world found it easy 
to claim credit frequently undeserved for many of the antireagan 
articles which flooded the worlds press 
on friday gordievsky said in an interview that the kgb helped 
ignite last years east european revolutions to put progorbachev 
reform communists in power but he said the kgb and its soviet 
communist party bosses never expected the outpouring of 
anticommunist fervor which they were later helpless to stop 
he did not say where he learned about the alleged kgb 
involvement in eastern europe but he regularly goes to the united 
states for meetings with us officials and international analysts 
and he consults for the journal intelligence and national 
security 
gordievsky began working for the british while posted in 
copenhagen denmark in the early 1970s he has said the 1968 
soviet invasion of czechoslovakia pushed him to act on his growing 
disillusionment 
the kgb sent him to london but he was recalled to moscow and 
questioned about his activities he eluded his kgb tail and escaped 
to the west 
his 1985 defection sparked a titfortat expulsion of 31 soviet 
and 31 british diplomats trade representatives and journalists

federal regulators may give the library of 
congress a collection of memorabilia from the world of magic that 
was seized from the head of a failed thrift 
thousands of posters handbills 16thcentury books and private 
letters from harry houdini and other noted magicians were taken 
from carl m rheuban after the savings and loan he ran was closed 
last month

city allegedly spent at least 15 million of the thrifts money 
on the magic collection which was named after the late john 
mulholland an early 20th century magician 
library of congress officials say they dont have the money to 
buy the collection which was seized by the federal resolution 
trust corp the bailout agency for ailing savings and loans 
these arent just card tricks we are talking about larry 
sullivan chief of the rare books collections at the federal 
library said of the magic collection 
kevin shields spokesman for resolution trust said his agency 
usually sells all seized assets at auction but the rarity of the 
magic collection has him considering whether to hand it over to the 
library of congress 
it is an unusual asset to say the least for a savings and 
loan to have if this were an apartment building it would be an 
easy decision said john f penrose who is overseeing the

riot police fired tear gas today to 
block a street march by thousands of angry protesters leaving an 
antigovernment rally attended by more than 100000 dissidents and 
opposition supporters 
meanwhile the health of opposition leader kim daejung 
deteriorated on the sixth day of his hunger strike against the 
government 
about 20000 people protesting government surveillance waved 
banners and shouted down with president roh taewoo they 
were blocked from marching toward downtown seoul by riot police 
about 2 miles from the park where the mass protest was held 
police fired volleys of tear gas to disperse radicals and 
dissidents hurling firebombs and chunks of cement pavement torn 
from the sidewalks 
injury figures were not immediately available 
disband defense security command protesters shouted as 
thousands of other marchers clicked flashlights and cigarette 
lighters on and off in the dark in a show of protest and unity 
the protesters were demanding the dissolution of the defense 
security command military intelligence which has conducted illegal 
and widespread spying on more than 1300 civilians 
violence also erupted inside the park as the rally ended when 
some protesters hurled rocks and bottles toward the podium another 
group of protesters attacked a truck carrying about 20 members of 
the splinter democratic party one party member was seen bleeding 
from his head 
the reason for the violence was unclear but it appeared to be 
disagreement between two factions of opposition parties attending 
the rally 
kim daejung head of leading opposition party for peace and 
democracy had been expected to speak at the rally but doctors 
said the 66yearold leaders health had deteriorated after six 
days of no food and he was not strong enough to appear 
the barbarious surveillance of civilians by the security 
command clearly shows the roh regime as a disguised military 
dictatorship said national assemblyman choi yongkeun who said 
he was speaking for kim 
aides said kim a twotime presidential candidate had lost 
about 13 pounds since his fast began and he suffered stomach 
cramps kim was undergoing routine tests for admittance to a 
hospital they said 
kim launched his hunger strike last monday to demand reforms 
from the government and call attention to a scandal involving the 
military intelligence defense security command which allegedly 
spied on more than 1300 civilians 
the turmoil comes in the second month of a boycott by the 78 
opposition members of the 299member national assembly the 
opposition members resigned en masse in august charging the 
government with railroading bills and curtailing democratic 
reforms 
roh fired the defense minister and head of military intelligence 
earlier this week the new minister said military reforms would be 
made and an investigation was under way into the surveillance 
scandal 
opposition leader kim said he would continue his fast until the 
government met four demands disolution of military intelligence 
implementation of local selfrule economic reform and the ruling 
partys agreement to drop efforts to change from a presidential to 
parliamentarycabinet system of government 
us rep edward f feighan of ohio sent a news release to kim 
saying he supported him but the recent exposure of the 
governments extensive domestic spying network makes one wonder 
whether it intends to shed completely its past of military rule 
the congressman said in the release

egypt honored its slain parliament speaker 
and four security men today with a state funeral led by a 
grimlooking president hosni mubarak 
the government said iraqi agents or egyptian moslem 
fundamentalists were to blame for the assassination friday of its 
secondhighest official rifaat elmahgoub he was the first 
egyptian politician assassinated since islamic extremists shot 
president anwar sadat at a military parade nine years ago 
four assassins riding two motorbikes killed elmahgoub in a car 
driving by a luxury hotel by the nile 
the death toll from the attack rose to six today with the death 
of the speakers chauffeur doctors in a cairo hospital said the 
driver suffered bullet wounds in the stomach back and arm 
hassan abubasha a former police minister told the cairo 
newspaper alahram he believed elmahgoubs slaying was the work of 
iraqi agents he said the perpetrators possibly belonged to the 
palestinian extremist faction led by abu nidal 
the funeral was at nasr city the same suburban neighborhood 
where sadats funeral took place 
hundreds of redbereted military police and whiteuniformed 
policemen sealed off all streets leading to the mosque where the 
religious service was held they also lined the funeral procession 
route as did hundreds of plainclothes security men 
mubarak wearing a black suit and sunglasses and british 
foreign secretary douglas hurd on a twoday official visit were 
in the front row of about 1000 mourners they included relatives 
of the dead government officials and foreign diplomats 
symbolic units from the military services spearheaded the 
procession followed by a military band and two dozen 
wreathbearers 
behind them were four military jeeps carrying coffins of the 
four security men draped in the red white and black egyptian 
flag 
a caisson bearing elmahgoubs coffin followed also wrapped in 
the flag it was drawn by three pairs of black horses military 
officers rode the three horses on the right immediately behind 
came two officers carrying elmahgoubs decorations laid on 
blackvelvet cushions 
the procession began from the mosque and stopped about 1500 
feet away relatives of the dead then lined up to accept 
condolences from mubarak and other mourners 
interior minister abdelhalim moussa had warned days earlier of 
such an attack he said authorities arrested alleged saboteurs who 
were entering the country with orders from iraqi president saddam 
hussein to assassinate egyptian officials 
saddam has called egypt a traitor to the arab cause for sending 
its troops to back the us military buildup in the gulf in 
response to the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the stateowned newspaper alahram quoting police sources 
reported monday that local moslem extremists were collaborating 
with palestinian terrorists sent to the country by iraq on sabotage 
missions 
it said the extremists had provided weapons and explosives to 
five palestinians from abu nidals faction of the palestine 
liberation organization recent reports said abu nidals 
fatahrevolutionary council recently moved its headquarters from 
libya to iraq 
police ordered a state of alert at airports to keep the 
assailants from fleeing and set up security checkpoints along cairo 
bridges 
elmahgoubs authority extended solely over the 458seat 
parliament which he had headed since 1984 he was not active in 
the gulf crisis alahram noted in a frontpage editorial today 
in fact he was assassinated because he was a prominent 
egyptian politician the assasins wanted to tell their terrorist 
bosses that they pierced the stability of egypt the newspaper 
said 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we 
are shocked by the assassination of the egyptian speaker 
we certainly deplore these kinds of terrorist activities and 
assassination is the most vile kind of terrorism we dont have any 
indication at this time who was responsible or what their purposes 
were he said

making common cause with its new arab 
allies the united states has joined the rest of the security 
council in denouncing israeli authorities for killing 19 
palestinians during rioting in jerusalem 
in its unanimous vote late friday the council asked for a un 
investigation of the deaths but israel said today it must consider 
whether it would allow such a mission on its territory 
the us vote for the resolution represented a rare departure 
from the usual american practice of defending israel its longtime 
ally from censure in the council 
the last us vote against israel in the united nations was in 
1988 over the israeli practice of expelling suspected leaders of 
the arab uprising known as the intefadeh 
diplomats said the united states wanted to avoid a veto on the 
issue because it feared alienating its arab allies in the 
international effort against iraq 
beginning from now israels protective umbrella will begin to 
be steadily removed malaysias ambassador rasali ismail 
predicted early today 
the palestine liberation organization today accused the united 
states of preventing the security council from developing a 
stronger response 
yasser abd rabou a member of the plos executive committee 
said in tunisia today that the resolution was insufficient even 
though it condemned the actions of israeli police 
the plo initially sought a threemember security council mission 
that would have made recommendations on how to protect palestinians 
in the occupied territories that was seen as part of a plo tactic 
of trying to get the council directly involved in supervising the 
territories 
the resolution instead envisages an inquiry organized by 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
the us ambassador to the united nations thomas r pickering 
said the killings never should have happened 
the security council tonight grieves for those lost and 
injured and condemns the acts of violence both provocative and 
reactive he said 
mondays rioting in jerusalem broke out after arabs threw rocks 
at praying jews the arabs were killed when police moved in first 
with tear gas and rubber bullets but later with live ammunition 
in addition to the 19 dead about 140 arabs were wounded about 
30 jews were injured 
the un resolution condemns especially the acts of violence 
committed by the israeli security forces resulting in injuries and 
loss of human life 
it also refers to the injury of innocent worshipers in an 
implied criticism of the palestinian rockthrowers the plo had 
fought to have that phrase removed 
the resolution was sponsored by britain canada the soviet 
union zaire finland ivory coast and france 
israel expressed regret over the resolution this morning 
however israeli ambassador johanan bein in a statement from his 
foreign ministry complained that the resolution fails to condemn 
the cause of the tragic events in jerusalem an unprovoked arab 
attack on jewish worshipers 
it is also regrettable that the security council fell into the 
trap laid by iraqi president saddam hussein and his plo 
supporters who inspired the riots in order to divert attention 
from iraqs aggression in the gulf 
a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel today 
said the cabinet would have to decide whether it would accept a 
un investigating team 
the statement by spokesman avi pazner said the un action was 
without any reason or justification since the police opened 
fire after a stoning attack by palestinians that injured more than 
30 jewish worshipers and police 
one western ambassador said the united nations would send an 
american of such stature that the israeli government would find it 
impossible to refuse the visit the ambassador spoke on condition 
of anonymity and did not elaborate 
the investigating team would be charged not only with looking 
into how mondays riots were handled but at other similar 
developments in the occupied territories it would recommend ways 
of ensuring the safety of palestinians 
israel captured the arab sector of jerusalem from jordan in the 
1967 middle east war and later annexed it 
the un resolution followed five days of arduous bargaining 
among the united states and nonaligned nations on the 15member 
council 
the only arab on the security council ambassador abdalla saleh 
alashtal of yemen said the nonaligned countries supported the 
compromise because it is a clear condemnation of israeli actions 
something the council didnt do for a very long time 
he said the investigating mission will report back to the 
security council by oct 24 
the last us condemnation of israel was in 1988 when american 
officials objected to its expulsions of suspected ringleaders of 
the palestinian uprising from the occupied lands 
the united states cast a dramatic un vote denouncing israel in 
1982 when israeli forces invaded lebanon to oust the plo it did 
so again in 1981 when the israelis bombed a nuclear power plant in 
iraq

le duc tho a hardline communist 
revolutionary named as a winner of the 1973 nobel peace prize for 
negotiating a settlement in the vietnam war died today in hanoi 
official accounts say he was 79 
the foreign ministry in the vietnamese capital said by telephone 
that tho died early in the day but gave no details 
japans kyodos news agency reporting from hanoi said he died 
of throat cancer he had been hospitalized at an army hospital 
since returning in april from treatment in paris the report said 
tho shared the nobel prize with thensecretary of state henry a 
kissinger together they negotiated the paris peace accords of 
1973 but tho turned down the prize saying vietnam remained at 
war 
the guns fell silent two years later when communist forces 
defeated the usbacked saigon government and unified the country 
tho one of the organizers and theoreticians of communist 
revolution in vietnam remained in the ruling politburo after 1975 
he was believed to have played a key role in vietnams invasion of 
cambodia in late 1978 
but in 1986 he was removed from the politburo as aging veterans 
gave way to more liberal leaders seeking economic reform 
western diplomats have speculated that in recent years thos 
power had ebbed but that he remained an important figure in the 
partys conservative ranks his official position was adviser to 
the partys central committee 
until the end tho kept parts of his life from the public domain 
as did many revolutionary leaders of his generation there are 
several different versions of his birthdate and accounts of his 
early life 
by some accounts he was born of poor parents in a village about 
60 miles south of hanoi but some western biographical sources say 
his father was a civil service official of middle rank in the 
french colonial administration 
still in his teens tho became involved in leftwing labor and 
political movements and helped organize several protests in the 
hanoi area 
he was among the founding members of the indochinese communist 
party in 1930 and was later imprisoned by the french in jail he 
reportedly organized some fellow inmates who nicknamed him tho 
the phonograph for his ceaseless recitations of marxist 
literature which he had learned by heart 
his activities during world war ii are still a matter of 
speculation among western historians some sources say tho escaped 
to china and helped vietnams founding father ho chi minh form 
the viet minh guerrillas and lead them against the japanese others 
say tho spent some of the war years in a french prison in vietnam 
after the founding of the democratic republic of vietnam and 
during the war against the french colonialists tho became a key 
communist party organizer in south vietnam and a prime purger of 
the middle and upper classes in north vietnam 
he became a member of the partys politburo in the 1950s and an 
expert on party organization and ideology periodically he 
criticized revisionists defeatists traitors pessimists and 
individualists within party ranks 
although a party watchdog through much of his career he often 
called for patience and moderation in healing internal rifts 
unlike parties in china and the soviet union communists in vietnam 
carried out no bloody purges 
during the vietnamese war in 1960s and 1970s tho apparently did 
not have a direct say in military matters 
until 1968 his diplomatic experience had been limited to trips 
to various communist nations usually as head of hanois delegation 
to party gatherings 
in 1968 with the vietnam war stalemated the united states and 
north vietnam opened talks on a ceasefire tho was officially 
described as special adviser to his delegation but it became 
apparent that the real powers to negotiate lay with him 
in kissinger tho faced an adversary acknowledged as one of the 
most skilled and stubborn negotiators of recent times the 
silverhaired tho also proved a man of considerable social polish 
and personal charm although he rarely sought the limelight during 
his years in paris 
the negotiations dragged on year after year the two sides 
trying to overcome what kissinger called mountains and ravines 
of complexities the accord was finally signed jan 27 1973 
it resulted in the withdrawal of us forces from vietnam the 
exchange of prisoners and the splintering of south vietnam into 
communist and saigon controlled zones but true peace failed to 
materialize each side accusing the other of sabotaging the 
agreements 
the nobel peace prize award of 1973 was perhaps the most 
controversial ever leftists protested the selection of kissinger 
and other critics bristled at the naming of a communist 
revolutionary

syrian forces using land and air power 
today blasted the stronghold of gen michel aoun who ended his 
11month mutiny by fleeing to the french embassy and ordering his 
forces to surrender 
aoun told his troops to pledge allegiance to the government of 
president elias hrawi trying to end lebanons 15yearold civil 
war among christian and moslem factions 
hrawis army entered aouns presidential palace headquarters in 
suburban baabda at 1245 pm 545 am edt beirut radio 
stations reported 
the official syrian news agency sana said that almost two hours 
earlier syrian troops had taken control of the palace headquarters 
and the defense ministry complex in the suburb of yarze which had 
also been under aouns control 
aoun had opposed the governments peace plan which gives the 
moslem majority an equal share of power but has no timetable for 
withdrawing the 40000 syrian troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate 
the developments contributed to the growing instability in the 
middle east where the united states is struggling to hold together 
its alliance of arab states opposed to the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait syria the main powerbroker in lebanon and iraqs 
archrival is an important part of that effort 
several of aouns battalions surrendered after aouns order and 
fighting was tapering off at the major entry points to the 
christian enclave witnesses and police said civil aviation 
authorities ordered beirut airport closed 
in paris the foreign ministry said france had granted aoun 
political asylum and was prepared to help him leave beirut beirut 
radio stations said hrawi asked for a pledge from france to ban 
aoun from political activity 
aouns departure removes a major obstacle toward implementing 
the arab leaguebrokered peace plan but many enmnities still exist 
not only between christians and moslems but among the various 
sects on both sides 
this is a historical moment heralding the reunification of 
the lebanese army and the return of peace to lebanon said 
hrawis prime minister salim hoss he called for the lebanese to 
close ranks behind his government 
at least 15 civilians were killed and 110 wounded in fighting 
early today along beiruts moselmchristian dividing line and 
lebanons central mountains police and hosptials said military 
casualties were not immediately available 
aoun 55 escaped assassination friday by a moslem shiite gunman 
who aimed a pistol at him as he addressed cheering supporters the 
crowd roughed up the gunman and bullets went astray wounding an 
aoun aide 
i ask my chiefs of staff to take their orders henceforth from

air traffic likely will double early in the 
next century and billions of dollars in airport expansion and 
thousandseat planes may be needed to prevent gridlock in the 
skies said a report released saturday 
delays in air travel have been mounting and could reach 
staggering proportions in the coming years the national research 
council conclude in its report on a oneyear study conducted for 
the federal aviation administration 
in 1987 each of 21 major airports experienced more than 20000 
hours of flight delays but by 1997 the report said 39 airports 
could reach that level delays could reach 100000 hours a year at 
such major hubs as chicago atlanta and denver 
the nations air transport system is expected to carry about 13 
million domestic and international passengers a day in 1990 
but shortly after the year 2000 the number is expected to reach 
25 million a day or nearly 1 billion passengers a year the report 
said 
if this growth continues the system could be carrying 4 
million to 5 million passengers daily by 2040 more than triple the 
present volume of traffic the report said 
if plans are not made now to handle such vastly increased levels 
of air travel congestion and delay will be a constraint on 
growth that will profoundly affect the society in the 21st 
century 
the study calls for a blend of new construction changes in 
approach and greatly expanded research and development 
specific recommendations include 
the faa should establish a strategic planning process through 
the year 2040 with shorterrange goals in each 10year period 
increase capacity at up to 50 existing airports at a cost of 
40 million to 65 million each with runway changes and 
improvements in airtraffic control 
develop new secondary hubs for connecting flights at some or 
all of 28 underused airports at a cost of 250 million to 500 
million each 
study ways to improve airport design manage resources reduce 
airport noise and integrate air and land transportation 
create an expanded centrally organized airport system by 
giving the federal government authority to oversee improvements in 
airport capacity possibly including construction of 10 new major 
airports this could involve federal costs of 50 billion to 90 
billion over the next 40 years 
seek marketbased solutions to capacity problems this strategy 
also involves the construction of 10 new airports but would give 
state and local authorities responsibility for increasing airport 
capacity estimated federal financing 38 billion to 75 billion 
develop larger subsonic jets of up to 1000 seats for heavily 
traveled routes supersonic commercial transports for international 
routes and shorthaul aircraft and miniports at suburban locations 
for transfer purposes develop new surface transport systems to 
absorb some of the 200to500 mile intercity traffic now handled by 
aircraft the estimated price tag in federal local and private 
funding between 50 billion and 100 billion by 2020 and perhaps 
125 billion to 165 billion more by 2040 
the report stressed that no matter what is done congestion and 
delay cannot be eliminated simply or permanently especially when 
weather and airspace congestion are taken into account 
the best that can be achieved is a higher degree of efficiency 
that reduces congestion and delay to an acceptable level at an 
affordable cost it said

hundreds of kuwaitis gathered in saudi arabia today to discuss 
the future of their occupied homeland in washington officials 
said the us buildup facing iraqi invading forces had surpassed 
200000 troops 
at the united nations us officials joined the rest of the 
security council in condemning israels security forces for killing 
19 palestinians in rioting in jerusalem earlier this week 
diplomats said the united states had not exercised its veto 
power over the resolution for fear of alienating arab nations whose 
support it needs against iraq in the persian gulf crisis 
there were new indications that the united states might launch 
an attack on iraqi forces pentagon sources in washington said 
friday a marine amphibious force was planning a practice assault on 
the arabian coast as a trial run for a possible us invasion of 
kuwait 
and a french magazine said us military officials have drawn up 
an offensive plan against iraq 
more than 1000 kuwaiti exiles from all walks of life gathered 
in jiddah saudi arabia for the threeday kuwaiti peoples 
conference which began today 
hundreds of young men and women demonstrated outside jiddahs 
conference palace raising banners of support for the emir and 
shouting slogans calling for the liberation of kuwait which iraq 
invaded aug 2 
this conference is the most eloquent response to your enemy 
who usurped your homeland said the emir sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah in his opening speech 
the crown prince and prime minister sheik saad alabdullah 
alsabah also addressed the opening session and promised democracy 
would increase in kuwait after liberation from occupation by troops 
loyal to iraqs saddam hussein 
more than 200000 us troops have been deployed against iraq 
the pentagon said it has refused to say however exactly how many 
us soldiers sailors airmen and marines are in saudi arabia or 
on warships in the region 
there are an estimated 430000 iraqi troops in kuwait and 
southern iraq 
the un resolution approved in new york condemns the acts 
of violence committed by the israeli security forces resulting in 
injuries and loss of human life 
the palestine liberation organization had supported a harsher 
version of the resolution the us vote in favor of the resolution 
was a rare departure from its usual practice of defending israel 
from censure in the council 
the united states however did not want to allienate its arab 
allies including egypt and syria joining the multinational effort 
against iraq 
there were indications the united states might be growing 
impatient with the unordered economic embargo on iraq pentagon 
sources announced a practice assault on the arabian coast 
and the french news magazine lexpress reported that us 
military officials have drawn up plans to free kuwait and defeat 
iraq in a fourday attack in november that would destroy saddams 
armed forces 
lexpress said us planners estimated the offensive might cost 
20000 american lives but gave no estimate for dead of other 
nations 
the magazine said it obtained an outline of the plan from an 
unidentified aide to us defense secretary richard cheney us 
officials refused comment on the reports 
james r schlesinger a former defense secretary and onetime 
cia director and joseph j sisco former undersecretary of state 
both said friday they consider the likelihood of middle east 
military action to be 5050 
they spoke at a news conference in hot springs va after a 
discussion of the persian gulf crisis with members of the business 
council a group of top american corporate leaders 
in jordan iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz said today the 
crisis had entered a new phase of reconsideration of stands in 
another indication of a shift in baghdads hardline attitude 
toward kuwait 
iraq meanwhile said it might stop soviet detainees from 
returning home if they have knowledge of iraqi weapons systems the 
evacuation began a week ago and iraq had promised to let at least 
2000 soviets leave 
defense sources said cheney planned to ask soviet officials next 
week for intelligence on the iraqi military armed largely by the 
soviet union and france the soviets have condemned their former 
ally over the invasion 
a pan am jetliner with 257 evacuees from iraq and kuwait the 
first uschartered flight in nearly three weeks landed friday 
at raleighdurham airport in north carolina the passengers 
mostly women and children included 123 americans six canadians

its party time sort of in the dimly lighted 
marble hallway outside the house ways and means committee hearing 
room but nobodys having much fun 
theyre clutching notebooks and documents not drinks and 
munchies and most of their causes are lost ones whether theyre 
trying to prevent luxury tax increases protect medicare or cut the 
tax rate on capital gains 
i dont think anybody in this hallway is doing very well with 
a 500 billion deficitreduction package everybody is going to get 
hit said a young man with glasses 
ah if that were the only problem facing the lobbyists who have 
been camping outside committee rooms for hours on end monitoring 
each incremental step of this years tumultuous budget process 
hoping against hope for one last moment with some key lawmaker or 
aide 
theyre bored theyre lonely theyre stretched thin theyve 
got image trouble 
were sick of each other said a hospital lobbyist 
gesturing to two colleagues 
i havent seen my fiance in days another woman said 
midterms start monday adds a young man studying for his 
masters degree in international management 
weve been tarred as fat cats laments ed hatcher senior 
manager of tax policy for the american electronics association 
his group wants guess what a capital gains tax cut but only 
a teeny one that wouldnt hurt the deficit much and would help 
strungout entrepreneurs trying to create the apple computers of 
tomorrow 
i personally think they should go easy on medicare 
beneficiaries hatcher said 
gucci gulch named for the soft designer leather worn by the tax 
lobbyists who often congregate there is a wide swath of hallway 
across the front of the longworth house office building 
committee democrats were talking about capital gains taxes and 
medicare on friday and dozens of lobbyists had decided they had to 
be on hand 
they leaned against the marble walls sat in stairwells even 
perched in wall niches just big enough for two they filled the air 
with esoteric references to asset reversions corporate interest 
disallowances esops and rampd extenders 
it really is sort of a social event said hatcher the 
trouble is its not terribly productive i come up when theyre 
very close to reaching a decision otherwise youre better off in 
your office 
many of the old hands at gucci gulch agree 
i promise you a lot of the people are sitting out here in the 
hall billing hours said bank and real estate lobbyist jim 
skinner a 14year veteran of the process 
he added hastily im waiting for a phone 
at this late stage particularly with the political stakes so 
high for democrats republicans and the white house most of those 
haunting the hallways admit that its too late to work their will 
on anyone 
now theyll settle for information even rumors and hearsay in 
a pinch 
staying ahead of the information curve is basically my job 
said dan harrington an assistant at a law firm it gets 
exciting you get caught up in the paper chase the fun of getting 
something before its released 
budgetwatching is just about the only thing the halldwellers 
have done for the past two weeks 
its seasonal work like farmworkers said tom nickels 
director of the washington office of the american college of 
emergency physicians the group helped win a 35 percent medicare 
fee increase and hes trying to make sure it survives each 
transmutation of each budget bill 
venture capitalists and homebuilders and hatcher meanwhile 
watch the capital gains tax cut fall in and out of favor on a daily 
and sometimes hourly basis 
there just comes a point where you have to look at the process 
with a sense of humor said hatcher if you dont you really

faced with the inevitable decline in military 
spending defense contractors are adapting to a sharp drop in 
business by using existing programs to help laidoff workers a 
study released saturday said 
the report by the arms control and disarmament agency found that 
the impact of a scaledback defense budget will affect individual 
companies and some communities but nationwide the impact will be 
minimal 
we estimate that even if defense spending were reduced at an 
annual rate of 2 percent for as long as five years job loss would 
be roughly 68000 defenserelated workers per year according to 
the study by the government agency 
the agency found that programs in place through the job training 
partnership act the worker adjustment and retraining notification 
act as well as assistance provided by the defense departments 
office of economic adjustment are enough to help defense workers 
who lose their jobs 
some members of congress have pushed for additional programs to 
assist employees and communities affected by lower defense 
spending the housepassed defense bills include 200 million for 
existing programs and provides funds to affected communities 
the economic effects of future reductions are unlikely to 
require legislation to convert the defense industry to nondefense 
activities and that conversion directed by government mandate 
would not be helpful the study said 
it did recommend however that congress ease the pain for 
workers by reducing the budget deficit which would lead to lower 
interest rates improve conditions for investment by adjustments in 
the tax system and encourage the use of commercial products in 
defense buying 
the report found that states heavily dependent on defense 
contracts california texas new york connecticut massachusetts 
and virginia will feel the brunt of significant cuts in defense 
spending 
however some states will be able to use the adjustment 
assistance while others with large varied and vibrant economies 
such as california and new york would probably not require it 
the report said 
the purpose of the report which was provided to sen paul 
simon dill was to determine the effect of ussoviet arms 
control agreements and the resulting cutbacks in defense spending 
the study found that savings resulting from such agreements will 
probably be limited during the years immediately after the signing 
of arms control treaties

for 37 years blacks have been 
legally banned from the sparkling blue waters of south africas 
public swimming pools 
thats supposed to change monday with the end of the separate 
amenities act a major apartheid law that segregated bathrooms 
swimming pools libraries and other public facilities 
but if sasolburg officials have their way few if any blacks 
will join white residents in the towns municipal pools 
a new local law takes effect monday that allows only town 
residents most of them white to use the public pools the tens of 
thousands of blacks forced by apartheid laws to live in townships 
outside the city will still be barred 
similar measures aimed at restricting use of facilities to 
whites have been reported in other towns controlled by the 
proapartheid conservative party 
the legal maneuvering by rightwing whites illustrates the depth 
of south africas internal divisions president fw de klerk has 
pledged to end apartheid but many whites are unprepared to share 
their daily life with blacks 
scrapping apartheid laws is one thing ending race prejudice 
and eradicating apartheids deep roots will take a little longer 
said the star an antiapartheid newspaper in johannesburg 
little will actually change with mondays formal repeal of the 
separate amenities act all major cities have wiped out the 
socalled petty apartheid last christmas de klerk opened the few 
remaining segregated beaches to all races 
symbolically though the governing national party is lifting 
one of the last barriers protecting white privilege 
de klerk has promised to abolish all discriminatory legislation 
including laws prohibiting blacks from residing on or owning 
property in much of the country those measures along with the 
ones that segregate public schools and the political system are 
the major remaining apartheid laws 
the separate amenities act became law in 1953 and was repealed 
by parliament in june local communities were given until oct 15 
to comply 
in places like sasolburg a conservative town about 50 miles 
south of johannesburg in the countrys heartland many white 
residents oppose the governments actions 
i think if they open everything up the standard of living is 
going to drop said trevor engelbrecht 43 a taxi driver 
under the new sasolburg law the small number of black employees 
living in white households or worker hostels inside the city of 
27000 can use the pools but not blacks living in the adjacent 
township of zamdela which like most black areas has few 
recreational facilities 
you must take some sort of a measure to prevent 
overcrowding said kim leroux head of the towns community and 
development services he conceded that the end of whitesonly 
regulations monday prompted the new law 
several blacks interviewed on the towns streets were unaware 
the separate amenities act would end monday they also showed 
little interest in the new law restricting use of the pools to 
residents 
its not right its unfair said george mkhwanazi 40 who 
works in sasolburg but lives in zamdela but he said he had no 
plans to use the city pools anyway 
the conservative party has become the main white opposition to 
the national party with its calls for strict segregation including 
separate facilities for blacks and whites 
to our way of thinking the facility provided by taxpayers 
should be controlled in such a manner so that the ratepayers should 
be able to enjoy them said clive derbylewis a top conservative 
party official 
he compared the sasolburg law to similar restrictions in other 
countries where city taxpayers have exclusive use of recreational 
facilities 
the conservatives control 101 of 150 town councils in the 
transvaal province of northern and eastern south africa but few in 
other areas other restrictive measures reportedly adopted in some 
towns include a library fee for nonresidents 
derbylewis said such regulations would effectively bar 
outsiders 
a few days before the laws changed about two dozen whites 
splashed in the water or sunbathed at the twopool complex near 
sasolburgs business district the only blacks inside were workers 
heine de klerk 23 said he supported restricting use of the 
pools to residents because you only get the people who work 
here 
blacks will come here for a while but then theyll stop he 
said itll die out

since its ancient days as the granary of the 
middle east iraqs fortunes have turned on the tides of trade 
international sanctions have changed the rules and now baghdad 
urgently seeks ways to survive alone 
exhorting farmers to grow more and citizens to eat less saddam 
husseins government is trying to wean iraq from a deep dependence 
on imports that range from sugar to spare parts us and british 
analysts say 
with iraqs veil of secrecy drawn even tighter since the 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 however no outsiders have a clear 
picture of how its economy is faring 
many analysts believe iraq can make do until the spring harvest 
despite its preinvasion economic straits and the increasing 
hardship sanctions will cause 
assuming their ability to substitute produce more and ration 
its conceivable they could last six months said sharif ghalib 
of the institute of international finance in washington dc 
it wont be easy said jonathan crusoe who analyzes iraq for 
the middle east economic digest because theyve been addicted 
too long to imports 
iraq once was home to the ancient civilization of mesopotamia 
which built an intricate irrigation system between the tigris and 
euphrates rivers it is a developing country but not a poor one 
per capita annual income is equivalent to about 3000 and the 
planning ministry estimated the 1989 gross national product at 
6619 billion up from 57 billion in 1988 
with its abundant oil water and rainfed farmlands of the 
north iraq is regarded as having the second greatest potential for 
economic development in the region after iran 
development has been hampered however by the costly eightyear 
war with iran that began in 1980 rigid state economic controls and 
extreme dependence on imports and the oil sales needed to pay for 
them its foreign debt is estimated at 75 billion 
this year iraq was spending liberally on the military and 
industrialization despite declines in the price of oil which 
provided 96 percent of its income 
the picture was one of a growing cash squeeze at a time when 
the iraqis were trying to provide both guns and butter said 
ghalib director of the institutes africanmiddle east division 
since the invasion of kuwait iraq has become virtually an 
island economy its foreign assets frozen and oil sales blocked by 
un resolutions in retaliation it is refusing to repay all 
foreign debts 
analysts say the lack of money shouldnt be a problem for iraq 
since there is little for it to buy unless smuggling increases or 
the united nations allows it to receive humanitarian food 
shipments 
iraq had about 65 billion in gold and foreign exchange at the 
time of the invasion the institute in washington said but it does 
not know how much of that was frozen abroad the iraqis are 
believed to have stolen 16 billion in kuwaiti gold and currency 
according to the analysts the key to iraqs future lies in its 
factories and farms now dependent on imports iraq has progressed 
from making simple goods like bricks and blankets 50 years ago to 
heavy industries including a petrochemical plant 
saddam has tried to expand domestic industry and farming let 
us think of ourselves as a country without oil he said in 1987 
in 1989 however manufacturing accounted for only 14 percent of 
gross domestic product the country depends heavily on foreign 
equipment parts and expertise as illustrated by the estimated 1 
million foreign workers and relatives who were in iraq 
few details on industry are available particularly because the 
war with iran put civilian industry undr military authority 
a forthcoming report by the middle east economic digest says 
there is no shortterm way that iraq can start or increase 
domestic output of either spare parts or industrial equipment

members of congress involved with the peace 
talks in angola are being courted by two rival suitors soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and secretary of state james 
baker 
shevardnadze has written two democratic representatives 
proposing that moscow and washington stop aiding their rival 
clients immediately so that angolas 15year civil war can be 
brought to an end 
baker who in the past has rejected this soviet proposal wrote 
lawmakers urging them to keep supporting the antigovernment rebels 
so that the sovietbacked government stays at the negotiating table 
until peace is achieved 
the united states and soviet union have started to cooperate 
this year on angola and chances look better than ever that a 
settlement can be reached but the united states still sends unita 
60 million annually in weapons and the soviets back the luanda 
government with about 10 times that amount 
the united states argues that if it stops the aid now the 
government would be left with a massive advantage over the rebels 
and might exploit that to wiggle out of peace talks 
in a memo last week to the house republican leadership baker 
argued that just when negotiations are bearing fruit would be the 
absolutely worst time to halt aid unita leader jonas savimbi 
made the same argument here earlier this month in talks with 
lawmakers 
shevardnadze however wrote that a mutual aid suspension would 
disabuse them each side of the illusion that by pursuing 
interminable military operations they can buttress their 
negotiating positions and would prompt them to take a more 
constructive attitude at the negotiations 
aid should be cut now even before the sides agree on a 
ceasefire he wrote reps howard wolpe dmich and ronald 
dellums dcalif the sept 23 letter released friday by fenton 
communications which represents the angolan government was 
responding to a letter from the two democrats 
wolpe chairman of the house subcommittee on africa and 
dellums chairman of the congressional black caucus are among a 
growing number of lawmakers opposing the bush administrations 
renewal of aid to unita in the fiscal year that began oct 1 
arms for unita enjoyed wide support in congress over the years 
as long as they were viewed as helping to block soviet influence in 
various parts of the world 
but with the decline in soviet power and in its massive military 
support of third world wars congress has begun to rethink us 
support for several such wars including those in afghanistan and 
cambodia 
the house intelligence committee defeated a proposal last month 
to cut off aid to unita but only after baker made hurried calls 
from moscow to several committee members urging them to reconsider

people used to leave their doors unlocked and 
take the kids for strolls along the citys quiet streets north of 
downtown not anymore a mysterious serial killer who has claimed 
five female victims and who police say will likely strike again 
has driven people inside behind locked doors and windows 
there some people have taken to bathing with revolvers nearby 
aware that some of the victims were in the shower or had just 
gotten out when they were stabbed to death with their own kitchen 
knives 
outside the citys normally peaceful university city and 
clairemont neighborhoods are filled with fear 
i cant go out in the street or open the door said lupe 
reyes a 23yearold livein baby sitter in university city 
before we could take the children out to play and we could take 
walks but now we cant go out because of the fear that hes out 
there 
sometimes the doors along the back used to be open she 
said motioning to the back of the house now day and night 
theyre closed 
reyes like so many other women in the neighborhood is wary 
frightened of the man who since january has boldly entered the 
homes of five women between the hours of 8 am and 1 pm 
in each instance the killer entered through an unlocked door or 
window say police who are conducting the largest manhunt in san 
diego history 
about 30 investigators in the nations sixthlargest city are 
sifting through more than 2000 leads that came in after the most 
recent murders the sept 13 slayings of pamela gail clark 42 and 
her 18yearold daughter amber 
amber clark and three other victims were brunettes aged 18 to 
21 authorities speculate that pamela clark was killed because she 
happened to be home with her daughter 
the first victim was 20yearold tiffany paige schultz a san 
diego state university student who moonlighted as a nude dancer 
she was slain in her clairemont apartment in january 
janene marie weinhold 21 who lived just two blocks away was 
killed two months later holly suzanne tarr an 18yearold high 
school student from okemos mich was in town to visit her brother 
when she was killed in april 
experts have put together a profile of the killer that describes 
him as a disorganized opportunist who probably picks his victims on 
the spot they say the fact he uses the victims own knives as 
weapons indicates the murders arent well planned 
a maintenance man who interrupted the attack on tarr described 
the killer to police as 14 to 23 years old with a dark complexion 
closecropped hair and a medium build 
but aside from that information authorities say they have 
little to go on 
we dont have the lead that we need said police capt dick 
toneck were still waiting for someone to come forward and say 
i know this person 
in the meantime toneck said police believe the killer will 
strike again 
i dont think this person is going to leave town toneck 
said i believe hes going to do what hes doing were fully 
aware of the time constraints were fully aware that this could 
take place anywhere 
many residents agree adding they have taken precautions to 
protect themselves some people have even moved away 
after the second murder there was a stream of moving trucks 
going up and down the street said victoria ross 27 who lives 
across the street from the apartment complex where schultz was 
killed 
ross stayed but she has become far more cautious 
every time i come up the stairs i watch around the bend 
thinking that since there were no signs of forced entry in any of 
the murders that maybe he waited outside for his victims she 
said i watch in every direction before i get out of the car 
she also keeps an eye out for strangers notes the license plate 
numbers of cars in the neighborhood and studies newspaper stories 
about the killings 
i want to catch him she said

voters in two states considered abortion 
rights strongholds nevada and oregon will have their convictions 
tested on election day 
in nevada a referendum backed by prochoice advocates would 
preserve a state law protecting abortion rights prohibiting any 
change in the law except by a direct vote of the people that would 
keep the matter out of the hands of the state legislature and 
governor 
one opinion poll found broad support for the prochoice side 
oregon voters meanwhile face two antiabortion measures 
measure 8 sponsored by the conservative political group oregon 
citizens alliance would ban abortions except to prevent the death 
of a woman or in reported cases or rape or incest 
the less stringent measure 10 would require oregon doctors to 
notify a parent at least two days before performing an abortion on 
a minor the measure is sponsored by a coalition that includes 
oregon right to life 
in oregon activists on both sides agree the contest is drawing 
national attention because of the states reputation as an abortion 
rights sanctuary 
twice previously in 1978 and 1986 oregon voters beat back 
ballot measures aimed at restricting state funding for abortions 
the outcome next month may be different polls suggest oregonians 
may defeat the tougher measure 8 but favor measure 10 
antichoicers know that because of oregons long tradition if 
they can win here they can win anywhere said jeanette turk 
executive director of the no on 8 and 10 campaign 
lon mabon chairman of the rival oregon citizens alliance 
agreed if we can do it here it would be sort of a remember the 
alamo to all prolife groups in other states 
i think people will be watching what happens in november to 
see whats the mood of the nation said kathryn kolbert an 
attorney with the american civil liberties union in new york 
nevada statutes currently permit abortions by a physician within 
the first 24 weeks of pregnancy abortions can be performed after 
that only to protect the life or health of the mother 
in nevada campaign for choice organizers gathered more than 
75000 signatures in its successful petition drive 
the push to preserve nevadas abortion statute followed a us 
supreme court ruling last year that gives states more latitude in 
limiting abortion rights granted in the 1973 roe vs wade decision 
nevada adopted a parental notification law in 1985 but its 
implementation has been barred pending a ruling by the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals on its constitutionality 
campaign for choice chairwoman maggie tracey the petition drive 
was spurred by gov bob millers anti abortion stance 
when he said he would sign a bill changing the abortion law she 
said thats when we decided not to gamble and get the matter 
before the voters choose life 90 a statewide antiabortion 
organization wants the legislature to debate the matter the group 
is targeting nevadas large mormon and roman catholic populations 
to help defeat the referendum 
we are trying to cover the entire state and reach every voter 
two or three times said choose life organizer janine hansen 
another group nevada physicians for life argues abortion 
promotes the practice of induced death and will lead to 
widespread use of euthanasia to rid society of the elderly and 
handicapped 
laura fitzsimmons a campaign for choice attorney said a poll 
of 600 registered voters by her group found 77 pecent think 
government should stay out of the controversy sixtyeight percent 
supported a womans right to choose an abortion while 24 percent 
believe abortion should be outlawed 
in oregon a recent telephone survey of 600 registered voters 
conducted for the oregonian newspaper in portland found that 62 
percent opposed a state abortion ban 
but the same poll found 63 percent in favor of measure 10 
requiring parental notification 
the aclus kolbert said the organization is opposed to the 
parental notification measure 
the real intent here is to prohibit abortion she said 
antiabortionists use this as a first step towards that goal 
unlike nevadas parental notification statute measure 10 does 
not include a judicial bypass clause allowing a minor to obtain 
court permission for an abortion if she can show that telling a 
parent is either impossible or would endanger her

the rev arthur gustafson shuffled to the 
pulpit of his small church just like he does every sunday the 
pews were empty just as they are on most sundays 
gustafson the 78yearold leader of the emmanuel evangelical 
covenant church since 1947 is a pastor without a congregation a 
preacher with no one to preach to a shepherd without a flock 
but still he preaches 
if no one is here god is here and he hears prayers 
gustafson said looking across his empty church in this central 
wisconsin community of 9500 people i felt i heard the lord say 
to stay so i stayed 
one by one church members have drifted away and the last 
member of his congregation left town about two years ago even his 
church building owned by the central conference of the evangelical 
covenant church in chicago is for sale 
sometimes we have a number of visitors a family from pine 
river has been coming fairly regularly gustafson said a smile 
covering his bearded face 
when someone is here i am encouraged he added when they 
are not here i just feel this is the way it is and this is the way 
i accept it theres a lot to thank the lord for 
gustafson is the churchs sole supporter donating some of his 
social security check and an investment that earns 62 a month the 
park city baptist congregation in merrill helps with the bills by 
leasing gustafsons church for services sunday morning and evening 
the church was formed almost 100 years ago to meet the needs of 
scandinavians settling in central wisconsin since hes been 
pastor the congregation seldom exceeded 30 people he said it 
has always been a small struggling church 
these days gustafson a frail man of slight build struggles 
with his health too my hearing isnt so good i wear a couple 
of hearing aids 
every sunday gustafson prints six church bulletins listing the 
order of worship and a few announcements 
his service is simple he reads the bible gives a short sermon 
and sings for hymns he plays the melody on a piano with his right 
hand faintly singing the words 
paul nulton pastor of the christ united methodist church in 
merrill believes gustafson hasnt retired because his church and 
its rows of pews with cracking paint are like family 
if he quit preaching he would die nulton said he 
doesnt have a family he doesnt have any other reason to be art 
gustafson unless he is a preacher 
other ministers understand gustafsons devotion and realize that 
for him to get active in another thriving congregation would be 
difficult nulton said 
it would be kind of like a 78yearold person joining a new 
family because his old family died off it just doesnt work that 
way nulton said 
gustafson became a minister after becoming disgruntled with his 
career as a chicago banker more than four decades ago he said he 
had problems because he believes lending on interest is a sin 
the lord will tell him when to retire from the pulpit he adds 
saying church leaders have urged him to move into a retirement 
center in chicago and continue his ministry there 
we will just have to wait and see you know it is interesting 
how we discover the lords will i seem to hear the lord say very 
definitely that i should stay and that is the last word i seem to 
have 
last sunday gustafson prepared enough wine for 12 people to 
drink during communion the churchs celebration of jesus christs 
last supper with his disciples 
no one showed 
i always like to have plenty he said smiling

sen pete wilson is feeling the heat 
if he wins the california gubernatorial race next month one of 
his first duties will be to appoint a senate successor 
wilson a republican is not saying whom he has in mind only 
that hell look for someone who shares his political views 
when the necessity arises i will share it in detail wilson 
said 
sherri bebitch jeffe senior associate at the center for 
politics and policy at claremont graduate school says the issue 
puts wilson in a nowin situation 
he makes one friend and innumerable enemies she said about 
wilsons dilemma if he makes a choice before the election 
wilson and democrat dianne feinstein are locked in a 
neckandneck race for the states top job a recent poll showed 
wilson with a narrow lead of 47 percent to 42 percent for 
feinstein 
feinstein says shes more concerned about wilsons attendance 
record in the senate than whom hell choose as a successor but she 
has challenged him to reveal his choice 
will that successor be prolife or prochoice she asked 
will that successor be promedicare or for more cuts in 
medicare will that successor be prosocial security or not 
speculation on the short list of possible successors includes 
moderate former rep ed zschau the gop nominee who was narrowly 
defeated by incumbent democrat alan cranston in a race for 
californias other us senate seat in 1986 
another is conservative television commentator bruce 
herschensohn who also ran for the senate in 1986 
palm springs mayor sonny bono the shorter half of the former 
singing duo sonny and cher is one of those who has expressed an 
interest in wilsons senate seat 
wilson tries to make light of that 
how about cher wilson said when asked about bono 
wilson is also fighting criticism that hes missing votes in 
washington 
in the senate there are no golden parachutes says 
feinstein the former mayor of san francisco i dont know of any 
other californian who can take two months off to look for another 
job 
like the successor issue wilsons attendance record places him 
in an uncomfortable political position if he stays in california 
he gets accused of absenteeism if he goes to washington he could 
get tied to the budget mess 
its not uncommon for a member of the senate to vote 99 percent 
to 100 percent of the time wilsons attendance record was 92 
percent in 1989 in the fall term wilson missed votes on the david 
souter supreme court nomination middle east resolutions and the 
budget 
he blames his absences on an appendectomy time spent in 
california after the san francisco earthquake and the demands of 
the current campaign 
he said hes missed no votes on which his ballot would have 
affected the outcome and stressed he has kept in touch with the 
white house and senate leaders during the budget process to protect 
californias interests 
responding to questions about his absences wilson says hell 
return to washington to vote on a budget reconciliation bill 
earlier he had said he would return only if his vote were 
critical 
at a recent news conference wilson showed his irritation when a 
reporter noted that at least 30 senators are up for reelection but 
have still voted in washington 
im the only one who is running for governor of california 
wilson snapped you cannot campaign for office in california if 
you are in washington

jerusalems worst nightmare came true last 
week in a shower of rocks and a burst of gunfire 
israeli police fired into a mob of palestinians on hallowed 
temple mount who had stoned jewish worshipers shattering the calm 
cautiously upbeat mood that had enveloped israel since the persian 
gulf crisis began 
despite israels efforts to keep a low profile in the crisis 
the international spotlight abruptly moved from kuwait back to 
jerusalem nations in the un security council took a break from 
denouncing iraq to return to their more familiar practice of 
criticizing israel 
worst of all the united states joined in making the rare 
gesture late friday of voting to condemn israel and ask for an 
investigation 
suddenly the world seems less open to israels argument that it 
is arab militants like saddam hussein and not israels treatment 
of the palestinians that threaten stability in the middle east 
the palestinian uprising which flagged in recent months seems 
likely to revive the temple mount bloodshed in which least 19 
palestinians were killed will escalate things much more because 
you have both nationalist and religious emotions being played 
out said daoud khuttab a palestinian journalist 
acrimony rages within the israeli establishment over the failure 
of police to foresee trouble and their use of live ammunition 
police insist they acted properly given that only 45 officers 
were on hand monday to repel a mob of up to 3000 rioters who had 
attacked peaceful jews in a holy place on a holy day 
already however the israeli press is reporting that very 
senior officers probably will be fired 
while insisting it was the victim of an arab provocation the 
government has shown keen displeasure with the police in an 
unusual step it scuttled an internal police inquiry into the 
shootings and set up an outside investigation 
the probe is less weighty and highlevel than critics demanded 
but much more credible than leaving the police to investigate 
themselves 
whatever the commission finds it is unlikely to bridge the huge 
gap that has always existed and is even starker now between 
jerusalems moslems and jews especially where the temple mount is 
concerned 
to moslems the flattopped hillock is haram essharif from 
which the prophet mohammed rose to heaven the site of the al aqsa 
and dome of the rock mosques it is the ultimate bastion of 
struggle against zionisms inroads 
to jews it is the site of the biblical temple destroyed by the 
romans the western wall all that remains of it is a symbol of 
jewish rebirth as a nation and it is judaisms holiest shrine 
since israel captured the site from jordan in 1967 a fragile 
truce has prevailed whereby jews dont pray on the mount and the 
police keep a distance from its mosques 
a fringe group of zealots called the temple mount faithful wants 
to rebuild the jewish temple but has been rebuffed by rabbinical 
rulings supreme court decisions and police firmness 
the palestinian uprising now nearly three years old has 
sharpened everyones sensitivities so when the faithful announced 
they would march to the mount on the jewish festival of sukkot the 
arabs appear to have taken it as a real threat 
rocks rained down on jewish women children and men in prayer 
shawls causing panic and injuring 28 people 
israel calls it a planned provocation by proiraqi palestinians 
to distract attention from the persian gulf palestinians say it 
was a spontaneous outburst of religious outrage to which police 
responded with far too much force 
according to israel the arabs had prepared piles of rocks and 
moslem clerics incited the mob by loudspeaker moslem authorities 
say the rocks came from a building site already there and that the 
mullahs were pleading for calm 
jews say they heard moslems shouting kill the jews arabs 
arrested by police said they heard jewish zealots shouting death 
to the arabs 
the israelis are in a bind if it was planned as they say why 
didnt their vaunted secret services get wind of it why werent 
the police out in force to head off trouble 
no israeli outside the ultraright fringe seriously contemplates 
rebuilding the temple they know it would cause allout war and 
make israel the worlds outcast yet many moslems are convinced it 
is about to happen 
emmanuel sivan a jewish scholar of arab affairs at hebrew 
university believes the government should condemn such groups as 
the temple mount faithful much more loudly even though the israeli 
public does not taken them seriously 
the arabs dont read us properly and its certainly mutual 
he said in an interview 
teddy kollek the jewish mayor of jerusalem says israel has not 
given the citys arabs a sense of equality 
equal rights dont go along with yeshivot jewish seminaries 
infiltrating into the moslem quarter and yeshiva students urinating 
on the heads of moslems from the second floor to the first he 
told the newspaper maariv in characteristically blunt language 
weve never excelled at generosity we never gave them a 
feeling of equality before the law they were and remained 
secondand thirdclass citizens 
khuttab the palestinian journalist believes the problem might 
have been solved by giving a moslem cleric a walkietalkie with 
which to assure the mosque congregation that no temple mount 
zealots were coming to seize their shrines 
he said in an interview however that there is absolutely no 
communication the zealots are allowed to pursue their goals with 
impunity khuttab said and there is clearly a feeling that the 
israelis are just indifferent to palestinian and moslem 
aspirations

to chants of long live the emir 
kuwaits royal leader convened a conference of kuwaitis in exile 
saturday declaring that the meeting sent a stern message to 
baghdad 
sheik jaber alahmed alsabah choked with emotion at the cheers 
from more than 1000 kuwaiti refugees who gathered in jiddah for 
the threeday conference 
with this meeting oh sons of kuwait you are affirming to the 
unjust enemy and to the entire world the unity and cohesion of the 
people of kuwait in confronting the occupation and categorically 
rejecting it he said 
this conference is the most eloquent response to your enemy 
who usurped your homeland 
the crown prince and prime minister sheik saad alabdullah 
alsabah also addressed the opening session and promised more 
democracy in kuwait once it is liberated 
liberation is our top priority and after liberation we have 
much to achieve sheik saad told the gathering kuwait will 
reinforce democracy and consolidate popular participation the 
political leadership will respond to the aspirations of the people 
regarding the reorganization of the kuwaiti house 
outside jiddahs conference palace hundreds of youths raised 
banners of support for the emir and shouted slogans calling for the 
liberation of kuwait 
they included critics that before the invasion demanded a return 
to the westernstyle democracy prescribed in the 1962 constitution 
the kuwaiti parliament was suspended in 1986 because of pressure 
from opposition deputies at a time when the country was the target 
of a terrorist campaign meant to break kuwaits support for iraq in 
the persian gulf war 
among the items to be discussed in jiddah are ways to intensify 
the opposition to saddams invasion of kuwait on aug 2 and 
annexation 
conference members are expected to reject any iraqi attempt to 
include a national referendum on kuwaits future as part of a 
political solution to the gulf crisis 
the prime minister expressed pride that all kuwaitis regardless 
of their political commitments have rejected the iraqi occupation 
the occupying iraqi forces did not find a single kuwaiti to 
cooperate with them he said 
reports that baghdad would find the opposition figures ready to 
form a government to replace the alsabah rule have never 
materialized 
but some of the critics like prominent former parliament deputy 
ahmed alkhatib have started pushing for democratic reform even 
before the end of the iraqi occupation 
seham yousef of the londonbased campaign to free kuwait said 
the fact that the emirs government allowed criticism is a point 
in favor of the government where else in the arab world will you 
find people being allowed to criticize and live

the united states on saturday urged the people 
of lebanon to support president elias hrawi who has ousted his 
fiercest rival and is trying to restore peace 
a statement by the state department said the united states 
regretted the loss of 13 lives in the battle for beirut that forced 
gen michel aoun to end his 11month mutiny earlier in the day and 
flee to the french embassy 
we hope that this ends a sad chapter of lebanons history and 
that the lebanese people can now move toward reconciliation and the 
rebirth of a united sovereign and independent lebanon the 
administration said 
aouns departure removes a major obstacle toward implementing a 
peace plan adopted last year by the arab league for ending 
lebanons 15year civil war but many enmities still exist not only 
between christians and moslems but among the various sects on both 
sides 
the state department did not make any mention of syrias 
involvement in the fighting 
thousands of syrian troops and hundreds of tanks joined hrawis 
troops in a threepronged ground assault on aouns enclave in 
lebanons christian zone the attack began with two hours of syrian 
air and artillery bombardment of aouns palace east of beirut 
us officials said they were uncertain to what extent syria was 
instrumental in hrawis victory they said there had not been any 
contact with syria in recent days regarding plans for an assault on 
aoun 
the united states and syria have improved their ties 
significantly since damascus joined the international coalition 
against iraq and sent troops to join the multinational usled 
force in saudi arabia 
aouns ouster is expected to make things easier for syria which 
maintains 40000 troops in lebanon and has been vilified by its 
archrival iraq for allegedly contributing to the instability in 
lebanon 
aoun had been supported by iraq and his removal is expected to 
bolster syrias stand in the antiiraq coalition 
the united states has been urging aoun for months to give up and 
let hrawi restore peace but it informed syrias and lebanons 
governments last month that it opposed aouns removal by force 
nonetheless the administration was pleased by the outcome 
now is the time for national reconciliation and a free 
independent sovereign lebanon the state department said 
it reiterated the us call for all foreign forces to leave 
lebanon israel also maintains some troops in southern lebanon 
the american staff of the us embassy in beirut which was 
evacuated last year when their safety was endangered by factional 
fighting will only go back once calm is restored an official 
said for the time being the embassy is staffed only with local 
arab employees

nelson mandela intervened to 
stop a violent confrontation saturday after police fired rubber 
bullets and tear gas at hundreds of black youths 
the african national congress leader rushed to elkah stadium in 
the black township of soweto after riot police blocked some 700 
youths who tried to march to a nearby police station five people 
were injured by rubber bullets but marchers refused to disperse 
police said they fired because the marchers did not have a 
permit to stage a demonstration and ignored orders to disperse the 
marchers had been taking part in a rally to demand release of 
political prisoners 
mandela protested to police at the scene and demanded they pull 
back he then met with police maj gen johann swart at the police 
station 
police said they agreed to release 32 marchers who had been 
arrested 
i was concerned with defusing the situation getting the 
people behind bars released mandela said later at an airport 
press conference before leaving for a visit to india japan and 
australia 
witnesses said mandelas intervention calmed the situation 
mandela later addressed the marchers and said the march would be 
held next weekend 
mandela praised police official swart saying they often worked 
together to solve problems in soweto the sprawling township 
outside johannesburg 
its easy for us to sort out difficult problems he told 
reporters 
mandela also accused the government of attempting to muzzle the 
anc while allowing itself freedom to express opinions and 
criticism he claimed the government violated an agreement with the 
anc not to disclose details of a meeting monday on the political 
situation 
he accused government ministers of attacking the anc and trying 
to discredit the black opposition group he said government actions 
were a threat to efforts to begin talks on ending whiteminority 
rule 
it is quite clear they regard it as a privilege on their part 
to enter into agreements and then break them he said 
the anc and the government have exchanged charges of duplicity 
in recent days they have disagreed over plans to release political 
prisoners the return of exiles and other subjects 
but mandela played down suggestions that the dispute was a 
serious threat to peace talks he said disagreements were 
unavoidable and he believed president fw de klerk was committed 
to political change 
i dont think anyone should be alarmist about this he said 
i am convinced mr de klerk wants peace in this country he 
wants fundamental changes in this country 
de klerk has promised to end apartheid and share power with the 
black majority talks on sharing power are expected to begin early 
next year 
mandela was released from prison in february after serving 27 
years for his actions against the whiteled government

parliament speaker and four security guards killed a day earlier in 
an ambush and suspicion for the killings centered on iraq 
egypt has led arab opposition to iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
rifaat elmahgoub was the first egyptian politician to be 
assassinated since moslem extremists killed president anwar sadat 
at a military parade on oct 6 1980 
a sixth person shot in the attack elmahgoubs driver died 
saturday after being wounded in the stomach back and arms doctors 
said 
president hosni mubarak led a procession of about 1000 mourners 
at saturdays state funeral in cairos nasr city district where 
sadats procession also took place 
security was tight hundreds of military police in red berets 
whiteuniformed security police and plainclothesmen were on hand 
under the constitution the 64yearold speaker was second in 
rank to mubarak who has not named a vice president 
although there was still no claim of responsibility for the 
attack government and outside experts said they suspected either 
terrorists sent by iraq or egyptian moslem extremists 
hassan abubasha a former interior minister in charge of

recent reports said abu nidal who split years ago with the 
palestine liberation organization has moved his headquarters from

gen michel aoun the selfstyled 
liberator of lebanon plunged the country into some of the worst 
bloodshed and destruction in its 15 years of civil war 
in the last 25 months the strongwilled maronite catholic 
general has taken on all comers the syrian army moslem militias 
lebanons new government even fellow christians he considered a 
threat to his authority 
in the end the syrians unleashed their military might to force 
him into surrender and remove a major obstacle to efforts to 
implement an arab league peace plan 
president amin gemayel made aoun army commander in june 1984 at 
49 he was the youngest man to hold the post since lebanons 
independence from france in 1943 
aoun 55 moved center stage sept 22 1988 when gemayel 
ending his 6yearterm with parliament unable to elect a successor 
appointed the general interim prime minister 
moslem leaders rejected aouns appointment syria and the 
moslems recognized prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem 
citing an unwritten convenant in force since independence under 
which the president is always a maronite and the premier a moslem 
in the political vacuum two governments emerged both claiming 
legitimacy 
in april 1989 aoun sought to impose his authority by ordering 
the closure of all illegal ports run by militias the syrians and 
the moslems responded by blockading the christian enclave north of 
beirut 
within days aoun launched a war of liberation to drive the 
syrians out of lebanon the syrians were in lebanon under a 1976 
arab league peacekeeping mandate 
for six months aoun and the syrians fought the heaviest 
artillery battles in the civil war nearly 1000 people were killed 
and more than 2700 were wounded mostly civilians 
aouns 19000 troops fought a lopsided war against the syrians 
who have 40000 men in lebanon and their moslem allies 
the carnage ended in september 1989 with a ceasefire 
ironically it was aouns actions that galvanized the first 
concerted arab effort to end the civil war in which some 150000 
people have been killed 
in october 1989 the parliament met in extraordinary session in 
taif saudi arabia and endorsed an arab league plan to share power 
equally between lebanons moslem majority and the traditionally 
dominant maronites 
elias hrawi was elected president nov 24 to implement the plan 
aoun refused to recognize him because of his syrian backing and 
rejected the peace accord because it did not provide for the 
complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon 
hrawi sacked aoun as army commander and interim premier but the 
general refused to step down 
the world can smash me he declared in february but they 
cant force me to approve of taif 
despite the violence he unleashed aoun remained widely popular 
among the beleaguered maronites 
on jan 30 aoun began fighting the militia of samir geagea a 
onetime medical student who was the only christian with the 
firepower to challenge him 
when the fighting halted several weeks later aouns forces were 
left with an 80squaremile enclave northeast of beirut with no 
outlet to the mediterranean for supplies 
aoun was further isolated when geagea recognized the taif accord 
and hrawis presidency 
the end came swiftly early saturday when syrian patience 
finally cracked 
aoun always maintained he was fighting to kcck foreign armies 
out of lebanon and reunite his tortured homeland his opponents say 
he was on a power trip and disparagingly dubbed him napolaoun 
asked in a recent interview how he reconciled the death and 
destruction he triggered in the country he claimed to be trying to 
save he said 
sometimes the innocent have to pay the price for liberty 
over the years the general survived several assassination 
attempts the last one friday night when a gunman shot at him 
during a rally aoun was not hit but he appeared doomed

the fountain in the living room had 
to go but real state developer stefan hemming says the rest of 
liberaces desert retreat will be restored with the spirit of the 
pianist in mind 
it was strictly liberace fashion hemming said of 
spanishstyle homes interior design it was very colorful it 
was done some years ago youd do different things in the 60s and 
70s than you would today 
the entertainer known as much for his outlandish lifestyle as 
his music invested heavily in real estate 
by the time he died in 1987 from complications of aids 
liberaces property included a mansion and shopping center in las 
vegas a home at lake tahoe and a fivestory office building in los 
angeles 
he wanted casa de liberace in palm springs to become a museum of 
liberace memorabilia but the idea struck a sour note with the city 
council which rejected a request for a zoning permit because it 
would have disrupted the ambiance of the old residential 
neighborhood 
hemming a san francisco businessman said he fell in love with 
the house while attending a party there when the sultan of 
schmaltz was still alive 
after liberaces death he bought the 7000squarefoot home 
at the reduced price of 750000 because he like the whole 
feeling of it 
he hopes to have casa de liberace restored by christmas 
the work of hemming and his crew of designers and crafts people 
is a constant source of discovery 
take the bathrooms for example hemming thought there were nine 
of them until he stumbled upon another adjacent to the laundry 
room 
i cant keep track of all them he said chuckling 
then there are the wash basins not a plain sink of any 
kindand of course there are hundreds of light bulbs 
everywhere thousands probably 
some of the restorative changes have been as simple as taming 
the overgrown garden fixing leaky faucets and polishing the 
5foottall french bronze chandelier hemmings also ordered custom 
rugs to cover the lime and rustcolored cermic tiles in the living 
room its a very busy pattern a little goes a long way 
the biggest change however has been the removal of the 
6footwide octagonal fountain in the living room 
it didnt belong there hemming said he had it 
disconnected and filled it with plastic flowers 
since one can add little to a home with a bell tower cloisters 
and six fountains hemming plans no architectural additions 
memorabilia however is a different story even though hes 
collected a few items from the neighbor next door who owns the 
house where the entertainers mother once lived there is one thing 
he has enough of for now 
i have more candelabras than i have fountains he said

thanks to recent heavy rains officials 
have ended unprecedented waterrationing measures imposed last 
month on pilgrims visiting the spring at this worldfamous shrine 
under the rules imposed sept 19 visitors were asked to take 
away with them only one small container of water but officials 
said saturday that pilgrims once again could take as much of the 
water as they could carry 
the increased water supply was attributed to the recent rains 
and the end of the main pilgrimage season 
more than 4 million pilgrims come each year to lourdes where 
according to roman catholic tradition the virgin mary appeared 
repeatedly before a 14yearold girl in 1858 
a spring was found at the site and thousands of people who 
subsequently prayed and bathed in its waters said they were healed 
a medical bureau established at lourdes has categorized as miracles 
65 of the cures attributed to pilgrimages to the shrine

democrats who control both houses of congress 
are ready to battle over a bill that would cut the budget deficit 
by 500 billion over five years 
the house gop are debating whether they should sit out the fight 
because of the allout opposition to higher taxes or offer a 
substitute plan with almost no chance of passing 
senate republicans are more inclined to side with president 
bush who swallowed his notaxincrease pledge in the interest of 
slashing the deficit 
if we could do it all through spending restraint that would 
be ideal said senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
thats not going to happen 
a showdown could come as early as wednesday in the house and 
thursday in the senate 
house democrats trying to take back a big part of the wealth 
that shifted into the hands of higherincome americans over the 
past decade are pushing a 149 billion tax increase 
nearly twothirds of that would fall on the 13 million or so 
couples and individuals with incomes above 50000 a year 
in the senate where democratic control is not nearly so solid 
the finance committee picked up backing from most of its gop 
members in approving a 142 billion tax increase about 40 percent 
of which would be paid by those earning more than 50000 the 155 
bipartisan vote on the middleoftheroad plan came early saturday 
morning 
there is another glaring difference between the two bills 
the liberal house plan wouldnt touch the gasoline tax and 
sponsors admit the reason is purely political the senate version 
would raise the 9centagallon tax by 9 cents a gallon over the 
next 15 months 
the tax increase that house democrats chose to replace the 
gasoline tax would not be as obvious but it would hit every person 
who files an income tax return 
it would forgo next years annual adjustment in the income tax 
rates and personal exemptions designed to offset inflation to 
prevent bracket creep that can give the government an 
everincreasing share of any costofliving pay raise 
thus more income would be taxed at higher rates the personal 
exemption would be about 100 less than present law provides for 
1991 and taxpayers would turn over another 36 billion 
both bills would raise taxes on cigarettes alcohol airplane 
tickets and such luxury items as expensive cars planes and 
jewelry 
either would require the 33 million medicare beneficiaries to 
pay more each month for part b insurance for doctors bills and to 
pay slightly more each year before medicare starts picking up the 
tab 
both would hit the insurance industry for about 8 billion in 
extra taxes and require state and local government workers who are 
not covered by a public pension to join social security 
both would cut more than 13 billion in agriculture spending 
the senate bill reflects the homestate interest of sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas chairman of the finance committee it includes 
34 billion worth of tax incentives for the oil industry aimed at 
reducing us dependence on imported energy 
after nearly two years of bashing bushs efforts to cut 
capitalgains taxes which apply to profits from investments house 
democrats sought to broaden support for their bill by including a 
capitalgains reduction of their own but its aimed to help 
middleincome americans not provide the incentive to bigdollar 
investors that some economists say is needed 
the bush administration was quick to endorse the senate bill as 
far preferable to the house democratic plan 
this bill is not perfect but it is satisfactory said sen 
bob packwood of oregon senior republican on the finance committee 
sen bill armstrong rcolo reflected the views of most house 
republicans about any bill that would raise taxes when the economy 
is sagging 
im convinced this is really dumb he said 
there also is some discontent among democrats 
sen max baucus dmont voted no because of the gasoline tax 
increase which he said discriminates against his and other rural 
states sen bill bradley dnj wouldnt vote for raising 
medicare charges while giving new tax breaks for wealthy oil and 
energy investors 
the tax increases and medicare changes are only a big piece of 
the packages to cut the deficit which without some action will be 
around 300 billion in 1991 
other committees are making adjustments affecting other 
programs 
all the changes will be packaged into a reconciliation bill 
which after being passed by the house and senate and signed by the 
president would be expected to reduce the deficit by about 40 
billion this year and 500 billion over the next five years 
here in round numbers are the pieces of the package no matter 
which version of the bill congress finally agrees on 
raising taxes in the range of 140 billion to 150 billion over 
five years 
slowing the growth of discretionary spending programs that 
can be reduced without changing any law by about 182 billion 
those programs range from the military budget to finding a cure for 
cancer 
reining in entitlements by about 106 billion those are 
programs that guarantee benefits to any person meeting certain 
qualifications and thus may not be cut without changing a law 
they include medicare food stamps and farm subsidies 
those changes would be expected to reduce the governments 
borrowing needs and thus cut its interest payments by as much as 
70 billion

proposed cuts of more than 13 billion in the 
agriculture budget over the next five years would mean smaller 
government checks for farmers who plant federally subsidized crops 
the plan would be part of the overall 500 billion deficit 
reduction package of budget cuts and higher taxes announced by 
congressional budget negotiators 
details were still being discussed saturday but a general 
agreement by the housesenate farm bill conference committee was 
revealed late friday 
house agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas 
had no comment after the tentative agreement was reached 
but sen patrick leahy dvt who chairs both the senate 
agriculture committee and the conference committee blamed 
spendnowsavelater economic policies of the 1980s for the 
deep cuts in government support 
we have made every effort to make these painful cuts as fair 
as possible he said saturday 
other savings proposals include 
reducing subsidized wheat acreage by 15 percent and corn 
acreage by 75 percent in 1991 
shifting 25 percent of rural electric administration direct 
loans to private lenders 
shifting farmers home administration direct loans to private 
lenders on a gradual basis until fmha guaranteed loans are reduced 
to a total 450 million by 1995 
putting 1 percent user fes on loans for dairy sugar tobacco 
peanuts honey wool and mohair 
establishing user fees for the animal and plant health 
inspections service 
like the proposal submitted to the farm bill conference 
committee by house agriculture committee members the agriculture 
plan relies on a socalled triple base approach to save more than 
5 billion over five years 
under the plan farmers would reduce the subsidized crops they 
grow by 15 percent in each of the four years following the 1991 
planting year 
farmers could use that 15 percent of acreage to grow wheat 
corn feed grains rice cotton oilseeds industrial crops 
experimental crops or other commodities not already being grown in 
substantial quantities 
proponents of marketoriented agriculture say that flexibility 
allows the farmer to raise crops according to consumer demand 
rather than because government subsidies are offered 
they say that even though government subsidies will be down 
farm income doesnt have to suffer if market conditions are right 
and farmers plant wisely 
the bush administration has favored that approach since the 
beginning of negotiations on the farm bill last winter but 
congress prefers the safety net to farm income that subsidies 
offer 
the house and senate are being forced into a marketoriented 
approach said a staff member for the agriculture committees 
there are no other places to cut so you have to go into the 
commodity programs 
about 29 billion in savings would be achieved by averaging 
deficiency payments over 12 months instead of the first five months 
after harvest now used for most crops 
deficiency payments are the difference between market price and 
the governmentestablished target price immediately after harvest 
market prices are lowest making that gap wider than later in the 
year

israel said saturday that a un 
resolution condemning it for the deaths of 19 palestinians was 
unfair and the palestine liberation organization said it didnt go 
far enough 
the predictable reactions came a day after a rare unanimous vote 
against israel by the 15member security council the united 
states long a defender of israel in the council departed from its 
usual stance to join in the censure 
this is an incident which never should have happened us 
ambassador thomas pickering said saturday of last weeks killings 
on the temple mount 
malaysias ambassador rasali ismail predicted that beginning 
from now israels protective umbrella will begin to be steadily 
removed 
in the resolution which was passed just before midnight friday 
the council also asked secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to 
send a team of envoys to israel to investigate the slayings last 
week on the temple mount 
the compromise resolution was worked out after five days of 
marathon negotiations that pitted the united states against the 
nonaligned members of the council who supported the plo 
the plo urged its allies to support a resolution that would have 
sent a council team to investigate the killings as a first step 
toward giving the council a direct role in protecting palestinians 
in the occupied territories 
but the united states let it be known it would veto that 
resolution 
a us veto would have shattered americas fragile coalition 
with moderate arab states that support the un economic embargo on 
iraq and have joined the multinational military effort to counter 
new aggression by baghdad 
moderate arabs told the council in speeches last week that 
israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip which it 
seized in the 1967 middle east war is as illegal as iraqi 
president saddam husseins aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
some western diplomats said privately that they believed the plo 
aimed to force a veto from the united states and thus split the 
antisaddam alliance 
the security council tonight grieves for those lost and 
injured condemns the acts of violence both provocative and 
reactive and reaffirms the obligations and responsibilities 
that israel has to protect the safety and rights of palestinians 
pickering said saturday 
last mondays rioting in jerusalem began when arabs on the 
temple mount threw rocks down onto jews praying below at the 
western wall judaisms holiest site 
police moved in to disperse the arabs at first using tear gas 
and rubber bullets then live ammunition 
in addition to the 19 palestinians confirmed dead 140 arabs 
were wounded and 30 jews were injured 
the un resolution condemns especially the acts of violence 
committed by the israeli security forces resulting in injuries and 
loss of human life 
it also refers to the injury of innocent worshipers in an 
implied criticism of the palestinian rockthrowers the plo had 
fought to have that phrase removed 
in tunisia a member of the plos executive committee yasser 
abd rabou said saturday the resolution was insufficient even 
though it condemned the actions of israeli police 
unfortunately we are expecting israel to continue oppressing 
the palestinian people said the plos un observer m nasser 
alkidwa 
a spokesman for israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
israels cabinet would have to decide whether to accept a un 
investigating team which is to report back to the security council 
by oct 24 
the spokesman avi pazner said the un action was without 
any reason or justification since the police opened fire only 
after the stoning 
israels ambassador to the united nations johanan bein said 
the resolution fails to condemn the cause of the tragic events in 
jerusalem an unprovoked arab attack on jewish worshipers 
it is also regrettable that the security council fell into the 
trap laid by saddam hussein and his plo supporters who inspired 
the riots in order to divert attention from iraqs aggression in 
the persian gulf he said 
israeli politicians on both right and left have said security 
forces had advance warning of the riot which they said was 
planned and failed to prepare adequately 
france cosponsored the un resolution with canada britain 
the soviet union zaire ivory coast and finland

the first vietnamese leader to visit here 
since the vietnam war will hold talks in washington this week 
officials said saturday 
foreign minister nguyen co thach will meet wednesday at the 
pentagon with gen john vessey former head of the joint chiefs of 
staff and now the presidents special negotiator on us servicemen 
missing in action from the vietnam war 
also attending the meeting will be state and defense department 
representatives and anne mills griffiths who heads a coalition of 
mia families said officials who asked not to be named 
thachs visit is another in a series of steps taken this past 
year by the administration toward normalizing relations between the 
two countries two weeks ago secretary of state james baker met 
with thach at the united nations in new york the highestlevel 
talks between the sides since the war ended in april 1975 
the administration insists the only agenda for thachs visit is 
to move along the accounting for an estimated 1700 american 
servicemen whose fate is unknown 
the administration says restoration of relations would depend on 
vietnams cooperation in the mia issue and in resolving the civil 
war in cambodia 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in 1978 to oust the khmer rouge 
has withdrawn most of its 140000 troops but must still sign a 
peace treaty being worked out for signature in paris 
vietnams communist leadership hopes the washington visit will 
enhance the prospects for us aid to the impoverished nation and 
help end its international isolation the government still rejects 
democracy and represses opposition but it has moved the economy 
away from the failed communist model to a freemarket system which 
has dismantled collective farming and improved urban living 
standards 
thach will also meet with members of the senate foreign 
relations committee at their invitation 
baker agreed to lift the usual travel restrictions on vietnamese 
diplomats which limit them to a 25mile radius of new york city 
so thach could travel here

composer gian carlo menotti has quit as artistic 
director of spoleto festival usa in a dispute over control of 
the event he created but his decision may not be final 
the 80yearold founder of the annual festival said saturday he 
will stay on if there are changes in the board of directors and 
the board which didnt accept his resignation when it was 
submitted friday is hoping differences can be smoothed over 
i no longer feel it is my festival and this has been my life 
for 15 years menotti said from his manhattan hotel room i 
feel a bit lonely among them the board members im treated 
like the clerk 
menotti is best known in this country for his opera of the 
christmas story amahl and the night visitors in 1977 he 
founded the international arts festival in charleston sc two 
decades after founding the festival of two worlds in spoleto 
italy in an effort to bring together european and us culture 
im not going to go on in an organization where people stand 
against me on artistic matters i must feel my leadership is 
accepted menotti said 
board chairman ross markwardt said frankly im going to let 
the whole thing cool for a few days then ill speak with his 
agent and try to open a dialogue that can result in some kind of 
agreement 
menotti acknowledged he could change his mind though he sounded 
resolute in his decision 
they did not accept my resignation but as far as i am 
concerned im still resigned menotti said 
one issue between menotti and the board involves an 800000 
conceptual art exhibit planned for the 1991 festival menotti 
opposes it 
menotti is in the second year of a threeyear contract as 
artistic director markwardt said it was unlikely menotti would be 
compelled to finish the term 
i cant imagine that this board would have the stomach to do 
anything to harm an 80yearold patriarch who founded this 
festival markwardt said 
menotti said he was meeting privately saturday with festival 
general manager nigel redden who declined to comment about the 
flap markwardt said he hoped this kind of private approach would 
help ease tensions 
it is much more appropriate that this not be turned into a 
business arrangement given the long personal relationships that 
exist he said

in crushing rebel gen michel aoun 
president elias hrawi may have eliminated a main obstacle to a 
peace plan for lebanons 15yearold civil war but his troubles 
are far from over 
hrawi can claim that his authority now extends over much of his 
ravaged country 
but he depends on syrian muscle and goodwill to maintain his 
authority that was underlined by the syrian firepower needed to 
hammer aoun into submission 
the syrians for their part have a history of getting rid of 
allies who dont do as theyre told 
hrawi faces a tough time ahead in consolidating his control and 
implementing the 1989 peace agreement which is still viewed with 
misgivings by many moslems 
hrawi declared in a radio address saturday that a new dawn for 
the republic was born after aoun fled the presidential palace in 
baabda where he had his headquarters in an underground bunker 
that could well be but the syrians still control 70 percent of 
lebanon they have said they will withdraw from beirut and other 
cities to the bekaa valley in east lebanon in the coming months 
but they may never leave lebanon altogether unless there is an 
arabisraeli peace settlement 
the syrians see lebanon which was part of syria under french 
rule until 1943 as vital to their defensive strategy against 
israel 
the israelis occupy a border strip in south lebanon and they 
wont withdraw while there are palestinians and other moslem 
guerrillas operating in the southern panhandle 
there are also several thousand iranian revolutionary guards 
and various palestinian factions based in syrianpoliced east 
beirut 
getting rid of them will not be easy the arab leaguebrokered 
peace accord agreed on in taif saudi arabia provides for the 
traditionally dominant christians sharing power equally with the 
moslem majority 
hrawi last month formally signed political reforms into law but 
the druse and shiite moslems still do not think they are being 
treated fairly and many maronites the dominant christian sect are 
loath to see their traditional privileges stripped away 
the shiites are also deeply divided between among themselves 
the iranianbacked fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god has 
been feuding for the last three years with the more secular 
syrianarmed amal militia 
more than 1000 people have been killed in the power struggle 
for control of the shiite community 
iran and syria its main arab ally recently brokered a new 
ceasefire but there are still scores to settle and an new 
flareup is more likely than not 
the 200000strong druse whose stronghold is in the chouf 
mountains overlooking beirut fear they will be squeezed out by the 
biggest sects 
the palestine liberation organization which carved out a 
stronghold in south lebanon after it was driven out of beirut 
bastions by amal two years ago also is not likely to pay much heed 
to hrawi 
under the peace plan the militias are supposed to be disarmed 
and disbanded but for much of the civil war they have basically 
done what they wanted and carved out their own cantons disarming 
them will not be easy 
only syrian firepower keeps the lid on without it hrawis 
poorly armed forces would find it difficult to take on the veteran 
street fighters 
and even if political stability can be restored hrawi faces the 
awesome task of rebuilding the shattered economy 
much of the infrastructure has been destroyed or damaged 
particularly in fighting triggered by aouns actions 
under the peace plan the saudis were slated to bankroll much of 
the reconstruction but iraqs invasion of kuwait has meant the 
saudis are too involved confronting saddam hussein and underwriting 
a multinational force to bother about the lebanese 
economists estimate hrawi will need 21 billion for 
reconstruction

rebel gunmen killed a government 
militia commander and seven of his men in a raid on a mosque in 
afghanistans western state of herat staterun radio said 
saturday 
kabul radio in its englishlanguage broadcast said at least 22 
people were injured including a member of the iranian consulate in 
herat 
gunmen belonging to the moslem resistance fighting the 
sovietbacked government in kabul stormed the blue mosque friday 
and killed militia commander zahim ahmad and his men as they were 
praying the radio said 
extremists launched an inhuman and criminal attack on the 
mosque and martyred eight people including commander zahim ahmad 
and wounded 22 people said the radio monitored in islamabad 
midia the pakistanbased news agency of the guerrillas 
governmentinexile confirmed rebel fighters had killed ahmad and 
other notorious communists but denied the attack occurred in 
the mosque 
the mosque was not damaged the ambush took place on a road 
north of the mosque the agency said 
the usbacked guerrillas known as mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors have been fighting for 12 years to unseat the 
communiststyle government in kabul 
ahmad the leader of a militia force of about 5000 was a 
guerrilla fighter before he signed a nonaggression pact and 
switched to the governments side three years ago 
ahmad wielded considerable influence with the provincial 
government in herat which borders iran and the soviet union he 
had been critical of the mujahedeen leaders based in pakistan 
diplomatic and guerrilla sources in pakistan say ahmads murder 
could be linked to intermilitia rivalries or to avenge the murder 
of another militia commander who was killed in a similar incident 
in herat in august no one claimed responsibility for that attack

israel was angered by the security councils 
condemnation of the killing of 19 palestinians but has not decided 
whether to reject a un investigating mission a government 
spokesman said saturday 
the council resolution friday night condemned the violence 
committed by the israeli security forces in mondays riot at the 
temple mount us approval of the resolution appeared to mark a 
shift in its policy toward israel 
avi pazner a spokesman for prime minister yizhak shamir said 
the resolution was without any reason or justification since 
police opened fire after a stoning attack by palestinians that 
injured more than 30 jewish worshipers and police 
he said that he did not know if the government would accept the 
resolutions call for emissaries of the un secretarygeneral to 
investigate the deaths 
i cant say if we will accept this mission the cabinet will 
have to decide pazner said the resolution would be discussed at 
a cabinet meeting sunday he said 
shamir said earlier that a un investigation of the rioting on 
the temple mount would infringe on israels sovereignty over 
jerusalem the mount holy to both moslems and jews is in arab 
east jerusalem which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war 
and then annexed 
jerusalem is the pupil in the eye of the jewish people i 
think it would be a real crime to allow anyone to damage the 
sovereignty of a hebrew jerusalem shamir said in a radio 
interview broadcast saturday but taped before the security council 
decision 
the councils resolution did not specifically mention a un 
mission to jerusalem but referred only to a visit to the 
region 
nafez essala head of the palestinian center of nonviolent 
studies in jerusalem praised the councils resolution but had 
reservations about its real worth 
if israel says they wont accept the un delegation will the 
un impose an embargo or send troops to force israel to accept it 
i dont think so essala said 
pazner said that the un condemnation of israel for the 
palestinian deaths 19 20 or even more than 20 according to some 
versions played into the hands of another of israels strongest 
enemies iraqi president saddam hussein 
the foreign ministry issued a reaction to the security council 
vote that warned the resolution could further inflame the middle 
east 
one can only hope that the arab extremists who formented these 
riots will not view this resolution as an internationally 
sanctioned license to further violence the statement said 
questions have been raised in jerusalem about whether the 
rioting was planned by palestinians or a spontaneous reaction to 
rumors that a group of jewish zealots was planning a march on the 
temple mount 
israel officials first said palestinians planned in advance to 
hurl a barrage of rocks at jewish worshipers below the mount at the 
wailing wall judaisms holiest site 
but police commissioner yaacov terner later said he believed the 
riot was spontaneous 
the rioting was the bloodiest single incident in jerusalem since 
israel captured the citys arab sector from jordan in 1967 as well 
as in the 34month palestinian uprising 
at least 760 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the revolt against occupation an additional 278 
palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of 
collaborating with israel fortyeight israelis have died in the 
violence

thousands of iraqi children burned 
effigies of president bush and british prime minister margaret 
thatcher outside their embassies in baghdad on saturday the iraqi 
news agency said 
the children also burned british and american flags and 
delivered letters to both missions protesting the economic siege 
imposed by the united states and its allies against the iraqi 
children 
the protests occurred on iraqs national childrens day which 
commemorates an oct 13 1987 iranian missile attack on a baghdad 
primary school that killed 39 children during the 19801988 
iraniraq war 
iraqi president saddam hussein on saturday visited the school 
located in baghdads dora district according to the new agency 
monitored in nicosia 
the protest letters said that depriving children of food 
medicine and vaccinations under the un economic embargo on iraq 
violated international human rights agreements and declarations on 
the rights of children 
the un imposed the trade embargo to force baghdad out of 
kuwait which iraq invaded aug 2 and then annexed 
we call upon you to retreat from this uncivilized course and 
end the blockade imposed for the purpose of subjecting iraqi 
children to hunger and endangering their health and lives the 
letters said 
we also urge you to withdraw your forces and fleets from our 
lands and arab waters 
iraqi authorities have been claiming there is a milk shortage 
but western journalists who traveled to baghdad recently saw stores 
stocked with milk 
in his visit to the school saddam met with teachers and 
students and wished the pupils success in service of the great 
objectives of iraq the news agency said 
teachers pupils and their relatives gathered in front of 
school to express pleasure over his excellencys visit it said 
in a nationally broadcast address marking childrens day saddam 
on friday urged the children to understand the candy and milk 
shortages caused by the trade embargo 
i know that you like sweets despite the harm they cause to 
your beautiful teeth and that the younger among you live on 
imported milk saddam said in the speech read by an announcer on

as the world changes so des the nobel 
peace prize 
once the domain of western statesmen recipients in recent years 
have come from a range of backgrounds and regions such as tibets 
exiled dalai lama last year and mother teresa in 1979 
gidske anderson norwegian nobel committee leader said members 
no longer look just to the western world but to the whole 
world 
what is new is the peace prize encouraging human rights 
said nobel institute director geir lundestad noting the awards 
that have gone to the dalai lama and to lech walesa leader of 
polands solidarity movement among others 
the prize could be awarded for the 71st time on monday since 
the first peace prize in 1901 it has been withheld 19 times most 
recently in 1972 
the 1990 winners name if there is one remains a closely 
guarded secret until ms anderson makes the announcement at the 
nobel institute in oslo 
ms anderson said she often finds speculation beforehand a 
little amusing 
norways news media has suggested soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev czechoslovak president vaclav havel south african 
antiapartheid leader nelson mandela or chinese prodemocracy 
activist chai ling 
others mentioned as possible candidates include former president 
reagan pope john paul ii and german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher 
nominations for 74 individuals and 26 organizations were 
received by the feb 1 deadline 
ms anderson would not say if the 1990 award would be 
surprising 
but there is always someone who will criticize the choice 
its perfectly natural there are a lot of opinions in the world 
she said 
before 1960 the only winner from outside north america or 
western europe was argentine negotiator carlos de saavedra lamas 
who helped settle a conflict between paraguay and bolivia 
but six of the past 10 winners were from other parts of the 
world including costa rican president oscar arias sanchez in 1987 
south african bishop desmond tutu in 1984 and mexican disarmament 
champion alfonso garcia robles who shared the prize in 1982 
the office of un high commissioner for refugees was awarded 
the prize in 1981 
the prize was founded by alfred nobel a swede who invented 
dynamite and hoped the power of his find would force the world to 
disarm the prize is always awarded in oslo on the dec 10 
anniversary of his death in 1896 
no one is certain why nobel picked norway for the peace prize 
the awards for science and literature are given in sweden 
nobels will said the peace prize should recognize those who had 
arranged peace conferences negotiated disarmament or encouraged 
brotherhood between nations 
the committee has a great deal of latitude said lundestad 
but three basic categories emerged quickly humanitarians peace 
activists and world statesmen 
the prize carries a prize of 4 million swedish kroner about 
700000 at the present exchange rate 
i dont think the money is that important for someone like 
tutu or walesa its prestige gives them a whole new dimension they 
can no longer be ignored by their governments said anderson 
yet choices can provoke anger 
china threatened sanctions against norway after the dalai lama 
was named the award was seen as a slap at china for the june 4 
1989 massacre of prodemocracy students in beijing and its 30year 
occupation of tibet 
adolf hilter was so enraged by antinazi journalist carl von 
ossietzky winning the prize in 1935 that he decreed no german could 
ever accept one the nobel foundation sometimes awards a prize 
retroactively and ossietzky received it in 1936 
the fivemember nobel committee appointed by norways 
parliament for overlapping sixyear terms does not answer to the 
government 
one tradition that has become stronger in the last decade is 
that any kind of campaign for a candidate has the opposite 
effect ms anderson said it makes us suspicious 
nor is timeliness of events such as the 1989 prodemocracy 
reforms in eastern europe a key consideration 
if a nomination cant last a year then it wasnt worthy 
ms anderson said 
no organization can always be on the mark but i think the 
nobel committee has a pretty good overall record of finding worthy 
winners lundestad said

among reservists nationally 
ive never heard of another father mother and son serving 
together in the same unit gordon said 
walter hall 39 an assistant platoon sergeant and rotha hall 
a tank farm supervisor joined the reserve unit together 14 years 
ago mrs hall wouldnt give her age 
i had just gotten out of the army and decided to join when we

people run up either his wife added its worked out really 
well weve used our reserve pay to buy clothes for the kids and to 
buy a car

inability to conceal his cigarette habit from his parents are the 
only problems hes had since joining the reserve unit three years 
ago

but all im thinking about is leaving my girlfriend behind 
the halls learned they could be called up in august while the

troops invaded kuwait 
weve made out our wills and told our other children what to 
do if something happens rotha hall said they told us we could 
be away six months or a year if war breaks out they said we could 
be there for the duration 
that possibility doesnt sit well with the halls two daughters 
and two other sons 
i hate this said lea pyles one of the halls daughters 
ive never really been away from my parents for any length of 
time we grew up with them going to summer camp but this is

federal agents seized 3 million deposited in a 
bank account by an iraqi broker who the government claims broke 
federal law by shipping aircraft parts from the united states to 
libya 
the late ihsan barbouti wired the 3 million to manufacturers 
hanover trust co in new york to finance the illegal export of the 
aircraft parts according to a federal complaint filed in new york 
barbouti was a londonbased architect who designed a chemical 
weapons plant in rabta libya he died in london in july of heart 
and lung complications 
the dallas morning news reported friday that last year barbouti 
ordered parts identified in documents as replacement equipment for 
ch47 chinook helicopters c130 cargo planes and frenchmade 
mirage jet fighters they were shipped from miami to brazil where 
a barbouti associate then shipped the equipment to libya according 
to the complaint 
the seizure of assets last week stems from an ongoing us 
customs investigation federal investigators have been trying to 
unravel the intricate domestic holdings of the international 
middleman who described himself as a procurement broker for col 
moammar gadhafis government in libya 
don de gabrielle a federal prosecutor in houston confirmed the 
oct 4 seizure of the 3 million but declined to say whether 
barboutis role in the parts transactions has been presented to a 
grand jury 
the news reported last month that the arms deal was part of a 
pattern of purchases and investments by barbouti apparently 
designed to divert american technology to libya and iraq 
barbouti held interests in hightech companies based in houston 
dallas oklahoma and boca raton fla the newspaper reported 
the news also reported that interest among federal law 
enforcement agencies in those investments and purchases was 
heightened by iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
at least three american businessman with whom barbouti did 
business told the newspaper that barbouti intended to export 
technology from their companies to libya 
among barboutis american investments was product ingredient 
technology inc a manufacturer of cherry flavoring in boca raton 
fla last month the newspaper reported that a waste byproduct in 
the making of cherry flavoing was hydrogen cyanide a lethal 
compound easily converted for use as a chemical weapon 
peter kawaja a hightech security consultant and former 
employee of barboutis said some of the deadly compound was taken 
out of the united states to a destination he declined to identify 
as in the case of the aircraft parts the export of such 
technology would violate a 4yearold presidential order that bars 
the export of any goods technology or services from the united 
states to libya 
according to a customs document barboutis plan involved the 
purchase of what he claimed was automobile parts from brazil the 
customs claim says barbouti admitted in litigation in florida and 
new york that the 3 million really for the purchase of aircraft 
parts for shipment from brazil to libya

congressional investigators have joined 
state officials in seeking more precise data on two leaky 
radioactivewaste storage tanks at the hanford nuclear reservation 
the energy department said thursday that a damaged waste tank at 
hanford may have leaked 800000 gallons of radioactive cooling 
water into the soil since being ruptured in a 1965 explosion 
on friday operator westinghouse hanford said almost 1 million 
gallons of radioactive waste and water were pumped between 1963 and 
1967 into another underground tank that had leaked about 2400 
gallons of liquid in 1962 
the two singleshell tanks are about 5 miles apart on the 
560squaremile nuclear reservation in southcentral washington 
we dont have the full story yet said don provost 
wastemanagement director for the state department of ecology 
provost said the state needs extra leak data so it knows how 
much work is required under a 30year federal plan for cleaning up 
the entire hanford site which westinghouse hanford began operating 
for the energy department in 1987 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress also wants to know what they the operators knew and 
when they knew it said vic rezendes the agencys chief of 
energy issues 
the 1965 explosion caused tank 105a to leak and the radioactive 
wastes inside to overheat the department reported a year ago that 
the tank had leaked 5000 gallons of liquid since it ruptured 
the new estimate shows 832000 gallons of cooling water were 
pumped into the tank between 1965 and 1978 when the work stopped 
the energy department estimates 40000 to 200000 gallons may have 
evaporated through vents leaving 632000 to 792000 gallons still 
in the soil 
hanford waste engineer johnnie newsom said officials were still 
going through old records to determine how much waste was leaked 
the energy department has agreed to turn over any additional 
records to the state 
energy department spokesman ken morgan said there was an 
honest attempt to provide all the information on the tanks 
though he said the data may prove incomplete 
the other tank 108sx was pumped dry in 1980 and is no longer 
in service it cannot yet be determined how much of its contents 
may have evaporated or leaked but a westinghouse investigation 
continues said richard raymond westinghouse manager of 
singleshell tanks 
hanford has 177 underground waste storage tanks they were used 
to store radioactive waste generated in four decades of producing 
plutonium for nuclear weapons

israeli officials said saturday they regretted 
the syrian invasion of the christian enclave in lebanon but did not 
consider it cause for an israeli move against syria or lebanese 
forces 
past reports have said syrian use of air power in lebanon could 
lead to an israeli attack but uri lubrani israels coordinator in 
lebanon said the attack that forced rebel gen michel aoun to 
surrender was not enough to force israels hand 
the syrians know very well israels red lines it is true that 
they used planes but this is the use of force in order to do 
something inside lebanon lubrani said on israel television 
we are sticking to the position that anything that doesnt 
threaten our security doesnt obligate us to make any move that 
would be seen as interference in lebanons internal affairs 
he added we are sorry that it came to the use of violence and 
the entrance of syrian forces into the christian enclave we hope 
that these forces will leave as quickly as possible 
israel carved out a 2 to 10mile wide strip in southern lebanon 
in 1985 to act as a buffer against guerrilla attacks when it 
withdrew the bulk of its forces from lebanon following its 1982 
invasion 
a 3000man south lebanon army led by general antoine lahad 
patrols the zone backed by about 1000 israeli troops 
binyamin beneliezer a parliamentary leader said aouns 
surrender would have little affect on the security of israels 
northern border despite the christian south lebanon armys close 
relations with aoun 
dont forget that lahad is supported that his back leans 
totally on israel beneliezer said 
israel radio said residents of southern lebanon had turned to 
the israeli army officers to protect christians in beirut from 
reprisals in the wake of aouns defeat 
israeli military sources said such appeals could not be granted

when the natural springs that had fed this 
west texas region for millennia dried up in the 1930s lake lubbock 
vanished with them 
but the lake has not been forgotten its legacy was in helping 
to preserve a treasure store of artifacts of human and animal life 
dating back more than 11000 years archaeologists say 
the arid windswept plains of west texas were once rich with 
grasslands inhabited by huge hairy mammoths 3foottall armadillos 
and bears three times the size of a grizzly lake lubbock has 
provided the proof 
a 300acre site northwest of lubbock centered on where the lake 
once existed has been turned into a state park that has been 
designated as a federal historic site the lake lubbock landmark 
opens sunday 
some archaeologists regard it as the premier site of its kind in 
north america over the last 50 years researchers have unearthed 
evidence that the area has been continuously inhabited for more 
than 11000 years 
the site basically is little packages of time stacked one on 
top of the other said eileen johnson the parks director you 
can study mans entire existence in the new world in one spot 
instead of having to go to 100 different sites 
researchers have been able to identify soils vegetation pollen 
records wildlife and human culture from fossils excavated at the 
site 
among the bigger finds have been an ancient shortfaced bear a 
giant armadillo and mammoths 
the giant armadillo was truly texassize ms johnson said 
it was 3feettall and 6feetlong 
researchers have also identified the remains of prehistoric 
plants fish amphibians reptiles and birds she said 
while researchers have found evidence of human life projectile 
points bone tools manufacturing debris processing areas 
slaughter sites and an oven the most fantastic thing is that no 
human remains have ever been found said robert a nash a 
longtime supporter and namesake of the landmarks interpretive 
center 
that would be the find of the century if they found a skull of 
the socalled clovis or folsom man he said 
amid the sprawling acres are a museum documenting the site and a 
research lab occupied by archaeological students from texas tech 
university 
after visitors pass through the museum filled with murals of 
ancient life photographs and fossils they are encouraged to walk 
through the excavation sites picnic tables and grills are set up 
for barbecues 
the park is a collaborative effort by the texas parks and 
wildlife department texas tech and the city of lubbock the state 
agency leases the property from the city and texas tech provides 
the research 
we know only 5 percent of what is out there ms johnson 
said its aweinspiring and exciting to think we will be 
uncovering and learning here for years and years to come 
scholars from around the world were expected to attend the 
parks formal opening 
john albanese a wyomingbased geologist and independent 
consultant for archaeological sites said the park is the premier 
site in terms of the quality and quantity of the old material that 
has been found there 
its one of the better preserved records of early man in north 
america he said

iran and iraq were to open embassies in 
each others capitals sunday marking another step in the 
rapprochement of the two nations after a decade of hostility the 
tehran times reported 
iraqi president saddam hussein is seeking iranian help in 
puncturing the comprehensive economic embargo slapped on him by the 
united nations to force his pullback from kuwait 
quoting an informed source the englishlanguage newspapers 
sunday edition said the two nations agreed to establish missions 
during the current tehran visit by iraqi deputy foreign minister 
wisam alzahawi 
the source said the level of representation would be at the 
charge daffaires level for the time being 
iranian political circles believe tehrans first envoy will be 
javad turkabadi irans former charge daffaires in kuwait 
turkabadi currently heads the iranian foreign ministrys persian 
gulf affairs desk 
there was no word on who the first iraqi envoy would be 
iran and iraq agreed to reestablish diplomatic ties during a 
september visit to tehran by iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
it was the first visit by an iraqi official since before the 
1979 islamic revolution that overthrew iranian shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi 
a year later war broke out between the two nations a 
unbrokered peace was made in 1988 
iraq has been seeking the help of neighboring states to 
circumvent the un sanctions since its coastline is effectively 
blocked by the usled multinational fleet in the gulf 
iraq and iran share a 700mile border and although tehran has 
condemned saddams invasion of kuwait there have been reports iran 
was allowing food shipments across the border 
iran could be of even greater help if it helps iraq ship its 
oil which accounted for more than 95 percent of iraqi foreign 
exchange earnings before the embargo 
the embargo and blockade have shut down iraqi exports but iran 
could use the pipeline to its kharg island terminal in the gulf to 
carry iraqi oil from across the nearby border

a greenpeace ship seized by the soviets 
after it approached an arctic nuclear test site was released 
saturday and headed for norway a member of the environmental group 
said 
none of the 42 activists detained were charged following more 
than five days at a naval base near the port of murmansk about 900 
miles north of moscow canadian activist steve shallhorn said by 
radiotelephone from the ship 
the ship was expected to reach the norwegian port of kirkenes by 
early sunday 
last monday the soviet coast guard fired warning shots from 
deckmounted machine guns before boarding the mv greenpeace 
four environmentalists in a rubber raft had earlier managed to 
reach one of the novaya zemlya islands in the barents sea and 
collect radioactive soil and other samples shallhorn said 
the ship was towed to the naval base where it was held for 
violating soviet territorial waters 
shallhorn said the four activists spent 10 hours on the island 
before being captured novaya zemlya was a primary nuclear test 
site from 1958 to 1963 environmental groups claim it was last used 
in 1988 
they tried to hide samples in their packs their pockets even 
their socks but the soviets went through everything with a 
geiger counter and found everything shallhorn said 
he said the 35 western and seven soviet activists had been 
generally treated well during the detention and were guarded by at 
least 13 armed men under kgb command 
the greenpeace was ordered to leave soviet territorial waters 
following an investigation by the kgb security police and the 
soviet prosecutors office the soviet news agency tass reported 
the vessel was on a twoweek antinuclear protest voyage along 
the arctic coastline 
on wednesday soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
gerasimov said the soviet union agreed with the greenpeace goal of 
ending nuclear weapons testing but he said no matter what the 
mission or how noble the objectives may be the laws of our country 
cannot be violated with impunity 
according to greenpeace officials in london novaya zemlya was 
chosen for the protest because of fears it would again become a 
major test site after the closing down of the soviet unions main 
test range in the kazakhstan republic in central asia 
the site is about 370 miles from norway unconfirmed reports 
that nuclear tests would be resumed there prompted protests from 
nordic governments

the citys bestknown abortion clinic has 
closed after authorities seized its equipment for failing to pay 
federal fines the penalties were ordered because clinic doctors 
illegally prescribed drugs 
the clinics lawyer contends the seizure was more than a matter 
of 337000 in fines but a stroke against abortion 
ive talked to people all over the country and this is the 
only time this has ever happened said charles cotton an 
attorney for delta womens clinic after its equipment and 
furniture were seized friday 
the us marshals service said it will auction the confiscated 
items to collect on fines set in march by us district judge 
adrian duplantier 
the judge agreed with federal prosecutors that three doctors 
illegally prescribed sedatives and painkillers at the clinic the 
physicians were licensed to prescribe the drugs but had not 
registered to do so at the clinic 
clinical leasing services inc which owns the clinic filed for 
protection from its creditors in may but thursday federal 
bankruptcy judge thomas kingsmill dismissed the petition saying it 
was filed in bad faith 
cotton said he hadnt been told of the ruling when the clinics 
assets were seized 
the speed rapidity and zeal in which this was handled leads 
us to believe it was more than a simple execution of a judgment 
cotton said 
this is an attempt to circumvent roe vs wade and an attempt 
to abrogate womens right to choose an abortion cotton said the 
clinic opened in 1973 after the us supreme court ruling that 
legalized abortion 
first assistant us attorney al winters jr said the government 
simply went after a debt it was owed we are collecting the civil 
judgment as required by law winters said 
us attorney john volz has denied repeatedly that his office 
sued delta in july 1989 to shut it down 
cotton said the clinic may stay closed until the courts can hear 
an appeal 
clinical leasing services said in the spring that it wanted to 
appeal the court ruling but could not afford the fine or an appeal 
bond 
the bond would have kept the case in court and prevented the 
seizure of assets 
in april the government seized about 40000 from clinic 
accounts cotton said 
volz has said that federal authorities began looking into the 
clinics operations in august 1988 and had warned officials that 
physicians had to be registered to dispense drugs at the clinic 
duplantier ordered fines of 300000 against the clinic for 100 
instances in which doctors prescribed sedatives and painkillers 
the judge also fined the clinic 37000 for 37 instances of 
alleged failure to list addresses of patients who had received 
drugs 
duplantier also fined the doctors a total of 278000 they are 
appealing the fines

a russian orthodox service reverberated across red 
square from the brightly colored onionshaped domes of st basils 
cathedral on saturday night for the first time since the 1917 
revolution 
in one of the most stirring demonstrations of the revival of 
religion in the soviet union the plaintive chanting of the 
faithful echoed off the kremlins red brick walls floated over 
lenins marble tomb and through much of central moscow on a cold 
clear night 
st basils whose bright yellow green blue and white domes 
and spires are among russias most famous symbols sits on the 
southern edge of the cobblestone square the plaza is bordered on 
the east by the immense gum department store and on the west by the 
kremlin seat of the soviet government 
like many important churches across the country st basils was 
confiscated by the soviet government after the bolshevik 
revolution converted into a museum and closed to religious 
observances 
saturdays service commemorating a ninth century miracle in 
which the mother of god is said to have appeared to soldiers 
defending the city of byzantium was the first allowed in the 
cathedral since 1917 
official tolerance for religion has increased greatly since 
president mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 during the 
last two years in particular many churches have been 
reconsecrated and soviet citizens have flocked to services in 
record numbers 
last month a full service was held in the kremlins uspensky 
cathedral the countrys holiest church for the first time since 
the revolution the soviet legislature also passed a law on freedom 
of conscience formally ending decades of repression 
shortly before nightfall saturday hundreds of people packed st 
basils built in 15551561 by ivan the terrible to celebrate his 
military victory over the kingdom of kazan on russias eastern 
border 
as many as 1000 other worshippers gathered behind police 
barricades outside the church enduring 35degree temperatures 
throughout the threehour service which was projected by two sound 
trucks on the square 
the worshippers stood silently gazing up at the domes 
illuminated by floodlights and periodically making the fourpoint 
sign of the cross across their chests with three fingers in the 
eastern church tradition 
inside the scent of incense filled the cathedral and the 
choirs chanting seemed at times to come from within the walls of 
its eight chapels which represent ivans eight major battles 
against kazan 
among the worshippers saturday was a former kgb general oleg 
kalugin who was stripped of his rank honors and pension last 
summer after he accused the security police of continuing to spy on 
ordinary citizens including clergymen the service was conducted 
by archimandrite pavel of pskov one of the leaders of the russian 
orthodox church which has an estimated 30 million active followers 
among the soviet unions 285 million people 
i am a believer and for us this is a great event in our 
life said vitaly kolesnik 55 a magazine editor i wanted to 
be here on red square when it happened 
it was very sad when this was a museum now there is joy and 
the walls are alive again with prayer said maya besarabskaya

ambitions is at the heart of the trial that on monday enters its 
second week at the multnomah county courthouse 
the metzgers are accused of inciting the beating death of a 
black man by sending agents to portland to preach hate and 
violence 
mulugeta seraw 27 an ethiopian national planning to attend 
college in this country was returning home from a party in 
november 1988 when he was beaten to death with a bat 
three skinheads have pleaded guilty to killing seraw 
now seraws family wants 10 million in damages for his death 
the lead attorney in the civil suit is morris dees a civil rights 
lawyer from the southern poverty law center in montgomery ala 
three years ago dees won a 7 million jury verdict that put the 
united klans of america out of business two klansmen from mobile 
ala killed a black man as compensation the victims mother 
received title to the klans national headquarters 
the metzgers are representing themselves in the trial before 
judge ancer haggerty 
i am a white separatist the elder metzger told jurors by 
way of introduction 
im a smallbusiness man from fallbrook calif im going to 
talk to you like i would one of my customers over a cup of coffee 
or a beer 
he told jurors the lawsuit was a government attempt to persecute 
him 
dees spent the week trying to link the metzgers to seraws 
murder in part through the testimony of kenneth mieske 
mieske who goes by the nicknames ken death and bat man is 
serving a life sentence for killing seraw under dees questioning 
he was contentious often smirking and winking at his girlfriend 
across the courtroom 
when he pleaded guilty to killing seraw mieske had said his 
motive was racial 
but on the stand last week mieske said the government forced him 
to say that the alternative he said would have been charges 
bringing more prison time than the 20year minimum sentence he 
ultimately received 
mieske 25 said he really killed seraw to defend fellow 
skinhead kyle brewster seraw hit brewster with a sucker punch 
he said and seraw was choking him 
a man allegedly sent to train mieske in violence dave mazzella 
21 is dees star witness and he put him on the stand friday 
mazella a former vice president of the aryan youth movement 
told jurors the metzgers sent him to portland to organize neonazi 
skinheads and incite them to do violence against minorities 
at the metzgers direction mazella said he headed for kenneth 
mieskes home after arriving in portland 
metzger has filed a countersuit against mazella and two other 
men he allegedly sent to portland charging they were agent 
provocateurs working for the portland police the countersuit 
also claims two of seraws friends provoked the fight with the 
skinheads and that they and the provocateurs should be liable 
for any damages metzger might be ordered to pay seraws estate 
among the spectators are skinheads professing racism and members 
of skinheads against racial prejudice the american civil liberties 
union and the antidefamation league of bnai brith are monitoring 
the trial as well 
the courthouse is under heavy security police taped paper over 
the courtroom windows and spectators were required to pass through 
a labyrinth of metal detectors 
officers routinely lined skinheads along the wall outside the 
courtroom and searched them three skinheads were arrested for 
carrying weapons and two on outstanding warrants one warrant 
alleged a neonazi skinhead had tried to carve a swastika into the 
skull of a member of skinheads against racial prejudice 
police revealed some anxiety early in the week when they spotted 
a suspiciouslooking lunchbox outside a federal courthouse several 
blocks from where the trial is being held 
the bomb squad was called and the box was gingerly pulled by a 
rope into the street it contained a lunch

since his election 11 months ago elias 
hrawi has been known as the displaced president because rebel gen 
michel aoun held the presidential palace and refused to recognize 
him 
after aoun was pushed out by syrian and lebanese government 
forces saturday hrawi an affable 65yearold former agricultural

zahle in the fertile bekaa valley of eastern lebanon where his 
family has an agricultural business 
he was elected president nov 24 by parliament which convened 
at a honeymoon hotel in the syrianpoliced bekaa because aoun had 
banned elections in the 300squaremile christian enclave north of 
beirut 
hrawis main task was to implement the peace agreement reached 
in taif saudi arabia in october 1989 
unable to occupy what was left of the palace in the christian 
enclave hrawi had to make his headquarters in a spartan lebanese 
army barracks in the bekaa he later moved to an apartment in west

president mikhail s gorbachev issued a decree 
saturday forbidding the removal or destruction of lenin monuments 
war memorials and other state symbols under attack by 
anticommunist protesters 
crowds in several cities have toppled statues of vladimir i 
lenin the leader of the bolshevik revolution and desecrated other 
symbols of communist power 
gorbachevs decree says such actions are incompatible with 
popular traditions respect for the history of the motherland and 
generally recognized moral standards 
in the most recent incident unidentified protesters attempted 
oct 4 to blow up a monument to soviet soldiers who died fighting 
the nazis in 1944 near the lithuanian town of krizhkalnis 
lithuanian leaders contend that their republic was illegally 
occupied and annexed by the soviet union at the end of world war 
ii and there is widespread resentment against the red army among 
lithuanian citizens 
the republics government in a statement saturday deplored the 
bombing which it called a provocative act perpetrated by 
forces aiming to destabilize the situation in lithuania prior to 
negotiations on independence 
under gorbachevs reforms plaques and monuments to disgraced 
soviet leaders such as josef stalin and leonid brezhnev have been 
removed but lenin who led the revolution until his illness and 
death in 1924 is another matter 
some criticism of lenin has appeared in the staterun press but 
moves to brand him as a criminal and to stop venerating the soviet 
victory in the great patriotic war of 19391945 appear to have 
met stiff public resistance particularly in russia the largest 
soviet republic 
outraged citizens have written letters to newspapers and been 
interviewed on television when the city council in the ukrainian 
city of ternopol voted in july to dismantle statues of lenin and 
karl marx the local communist party committee branded it an act of 
vandalism and barbarism 
according to the newspaper soviet culture statues of lenin have 
been destroyed in more than two dozen georgian towns and attempts 
have been made to topple them in the azerbaijani capital of baku 
and the armenian capital of yerevan 
a giant monument to lenin in the georgian capital of tbilisi was 
guarded roundtheclock for months until authorities gave into 
public demands and allowed it to be dismantled in september 
some prominent politicians including the radical mayor of 
moscow gavriil popov have advocated pulling down memorials to 
lenin and changing the names of cities streets and institutions 
dedicated to him 
the city council of leninakan an armenian community that was 
virtually destroyed by an earthquake two years ago and has since 
been rebuilt with international aid voted this week to retake its 
ancient name of kumairi 
there has also been popular pressure in leningrad to change back 
to the prerevolutionary name of st petersburg 
gorbachevs decree apparently does not prevent name changes but 
it suspends all decisions by local authorities about the pulling 
down moving or changing of memorial structures according to the 
official soviet news agency tass

the looseknit coalition opposed to 
ousted prime minister benazir bhutto on saturday opened their 
campaign by announcing a platform that includes some of ms 
bhuttos populist ideas 
the islamic democratic alliance released a 17page manifesto as 
its leaders fanned out across the country to hold rallies and tell 
the voters that their differences had been swept aside 
the alliance is comprised of nine parties spanning the 
ideological spectrum and bound together largely by their contempt 
for the 37yearold former prime minister 
ms bhutto has capitalized on their highly publicized bickering 
and labeled them the remnants of zia referring to gen 
mohammad zia ulhaq who took power in a coup in 1977 and ruled 
until his death in a 1988 plane crash 
many pakistanis have voiced fears that a government headed by 
the alliance would resurrect many of zias policies curtailin 
individual rights especially for women and nonmoslems 
kamal azfar special assistant to caretaker prime minister 
ghulam mustafa jatoi sought to dispel the notion he told a news 
conference that the coalitions manifesto has some of the 
populist promises that have been the hallmark of ms bhuttos 
leftleaning pakistan peoples party 
among them were increased education and medical care free 
housing for the poor programs to reduce the countrys alarming 
birthrate deregulation of the economy denationalization of major 
industry and financial reforms 
ms bhutto has yet to announce her partys manifesto she 
currently faces charges of corruption in a special court her 
husband asif ali zardari was arrested wednesday on a kidnapping 
and extortion charge 
president ghulam ishaq khan dismissesd ms bhuttos government 
aug 6 on charges of corruption and mismanagement and set 
parliamentary elections for oct 24 
the 20 months of ppp rule was a period of anarchy loot and 
plunder of national resources gross incompetence and breakdown of 
law and order the alliances manifesto said referring to ms 
bhuttos pakistan peoples party 
it was the government of one family for one family and by one 
family the manifesto said 
the alliance promised severe measures to put an end to all 
unislamic means of illgotten wealth including gambling

a new york art dealer offered the sole bid 
saturday on a longlost painting and in his opinion walked away 
with a steal from an auction at an amusement park 
the 6foot by 10foot painting by american landscape artist 
albert bierstadt of lake lucerne and the swiss alps was expected to 
fetch 1 million richard york bought it for half that 
when one examines it as a work of art it has all the elements 
that make bierstadt great york said its also one of his 
first largescale paintings 
york who owns the richard york gallery in new york city said 
he thought the decision to hold the auction at the rocky point 
amusement park may have affected the purchase price 
maybe its not the right climate for the picture here he 
said glancing at the faded winecolored velvet curtains and glitzy 
gold drapes that decorate the hall 
another large swiss landscape by bierstadt went for 990000 at 
sothebys new york auction house on may 24 
the 1858 lake lucerne painting was offered about halfway into 
the auction of art from the estate of the late pearl j rose 
mrs rose was secretive about her collection in fact she and 
her family kept the bierstadt from the public for more than 100 
years since it was last sold in boston in 1882 
bidding had been erratic a painting by mauritz frederik 
hendrick de haas expected to bring 13000 was sold for 50000 
one by charles storer valued at 4000 was unsold after there was 
no opening bid of 300 
john lynch the estate attorney said he had inquiries about the 
bierstadt from france tokyo london and around the united states 
the auctioneer started bidding at 500000 when none of the 150 
registered bidders would offer 600000 he dropped to 550000 
again no takers he then stopped the auction to confer with 
organizers 
a stunned audience watched as he asked one last time for a 
higher bid york raised his hand 
afterward york said he had been prepared to pay more 
he would not say if he bought the painting for himself or a 
client or whether it would be staying in the united states 
bierstadt part of the hudson river group of painters built his

a dozen animalrights activists were cited for leaving a 
designated area in a demonstration saturday against floridas 
annual youth deer hunt 
in texas protesters who want to test the legality of 
hunterharassment laws in effect in 37 states walked noisily behind 
bowandarrow hunters to prevent them sneaking up on their prey 
but failed in their primary mission to get arrested 
about 80 demonstrators carrying signs and noisemakers marched 
for four hours outside the camp blanding wildlife management area 
in northeast florida while 39 young hunters were inside the 
statesponsored deer hunt is staged to help parents and guardians 
teach children 8 to 15 to hunt safely 
the protesters had a permit to demonstrate across the street 
from the park about a halfmile from the nearest hunting area but 
12 attempted to go inside and were stopped said capt bill glover 
of the florida game and fresh water fish commission 
they were cited for failure to obey lawful order a misdemeanor 
one also was charged with resisting arrest glover said they were 
released pending a court appearance later this month 
protesters had planned to make noise and disrupt the hunt but 
glover said there appeared to be no violations of a new state law 
that prohibits interfering with legal hunting trapping or fishing 
all in all both the hunt and the protest went pretty 
smoothly he said we just had a few who felt like they had to 
push their cause and come into an area they couldnt go into 
barry silver a boca raton lawyer and board member of florida 
action for animals argued that public funds should not be used to 
pay for the hunt 
we are against the use of taxpayer money in order to 
indoctrinate our youth to become trained killers he said 
training children in acts of violence will only encourage them to 
become violent later on 
in texas four teams of 1215 protesters stationed themselves in 
sam houston national park 55 miles north of houston during a 
bowandarrow hunt and rustled leaves as they walked behind the 
hunters said dana forbes of fund for animals 
even though the demonstrators were technically violating the 
states hunterharassment law game wardens declined to arrest 
them giving them no vehicle with which to challenge the law in 
court 
if they have a right to harm these animals we have a right to 
protect them ms forbes said 
tommy johnson the state game warden for walker county said no 
one was arrested because none of the hunters seemed to be harassed 
the protesters wanted to have their little say and have their 
little day and the hunters were real courteous about it johnson 
said they took a whole lot more abuse than most people should 
have to put up with 
ms forbes said some hunters were obviously very angry but we 
didnt allow anything to get physically violent 
wayne pacelle national director of the fund for animals said 
friday that if protesters were arrested the 23yearold 
organization would take the state to court and possibly use the 
arrests to test hunterharassment laws around the country 
the group contends that bowandarrow hunting is far more cruel 
than gun hunting because the animals die slowly or are wounded and 
remain crippled 
state officials said 80000 hunters in texas this year applied 
for bow licenses and 11 million applied for gunhunting licenses

a national monument etched with the names 
of 1238 firefighters who have died in the line of duty since 1981 
was dedicated saturday at a ceremony that recounted the tales of 
fallen heroes 
president bush signed legislation in august designating the 
9yearold monument at the national fire academy in emmitsburg the 
official national memorial to career and volunteer firefighters who 
died on the job 
while many local communities and states honor their fallen 
heroes this memorial stands as a lasting national tribute to those 
who have answered their last alarm said olin l greene 
administrator of the us fire administration 
about 200 people including state local and national officials 
and firefighters from across the country attended the outdoor 
ceremony held at the 7foottall pyramidshaped limestone 
monument 
honor guard units from baltimore county and st louis marched to 
the strains of bagpipes traditionally played at firefighters 
funerals 
in recent years many people have bemoaned our countrys lack 
of national heroes said sen paul sarbanes dmd who 
shepherded legislation through congress to get the memorial 
dedicated what they fail to realize is that we do have heroes in 
every fire hall across this land 
no job demands more sacrifice of time and dedication sadly 
that sacrifice too often results in death said wallace e 
stickney director of the federal emergency management agency 
which operates the academy 
we honor that sacrifice now as we dedicate this fallen 
firefighters memorial this is much more than a memorial it is 
national recognition by president bush and congress that these men 
and women who have given their lives deserve the respect and 
honor of all americans 
alan lee mickelson one of 113 firefighters from 35 states who 
died in 1989 fought his last blaze in gillette wyo on jan 31 
he fell 40 feet through a roof in a burning church the whole 
sanctuary roof fell at once there was no warning at all said 
his 34yearold widow marietta mickelson who traveled from her 
home in northeast wyoming 
i just think it was something good for my kids to see a part 
of the healing she said it was something we needed to do

le duc tho the cofounder of the 
vietnamese communist party who in 1973 negotiated the us 
withdrawal from vietnam died in hanoi saturday official accounts 
said he was 79 
tho shared the nobel peace prize with former us secretary of 
state henry a kissinger with whom he negotiated the paris peace 
accords of 1973 but tho turned it down saying peace had not yet 
been achieved 
a foreign ministry official in the vietnamese capital confirmed 
thos death but gave no details 
japans kyodos news agency reporting from hanoi said tho died 
of throat cancer he had been hospitalized at an army hospital 
since returning in april from treatment in paris the report said 
kissinger wrote in a 1982 book years of upheaval that 
thos subtlety his acumen his iron selfdiscipline were 
admirable and in all the years of negotiation with me he never 
lost his poise he never made a mistake 
as a professional leninist he despised the bourgeois values of 
compromise i put forward kissinger said and the effrontery of 
his deceptions inside and outside the conference room could be 
enraging 
in april 1975 forces from communist north vietnam defeated the 
usbacked south vietnam government and reunified the country 
tho known as a hardline party organizer and theoretician was 
believed to have had a key role in vietnams invasion of cambodia 
in late 1978 
but in 1986 at the sixth national party congress he and other 
veterans were replaced on the politburo by pragmatists seeking 
economic reform he became an adviser to the party central 
committee and western diplomats said he continued to exercise 
considerable influence in the partys conservative wing 
his younger brother mai chi tho who is said to share his 
hardline views is the powerful interior minister in charge of 
internal security and is on the politburo 
last month tho was awarded the states gold star order for his 
more than 60 years of political activity 
i pledge to dedicate my utmost efforts as i have done since i 
joined the revolution to the common cause of the party and the 
country he said at the ceremony 
much of thos life was shrouded in secrecy like many of the 
revolutionaries of his generation there are several accounts of 
his birth 
some say he was born to poor parents in a village about 60 miles 
south of hanoi but other western biographical sources say his 
father was a civil service official of middle rank in the french 
colonial administration 
as a teenager tho became involved in leftwing labor and 
political movements and helped organize strikes and riots in the 
hanoi area 
he helped found the indochinese communist party in 1930 during 
his imprisonment by the french his fellow inmates nicknamed him 
tho the phonograph for his ceaseless recitations of marxist 
doctrine 
his activities during world war ii are a matter of speculation 
among western historians some sources say tho escaped to china and 
helped vietnams revolutionary father ho chi minh found the 
viet minh guerrillas and lead them against the japanese 
others say tho spent the war years in a french prison in 
vietnam 
he joined the politburo in the 1950s and launched attacks 
against revisionists defeatists traitors pessimists and 
individualists but he often called for moderation in healing 
party rifts 
in 1968 with the vietnam war apparently at a stalemate the 
united states and north vietnam opened talks toward a ceasefire 
tho was the norths chief representative at the meetings in paris 
the negotiations some public others secret dragged on for 
years with the two sides trying to overcome what kissinger called 
mountains and ravines of complexities 
finally the accord was signed jan 27 1973 it resulted in the 
withdrawal of us forces from vietnam the exchange of prisoners 
and the splintering of south vietnam into communist and 
saigoncontrolled zones 
but the pact had no machinery for effectively enforcing the 
provisions fighting continued and when the north vietnamese began 
their final assault south tho was in the south as a direct link 
with the politburo 
recalling the talks and the fall of saigon in 1975 tho said in 
1985 on us television that the communist side had wrested total 
victory 
word of thos survivors was not immediately released

architect of the recent german unification was in satisfactory 
and stable condition after five hours of surgery to remove the 
bullet hospital officials said

governor of badenwuerttemberg state said after a visit to the 
hospital that schaeuble stood a chance of full recovery

autographs at the restaurant during a campaign appearance in 
oppenau in his home district late friday the second bullet hit 
the right side of schauebles face a third shot struck a 
bodyguard who was in satisfactory condition saturday 
prosecutor werner botz identified the gunman as dieter kaufmann 
37 kaufmann told investigators he had acted out of revenge for the 
terror of the state and had decided six months ago to shoot 
schaeuble according to botz 
the gunman had been undergoing treatment for schizophrenia 
according to the interior ministry kaufmann was released from 
prison in 1986 after serving three years in jail for a drug 
offense

village the gun he used was a 38caliber smith and wesson 
revolver he stole from his father botz said

lafontaine the opposition social democratic candidate for 
chancellor in the dec 2 elections lafontaine was stabbed in the 
neck at a campaign rally but has since recovered

offenburg and later flown by helicopter to the university hospital 
in freiburg his home town in southwest germany 
kohl and other politicians visited the freiburg hospital 
saturday schaeubles wife ingeborg and their four children were 
also at his side 
witnesses told german television the gunman sat in the 
nexttolast row in the restaurant hall during the rally and fired 
as schaeuble approached 
one of the ministers guards klausdieter michalski jumped in 
front of schaeuble to shield him and was shot in the stomach botz 
said michalski was relatively lightly injured and would be 
released soon 
schaeuble has sometimes been mentioned as a possible successor 
to kohl when the christian democratic leader decides to retire 
schaeuble guided the difficult talks that led to the historic 
german unification on oct 3 
he was named interior minister by kohl in april 1989 and 
previously had been the chancellors chief of staff

portauprince haiti ap the former head of the dreaded 
paramilitary police appeared at a political convention saturday 
defying warrants for his arrest 
former minister of the interior roger lanfontant is wanted for 
plotting against national security but the arrest warrants have 
not been served by the army where he has followers and inspires 
fear 
lanfontant was head of the tonton macoutes which used terror to 
keep the duvalier family in power for 29 years until jean claude 
duvalier fled in 1986 
the twoday national reconciliation convention on sunday was to 
select a neoduvalierist unity candidate for upcoming general 
elections 
lafontant has been openly campaigning for the presidency 
although the 1987 constitution bars criminal supporters of 
dictatorship from running for office until 1997 
lafontants return in july from exile in the dominican republic 
made many haitians fear an attempt to disrupt the elections now 
set for dec 16 
in 1987 the last attempt at free elections collapsed when thugs 
with the support of the army murdered at least 34 voters at the 
polls hundreds more were killed and wounded in preelection 
violence 
we have come out of hiding said radio liberte director 
serge beaulieu at the convention addressing a cheering crowd of 
around 1500 
we are the power we will organize elections ourselves we 
dont need the united nations said beaulieu criticizing 
soontoarrive un election monitors and security experts as an 
infringement of national sovereignty 
the mission of the observers includes trying to assure that 
paramilitary and police forces do not intimidate voters 
on a fivehour visit to haiti friday former president carter 
said the army had not yet arrested lafontant because he was in 
hiding but in recent weeks lafontant has been seen in the 
provincial towns of caphaitien and hinche as well as in the 
capital suburb petionville 
other duvalierist leaders on the podium besides beaulieu were 
duvalierist militants alphonse lahens and jean theagene and former 
duvalierdynasty ministers herve boyer alix cineas and dr 
volvick remy joseph 
we have not yet chosen our candidate they are still divided 
among themselves said convention moderator marjorie robins 
dr francois duvalier ruled haiti from 1957 to 1971 his son 
jeanclaude succeeded him and was ousted on feb 7 1986 he is 
living in france 
the doctrine of dr francois duvalier is very very fine but 
it must not be applied as it was applied but as he conceived it 
said robins 
on march 13 after four brief militarycontrolled regimes 
civilian provisional president ertha pascaltrouillot took over and 
promised to hold elections 
the presidentelect is to take office on feb 7 1991 on the 
fifth anniversary of the ouster of jeanclaude duvalier 
there are about 20 presidential hopefuls

columbia the shuttle plagued with 
mechanical problems since april was pulled from its hangar again 
saturday night for a trip to the launch pad 
the nations oldest flightqualified orbiter began the sixhour 
42 mile ride from to launch pad 39b at 903 pm edt its 
counterpart atlantis was taken to pad 39a friday night 
in late october columbia will undergo the first of what may be 
several fueling tests if columbia passes its mission to deploy 
the 150 million astro observatory may get under way in december 
the move was columbias sixth since april 22 when it was first 
rolled out for a may 30 mission hydrogen leaks scrubbed that

didnt get a shuttle in orbit until discovery took off with the 
ulysses solar probe on oct 6 
on june 6 columbia failed a leak test on the pad and was taken 
back to the assembly building for fuel line repairs on aug 9 
columbia equipped with a fuel line borrowed from the 
stillunfinished shuttle endeavour was rolled back to pad 39a 
an electronic problem with an astro telescope prompted nasa to 
delay a sept 1 launch then on sept 5 hydrogen flooded 
columbias aft compartment during fueling 
columbias next launch attempt was set for sept 18 but once 
again a hydrogen buildup was detected in the engine compartment 
and the liftoff was scrubbed 
at that point nasa decided columbia would have to vacate pad 
39a to permit atlantis to be readied for a secret military mission 
which had been on hold since midjuly because of leaking hydrogen 
after discoverys launch columbia was shifted to pad 39b for an 
allout search for the sources of its hydrogen leaks the very next 
day the approach of a hurricane forced shuttle managers to bring 
columbia back to its cavernous shelter

making common cause with its new arab 
allies the united states has joined the rest of the security 
council in denouncing israeli authorities for killing 19 
palestinians during rioting in jerusalem 
in its unanimous vote late friday the council asked for a un 
investigation of the deaths but israel said it would not allow 
such a mission on its territory 
the us vote for the resolution represented a rare departure 
from the usual american practice of defending israel its longtime 
ally from censure in the council
