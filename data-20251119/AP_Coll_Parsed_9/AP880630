seven past or present detectives went on trial 
thursday on charges of extorting money and favors from nightclubs 
and restaurants with the defense arguing they did little more than 
accept gifts from friends 
in return for the alleged payoffs the officers are accused of 
having fixed citations overlooked violations protected 
establishments from inspections and and received money for details 
that were never performed 
prosecutor diane kottmyer in opening arguments in us district 
court called the detectives greedy and shameless in their 
shakedowns and were almost flamboyant in the favors they provided 
for powerful friends 
kottmyer said former detective thomas j connolly arranged for 
employees of cafe budapest to be taken to make their nightly bank 
deposits in police vehicles free of charge 
in return kottmyer said connolly dined with friends at cafe 
budapest and at the conclusion of his meal no bill would be 
paid connolly would be seen just strolling out of the 
restaurant she said 
attorney robert muse representing retired detective francis x 
sheehan described his client as a damn fine cop whose 
deeplyrooted friendships with some club owners resulted in 
gifts not payoffs 
the detectives are charged with 50 counts of conspiracy bribery 
and extortion they are accused of extorting favors and 18000 in 
money from 1975 to 1986 
besides sheehan and connolly the defendants are former 
detectives john e carey and peter boylan and detectives john f 
mccormick kenneth j nave and matthew a kilroe

gil evans composer and arranger who died 
earlier this year at 75 did not remain stuck in the past his 
17piece band kept together by his son miles evans played at the 
jvc jazz festival in kaufman hall at the 92nd street y and sounded 
as modern and exciting as something put together by a young leader 
the set on wednesday night was unpredictable and loose with 
much passing the word about the next number if anybody wanted to 
watch something besides musicians play rock concerts show videos 
now there were high hand signals from first trumpeter lew soloff 
about coming in in unison 
the guitarist who usually stood in front of the band climbed 
the bleachers which held musicians chairs to boogie during other 
peoples solos while he sang a coolly confident moon dance 
there was some smiling and laughing behind him presumably at his 
expense 
the first 25minute number began with as much cacophany as 
though everybody was tuning up became so loud the sound echoed 
back from the halls walls held a beat that could be danced to in 
a disco went into a long alto saxophone solo then a brief french 
horn solo both tasty and tapered gradually to an ending it held 
interest throughout as did the whole set 
there were exciting tenor saxophone trombone and trumpet solos 
loud and soft the electric bassist improvised the star spangled 
banner 
no tunes or musicians were introduced 
the first half of the evening was played by the courtney pine 
quartet from great britain pine who played soprano and tenor 
saxophone began with a shower of notes and no melodic line then 
he played a noisy exhilarating swinging come back to me 
which was another shower of notes 
just when one thought that was his only style he played a 
tender melodic misty when he improvised on that the 
departure from the tune became another pleasing melody julian 
joseph took a ruminating piano solo then turned it back to pine 
who found some quarter tones between tones 
the final tune was zaire our only criticism is that pieces 
would find an ending then meander for a bit before the music 
stopped 
in general its an emphatic group and one wed like to hear 
again

gen manuel antonio noriega is 
believed to be paving the way to resign as panamas military 
commander in possible preparation for a presidential campaign 
according to sources here 
noriega the de facto ruler of the country as chief of the 
defense forces never has denied he wouldnt mind being president 
the reports circulating here are that noriega could step down as 
early as august 
but first these reports say he wants to make sure he leaves 
someone he can trust in charge of the military 
the new military chief likely would come from the group of young 
officers noriega has rallied around him after purging several older 
members of the military high command 
the purge swept away those involved in an attempted coup march 
16 as well as any others who noriega believes were at least hoping 
it would succeed 
noriega has survived economic sanctions by the reagan 
administration and feeble attempts by a ussupported local 
opposition to overthrow him 
in august noriega will have served 25 years in the military 
generally the mandatory time for retirement but it can be extended 
to 28 years his official biography lists him as being 50 years 
old although his high school yearbook indicates he might be 54 
some of his closest political allies in the governments 
revolutionary democratic party are already calling him the 
logical candidate for presidential elections in may 1989 and 
are pushing for removal of some of the older leaders who may not go 
along with a noriega candidacy 
panamanian sources point to aquilino sieiro noriegas 
brotherinlaw as the the mostlikely successor to ensure the 
defense forces remain loyal to the general 
the defense forces number about 15000 personnel with absolute 
military and police powers 
they are a tightly knit and closedmouth group and even general 
information about highranking officers is withheld because our 
officers are too modest according to a bureaucrat 
according to the scenario discussed here sieiro will become 
commander of the defense forces sometime in august 
sieiro was promoted from major to lieutenant colonel in april 
and the sources said will be made a full colonel in july 
sieiros sister felicidad is married to noriega his brother 
ramon sieiro is president of labor party which is part of the 
progovernemnt political alliance 
sieiro believed to be in his late 30s is now a member of the 
military high command he has been coordinator of joint maneuvers 
with the us military and was traffic director and chief of the 
colon military district the second most important after panama 
city 
at one time he commanded the battalion 2000 an elite force 
named after the year panama is due to take over full control of the 
panama canal under the 1977 treaties with the united states 
sieiro has a brother manuel who sources said also is 
scheduled to be promoted to lieutenant colonel in august 
the two sieiro brothers and lt col nivaldo madrinan are among 
noriegas most trusted associates madrinan director of the 
powerful national investigation department was promoted to his 
present rank in april 
another officer believed to be a close ally is maj luis del 
cid commander of the chiriqui military district 
the military high command was practically dismantled when 
noriega frustrated the march coup led by the police chief col 
leonidas macias 
seven lieutenant colonels and colonels have been dismissed or 
retired since others are scheduled to retire in august including 
col marcos justines chief of the joint chiefs of staff 
noriega has surrounded himself with 20 younger officers grouped 
under what was called the strategic military council that meets 
with him regularly to discuss national problems and propose 
solutions 
the group includes the commanders of the air force and the two 
largest military districts as well as the chiefs of police and 
other key military officers 
most prominent among them are lt col hilario trujillo chief 
of the air force maj pascual gonzalez chief of civil 
aeronautics maj armando palacio gondola chief of san miguelitos 
military district maj francisco porras director of the officers 
school as well as madrinan lt col aristides hassn the 
inspector general and lt col moises correa the personnel 
director 
noriega and the united states have been at odds since february 
when two federal grand juries in florida indicted the general on 
drug trafficking charges 
he ousted president eric arturo delvalle still recognized by 
washington as panamas leader on feb 26 after the president tried 
to fire noriega

like millions of other soviets touched by the 
terror of josef stalin dmitri a volkogonov still remembers the 
day his father disappeared 
more than 50 years later that personal tragedy is foremost in 
volkogonovs mind as he finishes the first comprehensive soviet 
biography of stalin the man he blames for the death of his father 
and those of millions of others 
volkogonov a military historian said he has spent 10 years 
culling soviet archives and talking to people who knew stalin for a 
twovolume biography triumph and tragedy scheduled to appear 
next year 
there is no thorough soviet biography of stalin who killed 
millions of people through his forced collectivizaton of 
agriculture that began in 1929 and the political purges that 
followed in the next decade 
volkogonov told reporters wednesday his book will give an 
unofficial estimate of the number killed but he declined to reveal 
what it was 
as director of the defense ministrys institute of military 
history and earlier as deputy chief of the defense ministrys 
political directorate volkogonov a colonelgeneral has had 
unusual access to longsuppressed official information about stalin 
nobody in this country has as many documents on this man as i 
do said volkogonov wearing an army uniform emblazoned with rows 
of multicolored military decorations 
the documents as well as interviews with people who knew him 
show stalin to be one of the most terrible figures in mankind 
said volkogonov 
my father was a direct victim of stalins purges the 
historian said he was an agronomist and somebody didnt like 
him once he was summoned to a certain meeting and he never 
returned he was 36 years old 
that was 1937 when volkogonov was 8 years old 
volkogonov said the disappearance of his father haunted him for 
years 
when i was already an old man people would deal with me with 
suspicion because i was the son of an enemy of the people he 
recalled referring to the label stalin used to brand those he 
considered his opponents 
volkogonov is among those tapped to correct the record as the 
countrys reformminded leader mikhail s gorbachev tries to 
reexamine the whitewashing of stalins crimes in history books and 
the official press 
the issue is at the forefront this week as the party holds its 
first nationwide conference since the last one stalin called in 
1941 volkogonov is a delegate to the conference which is 
reviewing proposals to correct deformations stalin caused in 
the party and society 
nikita s khrushchev was the first soviet leader to shake the 
world with the enormity of stalins crimes in 1956 his charges 
against stalin were made in secret to a party congress and 
disclosed only unofficially 
more than 31 years later at a public forum nov 2 marking the 
70th anniversary of the bolshevik revolution gorbachev accused 
stalin of enormous and unforgiveable crimes and dismissed any 
notion that the former dictator didnt know about those who died 
because of his excesses 
gorbachevs criticism sparked a wave of soviet press reports 
including ones by volkogonov about stalins crimes writing in 
december in the literary weekly literaturnaya gazeta volkogonov 
said stalins repressions were a result of the tragic triumph of 
evil force and who knows was there together with cruelty a 
neverrecognized spiritual illness of stalin 
last week the party newspaper pravda published excerpts from 
volkogonovs biography in which the author denounced the dictator 
for signing a friendship treaty with nazi germany and crippling his 
own army by purging its officer corps before world war ii 
some conservatives have suggested stalin was not aware of the 
extent of repression under him but at a news conference wednesday 
volkogonov said he had found evidence to the contrary 
there were personal orders about terrorism and the elimination 
of people he said but there was also inertia which he caused 
he couldnt predict what the volume of this inertia would be 
in several cases volkogonov said he found papers accusing 
people of crimes and stalins writing in the margins that he agreed 
with the charges 
asked if he agreed with western historians that stalin was 
behind the assassinations of political rivals sergei kirov in 1934 
and leon trotsky in mexico in 1937 volkogonov said he found no 
evidence stalin directly ordered the killings but that he had made 
it clear his aides were to remove all potential opposition

one new poll suggests vice president george bush 
is running neckandneck with gov michael dukakis while another 
survey indicates the republican nomineetobe is only slightly 
behind his democratic rival 
the new results contrast with a series of surveys in recent 
weeks indicating bush trailed dukakis in double digits 
a telephone survey of 1013 adults last week by abc news and 
money magazine released wednesday found 45 percent support for 
dukakis and 42 percent for bush that amounts to a tie given the 
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points 
and a gallup poll of 1210 voters also out wednesday suggested 
dukakis had the support of 46 percent to 41 percent for bush the 
margin of error was 3 percentage points 
by contrast gallup nbc newswall street journal and washington 
post polls conducted since june 9 have found doubledigit leads for 
dukakis the post survey done june 1519 found a 5139 percent 
dukakis margin 
the abcmoney magazine poll conducted june 2225 found support 
for dukakis down 7 points from an abcpost poll in midmay that 
used the same methodology bush rose only from 41 to 42 percent 
support those who didnt know grew from 2 percent to 6 percent 
the rest said they wouldnt vote or would support someone else 
poll analysts have said they expected the race to tighten as 
dukakis came off the crest of his democratic primary victories a 
harris survey early this month found a dead heat 4944 with a 
3point margin of error and a usa todaycnn poll gave dukakis a 
singledigit lead 
the abcmoney magazine poll had dukakis leading among women 
respondents earning less than 25000 a year and adults aged 35 to 
54 bush led among men respondents earning more than 50000 and 
those in the 5564 age group

congressional democrats are poised to act on 
compromise legislation to increase the federal minimum wage of 
335 per hour by 120 over the next three years 
the task will not be easy though if republicans are able to 
anything about it 
the senate labor committee voted 115 wednesday to approve 
legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to 455 per hour by 
1991 
but floor action on the bill is not expected until after the 
democratic national convention which takes place the week of july 
17 the house labor committee passed a wage increase in march 
senate labor committee chairman edward m kennedy dmass 
sponsor of the compromise said the panels vote brings us a 
major step closer to our goal of raising the minimum wage for the 
first time since 1981 
five million men and women will gain by the increase and they 
deserve it kennedy said theyre the working poor theyd 
rather work than live on welfare and they deserve a living wage 
for 50 years the minimum wage has been a promise by america 
that if you work for a living you wont have to live in poverty 
reaganomics broke that promise and its time for congress to fix 
it 
kennedy did not waste time in getting the committee vote to send 
the measure to the floor as soon as a quorum was formed at a 
hastilycalled meeting in the capitol the vote was taken 
although republicans indicated a week ago that they would offer 
amendments in committee none was introduced 
there was no reason to take on those issues in committee 
said sen orrin g hatch rutah there will be amendments when 
the bill gets to the floor i am sure we can conjure up some 
he predicted that floor action will be a donnybrook there is 
a lot of irritation on this bill they democrats havent had the 
intestinal fortitude to bring up the bill before now 
hatch said the increase in the minimum wage could cost up to a 
million jobs especially those that need them black youths and 
hispanic youths we just cant write them off 
republicans in both the house and senate are expected to offer 
amendments that would cap the increase at 4 an hour provide a 
training wage and exempt all small companies from the wage 
requirement 
the 115 committee vote was mainly along party lines with 
republicans robert t stafford of vermont and lowell p weicker jr 
of connecticut joining the ninedemocrat majority 
the kennedy compromise was worked out between democratic 
congressional leaders and organized labor after it became clear 
that the initial proposal approved by the house labor committee was 
going nowhere 
the kennedy bill would raise the current 335 an hour minimum 
wage to 375 in 1989 415 in 1990 and 455 in 1991 
the exemption for small businesses would be raised to cover 
companies with annual sales of 500000 or less the exemption 
currently applies to companies with sales of 362000 or less 
in addition the bill would increase the socalled tip credit 
for restaurant workers from 40 percent to 50 percent by jan 1 
1990 
employers are currently allowed to count 40 percent of an 
employees tips toward payment of the minimum wage 
kennedy and rep augustus f hawkins dcalif chairman of the 
house labor committee initially sponsored legislation that would 
have raised the minimum wage to 465 an hour over a threeyear 
period then index all future increases by tying them to the 
inflation rate 
opposition to the indexing provision by a number of democrats on 
the house committee forced the leadership to abandon it before the 
bill could get out of subcommittee in place of indexing the house 
committee voted to increase the minimum wage to 505 over four 
years 
when the bill reaches the house floor after the senate acts 
reps tommy robinson dark and thomas j ridge rpa will 
substitute the kennedy version of 455 an hour for the one passed 
by the house committee

by declining to disavow recent 
bombings of civilian targets the african national congress has 
provided the government with fresh ammunition for its campaign to 
brand the guerrillas as terrorists 
the attacks and the prospect of retaliation by the state 
prompted the countrys only daily newspaper for blacks the 
sowetan to plead this descent into hell must be stopped 
last week a mine shattered the interior of a seaside 
restaurant moments after nearly 100 diners were evacuated two 
days earlier a blast in a video game arcade injured 10 people 
including a 20yearold mixedrace woman pregnant with twins who 
failed to survive an emergency delivery 
seven civilians six of them black died in two bombings earlier 
this year part of the most sustained campaign of attacks yet on 
civilian targets 
the ancs hierarchy in exile has not claimed responsibility for 
specific attacks but it has not repudiated them anc officials in 
recent interviews in lusaka zambia said they sought to escalate 
urban violence in hopes of undermining white morale 
south africas white authorities have responded predictably to 
recent bombings vowing to use an iron fist against the 
guerrillas and urging western countries to shun the anc 
in addition the attacks have provoked outrage from white 
commentators who normally differ with the government white 
liberals who advocate unconditional negotiations with the anc are 
on the defensive 
it is impossible to imagine two more innocent victims than the 
unborn twin girls killed by the blast said an editorial in the 
star an independent newspaper and the countrys largest daily 
no cause however just can be served by such evil means 
the government in its condemnations of terrorism does not 
mention the political factors that motivate the anc guerrillas 
antiapartheid activists who opt for nonviolent tactics to gain 
black political rights have been detained by the thousands many 
blacks as well as some whites perceive the security forces as 
initiators of violence and occasionally as perpetrators of 
terrorism 
restrictions on major antiapartheid groups and laws forbidding 
favorable comment about the anc make it difficult to gauge black 
opinion about the bombings some prominent moderates have spoken 
out harshly against the ancs use of violence while many 
militants although barred by law from saying so publicly endorse 
the strategy 
dr nthato motlana a veteran activist who belonged to the anc 
before it was banned in 1960 sought to distance jailed anc leader 
nelson mandela from the latest bombings 
he does not like violence nor are people acting in his 
name he told a university audience last week 
the sowetan described the bombings as horrific acts and 
said it is surely desperation that drives men and women to such 
violence city press another major black paper made conspicuous 
mention of the fact that the video game arcades clientele was 
almost exclusively black 
law and order minister adriaan vlok says the anc fears it is 
losing public support and is now trying to intimidate the people 
with violence 
the anc contends most blacks generally approve of the guerrilla 
campaign accept the fact that some blacks will become casualties 
and are heartened by news of bombings 
a middleaged activist from the black township of alexandra 
speaking on condition of anonymity said guerrilla operations 
sometimes do boost morale among blacks even those who do not 
condone civilian casualties 
at least you know they the anc still exist the woman 
said with antiapartheid organizations restricted and banned 
how else is the peoples voice going to be heard 
for more 20 years after it adopted violence as a tactic in 1961 
the ancs official policy was to attack only targets connected in 
some way to the government or the security forces at his trial for 
sabotage in 1964 mandela said guerrillas were given strict 
instructions to avoid killings 
at a conference in 1985 anc officials said increased civilian 
casualties were inevitable in the struggle to end whiteminority 
domination attacks on civilians gradually have increased since 
then and an interview given last month by anc chief of staff chris 
hani indicated this reflects official policy 
we want to make apartheid costly and very painful and bitter 
for whites said hani suggesting that frightened whites 
eventually would turn against their leaders 
in south africa there are doubts about the wisdom of this 
strategy 
theres no sign of any fear or trepidation as a result of 
whats happened so far said helen suzman longserving 
parliament member for the antiapartheid progressive federal party 
they the anc underestimate the determination of the white 
minority to stay in power they underestimate the ferocity of the 
reprisals the government will take

new rules proposed by the environmental 
protection agency to protect farmworkers from pesticides are 
satisfying neither farm owners nor labor groups concerned about 
when sprayed fields can be reentered safely 
shelly davis an attorney for the migrant legal action program 
said wednesday she will submit comments so critical of the plan 
they will burn up the page 
mark maslyn pesticide specialist for the american farm bureau 
federation said the new rules still had problem areas that 
hopefully will be addressed in the 90day public comment period 
starting with publication sometime next week 
the new regulations 55 pages accompanied by 220 pages of 
explanation would replace a onepage regulation in effect since 
1974 they cover pesticides that have not yet been the subject of 
specific worker regulations in epas review of all 650 active 
pesticide ingredients 
compliance by farmers and manufacturers could cost 170 million 
in the first year and less after that epa said the average grain 
farm would have to spend an estimated 167 in the first year the 
average vegetable farm 611 and the average greenhouse 3515 
louis true head of program management and support in epas 
pesticide program told reporters wednesday that a reduction of 
onehalf percent to 1 percent in poisonings would make the cost 
worthwhile he did not explain the calculation 
estimates of poisonings have ranged from 12000 up to 300000 
some 25 million farmworkers could be affected by the proposals 
if they take effect as expected next year including about 300000 
not now covered in commercial forestry greenhouses and nurseries 
exemptions would apply for home use noncommercial forest use as 
by a park agency use on rights of way use in research and for 
chemicals injected directly into plant tissue 
major provisions of the new regulations establish general 
reentry intervals during which no one normally may enter fields 
after spraying 
for the most toxic pesticides the field would be closed for 48 
hours warning placards would have to be posted and oral warnings 
would be required for any workers on that farm 
other provisions deal with the legal responsibility for 
accidents and require the farmer to see to it that any contractors 
hired are aware of the rules still others specify warnings that 
must be given emergency equipment that must be kept on hand 
protective clothing that must be worn and when blood tests for 
professional pesticide applicators must be undertaken 
ms davis faulted the agency for using only acute toxicity to 
set reentry levels ignoring chronic effects such as cancer i 
would establish a long interval for anything thats an actual or 
suspected carcinogen in animals like a week she said 
a requirement that the oral warnings contain information on the 
medical effects of exposure would sharpen workers and farmers 
concern about their own health she said 
maslyn said he feared that the reentry intervals could not be 
enforced against farmers anxious to get their crops to market 
some provisions of the regulations appear to hold the farmer 
responsible for accidents even if a worker has refused to use 
safety equipment he said 
i dont know what you do about a provision forbidding 
farmers to require workers to work in chemicalresistant suits when 
it is too hot he said theres a potential for abuse there 
its been our concern all through this that they dont have 
specific hard information that shows we have a problem with 
reentry levels and it needs to be fixed in this way maslyn said

the hot dry weather plaguing america is 
likely to shift east and south in the next month and forecasters 
offer little hope that the widespread drought will be broken 
the 90day outlook issued by the national weather service on 
wednesday does indicate a chance of more rain than normal in some 
western sections of the great plains by the end of september 
but in the nearer term the watchwords were for more of the same 
weather that has been parching fields and reservoirs stalling 
river traffic and baking crops and livestock 
the 6 to 10day outlook is very close to holding stationary 
the pattern of the last few weeks donald l gilman head of the 
long range predictions group at the national weather service said 
at a news conference 
and the 30day prediction shows only subtle changes gilman 
added 
unfortunately reliable predictions of the droughts end its 
geographic spread or changes in severity cannot be made today 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration cautioned in an 
accompanying statement 
the agency noted that while the current drought is severe it is 
not yet comparable to the damaging dry spells of the 1950s and 
1930s this dry period is neither unprecedented nor unexpected 
from a climatological perspective the agency said 
nonetheless dr michael hudlow director of hydrology for the 
weather service said its likely to get worse before it gets 
better 
the river level at memphis tenn where mississippi barge 
traffic is already stalled could drop another foot in the next 10 
days he warned 
highaltitude jet stream winds that normally sweep across the 
northern tier of states have split to the north and south gilman 
said holding the drought conditions in place between them 
gilmans 6 to 10day outlook calls for much above normal 
temperatures in montana wyoming the dakotas nebraska wisconsin 
and iowa 
in addition above normal readings are expected in much of the 
rest of the nation except the columbia river valley west texas and 
along the atlantic coast from north carolina through georgia and 
northern florida 
in the short range the rain forecast is patchy said gilman 
he said no precipitation is likely in oregon california nevada 
southern idaho western utah western arizona and texas 
there is a chance of some scattered moisture from the gulf of 
mexico causing rain here and there in the midwest but only kansas 
south carolina and georgia seem likely to have more rain than 
normal for the period 
in july above normal heat is expected throughout most of the 
northern plains and upper midwest gilman said while the outlook 
for rain is very uncertain 
the greatest chance of hot weather is in illinois indiana 
ohio kentucky and tennessee gilman said he gave that region a 65 
percent chance of being hotter than normal for july an unusually 
high ranking for a summer forecast typically the 30day outlooks 
are considered only 55 percent likely in summer 
in addition july has a chance of warmer than normal weather 
from pennsylvania west through the great lakes states to montana 
south to oklahoma and arkansas and east to the appalachian 
mountains 
the rest of the country should expect near normal readings in 
july except the puget sound region where is it expected to be 
cooler than normal 
the outlook for rain in july shows below normal precipitation 
expected for california michigan illinois indiana ohio and 
kentucky above normal is expected only in puget sound and along 
the arizonanew mexico border 
other regions are likely to be close to normal gilman said 
with the added warning that the below normal region could expand 
back into the plains 
if this were earlier in the year he would have predicted a 
larger dry area gilman said but there may be breaks in the jet 
stream which could allow some rain to move north from the gulf of 
mexico 
finally he issued a longrange 90day forecast for july august 
and september 
that outlook anticipates above normal temperatures along the 
pacific coast in southern arizona and in iowa missouri arkansas 
louisiana illinois indiana ohio pennsylvania west virginia 
kentucky tennessee virginia maryland delaware the carolinas 
mississippi alabama georgia and florida 
below normal temperatures are expected in idaho montana 
wyoming colorado utah and new mexico with near normal readings 
elsewhere 
the threemonth rain outlook is for below normal in california 
maryland virginia the carolinas georgia and parts of west 
virginia tennessee and kentucky 
the lone bit of good news may be the chance of above normal 
precipitation for montana wyoming southern south dakota 
nebraska kansas colorado new mexico west texas and western 
oklahoma over the 90 days 
for the rest of the nation the chances are too close to call 
over such a long period

the supreme courts resounding endorsement of 
the special prosecutor law dispels any doubt about the authority of 
independent counsels investigating alleged wrongdoing by past and 
present reagan administration officials 
the high courts 71 decision wednesday removes a cloud from the 
irancontra conspiracy case and it clears the way for the 
sentencing of former white house aide michael k deaver for lying 
under oath about the lobbying business he formed after leaving 
president reagans staff 
the ruling also removes the special prosecutor issue from former 
white house political director lyn nofzigers challenge to his 
90day sentence and conviction for illegally lobbying former 
administration colleagues 
and the courts decision revives independent counsel alexia 
morrisons long dormant investigation of allegations that former 
assistant attorney general theodore b olson lied to a 
congressional committee investigating the superfund scandal at the 
environmental protection agency 
challenges by olson and two other former highranking justice 
department officials to grand jury subpoenas obtained by morrison 
led to the high courts ruling on the independent counsel 
provisions of the ethics in government act 
obviously we are very pleased with the opinion and 
particularly at the fact that it was reached nearly unanimously by 
the court said morrison whose investigation has been stymied 
for nearly a year 
the high court in a decision written by chief justice william 
rehnquist rejected arguments that appointment of independent 
counsels by a special court violated the constitutions doctrine of 
separation of powers 
rehnquist wrote that the special prosecutors did not encroach on 
the power of the executive branch to investigate crimes 
the decision drew an impassioned dissent from justice antonin 
scalia who wrote that by its shortsighted action today i fear 
the court has permanently encumbered the republic with an 
institution that will do it great harm 
ruling as it did the court further validated the authority of 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh to prosecute former white 
house aide oliver north former national security adviser john m 
poindexter and others on charges stemming from the irancontra 
affair 
walsh accepted a parallel appointment offered by the justice 
department last year to blunt constitutional challenges to the law 
but if the high court had ruled the other way north poindexter 
and their codefendants might have been able to challenge evidence 
walsh gathered before he was given the second appointment 
harvard university law professor laurence h tribe who 
represented walsh said the court found that vague notions of 
separations of powers are not enough to justify invalidating 
congress solution to a serious problem that would otherwise 
would have undermined credible law enforcement 
james c mckay the independent counsel who prosecuted nofziger 
also accepted a backup appointment five weeks after he began his 
investigation 
if the law had been invalidated nofziger would have challenged 
the use of evidence obtained by mckay before he was given the 
parallel authority 
morrison and deavers prosecutor independent counsel whitney 
north seymour jr refused to accept the justice departments 
offer choosing instead to set the stage for the constitutional 
battle 
deavers conviction was put in jeopardy in jan 22 when the us 
circuit court of appeals here ruled 21 that the special prosecutor 
law was unconstitutional 
following that decision us district judge thomas penfield 
jackson stayed further proceedings in the deaver case pending final 
resolution of the issue by the high court 
seymour called the decision a major victory for the public 
interest and said he would for ask jackson to set sentencing at 
an early date 
deaver could be sentenced up to five years for each of three 
felony convictions for lying to a house subcommittee and a grand 
jury that investigated his lobbying activities for possible 
conflictofinterest violations 
deaver himself requested appointment of an independent counsel 
when questions were raised in 1986 about the propriety of his 
lobbying contacts with former reagan administration colleagues 
but his lawyers later tried to stop his indictment and trial by 
challenging seymours authority to bring the charges 
defense lawyer randall j turk acknowledged the importance of 
the independent counsel challenge but said we have a number of 
issues still pending before the trial court and if we dont prevail 
there we plan to pursue an appeal 
e lawrence barcella one of nofzigers lawyers said the high 
courts decision is not a serious setback 
our challenge has always been focused on the postemployment 
sections of he ethics in government act the vagueness of that 
statute and the application of the facts to that statute 
barcella said 
nofziger remains free pending appeal of the conviction 
this office has believed that there is an appropriate place 
within the framework of the constitution for the establishment of a 
process which eliminates the inherent conflict of interest which 
arises when a high official of the executive branch is investigated 
by the department of justice said mckay who is also concluding 
a lengthy probe of attorney general edwin meese iii 
mckay is not expected to bring criminal charges against meese 
but is preparing a lengthy report that could raise questions about 
the ethical propriety of some of his financial dealings

jesse jacksons contention that he deserves to 
be offered the no 2 spot on the democratic ticket is supported by 
few democratic national convention delegates other than those 
pledged to support him for president an associated press survey 
found 
other delegates appear content to let michael dukakis pick his 
own running mate 
dukakis won fair and square and its his call said joseph 
courtney a dukakis delegate from connecticut 
roughly half the delegates surveyed said they had no preference 
for the no 2 spot on the partys ticket while the other half 
scattered their support among nearly three dozen potential 
candidates mostly favorite sons 
many of those responding to the survey said they were willing to 
go along with whomever dukakis asks to join him on the ticket 
its entirely up to michael dukakis to make those choices 
said laura past a delegate and democratic national committee 
member from nevada 
the delegates will be asked to ratify dukakis choice on the 
final night of the fourday convention 
nearly all of jacksons vice presidential support is coming from 
delegates pledged to support him for president according to the ap 
survey 
georgia sen sam nunn and jackson drew the most support in the 
survey followed by sens john glenn of ohio and albert j gore jr 
of tennessee further back were sens bill bradley of new jersey 
dale bumpers of arkansas and lloyd bentsen of texas 
ap bureaus throughout the united states are polling all 4161 
delegates to the democratic national convention which opens july 
18 in atlanta with replies tabulated from more than 1300 of those 
delegates thus far the trend was clear the delegates are not 
looking at anyone in particular 
dukakis by winning more delegates than jackson has earned 
the right to select whomever he wants regardless of how any of the 
other candidates did in the process said maine delegate john 
diamond who backs glenn 
of those tabulated 611 said they had no preference when asked 
whom they supported for the vice presidential nomination and 174 
supported nunn who said wednesday he told dukakis he is not 
interested in the job 
jackson was named as vice presidential choice by 148 delegates 
132 of whom already were supporting him for president 
jackson has said that because of his secondplace finish in the 
race for the presidential nomination he deserves to be offered the 
no 2 spot on the ticket he has not said whether he would accept 
the post if it is offered 
but jacksons argument found little support outside his own 
delegates 
i think that dukakis needs someone who has foreign policy or 
national experience and i dont think jackson has either maine 
delegate dana trattner said 
however lawrence lewis a jackson delegate from vermont said 
the vice presidential spot on the ticket should be offered to 
jackson because in the last 10 years jackson has done more to 
bring back enthusiasm than any other candidate the small 
person with little or no voice 
but support for jackson is not universal even among his own 
delegates 
barbara maddox a jackson delegate from michigan said she is 
still undecided about who should fill the second spot on the 
democratic ticket but is sure that it should not be offered 
automatically to jackson 
tradition has been that the presidential nominee of the party 
selects his running mate ms maddox said i think it should 
continue that way at least for this convention if they want to 
change the rules they should do it at the beginning of the game 
but theyve got to start a new game next year 
i dont think he should be the vice presidential nominee 
tom mason a dukakis delegate from oregon said of jackson i 
think we would lose the south 
and lawrence katz a dukakis delegate from arizona said jackson 
should be denied the spot on the ticket because of a jewish 
backlash over a 1984 remark in which he referred to new york as 
hymietown and his past association with nation of islam leader 
louis farrakhan 
dukakis spent wednesday on capitol hill talking to senators 
some of whom are potential running mates 
among the tabulated delegate replies glenn was supported for 
the vice presidential spot by 114 delegates while 94 backed gore 
bumpers and bradley were supported by 28 and 31 respectively and 
bentsen had 25 
dukakis himself was listed as the vice presidential choice of 28 
delegates twentyseven of them were jackson supporters

the keynote speaker for the republican 
national convention isnt known as a fiery orator he stuttered so 
badly as a child that he used to break into a cold sweat when he 
was called on in class and he has a hybrid new jerseynew england 
accent that earns him a good deal of ribbing 
but new jersey gov thomas h kean will be in the spotlight 
nonetheless at the gop convention aug 15 in new orleans selected 
from among hundred of other prominent republicans 
i am flattered by the honor excited about the opportunity 
and a bit humbled kean said during a news conference to announce 
he was accepting the offer from vice president george bush the 
expected republican presidential nominee 
i am going to go back home i guess sit for awhile and think 
about what i am going to say the governor said 
republican party sources had told the associated press on 
tuesday that kean had been picked to give the leadoff speech at the 
convention kean said he was told of his selection on tuesday and 
that bush called him wednesday to thank him for accepting 
bush called the governor one of the nations most respected 
leaders of either party 
we are extremely excited that the same voice of leadership 
that has inspired the people of new jersey will be in new orleans 
to send our troops out into battle said bush in a statement 
released by keans office 
keans selection provoked at least one republican however new 
hampshire sen gordon humphrey the senates leading opponent of 
legalized abortion threatened to stage a convention walkout if a 
righttolife partisan doesnt get equal time 
humphrey said kean is an outspoken advocate of abortion 
aides to the new jersey governor say kean is personally opposed to 
abortion but does not support a constitutional ban something 
humphrey has long sought 
kean spokesman john samerjan said the governor would not comment 
on humphreys complaint 
kean gained national prominence after his lopsided reelection 
gubernatorial victory in 1985 he captured nearly 60 percent of the 
black vote and twothirds of the bluecollar vote 
when asked the reason for the landslide victory in an industrial 
northeastern state kean uttered the fourword dogma for which his 
political autobiography is named the politics of inclusion 
kean has long urged the republican party to expand its appeal 
beyond its traditional bloc of supporters the affluent and 
middleclass whites to groups normally aligned with democrats 
such as blacks hispanics other minorities the poor and the 
bluecollar community 
kean said that over the next several weeks he will be developing 
themes and ideas for his speech and will draw upon the expertise of 
close aides and other republicans 
but he got a bit of encouragement from someone on the other side 
of the political aisle new york gov mario cuomo who delivered a 
muchacclaimed keynote address at the 1984 democratic national 
convention kean said he received a congratulatory call from cuomo 
on wednesday 
kean noted however that he felt no pressure to measure up to 
cuomos rousing speech to democrats in 1984 a monumental address 
that brought cuomo into the national spotlight 
mario cuomo is a better speaker than i am said kean but 
ill do my best what i want to do obviously is present a message 
and do what i can to help george bush and the party youve got 
to do your own speech 
born into one of new jerseys most distinguished families kean 
wrote in his autobiography of a lonely childhood and a stuttering 
problem so bad that it was an ordeal to speak up when he was called 
on in school 
he graduated from princeton university and holds a graduate 
degree from columbia university he taught prep school served as a 
camp director and was president of a real estate company before 
entering political life in 1968 when he served the first of 10 
consecutive years in the state assembly kean was speaker of the 
house in 1972 and 1973 and was elected governor in 1981

sen gordon humphrey protesting the selection 
of new jersey gov thomas kean as keynote speaker at the republican 
national convention is threatening to stage a walkout unless a 
righttolife partisan gets equal time 
humphrey the senates leading opponent of legalized abortion 
said the selection of kean to give the highprofile 
conventionopening address was a terrible mistake a blunder an 
affront to the righttolife movement 
humphrey said kean is an outspoken advocate of abortion 
aides to the new jersey governor say kean is personally opposed to 
abortion but does not support a constitutional ban something 
humphrey has long sought 
kean spokesman john samerjan said the governor would not comment 
on humphreys complaint 
humphrey said vice president george bush the republican 
nomineeapparent also needs to assure us that his vice 
presidential running mate will be someone who shares george bushs 
opposition to abortion 
the new hampshire senator said it was up to the bush campaign to 
settle the dispute before the convention which opens aug 15 in 
new orleans 
im going to try to organize a walkout from the convention 
during the governors speech unless between now and then the bush 
campaign seeks to make amends for this affront said humphrey 
who is a delegate to the convention 
humphrey said he wasnt opposed to kean being allowed to speak 
at the convention but objected to his giving the major address 
hes done an outstanding job as governor humphrey said but 
its a colossal blunder to have him give the keynote speech 
i think this decision is just another further indication of 
the inability of the bush campaign to understand the kind of 
coalition it must put together if it hopes to have the support of 
conservative republicans and democrats humphrey said 
ive spoken to about a dozen members of the senate and the 
house who are very upset humphrey said 
there is incredulity that george bush would choose an even 
moreblueblood figure than he is humphrey added noting keans 
aristocratic background 
kean the son of a congressman and grandson of a senator 
attended prep school and graduated from princeton university before 
becoming a banker and teacher

over half the female state department 
employees in a survey said they were harassed sexually at work 
giving the department the worst record in a study of the problem in 
the federal workplace 
but the department is by no means alone in having a dismal 
record the survey by the us merit systems protection board said 
sexual harassment is pervasive costly and systemic in the 
federal workplace 
in a report issued wednesday the board said 42 percent of women 
and 14 percent of men who responded to its survey of federal 
employees experienced some form of sexual harassment from may 1985 
to may 1987 that figure was virtually identical to findings in the 
boards 1980 survey 
the board an independent quasijudicial agency that decides 
federal employee appeals from personnel actions found that the 
problem cost the united states an estimated 267 million over the 
twoyear period in paying sick leave to employees who missed work 
replacing employees who left their jobs and in reduced individual 
and group productivity 
however the report noted that the respondents generally did not 
consider the problem any worse in the federal government than in 
the private sector 
i dont think the federal government is somehow a hotbed of 
sexual harassment that stands out from the rest of the country 
this is a problem in the rest of the country john m palguta 
the project supervisor said in an interview 
the survey was sent in march 1987 to a representative sample of 
about 13000 fulltime permanent federal workers and 8523 
employees responded 
palguta said the survey was checked carefully to make sure those 
who responded were representative and did not for example 
represent a high percentage of people who had reported problems 
the survey found that the state department had the highest 
percentage 52 percent of women respondents who said they 
experienced some form of uninvited sexual attention the veterans 
administration had the highest percentage of men respondents 21 
percent claiming sexual harassment 
the department of health and human services had the lowest 
percentage of women respondents who claimed harassment 29 percent 
and nasa had the lowest percentage of men who said they were 
harassed 10 percent 
a wide range of behavior was considered to be sexual harassment 
it was generally viewed as uninvited and unwanted attention 
including letters telephone calls or materials of a sexual 
nature touching sexually suggestive looks or gestures pressure 
for sexual favors or dates sexual jokes or questions actual or 
attempted assault or rape 
the most frequently experienced type of uninvited attention is 
unwanted sexual teasing jokes remarks or questions the 
report said 
women were more likely than men to be victims they were likely 
to be working in a nontraditional job in a predominantly male 
environment have some college education be single or divorced and 
between the ages of 20 and 44 male victims were more likely to be 
divorced or separated age 20 to 44 in clerical or trainee 
positions in a predominantly female work group 
the board said victims are most often harassed by coworkers and 
by people of the opposite sex twentytwo percent of male victims 
however reported in the 1980 survey that they were harassed by one 
or more men the question was not asked in the 1987 survey 
only 5 percent of both female and male victims said they took 
some kind of formal action usually in the form of requesting an 
investigation by the employing agency 
the report recommended that federal agencies and departments 
provide training on sexual harassment to all employees quickly and 
thoroughly investigate allegations and exercise strong sanctions 
against offenders existing guidelines detailing specific 
prohibited practices and penalties should be updated annually the 
report said

ethiopian leader mengistu haire 
mariam has renewed a call for improved relations with the united 
states but us diplomats are skeptical of the offer 
mengistu who transformed prowestern ethiopia into a marxist 
state after the military toppled emperor haile selassie in 1974 
told a may news conference we are not really pleased with our 
relations with the united states we will do everything of our best 
to improve relations i am sincere about this 
but us charge daffaires james cheek referring to a series of 
such overtures in the past three years said its been a history 
of occasional words and no action 
words are always welcome but they dont get you far if they 
are not accompanied by actions 
us officials said that mengistu at short notice canceled 
planned meetings three times in the past six months with chester 
crocker the us assistant secretary of state for african affairs 
in the latest incident crocker was at frankfurt airport in 
january awaiting a flight for addis ababa when the ethiopians 
said the meeting was off 
an angry crocker told voice of america president mengistu and 
his politburo are not interested in pursuing the possibilities of 
broadening their international options and are quite comfortable 
where they are out of step with the rest of africa but in a cozy 
relationship with the soviets and the cubans 
some diplomats based in addis ababa believe mengistu may face 
opposition from hardliners in his government who prefer to see 
even greater distance between addis ababa and washington 
ethiopia has close ties with the soviet union and receives 
substantial military aid from moscow in the governments battles 
against separatist guerrillas it is the only african nation with 
soviet combat troops it also has 2500 cuban soldiers 
under haile selassies rule the united states was ethiopias 
firmest foreign friend 
today the united states is a vocal critic of mengistus marxist 
reforms and his failure effectively to come to terms with rebel 
uprisings and persistent food shortages 
we are not saying for them to give up relations with the 
soviet union said cheek in an interview but we are saying 
pursue a truly nationalist and nonaligned policy 
ethiopian leaders resent the branding of their country as a 
client state of moscow neutral diplomats contend mengistu is 
fiercely independentminded but grudgingly forced to embrace the 
soviets to fight off guerrilla armies seeking autonomy or 
independence in eritrea and tigre provinces 
in his news conference last month mengistus tone toward the 
united states wavered from anger to admiration 
simple hatred he asserted at one point might have prompted 
washington to label ethiopia a communist country 
but he also declared we have respect and admiration for the 
american people once upon a time we were close friends 
the oncewarm relations between washington and addis ababa 
deteriorated when the soviet union became ethiopias biggest patron 
in 1977 
washington suspended development aid and downgraded its 
diplomatic representative from ambassador to a charge daffaires 
there was little contact until the 19841985 famine when the 
united states was the biggest donor of emergency food to the 
nation this year washington again is the biggest donor as a 
drought threatens more than 7 million ethiopians nearly half of 
them in the wartorn north 
there has been friction over the delivery of food supplies 
however with washington accusing mengistu of trying to keep food 
from reaching the northern rebels and the united states diverting 
some supplies for ethiopia to sudan for distribution by rebel 
organizations 
cheek believes that despite the acrimony the two countries 
could begin a rapprochement 
at least we could talk about getting the legal obstacles out 
of the way though the policy obstacles would stick said cheek 
the angolans are trying the south africans are trying but these 
people have not tried 
in 1985 ethiopia resolved one of several legal problems by 
paying 7 million in compensation to us companies for 
nationalized property 
us economic assistance still is restricted by laws that deny 
development aid to countries accused of human rights abuses and 
which owe money for arms

a compromise bill aimed at putting teeth into 
the nations basic fair housing law goes to the senate after 
winning overwhelming approval in the democraticcontrolled house 
the house voted 37623 wednesday evening in favor of the 
legislation to broaden protections against housing bias and speed 
review of complaints all the nays were cast by republicans 
the senate is expected to take quick action on the measure 
which amends the 1968 fair housing act the act barred 
discrimination based on race color religion or national origin 
in the sale or rental of housing a 1974 law prohibits housing 
discrimination on the basis of sex 
president reagan has said he supports the legislation which 
broadens the power of the department of housing and urban 
development to enforce discrimination complaints 
as part of the political compromises necessary to get the 
original law enacted hud was given the power to resolve disputes 
only through mediation 
the new proposal would empower hud officials to institute legal 
proceedings against parties they believe are guilty of 
discrimination but in a major concession to real estate interests 
those accused of discrimination would have the choice of taking 
their cases before an administrative law judge or a trial court 
rep john lewis dga a civil rights leader in the south in 
the 1960s said the legislation breaks another link in the chains 
that have bound our society in the ravages of discrimination 
what we do here today will be a meaningful and significant 
step on the long and continued journey on the road to an open 
society lewis said in a floor speech we are saying to the 
american people that we must look out for the common good that we 
are one nation one community one house the american house 
the legislation represents a compromise between the civil rights 
groups and realtors associations whose bitter dispute over 
enforcement of housing discrimination laws had stalled 
congressional action for nearly 11 years the two sides finally 
reached an agreement last week 
the house also approved 241159 an amendment by rep robert k 
dornan rcalif to ban discrimination against women who are 
pregnant

a small number of 
blackfooted ferret one of the rarest animals in north america 
may be living in the canadian portion of the watertonglacier 
international peace park a naturalist says 
if verified the find may have all the significance of the 
return of the whooping crane duane barrus the parks chief 
naturalist said this week 
the only known population of the weasellike animals is in a 
captive breeding program at the sybille wildlife center near 
wheatland wyo the ferrets believed extinct for years were 
discovered near meteetse wyo in 1981 and now number 62 
we believe among ourselves that we have a small wild 
population not too small we hope to reproduce barrus said of 
the waterton ferrets 
information about the sightings was relayed to park officials 
this spring by frank goble a retired waterton businessman who 
lives in cardston alberta barrus said 
goble said his son david a physics professor at a nova scotia 
university who summers in cardston first saw a ferret in 1983 but 
did not know what it was until he returned to school and saw a 
photograph in a national geographic magazine 
it was about six feet from him the elder goble said he 
thought it was a funnylooking weasel 
theyre out there he said my wife saw one last night 
im inclined to think that theres a fair population but theyre 
scattered 
barrus said researchers had not looked for blackfooted ferrets 
inside the park because they were believed to live only alongside 
prairie dogs their primary food source and waterton has no 
prairie dogs 
barrus said the animals may have adapted to feed on columbian 
ground squirrels which are plentiful in the park and perhaps on 
the richardsons ground squirrel or common gopher 
park officials have persuaded the canadian wildlife service to 
begin a study inside the park across southern alberta and into 
saskatchewan to get photos and determine the population and range 
of the ferrets barrus said

a juvenile court has sentenced 
two british soccer fans to two weeks in jail for a drunken attack 
on four italian fans during the european soccer championships 
but a court spokesman who asked not to be identified further

the air force says it is looking for other 
emergency power sources after scrubbing a program that would have 
placed small nuclear reactors at bases around the country 
we continue to be concerned about secure power and secure 
energy for our air force bases gary s flora associate director 
of air force engineering and services told a house government 
operations subcommittee wednesday 
his testimony came after an official of the general accounting 
office criticized the fouryear reactor development program which 
cost about 375 million as illconceived and poorly managed the 
program was terminated in may 1987 
flora said the air force is pursuing other options including 
additional feeder cables from the commercial power grid and 
installation of more auxiliary power generators at bases 
key facilities currently have backup generators he said 
but in most cases they can supply only a fraction of total power 
needs 
the local reactor project was prompted by the need to provide 
air force bases with auxiliary power supplies that would be more 
secure against disruption in the event of natural disasters 
sabotage terrorism or wartime attack 
rep mike synar dokla chairman of the subcommittee on the 
environment energy and natural resources said that while such 
concern was understandable the logical approach would seem to 
call for assessing all the options and choosing the one best suited 
to each individual base 
instead doe the department of energy pressed ahead with a 
plan to put cloned mininukes at bases around the country at a 
cost which could ultimately approach 20 billion he said 
as a start the program envisioned locating 10megawatt reactors 
at seven bases tinker air force base okla mcclellan afb 
calif kelly afb texas robbins afb ga hill afb utah 
mountain afb idaho and shemya afb alaska 
initial work on the project was done at los alamos national 
laboratory for does office of defense programs then before the 
los alamos feasibility study was complete the project was 
reassigned to does office of nuclear energy and the work was 
transferred to the departments idaho national engineering 
laboratory 
air force responsibility for the project also was shifted from 
an office at tyndall air force base fla to another at bolling 
afb in washington dc before the plan was dropped 
keith o fultz senior associate director of the gaos 
resources community and economic development division told the 
subcommittee that despite the time and money spent the program 
made little progress toward its intended goal 
he said the gao a congressional watchdog agency viewed the 
project as illconceived because the choice and feasibility of 
using nuclear power was never clearly established and documented 
prior to the decision to proceed 
flora emphasized in his testimony that the service had decided 
to kill the small reactors project before it proceeded beyond an 
early stage 
phase one of the project was a feasibility study only he 
said we decided the concept to be too costly it may have turned 
out that cost would have been outweighed by environmental concerns 
even if nuclear plants would have proved costeffective

hollywood actors and directors are coming up 
short in their efforts to win congressional approval of an outright 
ban on computer colorization of blackandwhite movies 
in the first capitol hill floor vote on the issue the house on 
wednesday approved legislation that would merely discourage 
colorization of classics such as casablanca and the maltese 
falcon 
the vote came on an amendment tacked by rep sidney yates 
dill onto an interior department spending bill the amendment 
would establish a 13member national film preservation board 
composed of filmrelated officials such as heads of the actors 
writers and directors guilds and of the academy of motion picture 
arts and sciences 
operating with a 100000ayear budget in the interior 
department the board would recommend movies for inclusion in a 
national film registry with up to 25 movies to selected for the 
registry each year by the interior secretary 
a registered film would be given a special seal to denote its 
status and the seal could be used to promote any version of the 
movie that has not been materially altered a term that includes 
colorization and heavy editing 
materially altered versions of registered films would have to 
carry labels to that effect in their advertising and on boxes 
containing videocassette versions 
the bill containing the film board amendment was sent to the 
senate by a 36145 vote with rep don edwards dcalif objecting 
to the amendment on constitutional freespeech grounds 
establishing a national film commission to pass on the merits 
or values of films is an unprecedented and unwarranted extension of 
federal power over privately produced works of art edwards said 
this is contentbased government regulation of speech in simple 
terms that is censorship 
we should not have a government body deciding that some films 
are worthy and some are not politics will enter into the 
decisions 
hollywood figures such as actor james stewart and director fred 
zinneman have been lobbying congress for months objecting to 
increasing numbers of movies colorized for television through a 
computer process

the white house is making veto threats against 
a housepassed spending bill that president reagans budget 
director says threatens us promises to canada to combat acid rain 
pollution 
james miller director of the office of management and budget 
is criticizing the 969 billion package to finance the interior 
department us forest service and key energy research programs in 
fiscal 1989 
miller says unless changes are made he will recommend a veto of 
the bill which was sent to the senate on wednesday by a 36145 
vote a margin far larger than what would be needed in the house 
to override any veto 
miller said the house bill would jeopardize the commitment 
reagan made to canada to combat acid rain from us sources by 
developing technology to reduce pollution from coalburning plants 
he said congress is backtracking on its agreement last year to 
spend 525 million on clean coal research in fiscal 1989 which 
begins oct 1 instead the house plan would spend only 100 
million in 1989 with 225 million earmarked for 1990 and 200 
million for 1991 
although miller blamed congress exclusively the 425 million 
cut in fiscal 1989 resulted from an agreement between the white 
house and congress to reduce the massive federal budget deficit 
miller also complained about the continuation of moratoria on 
leasing federal oil tracts off the coasts of northern california 
and massachusetts and the resumption of such a ban off southwestern 
florida the moratoria are for a year 
he said the administration strongly opposes a related provision 
that would require at least 50 percent us labor and materials to 
be used for petroleum facilities in other parts of the outer 
continental shelf 
miller contends that the buyus language would delay needed 
exploration drive up its costs and violate international trade 
agreements inviting retaliation by other nations 
the vetothreat message delivered to lawmakers also cited 
opposition to giving states 157 million for energy conservation 
programs which miller says states should finance themselves 
spending 156 million on discretionary construction and earmarking 
64 million for indian health facilities when existing facilities 
have a 50 percent vacancy rate 
the house was unmoved by the warning and the administration got 
no help from republicans rep ralph regula rohio called the 
legislation a peoples bill and ranking appropriations 
committee republican silvio conte of rhode island urged colleagues 
to vote for the measure calling it a good bill 
because of the tight money situation the legislation is 
proposing no major new initiatives and would grant mainly modest 
spending increases 
the national park service for example would get 960 million 
up from 900 million but well above the 780 million proposed by 
the white house the service and other interior agencies would get 
167 million for land acquisition more than eight times what 
reagan proposed 
overall the interior department would get 4484 billion next 
year compared to 4427 billion this year and the administrations 
request of 3973 billion 
the forest service would get 181 billion 200 million above 
the administrations proposal and about 56 million more than in 
fiscal 1988 the house approved the services plan to harvest more 
than 11 billion board feet of lumber on public land but it cut 5 
million from the current 1668 million roadbuilding budget

america faces a time of reckoning when 
foreign sources will no longer be willing to loan the money 
necessary for the nation to sustain its deficitridden trade 
habits says a congressional report 
the report prepared by the office of technology assessment and 
released wednesday by sen john heinz rpa says no nation 
not even one as rich as the united states can go on forever paying 
its current account deficit with foreign capital 
the current account is the most important of all the government 
trade statistics because it covers not only trade in merchandise 
but also trade in the socalled services category which reflects 
primarily the flow of investment earnings between nations 
the account has showed a deficit since 1981 as americans have 
handed over billions of dollars to foreigners in exchange for 
imported goods the us deficit has been sustained by loans and 
investments from abroad 
as the united states sinks further into debt foreign 
investors and creditors central banks individuals and firms 
will be less inclined to commit everincreasing amounts of capital 
to a 4 trillion economy on a spending spree ota said 
when that happens it said the united states will be forced to 
decrease government spending business investment or consumption 
or all three one way that could happen is through a recession 
but ota said the nation could minimize its economic woes by 
getting better at manufacturing with the governments help 
that is the most constructive way to recapture some of our own 
markets and raise exports the report said 
another way to boost exports is through a devalued dollar but 
that also increases the cost of imported cars video cassette 
recorders and other imported goods the report noted 
ota did not predict when the time of reckoning would occur 
it said the trade patterns of the 1980s are a significant 
departure from any past experience 
the report rejected the notion that service industries such as 
banking engineering or software design can replace manufacturing 
industries or cut the deficit on their own 
to speak of services as taking the place of manufacturing is 
to overlook the strong interdependence of the two kinds of 
activities and the blurring of distinctions between them ota 
said 
many service industries depend heavily on manufacturers for 
business and some manufacturing industries could hardly exist 
without allied services for example the manufacture of computers 
and design of software often by an independent firm it said 
of the 161 billion trade deficit in 1987 85 percent was in 
manufacturing such as motor vehicles and parts textiles shoes and 
electronics ota said 
the report was released at a news conference by heinz who said 
it demonstrated that manufacturing is the key and that bringing 
down the dollar to make american exports more attractive will not 
be enough

tough norwegian stock the pasture is pretty well worked and i 
am nervous about the water 
there aint much you can do about it though he said 
this is the heart of americas upper breadbasket 
breakfast attire can consist of big mac bib overalls dungarees 
blue work shirts clodhopper work shoes caterpillar belt buckles 
and baseballstyle mesh caps that advertise everything from seeds 
to tractors to fertilizers 
the restaurants wallpaper is a pattern with spears of wheat 
farm sales and auctions are posted on a bulletin board near the 
cash register 
the men speak in measured tones about how their crop is faring 
and ask their colleagues how theyre doing 
you can talk to your neighbors and exchange ideas maybe pick 
up something that you can give a whirl said jim regstad 46 of 
georgetown 
regstad has 100 acres of sugar beets that seem to be weathering

weather she said while carrying a tray of food even though

president reagan misread the hourglass when he 
challenged congress to take politics out of the national drug 
policy debate 
whatever sands of goodwill that existed had already slipped away 
by the time reagan used a midmay coast guard academy address to 
urge creation of a joint executivelegislative branch task force 
as i finish my final year in office and look ahead i worry 
that drug politics might undermine effective drug policy reagan 
said in the speech thats why today im calling on both houses 
of the congress both sides of the aisle to join with my 
representatives in a special executivelegislative task force to 
advance americas unified response to the problem of illegal drug 
use 
a month and a half later reagan has only twothirds of the task 
force the executive branch members and the representatives 
selected by republican congressional leaders 
the democrats have never sent the white house their task force 
lineup and this will not happen say those close to house speaker 
jim wright of texas house majority leader tom foley of washington 
and senate majority leader robert c byrd of west virginia 
simply put reagan had an idea whose time had passed theres 
the ongoing presidential campaign not to speak of the separate 
task forces already set up by the house and senate when reagan 
proposed the joint effort finally theres the reality that 
precious little time remains for lawmaking before congress goes 
into recess 
the clear confluence of politics and this citys great political 
debates is rarely out of sight and its seldom been more stark 
than in the drug issue during this presidential election year 
reagan violates the spirit of his own proposal when he puts in a 
plug for vice president george bushs antidrug efforts as he has 
done on more than one occasion in fact the presidential campaign 
crossfire between bush and democrat michael dukakis makes 
bipartisan approaches even less likely 
jeff biggs a spokesman for foley said we already have a 
task force my guess is that theres not going to be any 
appointments 
house minority leader bob michel rill said i would sure 
hope they would because they can give a sense of direction to it 
but in the absence of that i think we in the legislative branch 
have got to move ahead as aggressively as we can 
the unwillingness of democrats to name members to reagans task 
force has left white house officials grousing about political 
motives with tongueincheek expressions of shock 
gee i know jim wrights a partisan but i certainly would 
never suggest that congressman wright would want to be playing 
politics on the drug issue there must be some other explanation 
said domestic policy adviser gary bauer 
reagan may have been hoping to find the same kind of bipartisan 
cooperation that marked the joint executivelegislative agreement 
on a congressional budgetreducing package in the wake of the oct 
19 wall street collapse when investors sent a vote of 
noconfidence to washington political leaders 
or maybe he was looking for the kind of pulltogether consensus 
the administration enjoyed in congress when it decided to bomb 
libya in midapril 1986 in reprisal for a surge of terrorism that 
us officials laid at the feet of strongman moammar gadhafi 
what the drug task force fiasco likely proves is that only 
perceived emergencies slice through the partisanship of washington 
politics and that the drug problem did not fit that criterion its 
perils notwithstanding 
the drug issue will still be here after election day

the roman catholic church has suffered ruptures for 
centuries here at a glance is a look at the major schisms 
the old catholics led by german clergy and laymen split from 
the holy see in 1870 when they rejected the decrees of the first 
vatican council particularly the dogma of papal infallibility by 
1874 they set up a new church which among other things allowed 
priests to marry and made confession optional 
the great schism or the schism of the west occurred from 1378 
to 1417 it involved not a dispute over faith or practice but a 
conflict between two parties each claiming to support the true pope 
the schism began with the death of pope gregory xi in 1378 
under pressure from romans who feared that the papacy might move 
back to avignon france the cardinals elected urban vi as the new 
pope a few months later the cardinals declared the election 
invalid and elected cardinal robert of geneva as pope clement vii 
and he moved to avignon urban retorted by naming 28 new cardinals 
the schism lasted through two lines of popes ending in 1417 with 
the election of martin v today it is generally agreed that the 
urbanist popes were the true ones 
the eastwest schism marked the split between the holy see and 
the orthodox eastern church after centuries of doctrinal disputes 
and diverging traditions the break began in 1054 when michael 
cerularius the patriarch of constantinople split with pope leo 
ix the breach gradually widened becoming definitive in 1472 
in a recent split with rome china cut ties with the vatican in 
1957 and established its own breakaway catholic church which now 
claims 3 million members an unknown number of other chinese 
catholics remain secretly loyal to the pope 
cardinal rosalio jose castillo lara the vaticans leading canon 
law expert said tuesday that the chinese split is not considered 
schismatic because it is assumed the catholics were not acting on 
their own free will 
the catholic encyclopaedic dictionary defines schism as the 
refusal to submit to the authority of the pope or to hold communion 
with members of the church subject to him the sacraments may not 
be administered to schismatics even those in good faith according 
to the dictionary 
the case of martin luther 14831546 german leader of the 
protestant reformation was not one of schism but of heresy in 
that he was seen as rejecting a truth that the catholic church 
proposed as revealed by god

members of congress will have to cut short 
their july 4th campaign plans because of a struggle for political 
oneupmanship on the issue of giving workers advance notice of 
plant closings and layoffs 
democrats had hoped to win passage of a mandatory notice bill in 
both the senate and house before the independence day break so they 
could vote on overriding an expected veto from president reagan 
before the partys national convention in three weeks 
republicans thwarted those ambitions wednesday stalling final 
action this week by saying they would make democrats vote first on 
a massachusetts voluntary notice law touted by democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis 
with dukakis at the capitol most of the day wednesday democrats 
balked at allowing a vote that would have enabled republicans to 
claim victory either way as a rejection of dukakis or as a 
rejection of mandatory notices 
majority leader robert c byrd pulled the bill from the floor 
saying were not going to sit around here and fiddlefaddle with 
these little amendments that dont mean anything 
byrd had promised lawmakers earlier that they could spend all of 
next week campaigning for reelection in their home states if the 
senate could get final passage of the bill wednesday and allow 
house action on it today 
instead he and house speaker jim wright dtexas agreed to 
reconvene congress july 6 in another attempt to win passage of the 
plantclosing measure next week 
still the delay effectively precludes any chance of congress 
overriding a veto before the democratic convention opens july 18 in 
atlanta assuming reagan will use all 10 working days he has under 
the constitution to exercise it 
with polls showing more than 80 percent of americans in favor of 
advance layoff notices opposition to the mandatory 60day notice 
proposal from reagan and vice president george bush has become a 
top campaign issue for democrats 
dukakis boasted through the primaries that because of his 
efforts massachusetts is the one state that has a comprehensive 
plant closing law even though labor leaders and other critics say 
that it is toothless 
the 1984 massachusetts statute requests but does not require 
employers to give 90 days advance notice of a plant closings which 
is defined as a layoff involving at least 90 percent of a 
facilitys work force 
and the only sanction that it provides the denial of state 
economic aid to troubled companies that decline to sign a 
nonbinding pledge to provide the notices 
lets vote on the dukakis plan lets see how many votes he 
has senate minority leader robert dole dkan said wednesday 
hes for giving notice in his state but he wants to give it 
voluntarily 
dole said reagan would sign a substitute bill modeled on the 
massachusetts plan that seeks only voluntary rather than mandatory 
notices and offers incentives rather than fines as an inducement 
vice president george bush also has endorsed voluntary notices 
and conditioning federal contracts and tax incentives on pledges by 
companies to provide them

trumps castle hotel amp casino find employees trumps castle helps 
sister carmela get people off welfare all parties agree its a 
heavenly relationship 
the 62yearold member of the sisters of charity was driving 
recently thinking of ways to get jobs for the poor thats when 
she heard a radio advertisement for trumps castle 
she wrote to multimillionaire developer donald trump with an 
idea why not take people off the welfare lines and see if they 
want to work in his casino 
trump did not write back but his staff at trumps castle 
responded to her request 
shes phenomenal said judy ruchser the casinos personnel 
manager she does not take no for an answer shes a person 
with an astute business sense who just happened to devote her life 
to christ 
shed be a hell of an executive ms ruchser said she 
sets her sights on something and nothing will stop her 
sister carmela said she was troubled by reading about all 
these welfare recipients living in the motels 
its a terrible waste of taxpayers money to pay 1500 a 
month for a room they cant cook meals and many of them are run 
down this is making them dependent and many of them could get 
jobs she said 
all sister carmela had to do was find potential workers she 
headed to the pemberton township welfare office about 30 miles 
north of here at the beginning of june to interview recipients as 
they picked up their welfare checks of the first 45 people she 
talked to she referred 15 to the casino 
with her own money sister carmela bought a van to get the 15

too little vitamin b12 may sometimes be 
responsible for memory loss tingling fingers and other 
neurological problems according to a study published today 
the research concludes that contrary to common medical belief 
people can suffer these nervous system symptoms from vitamin b12 
deficiency even if they dont show signs of anemia or enlarged red 
blood cells 
its not real oddball and rare but its also not found in the 
majority of patients said dr john lindenbaum 
he said doctors see five or six such cases each year at new 
yorks columbiapresbyterian medical center and harlem hospital 
centers where the research was conducted 
in an editorial published with the study in the new england 
journal of medicine dr william s beck of massachusetts general 
hospital called the finding provacative and encouraging but he 
said they need to be confirmed by other researchers 
among the symptoms attributed to vitamin b12 deficiency were 
tingling and numbness of the fingers and toes walking 
difficulties memory loss dementia and fatigue 
the doctors found blood to be normal in 34 of 141 patients with 
the deficiency some had been incorrectly diagnosed as having other 
problems including strokes all of the patients responded to 
injections of the vitamin 
they recommended that physicians check patients vitamin b12 
levels when trying to diagnose unexplainable neurological problems 
the approach to this problem is not to give everybody and 
their motherinlaw vitamin b12 shots at the drop of a symptom but 
to document that they are vitamin b12 deficient and then treat 
them lindenbaum said 
vitamin b12 is available as pills but injections are more 
effective he said he also cautioned against people taking the 
vitamin without being advised by a physician

the communist partys first conference in 47 
years though far from the wideopen battles of western 
conventions is exposing discord rarely seen since the turbulent 
decade after the bolshevik revolution 
for two nights in a row soviet television viewers have seen 
members of their nations only political party disagree with one 
another and with mikhail s gorbachev 
only selected segments of the conference are being shown on 
television and foreign and most soviet reporters are barred from 
the conference hall 
but accounts in the staterun media and comments from delegates 
make clear this is not a routine kremlin gathering of tame 
stonefaced delegates applauding and voting in unison 
the squabbles and splits over everything from the economy and 
ethnic issues to the press and politics signal the kind of break 
with vestiges of the stalinist past that gorbachev advocated in his 
keynote address tuesday 
in the early 1920s internal party battles were fierce and 
obvious but josef stalin took the fighting behind tightly shut 
doors then eliminated it in a gruesome wave of show trials and 
executions 
when nikita s khrushchev denounced stalin in 1956 he did so in 
a secret speech that still has not been published in the soviet 
union 
even the new soviet openness has not fully penetrated the 
infighting in the party leadership in november boris n yeltsin 
was fired from his job as moscow party chief for attacking the slow 
pace of reform 
his speech remains unpublished 
gorbachev made it clear tuesday that his drive for glasnost 
or openness should not become weighted in favor of liberals 
when actor mikhail ulyanov complained to the conference on 
wednesday that the staterun media have become a combative force 
gorbachev peered over from his perch on the dais to interrupt 
in the past there was a monopoly on the media by one group of 
people and we know what that has brought about the soviet 
leader said 
now we see another group acting very gradually wants to use 
the press as a national rostrum we want the pluralism of 
views 
in a 3hour keynote speech gorbachev lambasted conservative 
apparatchiks for blocking change and outlined plans for 
redistributing political power so the party is no longer involved 
in the daytoday business of governing 
but he made clear it was not too late for opponents to climb on 
the bandwagon of reform 
in the 15 minutes allotted to them delegates have taken a much 
more strident stance for or against economic reform political 
change and the increasing outspokenness of the soviet press 
there has been no hint of a split in the politburo or criticism 
by name of the party leadership but gorbachevs proposals came 
under fire right after they were unveiled 
economist leonid abalkin a noted reformer labeled as 
undemocratic the suggestion that local communist chiefs should head 
local governing councils 
abalkin even uttered the onceunthinkable phrase multiparty 
system as he asked whether oneparty rule could guarantee 
unfettered political debate 
that passage of his speech was not televised but word of it got 
to reporters prompting party officials to read the relevant 
passage to reporters 
western reporters treated to numerous briefings with delegates 
have gleaned more about the debates than soviet citizens restricted 
to reading their newspapers or watching television 
as in the west preconference battles presaged the sniping now 
seen in debate as reformers battled conservatives over the delegate 
slate 
in leningrad moscow yaroslavl and omsk angry citizens took to 
the streets to protest conservatives maneuvering against reformers 
sometimes really it was turbulent said author and 
leningrad delegate daniil granin of the battles in his city in two 
cases popular protests even led to the disqualification of 
delegates 
on wednesday there was a hint that more delegates may be barred 
when fv popov party chief in the siberian altai region pointed 
to allegations that some uzbek delegates had taken bribes an 
investigation was promised 
the bribery charges were first published in the weekly ogonyok 
a forthright advocates of openness that was itself criticized by 
some delegates 
vladimir karpov head of the soviet writers union complained 
that some writers are filling in the blank spots in soviet history 
by painting them totally black 
karpovs deputy yuri bondarev charged that nihilistic 
criticism is becoming a commanding force in the press the 
immorality of the press cannot teach morality 
grigory baklanov chief editor of the literary magazine znamya 
called karpovs and bondarevs comments a disgrace 
if im given the floor ill certainly say what i think he 
told a news conference holding out promise of more delegate 
battles before the gathering ends

the environmental protection agency has 
decided against regulating oil and gas drilling wastes as hazardous 
material saying another layer of regulation is impractical for the 
hundreds of thousands of wells across the country 
but the agency is promising to get tough on states that fail to 
enforce existing regulations governing the disposal of such wastes 
as brine and drilling muds and ensuring abandoned wells are capped 
it was a tough decision but i think we made the right 
decision said j winston porter epas assistant administrator 
for solid waste and emergency response we were concerned about 
layering on another level of regulations 
the biggest problem found by the epa at the nations wells was 
the disposal of brine salt water that is extracted from wells in 
the drilling process porter said regulations already exist to 
cover that problem 
an environmental group criticized the decision as contrary to 
the public interest 
these substances do contain hazardous wastes with names 14 
syllables long said mike matz alaska representative of the 
sierra club clearly the epa once again is favoring big oil and 
big business and is shunning its responsibility to protect the 
public health and the environment 
congress in 1976 gave epa authority to decide what waste needs 
to be covered by the strict handling and disposal regulations that 
apply to hazardous wastes but it required a study before decisions 
could be made about oil and gas production wastes 
epa in december completed the study and then allowed public 
comment before drafting its recommendations the final report was 
to be presented to congress today 
epa estimated in its report that oil and gas production would be 
cut up to 12 percent if drilling wastes were treated as hazardous 
the cost of the program would have been at least 1 billion and 
could have ranged up to 6 billion porter said 
the american petroleum institute had put those costs much higher 
up to 37 billion the first year and 7 billion annually 
thereafter 
epa said stripper wells those that generally produce less than 
10 barrels a day could not have easily absorbed the additional 
costs for hazardous waste management 
oilstate lawmakers such as rep jim chapman dtexas opposed 
any new treatment requirements he said compliance would have been 
virtually impossible from an economic standpoint and in many 
instances unnecessary 
laws dealing with hazardous wastes are not very flexible and 
just didnt seem to fit this industry very well porter said

blazing sun may be baking the midcontinent 
but proposals for fighting the drought are raining down on capitol 
hill 
this is certainly the worst drought that this country has 
suffered since the droughts of the 30s sen john melcher 
dmont said wednesday in calling for steppedup federal aid 
our farmers are staggering 
proposals ranged from cancellation of a 50cent cut in dairy 
price supports to an evangelists haylift of livestock feed to 
south dakota 
democratic presidential nomineetobe michael dukakis huddled 
with farm democrats at the capitol on wednesday to discuss the 
plight of farmers 
i think the governors attitude was very reassuring to all of 
us said rep thomas foley dwash after the session he 
doesnt come with a lot of preconceived technical proposals hes 
there to get our counsel and advice 
meanwhile sens tom daschle dsd and david pryor dark 
lent their support to a haylift designed to feed 2000 to 3000 
head of cattle in south dakota for a month 
the rev larry jones an oklahoma city evangelist developed the 
plan to load hay onto 15 railroad cars for transport to south 
dakota where livestock producers are desperate to replace feed 
burned away by the sun 
a lottery might be needed to determine who gets the feed said 
dallas tonsager president of the south dakota farmers union since 
3000 head represent only a small fraction of the south dakota 
herd he expressed gratitude though to jones for his effort 
they say that a rising tide raises all boats jones 
declared but everybody does not have a boat and those who do not 
have a boat when the tide rises drown rural america is drowning 
livestock producers are being forced to sell their herds for 
lack of feed creating a buyers market and thus driving down 
prices 
the situation is going from bad to worse daschle said 
each day additional herds are shipped south and out of state 
an hour later in the same senate committee room melcher 
unveiled a wideranging drought relief bill at another news 
conference 
it would guarantee incomesupport payments to farm program 
participants whose crops fail and provide payments for growers of 
crops not covered by a usda program it also would authorize the 
secretary of agriculture to make irrigation grants 
federal officials would be directed to transport cattle out of 
droughtstricken areas hit by shortages of livestock feed the bill 
also would cancel an expected 50cent cut in dairy prices supports 
set for next year 
melchers plan received support from sens howell heflin 
dala daniel p moynihan dny tom harkin diowa and kent 
conrad dnd 
elsewhere minnesota gov rudy perpich met with lawmakers on 
droughtfighting strategy and then headed down independence avenue 
to the agriculture department to try the plan on secretary richard 
e lyng 
it was perpichs second trip to washington in recent weeks last 
time he urged lyng to allow hay cutting and grazing on 
conservation reserve program acreage the secretary balked but a 
few days later relented under heavy pressure from congress 
we have to send a signal that we are going to keep farmers on 
the land over this difficult period perpich said 
his latest proposal would delay the 50 cent dairy pricesupport 
reduction and allow farmers to keep government payments they have 
received in advance even if the effect of the drought would 
otherwise shrink the amount 
it also would provide special benefits for farmers who donate 
hay from conservation reserve program acreage and assure 
incomesupport payments later in the season even if crops are wiped 
out

a national poll shows public support for 
president reagans dealings with the soviet union but disapproval 
of his policies in central america and the mideast 
threequarters of americans surveyed approve of reagans 
handling of soviet relations but only 46 percent like his overall 
foreign policy according to the nonpartisan americans talk 
security poll released wednesday 
sixtytwo percent think he mishandled iran 63 percent disagree 
with his central america policies and 63 percent think he has done 
too little to solve conflicts in the mideast according to the 
survey 
the poll results also reflect heightened concern over 
international trade and drug trafficking for example 63 percent 
of those surveyed said reagan should do more to combat 
international drug dealing 
improved ussoviet relations probably have helped those issues 
come to the fore one pollster said 
reagan has sapped political concern on the issue of 
ussoviet relations said john martilla who conducted the survey 
as part of a bipartisan series martilla also conducts polls for 
michael dukakis the apparent democratic presidential nominee 
another pollster taking part in the series fred steeper said 
reagans success in dealing with moscow has removed from the 
republican bag of tricks the ability to run against the soviets 
steeper also conducts polls for republican presidential candidate 
george bush 
the survey was based on interviews with 1003 voters before the 
moscow summit may 29june 2 and had a margin of error of 31 
percentage points according to martilla and steeper who presented 
it at a news conference 
the survey also showed disagreement with the us policy to use 
nuclear weapons if the conventional armies of the north atlantic 
treaty organization are not able to stop a soviet invasion of 
western europe 
only 8 percent of those surveyed said nuclear weapons should be 
used if the soviets have successfully invaded western europe 
without nuclear weapons 
the poll also showed that the public holds some contradictory 
attitudes about foreign affairs 
for example even though 57 percent of the public agreed that 
its only a matter of time before japan becomes the number one 
economic power in the world 56 percent said the us will 
continue to be the greatest economic power well into the next 
century 
the us gross national product is far larger than that of 
japan although the japanese gnp is slightly higher on a per capita 
basis 
americans thought reagan has done a good job on traditional 
national security issues 75 percent liked him for standing up to 
the soviets 73 percent thought he has kept america out of war 
75 percent liked his arms control policies 71 percent thought he 
had developed a sound national defense 61 percent commended him 
for an appropriate use of military power 59 percent thought he 
had promoted the spread of democracy 58 percent thought he had 
prevented the spread of communism 61 percent liked his policy in 
the persian gulf and 54 percent thought he had won respect for the 
united states 
yet despite these truly impressive ratings only 46 percent 
of the american people approve of the way ronald reagan is 
handling foreign policy while 47 percent disapprove according 
to the survey 
also 48 percent approved and 48 percent did not approve of his 
efforts in fighting terrorism 51 percent thought he had not helped 
make the united states a strong competitor on the international 
market versus 48 percent who thought he had and 29 percent did 
not approve of his handling of relations with panamanian leader

henleyonthames england ap miniskirts may be high fashion 
but if theyre more than two inches above the knee they will keep 
you out of the exclusive enclosure for ticketholders at the henley 
royal regatta 
henley has retained its victorianedwardian style in almost 
every respect including its standards of dress and adherence to 
the rule book a spokesman said wednesday the first day of the 
149th annual rowing event 
stewards or race organizers will not examine all of the 
250000 people who attend the prestigious fourday regatta on the 
thames river a highlight of britains summer social season 
but they will inform women who enter the stewards enclosure 
with inappropriate hem height of their objections the 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
the enclosure with bar and dining facilities is reserved for 
stewards and their guests 
regatta officials said a number of women were turned away 
from the enclosure for wearing short skirts wednesday but did not 
specify how many 
if you go with womens fashion you end up with middleaged 
women displaying thighs they should have kept secret for years 
said peter coni chairman of the regatta committee 
you have got to have strict rules which dont place a burden 
on people at the gates having to make judgments on whether someone 
is sexy or not 
the regattas strict dress code also requires men entering the 
enclosure to wear suits or a jacket and pants and a tie women are 
not permitted to wear short skirts slacks or culottes 
no one is admitted to the enclosure wearing shorts jeans or 
anything made of denim

here are excerpts of the supreme court 
decision upholding the law that allows independent counsels to 
investigate alleged wrongdoing by highranking government 
officials and of the dissent to that ruling 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
chief justice rehnquist delivered the opinion of the court 
this case presents us with a challenge to the independent 
counsel provisions of the ethics in government act of 1978 we 
hold today that these provisions of the act do not violate the 
appointments clause of the constitution nor do they 
impermissibly interfere with the presidents authority under 
article ii in violation of the constitutional principle of 
separation of powers 
we do not mean to say that congress power to provide for 
interbranch appointments of inferior officers is unlimited 
in this case however we do not think it impermissible for 
congress to vest the power to appoint independent counsels in a 
specially created federal court we thus disagree with the court of 
appeals conclusion that there is an inherent incongruity about a 
court having the power to appoint prosecutorial officers 
congress of course was concerned when it created the office of 
independent counsel with the conflicts of interest that could arise 
in situations when the executive branch is called upon to 
investigate its own highranking officers if it were to remove the 
appointing authority from the executive branch the most logical 
place to put it was in the judicial branch in the light of the 
acts provision making the judges of the special division 
ineligible to participate in any matters relating to an independent 
counsel they have appointed we do not think that appointment of 
the independent counsels by the court runs afoul of the 
constitutional limitation on incongruous interbranch 
appointments 
most importantly the act vests in the special division the 
power to choose who will serve as independent counsel and the power 
to define his or her jurisdiction clearly once it is accepted 
that the appointments clause gives congress the power to vest the 
appointment of officials such as the independent counsel in the 
courts of law there can be no article iii objection to the 
special divisions exercise of that power as the power itself 
derives from the appointments clause a source of authority for 
judicial action that is independent of article iii appellees 
contend however that the divisions appointments clause powers do 
not encompass the power to define the independent counsels 
jurisdiction we disagree in our view congress power under the 
clause to vest the appointment of inferior officers in the 
courts may in certain circumstances allow congress to give the 
courts some discretion in defining the nature and scope of the 
appointed officials authority 
we think that the court of appeals overstated the matter when it 
described the power to terminate as a broadsword and rapier 
that enables the court to control the pace and depth of the 
independent counsels activities the provision has not been 
tested in practice and we do not mean to say that an adventurous 
special court could not reasonably construe the provision as did 
the court of appeals but it is the duty of federal courts to 
construe a statute in order to save it from constitutional 
infirmities and to that end we think a narrow construction is 
appropriate here the termination provisions of the act do not give 
the special division anything approaching the power to remove the 
counsel while an investigation or court proceeding is still under 
way this power is vested solely in the attorney general it 
is basically a device for removing from the public payroll an 
independent counsel who has served her purpose but is unwilling to 
acknowledge the fact 
we now turn to consider whether the act is valid under the 
constitutional principle of separation of powers two related 
issues must be addressed the first is whether the provision of the 
act restricting the attorney generals power to remove the 
independent counsel to only those instances in which he can show 
good cause taken by itself impermissibly interferes with the 
presidents exercise of his constitutionally appointed functions 
the second is whether taken as a whole the act violates the 
separation of powers by reducing the presidents ability to control 
the prosecutorial powers wielded by the independent counsel 
considering for the moment the good cause removal provision 
in isolation from the other parts of the act at issue in this case 
we cannot say that the imposition of a good cause standard for 
removal by itself unduly trammels on executive authority there is 
no real dispute that the functions performed by the independent 
counsel are executive in the sense that they are law 
enforcement functions that typically have been undertaken by 
officials within the executive branch as we noted above however 
the independent counsel is an inferior officer under the 
appointments clause with limited jurisdiction and tenure and 
lacking policymaking or significant administrative authority 
although the counsel exercises no small amount of discretion and 
judgment in deciding how to carry out her duties under the act we 
simply do not see how the presidents need to control the exercise 
of that discretion is so central to the functioning of the 
executive branch as to require as a matter of constitutional law 
that the counsel be terminable at will by the president 
nor do we think that the good cause removal provision at 
issue here impermissibly burdens the presidents power to control 
or supervise the independent counsel as an executive official in 
the execution of her duties under the act this is not a case in 
which the power to remove an executive official has been completely 
stripped from the president thus providing no means for the 
president to ensure the faithful execution of the laws 
the final question to be addressed is whether the act taken as 
a whole violates the principle of separation of powers by unduly 
interfering with the role of the executive branch

we observe first that this case does not involve an attempt by 
congress to increase its own powers at the expense of the executive 
branch unlike some of our previous cases most recently bowsher v 
synar this case simply does not pose a danger of congressional 
usurpation of executive branch functions indeed with the 
exception of the power of impeachment which applies to all 
officers of the united states congress retained for itself no 
powers of control or supervision over an independent counsel 
similarly we do not think that the act works any judicial 
usurpation of properly executive functions 
finally we do not think that the act impermisssibly 
undermines the powers of the executive branch or disrupts the 
proper balance between the coordinate branches by preventing 
the executive branch from accomplishing its constitutionally 
assigned functions 
the attorney general is not allowed to appoint the individual of 
his choice he does not determine the counsels jurisdiction and 
his power to remove a counsel is limited nonetheless the act does 
give the attorney general several means of supervising or 
controlling the prosecutorial powers that may be wielded by an 
independent counsel most importantly the attorney general retains 
the power to remove the counsel of good cause a power that we 
have already concluded provides the executive with substantial 
ability to ensure that the laws are faithfuly executed by 
independent counsel 
in sum we conclude today that it does not violate the 
appointments clause for congress to vest the appointment of 
independent counsels in the special division that the powers 
exercised by the special division under the act do not violate 
article iii and tht the act does not violate the separation of 
powers principle by impermissibly interfering with the functions of 
the executive branch the decision of the court of appeals is 
therefore reversed

dissent by judge antonin scalia 
the framers of the federal constitution viewed the principle 
of separation of powers as the absolutely central guarantee of a 
just government without a secure structure of separated 
powers our bill of rights would be worthless as the bills of 
rights of many nations of the world that have adopted or even 
improved upon the mere words of ours 
that is what this suit is about power the allocation of power 
among congress the president and the courts in such fashion as to 
preserve the equilibrium the constitution sought to establish so 
that a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same 
department can effectively be resisted frequently an issue of this 
sort will come before the court clad so to speak in sheeps 
clothing the potential of the asserted principle to effect 
important change in the equilibrium of power is not immediately 
evident and must be discerned by a careful and perceptive 
analysis but this wolf comes as a wolf 
the context of this statute is acrid with the smell of 
threatened impeachment where as here a request for appointment 
of an independent counsel has come from the judiciary committee of 
either house of congress the attorney general must if he decides 
not to seek appointment explain to that committee why 
thus by the application of this statute in the present case 
congress has effectively compelled a criminal investigation of a 
highlevel appointee of the president in connection with his 
actions arising out of a bitter power dispute between the president 
and the legislative branch 
the court devotes most of its attention to such relatively 
technical details as the appointments clause and the removal power 
addressing briefly and only at the end of its opinion the 
separation of powers as my prologue suggests i think that has it 
backwards 
in sum this statute does deprive the president of substantial 
control over the prosecutory functions performed by the independent 
counsel and it does substantially affect the balance of powers 
that the court could possibly conclude otherwise demonstrates both 
the wisdom of our former constitutional system in which the degree 
of reduced control and political impairment were irrelevant since 
all purely executive power had to be in the president and the 
folly of the new system of standardless judicial allocation of 
powers we adopt today 
the notion that every violation of law should be prosecuted 
including indeed especially every violation by those in high 
places is an attracive one and it would be risky to argue in an 
election campaign that that is not an absolutely overriding value 
fiat justitia ruat coelum let justice be done though the heavens 
may fall by its shortsighted action today i fear the court 
has permanently encumbered the republic with an institution that 
will do it great harm 
worse than what it has done however is the manner in which it 
has done it a government of laws means a government of rules 
todays decision on the basic issue of fragmentation of executive 
powers is ungoverned by rule and hence ungoverned by law

jim bakker presented a 100 million offer 
for the failing ptl ministry during a bankruptcy court session in 
which his wife tammy sobbed when the judge ordered the sale of 
the bakkers former parsonage 
ptl trustee mc benton who said he has received four offers 
one for 200 million to buy the ministry promised that the former 
television evangelists proposal will be considered along with 
everyone else if he can back it up 
we are ready to go forward with earnest negotiations bakker 
told reporters tuesday outside us bankruptcy court but he 
refused to identify who provided him with the 100 million line of 
credit to buy ptl 
the appearance of the bakkers sensationalized an otherwise 
routine 2hour bankruptcy hearing they received a standing 
ovation when they entered the courtroom tammy wearing a linen 
dress studded with pearls and bakker with a crisp doublebreasted 
gray suit 
look how pretty she looks whispered bee huffman who said 
she supports the return of the bakkers to ptl 
judge rufus reynolds gave initial approval to ptls 
reorganization plan which calls for sale of the 2300acre 
heritage usa religious theme park in fort mill he ordered the plan 
sent to creditors for a vote next month 
mrs bakker broke into tears and sobbed for several minutes 
after reynolds initially agreed to sell the ptl parsonage where the 
bakkers lived while running the ministry 
reynolds later rescinded the order and said ptl could auction 
the mansion to one of two proposed bidders neither of them 
connected to the bakkers on tuesday 
bakker with the letter of credit in his uplifted hand said he 
was committed to the restoration of ptl as a christian retreat 
center to pay all creditors 100 percent on the dollar to restore 
all lifetime partner benefits everything restored and all the 
people back happy and caring and ministering one to another 
benton said he hopes to decide which proposed buyer to present 
to the court by midaugust informed of the 200 million offer from 
a group benton would not identify bakker told reporters he doubted 
its legitimacy 
so far all we see is smoke he said adding that his lender 
was prepared to go higher than his 100 million offer 
asked why he was not willing to provide more details of his 
financial backing bakkers attorney james toms interjected 
thats all were prepared to say at this time 
the reorganization plan outlines the sale of heritage usa to pay 
creditors and the formation of a debtfree nonprofit ministry 
the plan would give lifetime partners major contributors who 
were promised free lodging and other benefits for every 1000 
donation the option of relinquishing their claims if they did 
they would become voting members of the new heritage ministries inc 
reynolds ordered ballots sent to creditors july 15 and set an 
aug 24 deadline to confirm or reject the plan ptl with debts of 
up to 130 million and assets of 160 million filed for bankruptcy 
reorganization in june 1987 
reynolds also granted ptl permission to use 800000 of the 
proceeds from property sales normally frozen by the court during 
bankruptcy proceedings to cover a shortfall at the ministry 
benton said contributions to the ministry hit an alltime low 
this month we are at the end of the rope in cutting operational 
activities he told reynolds we are hanging by a thread 
in charlotte nc meanwhile the federal grand jury 
investigating possible mail wire and tax fraud by bakker and 
former associates has been given six more months to complete its 
probe into how the ministry raised and spent millions of dollars 
prosecutors are trying to find out whether bakker and his aides 
raised money for one purpose and used it for another 
bakker who moved back to the fort mill area earlier this month 
resigned in march 1987 from the ministry he built after admitting 
that he had a sexual encounter with jessica hahn and that cash 
payments were made to silence her

a year after one of the worst summer fire seasons 
this century for the nations forests government and timber 
industry officials are worried the drought may be bringing even 
more devastating conditions 
in some parts the conditions we are experiencing now are very 
similar to what we would expect to be experiencing in august at 
the height of the fire season said paul weeden a us forest 
service emergency operations specialist in washington dc 
although there are pockets of wetness in some forests 
weeden said wednesday most of the nation has a high fire danger 
with some areas facing very high or extreme risks many areas are 
in their second year or more of drought he said with the 
hardesthit areas in the pacific northwest california and parts of 
the southeast particularly north carolina 
the dry weather also wilts tree seedlings slows growth and 
makes trees more susceptible to insects especially bark beetles 
weeden said 
if dry conditions continue for another month an estimated 57 
billion board feet of timber could be lost to the quarterinch 
beetles which eat the cambium between the trees bark and wood he 
said 
thats a pretty significant number because the average annual 
allowable cut for the forest service is about 11 billion board 
feet he said 
weyerhaeuser co expects to lose 15 percent of its 38 million 
seedlings in the south because of the drought said john mcmahon 
vice president of timberlands last year mcmahon told the wall 
street journal in an article published wednesday weyerhaeuser had 
to replant 4 percent of its seedlings nationwide 
fire is the most immediate threat to the nations dry forests 
last year fires burned almost 5 million acres of government and 
private timber worth 12 billion weeden said it was the worst 
fire year for federal lands since 1919 
one of the largest fires so far this year burned 58300 acres of 
parched timber and grasslands in and near the custer national 
forest along the montanasouth dakota border firefighters brought 
it under control wednesday 
in wyoming erratic winds hindered 389 firefighters trying to 
control a 1150acre fire that was sparked by lightning and 
threatened critical grizzly bear and bald eagle habitat in the 
shoshone national forest 
and southern california firefighters battled two riverside 
county brush fires that charred 1125 acres authorities hoped to 
encircle the largest blaze 1000 acres by tonight 
nearly 800000 acres of california timberland were lost to fire 
last year and officials are edgy even though the states forests 
got some rain recently were still in extreme danger said 
roberta andersen vice president of the timber association of 
california in sacramento 
the fire season started real early said brian barrette 
staff chief for the california department of forestry and fire 
protection it was running at least six weeks ahead of normal 
temperatures cooled in may but not enough to affect the 
driedout trees in many california forests barrette said with a 
30 to 60day outlook for abovenormal temperatures its a 
pretty good indication that well have some real problems he 
said 
in the northwest the cascade mountains divide the fire danger 
on the wetter west side conditions are about normal but to the 
east forests are facing a fourth consecutive dry year 
there was no significant rain this spring the little bit of 
rain we did get gave us good growths of grasses and brush that are 
beginning to dry out said marty ames spokeswoman for the 
wenatchee national forest in central washington it doesnt look 
like the weather is going to bring any relief

a prestigious journal announced today it will 
launch an independent investigation of a series of experimental 
findings that have been confirmed around the world yet defy any 
conceivable scientific explanation 
researchers at five separate laboratories in france canada 
israel and italy reported today they have identified a curious 
antibody reaction involving human blood cells that should by any 
imaginable theory be impossible 
its unbelievable and it breaks all the rules said one of 
the researchers patricia fortner an immunology research associate 
at the university of toronto 
the researchers have found that antibodies that react with 
certain blood cells will continue to react when diluted far beyond 
the point where they should theoretically be able to 
the reaction occurs even at extreme dilutions where there are 
theoretically no antibody molecules left in the solution said 
fortner 
weve all assumed that where there are no molecules present 
nothing will happen fortner said in an interview wednesday but 
something does 
this has really shaken up our world she said even people 
who have seen this phenomenon find it hard to believe because its 
hard to conceive what could be happening here 
the report appears in nature an influential british medical 
journal 
natures editors were as perplexed by the research as were the 
researchers its referees scientific experts chosen to affirm the 
soundness of research before it is published didnt believe the 
result but couldnt find anything wrong with the conduct of the 
experiments the magazine said 
readers of this article may share the incredulity of the many 
referees who have commented on several versions of it during the 
past several months nature said in an unusual comment entitled 
editorial reservation 
the scientist principally responsible for the inexplicable 
results is dr jacques benveniste of inserm the french medical 
research institute 
the findings are an outgrowth of his efforts to develop a new 
blood test to identify allergies 
fortner bruce pomeranz and others at the university of toronto 
have independently duplicated benvenistes findings as have two 
research groups in israel and one in milan fortner said 
benveniste was not in his laboratory wednesday afternoon and could 
not be reached for comment 
in its statement nature said of the findings there is no 
physical basis for such an activity with the kind collaboration of 
professor benveniste nature has therefore arranged for independent 
investigators to observe repetitions of the experiments 
the magazine said a report of the investigation would appear 
shortly 
other findings by benveniste have added further mystery for 
example the phenomenon occurs only when the extremely diluted 
solutions are mixed violently in the laboratory said fortner 
without this violent shaking called succussion nothing happens 
why unknown fortner said 
furthermore if the extremely diluted solutions are heated or 
frozen which would destroy any antibodies in them the reaction 
doesnt occur fortner said 
yet there arent supposed to be any antibodies present so the 
question is what is being changed 
researchers have tried the experiment with chemical agents that 
react with the blood cells they too exert their effect at 
extreme dilutions far beyond anything that should be possible 
benvenistes findings fuel a longstanding dispute over the 
effectiveness of a controversial school of disease treatment called 
homeopathy 
homeopathy basically says that the same substance that can 
cause a problem if you can identify that element and dilute it 
into very small doses infinitesimal doses it can cure or 
ameliorate those symptoms said robert matsuk a pharmacist at 
boironborneman a homeopathic pharmaceutical company in norwood 
pa 
benvenistes findings if correct lend support to the claims of 
homeopathy 
homeopathic practitioners dont claim to understand precisely 
how their treatments work matsuk said 
conventional medical wisdom says that there is no scientific 
evidence to support the claims of homeopaths fortner said 
among benvenistes collaborators were elisabeth davenas an 
adherent of homeopathy and bernard poitevin a homeopathic 
physician fortner said 
she said that the researchers speculate that perhaps the water 
molecules in the dilute solutions somehow are altered during the 
process of successive dilutions to produce the observed reaction 
we have a few theoretical physicists working with us she 
said and there are a lot of theories but nothing concrete

vladimir p kabaidze is no eddie murphy but the 
balding factory manager had them chuckling in the kremlin 
kabaidze a delegate from the city of ivanovo provided 15 
minutes of comic relief wednesday during his speech to the the 
countrys first communist party conference in 47 years 
his oneliners even pierced the stoic armor of president andrei 
gromyko who cracked a grim grin 
under kabaidzes earthy language and punchy delivery lurked a 
serious critique of soviet problems including the unwieldy 
bureaucracy and inefficient economy about which soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev so often complains 
at one point in his speech kabaidze waved a fist and said a 
factory that has been under construction at ivanovo for eight years 
could have been built in nine months by a south korean construction 
company 
im afraid when im being carried out feet first theyll 
still be building that factory kabaidze said 
in complaining of red tape the delegate said its hopeless 
to fight paper we must kill the authors 
thats when the smile lit gromykos dour visage the 5000 
delegates from across the vast country laughed and applauded 
soviet television broadcast kabaidzes remarks at least twice 
once during an afternoon newsbreak and again on the evening news 
program vremya the conference is closed to foreign journalists 
kabaidze a balding man of late middle years wore a gray suit 
adorned with medals in the fashion popular among soviet officials 
he runs a machinetool factory in ivanovo a city of 500000 about 
150 miles northeast of moscow 
speaking from the podium of the kremlins palace of congresses 
with gorbachev gromyko and the other leaders on the dais behind 
him kabaidze regaled the hall with his standup routine 
no country has as many ministers as we do but business 
stinks he said at one point 
if a minister catches a mouse then we will feed him if he 
doesnt we wont he said at another

the united nations and the plo hailed a 
federal court decision that blocks a congressional attempt to ban 
the plos un mission from the united states 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said wednesday he was 
gratified by this judgment which demonstrates the respect of the 
us courts for the international obligations of the country 
zehdi labib terzi the palestine liberation organizations 
ambassador to the un called the ruling a victory for 
international law 
the united nations now has no fear that the host country or 
any host country can violate its legal obligations and get out 
scotfree he said 
us district judge edmund palmieri ruled that the 1947 
agreement that brought the united nations to the united states 
prohibits the government from closing the palestine liberation 
organizations observer mission 
he also said the antiterrorism act passed by congress does not 
supersede us obligations under the 1947 headquarters agreement 
palmieri said the language of the antiterrorism act which 
branded the plo a terrorist group does not indicate congress meant 
to abandon americas obligations to the un 
the us mission to the united nations said it would have no 
comment on the ruling 
judge palmieri dismissed the governments suit with prejudice 
meaning it cant be brought again it can be appealed to a higher 
court 
us attorney rudolph giuliani who argued the governments case 
before palmieri earlier this month said the decision was being 
studied and we will make a decision as to further proceedings as 
soon as possible 
state department spokesman dennis harter in washington said his 
department also was reading the decision and consulting with the 
justice department the state department had opposed the attempt to 
close the plo mission 
the justice department filed suit in march seeking to close the 
plo mission citing the antiterrorism act passed by congress and 
reluctantly signed by president reagan last year 
the law which took effect march 21 labeled the plo and its 
affiliates a terrorist organization and a threat to interests of 
the united states 
the law barred the plo from operating its un mission or any 
other office in the united states and also barred the plo from 
funding any activities in this country to further its aims 
dr clovis maksoud the arab leagues permanent observer to the 
united nations said his organization considered the ruling a 
victory for the united states over the recklessness of the israeli 
lobby and their unquestioning supporters 
we welcome this decision and believe that this will facilitate 
the work of the un general assembly he said it shows 
judicial respect for united states treaty obligations and the 
healthy independence of the judiciary

five spanish adventurers boarded an 
anciently styled reed boat and pushed off for new zealand in a 
voyage aimed at showing how precolumbian peruvians could have 
crossed the pacific 
famed norwegian explorer thor heyerdahl whose theories and 
expeditions sparked the adventure bid farewell to the sailors 
wednesday as they departed limas port callao 
the uru is built correctly the 73yearold anthroplogist 
said during an inspection of the 70foot ship made from reeds he 
said it is crafted along the lines of precolumbian boat builders 
the spaniards headed by 29yearold kitin munoz plan to follow 
a course charted by heyerdahl who sailed the primitive balsa raft 
kon tiki from peru to polynesia in 1947 
heyerdahl and five others made the voyage which he wrote about 
in the book kon tiki to support his thesis that the first 
settlers of polynesia were of south american descent in 1970 he 
sailed a papyrus boat from morocco to barbados in an attempt to 
prove that the ancient inhabitants of the mediterranean region 
could have sailed to america 
paulino esteban a lake titicaca indian who built the uru and 
other reed boats used by heyerdahl also met with the spanish crew 
and heyerdahl aboard the 12ton craft 
esteban said the uru is a huge version of the reed boats that 
indians on titicaca the worlds highest navigable lake at 12700 
feet have used for centuries and still use today the lake is 600 
miles southeast of lima 
the uru named after an ancient titicaca tribe has no motor and 
depends on its two sails for propulsion a compass and a radio for 
emergencies are the only modern tools aboard the roughhewn craft 
although reed boats rot after about a year in fresh water munoz 
said the uru would remain buoyant during the fivemonth voyage to 
new zealand 7200 miles southwest of lima 
the expedition plans stops on several south pacific islands 
including raroia where heyerdahl concluded his kon tiki cruise 
this is not sport munoz said we are contributing to 
scientific study the proof of primitive navigation

a national institutes of health panel 
concerned about the spread of aids through donated blood is 
recommending that doctors keep blood transfusions to a minimum 
the panel of experts says doctors should also reevaluate 
traditional uses of blood in surgery in light of aids and improved 
surgical techniques 
the chances of contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
from donated blood is still considered miniscule said tibor 
greenwalt a university of cincinnati researcher and chairman of 
the nih committee but he warned wednesday that blood transfusions 
do carry documented risks of infection and immune changes 
he and other committee members issued a report that said 
blood transfusions were once believed to be relatively safe but 
more recently many physicians and patients have come to regard them 
as potentially dangerous

born 66 years ago of the womens suffrage 
movement the womans national democratic club has made men equal 
members of the organization 
the club voted wednesday to grant its male members the right to 
vote in what outgoing club president jean r jensen called an 
ironic turn for an organization founded to give women a say in what 
once was the male world of politics 
perhaps it is a measure of our success that womens clubs are 
being asked to include men she said 
the organization has nearly 2000 members of whom 85 are men 
as associate members the men could participate in all ways except 
that they could not head committees become officers or vote 
the clubs decision to grant men full membership status comes on 
the heels of votes by washingtons exclusive metropolitan and 
cosmos clubs to end their menonly policies

mothers are more likely to buckle up than 
fathers and a new survey says the behavior of parents can have a 
strong influence on whether their children use seat belts 
the survey of 1118 children released wednesday showed 58 
percent said they wear seat belts all or most of the time while 57 
percent said their mothers regularly wear seat belts and only 38 
percent said their fathers buckle up 
the children were interviewed by louis harris and associates for 
the american coalition of traffic safety which was set up by the 
us auto industry in 1986 to support safety belt use 
results of the survey which has a margin of error or 3 
percentage points were released at a news conference that included 
37 children who survived accidents because of seat belts 
susan akin miss america for 1986 accompanied the children and 
recounted that a seat belt saved her life in a 1987 mississippi 
crash involving her car and an 18wheel truck

nostradamus disaster warning date has 
passed but now californians are all shaken up about a series of 
earthquakes and an ominous official warning of worse jolts ahead 
a lot of people are spooked says paul preston who runs an 
earthquake preparedness business in marin county 
northern california residents began buying up survival supplies 
and swamping quake experts with phone calls after the state issued 
a rare official warning about an increased chance for a severe 
earthquake this week south of san jose where a quake rocked the 
region monday 
the temblor estimated as high as 57 on the richter scale of 
ground motion shifted tectonic plates along the san andreas fault 
and has been followed by a surprising lack of aftershocks 
seismologist robert uhrhammer said wednesday 
uhrhammer of the university of california seismographic 
stations at berkeley said the area in the santa cruz mountains is 
40 times more likely than normal to be hit by another temblor of at 
least the same magnitude by sunday because the quake put additional 
stress on the san andreas 
the american red cross on wednesday put its northern california 
chapters on alert through tuesday the action came a day after the 
state office of emergency services suggested that santa clara 
santa cruz monterey and san benito counties notify local officials 
of the increased earthquake risk 
we certainly dont want to panic people but if there is an 
increased chance even a little one we have to let people 
know said tom mullins an agency spokesman in sacramento 
if we had this information and didnt go out with it and a 
quake occurred and someone was injured or even worse i think we 
would bear responsibility he said and from what ive heard 
people are not panicking 
some californians had been on edge over predictions by 16th 
century astrologer nostradamus that a disaster would destroy the 
new city during a planetary alignment in may 1988 
many interpreted this as meaning los angeles would be leveled by 
an earthquake and thousands of worried residents called 
planetariums stocked up on supplies and planned outofstate 
summer vacations 
in addition about 1000 or more cambodian refugees fled town 
apparently heeding dire predictions from astrologers and 
selfproclaimed psychics but there was no planetary alignment and 
no major temblor 
this weeks official advisory was only the fourth such warning 
ever made 
we dont want to send people running and screaming into the 
streets because the increased likelihood is low said rick 
lester a us geological survey geologist but it is a 
responsible step to take to alert people 
all the earthquake talk has boosted business at a san jose 
hardware store where custoers have been buying batteries like 
you wouldnt believe assistant manager woody smith said bottled 
water sales also have been brisk 
the months since last octobers big earthquake in the southern 
california community of whittier have been the busiest time ever 
for prestons company earthquake preparedness consultants 
the company is one of several in the area that conduct home 
inspections and give advice on how to reduce potential earthquake 
damage it also sells a device that automatically shuts off natural 
gas pipes in the event of seismic activity 
i have had a lot of calls in the last couple of days but it 
really started with whittier and continued this year with the 
nostradamus prediction and the other quakes preston said 
most people hadnt given it any thought now almost everybody 
in southern california has felt a good jolt and people in northern 
california are getting worried too

the vietnamese said they 
withdrew their top military command from cambodia today turning a 
nineyearold guerrilla war over to cambodian officers 
for the first time vietnamese officials also disclosed their 
casualties in the war they said 55000 vietnamese soldiers have 
been killed since 1977 when vietnam began clashing with the khmer 
rouge regime which then ruled cambodia 
vietnam invaded cambodia the next year replacing the 
probeijing khmer rouge with a prohanoi government 
the top vietnamese commander in cambodia gen le ngoc hien and 
about 300 other top officers and their staffs returned to ho chi 
minh city from cambodias capital of phnom penh aboard sovietmade 
military helicopters and airplanes 
they are among 50000 vietnamese troops hanoi says it will bring 
home by the end of the year in the largest of seven annual pullouts 
from cambodia antivietnamese guerrilla groups claim the 
withdrawals are nothing but troop rotations 
vietnamese officials said the latest move completes the transfer 
of the military command to the phnom penh government 
we think the cambodian armed forces can shoulder their 
responsibility themselves lt gen le kha phieu deputy 
commander of vietnamese forces in cambodia told a news conference 
in ho chi minh city 
about 100000 vietnamese soldiers are helping the cambodian 
government fight a threeparty guerrilla group backed by many 
western nations and china 
phieu said about 13000 vietnamese soldiers have already 
returned home this year hanoi says 50000 are being withdrawn this 
year and the remaining 50000 will come home by 1990 
he also disclosed vietnamese casualties in the war saying 
30000 vietnamese died in border clashes in 197778 with the khmer 
rouge who killed more than a million cambodians during their 
bloody rule from 1975 to 1978 
another 25000 vietnamese troops have died in cambodia since the 
1978 invasion phieu said 
vietnamese forces in cambodia have been taking fewer casualties 
in recent years indicating that the guerrilla forces were becoming 
weaker phieu said he said that this year and last only 500 
vietnamese soldiers were killed in cambodia and another 2500 were 
wounded 
the ultraradical khmer rouge remain a force in cambodia but 
are in decline because they receive no support from the kampuchean 
cambodian people phieu said 
thousands of vietnamese crowded into the international airport 
of ho chi minh city formerly saigon to greet the returning 
officers and advisers they arrived after a sendoff in phnom penh 
by thousands of cambodians waving vietnamese and cambodian flags 
and saffronrobed monks offering blessings for a safe journey home 
cambodian defense minister koy buntha pledged to strengthen his 
forces to replace the vietnamese whom he thanked at an airport 
ceremony for your blood and sacrifice 
united nations special envoy rafee uddin ahmed was to arrive in 
phnom penh later today for talks with cambodian prime minister hun 
sen on settling the cambodian issue it would be the first time for 
a un envoy to hold formal talks on the issue with the cambodian 
government which the united nations does not recognize 
instead the un recognizes the tripartite coalition made up of 
the communist khmer rouge noncommunist khmer peoples national 
liberation front and forces loyal to prince norodum sihanouk 
in bangkok thailand meanwhile a us official appeared on a 
television broadcast and said the united states will not accept the 
return to power of the khmer rouge 
gaston sigur us assistant secretary of state for east asia 
and pacific affairs said today that the united states supports 
efforts by sihanouk to resolve the cambodian conflict 
the telecast from washington was organized by the united states 
information agency as a preview to a july visit to asia by 
secretary of state george p shultz

jesse jackson says he plans to leave the 
campaign trail for most of the next week to resume personal efforts 
to free us hostages held in lebanon and map out his strategy for 
the democratic national convention 
jackson said wednesday he will also use the time to deliberate 
in great detail with his family about whether to seek the vice 
presidential nomination 
there are no meetings scheduled between jackson and certain 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis but jackson said 
the attitude of those closest to him might be the most important 
factor in his own decision to seek the vice presidential nomination 
dukakis was meeting in washington this week with congressional 
leaders considered potential running mates 
unlike other persons who are under consideration i have taken 
every test that dukakis has taken said jackson 
jackson declined to provide many specifics on his efforts to 
free us hostages but said he plans to make several audio and 
videotapes for distribution in the middle east over the next few 
days appealing to the hostages captors for their safe release 
he said he has kept in contact with unnamed people in the middle 
east and instincts and certain conversations convinced him the 
timing was right to again seek the hostages release 
we must not give the impression that we have given up on the 
americans who are there jackson said and we need to exhaust 
all efforts to get them out 
he said he was prepared to make another personal trip to the 
region if necessary but added weve got no timetable 
jackson also announced the filing in washington of a political 
action committee keep hope alive to advance the themes of 
fairness and economic justice that were the centerpieces of his own 
presidential campaign 
there are some targeted areas in congressional campaigns and 
state legislative campaigns where we can help elect officials who 
believe the future of this party is in integrated slatemaking

said wednesday that president daniel ortega due back from cuba 
today might prolong the truce 
he also said defense minister humberto ortega the presidents 
brother would meet with his commanders today then announce the

contras have made proposals and counterproposals since talks broke 
down june 9 but they have been unable to agree on how to resume

than the one in march that preceded the first round of peace talks 
sandinista troops reportedly were positioning artillery at 
strategic sites in the provinces of boaco chontales rio san juan 
and zelaya sur 
meanwhile nicaraguas bishops urged the government and rebels 
to resume peace talks and not to give in to hate or the desire 
for vengance

their hearts have resounded with the heartbreaking clamor that is 
rising from the countryside and in the cities of nicaragua for 
an end to war and to the violent deaths of the young the peasants 
the indians

wellbeing of the people and said many people now feel defrauded 
by their leaders by corruption and by the bureaucracy

system that imposes the ideology of a few the recent 
legalization of divorce and the promotion of abortion 
they said the economy has deteriorated so badly that familiies 
feel the effects of hunger while the government pours money 
into defense spending

contaminated water that would poison their wells when they clashed 
with thousands of armed police on june 21 villagers said 
villagers told western reporters earlier in the week that three 
people died but were unable today to confirm the deaths 
about 150 people including some high school students were 
arrested during the protest most were released later the same day 
or the following day but at least 10 remain in custody their

despite a slight fall the dollar held its ground 
against the japanese yen today and share prices on the tokyo stock 
exchange added to its previous days gain 
after opening at 13290 yen up from wednesdays close of 13240 
yen the dollar crawled up further to peak at 13300 yen before it 
dropping to finish the day at 13220 yen down 020 yen from the 
previous day 
the dollar fell because market participants are closing their 
positions prior to the fourth of july holiday in the united 
states said a dealer a major local securities firm speaking on 
condition of anonymity us markets will be closed monday for 
independence day 
those who were buying the currency at the 133yen level at the 
start of trading moved down to 132 yen because of the upcoming 
holiday he added 
king ogino a dealer at goldman sachs said local city banks at 
one point tried to push the dollar above the 133yen level but had 
to fall back after meeting market resistance 
but buying pressure is still intact and the dollar will soon 
consolidate its position ogino said he added however that 
people are cautious 
the securities dealer said the dollar will be bought up in the 
upcoming week adding that there is a rumor of it reaching even 
the 135yen level 
he said however that the movement depended on the nations 
central bank which since last week refrained from intervening in 
the market to stem the dollars rise 
this lack of intervention has been primarily responsible for the 
dollars appreciation against the yen monetary authorities have 
ruled out stepping into the market and finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa earlier this week said the market changes were ordinary 
fluctuations 
in september 1985 the dollar was trading as high as 242 yen 
when the seven major industrialized nations agreed to push the 
currency down to help reduce the massive us trade deficit a 
lower dollar theoretically makes us goods cheaper and more 
competitive abroad 
meanwhile on the tokyo stock exchange the main market 
barometer added another 16207 points or 058 percent to close at 
2776940 points the index had gained 20924 points or 076 
percent on wednesday 
traders said the rise in the nikkei index was led mainly by 
heavy electricals and automakers 
volume on the first section was estimated at a heavy 25 billion 
shares unchanged from wednesday

the government proposed a relaxation of its 
stringent secrecy laws by decriminalizing trivial leaks giving 
journalists more legal protection and confining secrecy to defense 
intelligence and foreign affairs 
plans by prime minister margaret thatchers government to 
liberalize the laws were welcomed by conservative newspapers today 
but leftleaning papers said they would do little to help democracy 
the proposals outlined in a government policy document were 
presented to parliament wednesday they would reinforce the 
lifetime gag on intelligence agents and make them automatically 
liable for criminal prosecution for any disclosure 
the independent times of london said in an editorial that home 
secretary douglas hurd the cabinet member responsible for law and 
order deserves to win a wide measure of praise for the reform of 
the official secrets act which he proposed yesterday 
but the liberal newspaper the guardian which has repeatedly 
accused mrs thatchers conservative government of being obsessed 
with secrecy said the proposed changes portended nothing good 
for the press and democracy 
another critic of government secrecy the independent wrote 
mr hurd has produced ideas which are more liberal than had been 
anticipated but they are so circumscribed by exemptions and 
special designations that the bills effect is still likely to be 
unacceptably restrictive 
the labor party denounced the plans as draconian and 
unacceptable 
hurd told the house of commons on wednesday when he presented 
the proposal that the government aimed to clip the wings of any 
possible abuse of the criminal law by the executive 
he called it the most radical plan yet to reform the official 
secrets act which makes it a criminal offense to reveal any 
official information however trivial without formal authorization 
the act passed hastily during a 1911 german spy scare has 
helped give britain a reputation as the most secretive of the 
western democracies 
the new proposals restricted secrecy to six categories 
defense security and intelligence international relations 
information obtained in confidence from other governments 
information useful to criminals and information about bugging 
mail and phonetapping 
but officials would face internal disciplinary measures for 
disclosing confidential material such as cabinet documents and the 
proposal made no provision for a usstyle freedom of information 
act 
the proposals also stipulated that people charged under the 
official secrets act cannot plead in their defense that the leak 
was in the public interest or that the material had been already 
published elsewhere 
the daily telegraph which supports the conservatives wrote 
there will be some unease about the rejection of the 
defense of public interest 
but it generally welcomed the proposal 
des wilson chairman of the campaign for freedom of information 
pressure group said the proposed law would give no greater 
access to information 
it simply narrows the number of categories in which disclosure 
is a criminal offense he said 
the proposals followed a series of secrecyrelated 
controversies these included a 1986 police raid on british 
broadcasting corp studios to seize tapes of a documentary about a 
spy satellite and the governments losing twoyear court battle to 
ban publication of spycatcher the memoirs of retired 
intelligence officer peter wright 
under the new proposals wright who now lives in australia 
could be charged if he returned to britain

chinas official news agency today said the 
soviet union faces major hurdles in its attempt to revamp its 
economic and political systems 
the soviet communist party conference taking place in moscow 
is entrusted with the formidable task of seeking ways to deepen 
reforms xinhua news agency said in a signed commentary from 
moscow 
but big hurdles have to be overcome before the process can 
become irreversible 
the commentary did not mention the many obstacles china has 
faced since pioneering marketoriented economic reforms in 1979 and 
more recently tackling political restructuring 
but it spoke from experience in cautioning that the soviet road 
to reform will not be easy 
it noted that practices are lagging behind theory in the 
soviet union and quoted valentin falin head of the novosti press 
agency as saying old practices must be done away with for economic 
and social reforms to succeed 
xinhua said soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is calling for 
solutions to chronic food shortages and that wellstocked markets 
will help strengthen the hand of the soviet leader in convincing 
people of the correctness of reforms 
xinhua also noted that gorbachev had stressed political reform 
particularly the clear separation of party and government functions 
and an enhanced role for legislative assemblies china too is now 
striving to end communist party interference in government and 
economic affairs and make its legislatures more democratic 
the report said many at the conference agreed that 
selfcriticism of mistakes will prove more important than 
legislation because laws may be violated or annulled by rulers if 
no one stands up to raise an objection 
the commentary concluded people here now are wondering how 
far the conference will go in its efforts to make reforms 
irreversible one thing is almost certain the task requires more 
time and unremitting endeavor 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing asked about the 
conference at a weekly briefing today said the holding of such 
a conference by the soviet communist party under the current 
circumstances has naturally drawn peoples attention and we are 
also following the developments of the conference 
we have noted that a major topic of the current conference is 
reform and we hope that the reform in the soviet union will be a 
success 
china and the soviet union split over ideological differences in 
1960 and political relations remain strained 
but economic ties between the two countries have grown steadily 
and it is believed that the soviet union has watched closely 
chinas experiments in reducing the role of central planning 
allowing the value of goods to be determined by market forces and 
encouraging private enterprise

studies of a protein linked to the most serious 
form of muscular dystrophy suggest the disease may kill muscle by 
weakening muscle cell walls an idea that may help lead to 
treatments 
the protein is absent from muscles of people with duchenne 
dystrophy and the studies suggest that may result in abnormally 
weak cell walls 
scientists are trying to determine the function of the protein 
called dystrophin so they can tell just why its absence is so 
destructive in duchenne that knowledge is expected to guide 
development of treatments 
the studies do not directly demonstrate dystrophins function 
but hint at it by showing where the protein appears within the 
muscle cell the results support the cellwall hypothesis proposed 
before dystrophin was discovered last year 
todays british journal nature published one of the studies 
coauthored by louis kunkel of the howard hughes medical institute 
at childrens hospital in boston with colleagues at the hospital 
and harvard medical school 
similar conclusions were published this month by canadian 
researchers including elizabeth zubrzyckagaarn and ronald worton 
of the hospital for sick children in toronto and the university of 
toronto 
duchenne muscular dystrophy appears in about one in 3500 male 
births in the united states it causes progressive weakness and 
wasting of voluntary muscles requiring patients to use wheelchairs 
by age 12 and killing most in their early 20s no cure is known 
when kunkel and collaborators announced the discovery of 
dystrophin last december they suggested it may play a role in 
regulating muscle contraction but the new work makes that 
hypothesis less likely kunkel said this week in a telephone 
interview 
his teams research which involved examining extremely thin 
slices of muscle tissue under an electron microscope found that 
dystrophin appeared just inside the flimsy fatty membrane that 
makes up the cell walls 
it appears to be part of the cytoskeleton a mesh of proteins 
that maintains the structure of the cell he said that fits in 
with previous work showing that it resembles other proteins in the 
cytoskeleton he said 
if dystrophin is part of the cells structural support muscle 
cells that lack dystrophin may be unusually susceptible to being 
torn and destroyed as the muscle works he said 
zubryzyckagaarn senior author of the other paper said her 
team found a similar location for dystrophin and reached the same 
hypothesis about what its absence might do but scientists are 
still a long way from knowing dystrophins function in detail she 
said 
similar caution was voiced by donald wood of the muscular 
dystrophy association 
the studies show dystrophin is in some way associated with the 
cell wall membrane we dont know what that way is now he 
said i think were at the point where its best to keep an open 
mind about what dystrophin does 
in a separate report in nature japanese researchers said they 
have found another protein absent in muscle from patients with 
duchenne and other forms of muscular dystrophy its location in 
normal cells resembles that of dystrophin they said

evelyn cameron who nurtured her vegetable 
garden through the drought has her shotgun cocked in case the 
bandits who raided her patch last week come back looking for more 
if they come back ill be ready for them she said 
wednesday im not scared of anything 
the first harvest had just ripened when about 1 bushels of 
butter beans cucumbers and purple hull peas were stolen said mrs 
cameron who has lived in this central louisiana town 29 years 
thats not much but it was all that was ripe she said 
they took everything right down to the little bitty ones 
said mrs cameron its really disheartening because you plant a 
garden and take care of it through the drought and then they steal 
your vegetables 
more vegetables have begun to ripen and until theyre 
harvested shes not going anywhere her shotgun is at the ready in 
case anyone gets a latenight urge for corn on the cob okra or 
cucumbers 
i guarantee you ill shoot it she said ill scare the 
daylights out of em if nothing else 
mrs cameron said she did not call the grant parish sheriffs 
office about the theft because theres not much deputies can do 
unless the thieves are caught in the act 
even if the booty isnt cooked and eaten it would be hard to 
prove the vegetables were mrs camerons 
its not that mrs cameron is unwilling to share her bounty her 
three garden plots and dozen chickens provide more than enough 
vegetables and eggs for her 
if they want something why dont they come and ask id have 
given them eggs too if they needed em she said they were 
just out to steal something people do some strange things

in a landmark decision a magistrate court 
today sentenced four israeli leftwing activists to sixmonth 
prison terms for violating a law that bars contacts with the plo 
they were the first israelis to be jailed on the basis of the 
1986 law barring unauthorized contacts with members of 
terrorist groups israel views the plo as a terrorist group 
a judge in this city near tel aviv also gave each of the four a 
oneyear suspended sentence and ruled that each should pay 2500 
in fines and court expenses the law carries a sentence of up to 
three years imprisonment 
they seemed thunderstruck when they heard the ruling one 
witness told the associated press 
the leftists were convicted on june 2 for violating the law by 
meeting with a 15member palestine liberation organization group in 
costinesti romania in november 1986 
israel army radio quoted judge avraham baiser as acknowledging 
in his ruling that the law was disputed in israel 
however the law should be respected even if it is not 
accepted by the public baiser wrote the court is not to 
decide whether a law is bad or good the accused have committed an 
offense in front of the eyes of the whole world and now they should 
be punished 
the judge noted that the four sentenced were good citizens 
and suggested they serve their sentences doing public service and 
not in prison 
the implementation of the sentence was postponed until aug 4 to 
enable the four to appeal 
amnon zichrony an attorney for the four said that his clients 
latif dory yael lotan reuven kaminer and eliezer feiler would 
appeal the decision 
i hope the severe sentence will give rise to public campaign 
against this draconic law the radio quoted dory as saying 
police prosecutor raanan benyosef said the sentence would lead 
to indictments against 16 other members of the group that met with 
plo officials in romania

retired us autoworker john demjanjuk today 
appealed his conviction and death sentence for nazi war crimes his 
attorney said 
demjanjuk 68 was sentenced to death on april 25 a week after 
being found guilty of being ivan the terrible a brutal guard 
who operated gas chambers that killed 850000 jews at the treblinka 
death camp in nazioccupied poland 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk claims he is a victim of mistaken 
identity 
israeli attorney yoram sheftel said the appeal asks the supreme 
court to reverse the conviction due to lack of proof and much 
more than substantial doubt 
alternatively we are asking the court to eliminate the death 
sentence he told the associated press in an interview at the 
supreme court 
sheftel said the appeal challenges every finding of the court 
as far as facts and legal aspects and accuses the three district 
court judges of handling the case in a biased and uncivilized 
way 
in the 101page appeal the defense contends two photo spreads 
used by treblinka survivors to identify the defendant were 
impermissibly suggestive 
sheftel also quoted the appeal as saying the court failed to 
introduce any evidence challenging demjanjuks version that he was 
a nazi prisonerofwar during 1942 and 1943 when treblinka was in 
operation 
he said the defense also criticises an organized massive 
campaign by the israeli press against the defendant which 
completely undermined any possibility of a fair trial 
sheftel said he visited demjanjuk last week at his maximum 
security prison cell in the ayalon prison near tel aviv he was 
fine he is optimistic and looking forward to the appeal 
supreme court spokesman shmaryahu cohen said a fivejudge panel 
headed by chief justice meir shamgar will begin hearing the appeal 
dec 5 it will be held for three consecutive days then for 
another three days from dec 1215 cohen said 
the prosecution is scheduled to reply between dec 19 and dec 
29 
demjanjuk moved to the united states after world war ii 
settling in a suburb of cleveland ohio he was stripped of his 
us citizenship after a court ruled that he had lied on his 
application to become an american 
if the court rejects the appeal demjanjuk may become the first 
man to be executed in israel since nazi war criminal adolf eichmann 
was hanged in 1962 after a trial in jerusalem 
eichmann a highranking nazi official who promoted the use of 
gas chambers for mass extermination of jews and oversaw the murder 
of millions of jews in world war ii was kidnapped by the israelis 
in argentina in 1960

the united states will deploy 51 f111 bombers 
armed with cruise nuclear missiles in britain to replace landbased 
missiles banned under the superpower arms control agreement janes 
defense weekly reported 
britains defense ministry acknowledged in a statement without 
elaboration that nato was considering transferring usbased 
longrange aircraft to western europe 
but it said the deployment of airlaunched cruise missiles in 
western europe is not under consideration 
lt col ed neunherz spokesman at us air force european 
headquarters at ramstein west germany said plans to adapt f111s 
to carry cruise missiles have been under consideration for several 
years but nato has not given the final goahead 
janes reported that gen william kirk commanderinchief of 
the us air force in europe said the 51 f111s would augment 
the capability of striking targets deep in the soviet union from 
their new bases in the uk united kingdom when armed with 
nuclear cruise missiles 
it was the first confirmation of nato plans to update its 
nuclear arsenal following the intermediate nuclear forces treaty in 
december the magazine said in its issue to be published today 
the treaty ratified last month provides for elimination of 
1800 soviet and 800 allied mediumrange missiles over three years 
janes said a fleet of f111s will be transferred from strategic 
air command bases in new york and new hampshire in late 1989 or 
early 1990 to bolster natos flexible response strategy 
the us air force keeps about 150 of the swingwing supersonic 
f111s at lakenheath and upper heyford air force bases in england

weapons such dualcapable aircraft and airlaunched cruise 
missiles are not prohibited by the inf treaty which covers only 
landbased missiles with a range from 300 miles to about 3100

a criminal court today acquitted 44 police 
officers of charges they tortured moslem fundamentalists held in a 
case linked to the assassination of president anwar sadat 
it was the first time in egypts modern history that torture 
charges were brought against policemen by a government that was in 
power when the offenses were alleged to have taken place 
the officers ranging in rank up to brigadier held posts in the 
interior ministrys prisons administration and the state security 
service they were suspended for the duration of the trial that 
began in december 1986 
the defendants relatives friends and officers on duty in the 
courthouse broke into applause and cheered after suleiman ayoub 
president of the threeman tribunal read out the judgment they 
shouted long live justice and long live president hosni 
mubarak 
the defendants would have faced penalties of three to 10 years 
in prison if convicted 
the case grew out of the 1982 trial of 300 moslem 
fundamentalists belonging to an underground group called jihad or 
holy war 
they were charged with an abortive attempt to overthrow the 
government in the wake of sadats assassination by moslem 
extremists at a military parade in cairo on oct 6 1981 
mubarak succeeded sadat 
jihad members were tried for riots and armed raids on police 
installations in the southern city of assiut that left 87 people 
dead 66 of them policemen 
the disturbances occurred two days after sadats slaying and the 
government said the riots were part of a coup attempt 
jihad members in custody throughout their trial claimed in 
court they had been tortured by prison officers and state security 
interrogators 
in 1984 a state security court sentenced 107 jihad members to 
prison terms up to life at hard labor and acquitted the rest 
in handing down that ruling presiding judge abdelghaffar 
mohammed ahmed publicly demanded an investigation of torture claims 
by the defendants 
an investigation began in december 1984 and ended with the 
indictment of 44 officers 
judge adly hussein a member of the tribunal told reporters 
after todays session that the court had more than 130 reasons 
for deciding on acquittal foremost among them superficiality of 
investigations and lack of evidence 
the court also threw out damages claims made by 26 of the 
fundamentalist prisoners who alleged they had been tortured

employees streamed from the tennessee 
valley authority in a sea of pink clothing symbolizing the slips 
many of them carried as the nations largest supplier of 
electricity slashed its workforce by nearly a quarter 
its an awful day said deedra sluder a worker in the 
employee relations office who like many had expected the layoffs 
our branch manager called us in onebyone he did it as best he 
could it was hard on him 
tva chairman marvin runyon on wednesday announced that tva will 
lay off 7500 of its 34000 workers or 22 percent by october he 
said the cutbacks are necessary for the survival of the federal 
utility which operates in seven states and serves 8 million people 
we look at our operation as one thats in very bad trouble 
financially runyon said the steps were taking are the kind 
of steps that you would expect someone who had a real financial 
problem to take 
i wish they could all keep their jobs but the fact is 
were starting a new way of doing business and we had to make some 
very tough hard decisions 
runyon who became tva chairman in january after serving as 
chief executive officer of nissan motor manufactur 
new jobs 
it does appear that the layoffs have been distributed among 
all levels of tvas employees a statement from the senators 
said however tva has a responsibility to go all out to help 
those employees 
although employees have known about the layoffs for three 
months it was still a sad time for many at tvas headquarters in 
knoxville and elsewhere many wore pink to represent the pink slips 
they carried 
robert stone in the office of nuclear power said the layoffs 
were handled fairly well 
the only thing was they said they had been very communicative 
toward the employees and i feel like maybe we havent heard quite 
as much as our managers knew he said 
according to runyons announcement about 4000 fulltime 
salaried tva employees were laid off or 153 percent of the total 
he said 1800 contract employees or 47 percent were 
eliminated which should cut tvas cost for contract services by 
143 million next year and 1700 or 23 percent of the jobs paid 
on an hourly basis were cut 
runyon said 889 managers would be laid off reducing the ratio 
of supervisors to employees from 1to7 to about 1to13 
tva was created in 1933 during the new deal as a way of making 
the tennessee river more navigable controlling floods and bringing 
electricity and economic growth to a poor region in addition to 
tennessee it operates in mississippi alabama georgia north 
carolina virginia and kentucky 
tva embarked on an ambitious nuclear power program in the late 
1960s and early 1970s with plans to build 17 reactors five of 
those reactors have operated but all were shut down for more than 
two years over management and safety concerns only one is 
operating four others are under construction and eight have been 
mothballed at a cost of some 8 billion to tvas ratepayers 
the board also modified its contracts with tva power 
distributors and restructured its energy conservation program and 
changed the pay and benefits package for management level 
employees managers salaries will be frozen

a us supreme court decision dealing with 
testimony of young victims in sex abuse cases will likely spark a 
new legal skirmish in the marathon mcmartin preschool molestation 
trial a defense attorney said 
a prosecutor disagreed however saying wednesdays ruling in 
coy vs iowa which held that victims and defendants must confront 
each other in court should have little impact on the yearold 
trial 
the mcmartin trial is on a summer recess and jurors are 
scheduled to resume hearing testimony july 18 
raymond buckey 30 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 61 
are charged with 100 child molestations at their nowdefunct 
mcmartin preschoool in manhattan beach the case has been in the 
los angeles courts for five years 
the prosecution which once involved 41 children now focuses on 
14 youngsters who have grown from toddlers to preteenagers in the 
years of legal proceedings nine children have testified at the 
trial one alleged victim is not expected to testify and four 
others are scheduled to take the stand before the prosecution rests 
its case probably by september 
prosecutors dropped charges against five other teachers at the 
school in 1986 
the disagreement over significance of the supreme court decision 
will surface in court july 11 when a hearing is scheduled on a 
motion by prosecutors to allow use of videotaped preliminary 
hearing testimony in place of a child who refuses to testify in 
person at the trial 
we will vigorously oppose that defense attorney danny davis 
said we have a real confrontation problem if a mother says 
the child doesnt want to testify because theyre frightened does 
that reduce the trial to a video show 
as far as i understand it should not affect our case 
deputy district attorney roger gunson said of the high courts 
ruling which severely limited state efforts to shield child 
witnesses in sexual abuse trials 
the high court overturned the conviction of a man who was 
shielded by a oneway screen which prevented child witnesses from 
seeing him 
iowa california and many other states have passed laws intended 
to prevent children testifying at sex abuse trials from being 
intimidated by the sight of defendants 
the ruling casts serious doubt on the constitutionality of 
california laws that allow children in molestation cases to testify 
by videotape on closedcircuit television said steve white the 
states chief assistant attorney general 
in the mcmartin case closedcircuit tv testimony was used 
during the appearance of a single child at the preliminary hearing 
but the trial which has been under way for more than a year has 
not used that device all witnesses have testified in person 
we have not at trial presented any witnesses where the 
defendants could not see them or they could not see the 
defendants gunson said and we do not intend to use such 
devices with the remaining children

antigovernment guerrillas attacked 
a military post in eastern suriname killing three soldiers and 
wounding three others the suriname news agency reported 
the clash could threaten a ceasefire agreement between rebels 
and government representatives who met in neighboring french 
guiana on tuesday 
the soldiers were ambushed wednesday near the eastern town of 
patamacca as they were drawing water at a pump the state agency 
reported 
rebel leader ronny brunswijk told a radio station and friends in 
paramaribo by radio on wednesday that heavy fighting was still 
going on since the army attacked his troops in patamacca last 
friday he said government soldiers had surrounded his troops 
wounding several 
army spokesman commander badressein sital said tuesday similar 
allegations made by brunswijk monday were a big lie 
brunswijk and government delegates signed an agreement that may 
put an end to the guerrilla war that has ravaged this former dutch 
colony for nearly three years the talks were mediated by the head 
of the council of christian churches roman catholic bishop 
aloisius zichem 
army commander desi bouterse repeated last week that the army 
would not negotiate with terrorists but would not prevent the 
government from doing so 
brunswijk a former army private began his attacks on military 
and economic installations in the summer of 1986 when bouterse was 
president 
bouterse took power by coup in 1980 president ramsewak shankar 
was elected president last november 
shankars government is treating brunswijk as a rebel against 
the former regime rather than as a terrorist and criminal as 
bouterse had done 
the president shankar is also our president and we put our 
trust in his government brunswijk said after the talks in french 
guiana where he claims to have the support of an estimated 10000 
surinamese refugees 
after meeting with representatives of the council of christian 
churches to receive their report of the peace talks president 
shankar met wednesday with bouterse no information on their 
meeting has been released

nbc says it will dust off scripts from 
old shows and refilm them with new actors this fall but striking 
writers warned that the strategy would fail because theres no 
such thing as a writerproof script 
the network will use recycled scripts rejected pilots foreign 
and writerproof work as part of a fourpoint plan to deal with 
the strike nbc entertainment president brandon tartikoff said 
wednesday 
we at nbc have worked too hard dragging ourselves out of the 
ratings cellar to sit back and let our efforts be dashed because of 
the strike tartikoff said at a news conference that was sent by 
satellite to nbc affiliate stations we have been sitting back 
patiently watching the negotiations but today we are taking 
action 
the network will announce a revised fall schedule within 10 
days he said 
we want to let both the public and our advertisers know that 
come hell or high water were going to deliver original shows in 
the fall tartikoff said 
but a spokeswoman for the 9000member writers guild of america 
questioned that resolution 
theyre not going to fill their fall schedule without wga 
members cheryl rhoden said even scripts that are already 
written take rewrite work there is no such thing as a writerproof 
script 
the guild struck the alliance of motion picture and television 
producers on march 7 
tartikoff noted that nbc was in better shape than the other 
networks because its coverage of the summer olympics in seoul 
korea and baseballs world series would delay its fall schedule 
anyway 
but nbc was fast approaching the time when without contingency 
plans it would be unable to put a fall schedule on the air 
tartikoff said 
the fourpoint plan would include 
original shows of existing series that have signed interim 
agreements with the striking writers such as the cosby show 
a different world highway to heaven and alf 
writerproof programming such as unsolved mysteries and 
a presentational variety show that does not require writers 
the purchase of british and canadian comedy scripts and 
passedover pilot scripts in which additional episode scripts had 
been ordered but never filmed 
the revival of old shows that are recast and filmed again using 
the original scripts 
the nbc programming department was sifting through nearly 500 
properties looking for possible shows that could be put on the air 
tartikoff said 
he defended the plan to revive old shows and said they were not 
junk 
it would be much easier to simply buy the golden oldie reruns 
than to film the new shows he said 
the example ive been giving to the studios is suppose that 
bruce willis had not gone into moonlighting you could get eight 
to 10 old richie brockleman scripts a shortlived spinoff of 
the rockford files and redo them with willis he said 
we all know that a lot of recycling goes on in this business 
anyway look at broadway without revivals half of broadway would 
be dark the alfred hitchcock presents show we revived two years 
ago had 75 percent of the old original scripts

the government today released 46 
political prisoners and promised that the status of other 
imprisoned dissidents would be reviewed later 
along with 453 other ordinary criminals prison authorities 
said the 46 prisoners were released from various prisons 
the release came on the first anniversary of president roh 
taewoos promise to undertake democratic reforms ever since it 
came to power rohs government has been trying to deflate 
controversy over political prisoners 
among those freed today was prominent dissident kim kuntae who 
recently received the robert f kennedy award for human rights he 
was sentenced to five years imprisonment in 1986 for inciting 
unrest international human rights groups have campaigned for his 
release 
kim was released from a prison in the southern city of kimchon 
as about 30 relatives and friends welcomed him release all 
political prisoners they chanted 
the justice ministry said the dissidents were released in line 
with the governments continuing efforts to promote democracy in an 
atmosphere of national harmony 
but opposition groups which claim there are more than 600 
prisoners demanded the immediate release of other dissidents 
charging president roh with failing to carry out some of his 
promises for broad reforms 
the opposition said the dissidents were imprisoned for political 
beliefs or antigovernment activity but the government contends 
they committed violent crimes or violated national security laws 
today the three opposition parties agreed to move a resolution 
urging the release of all political prisoners the opposition 
stripped the government party of its parliamentary majority in 
elections in april 
among others released today were five labor activists a number 
of radical students and five people arrested in december on charges 
of leading violent protests against alleged government vote rigging 
in presidential elections 
also released were 11 koreans from japan convicted of spying 
for communist north korea the 11 were arrested while visiting 
south korea in the late 1970s 
todays action left only 81 political offenders in prison 
government officials said they said there also are about 480 
others awaiting trial on similar charges 
the parole coincided with the first anniversary of the socalled 
grand declaration for democracy made by roh on june 29 1987 
when nationwide protests forced the government to accept demands 
for democratic reforms he subsequently won the presidential 
election 
since last year hundreds of political prisoners have been 
released in several amnesties 
ministry officials said the cases of dissidents still in jail 
would be reviewed on a monthly basis and they might be released 
later

northrop corps chairman and two top 
executives have been ordered to testify before a federal grand jury 
investigating payments of more than 65 million to south korean 
businesses the defense contractor said the subpoenas were issued 
by the grand jury for the us district court in los angeles 
northrop spokesman tony cantafio said wednesday northrop also was 
ordered to produce documents related to its korean deals 
federal officials were not immediately available to comment on 
the action a call placed to the us attorneys office after 
business hours wednesday went unanswered 
the justice department and a congressional subcommittee have 
reportedly been conducting criminal investigations into northrops 
payment of more than 65 million to korean businesses in 
connection with attempts to sell its f20 tigershark jet 
fighter to the korean military 
northrop has denied it violated the foreign corrupt practices 
act and has said it was a victim of fraud by its korean partners in 
a joint venture to build a hotel and office project in seoul 
we made this investment in 1984 in good faith and to show our 
commitment to korea on the f20 project cantafio said 
we made several attempts to get the hotel built but our 
partners delayed the project when it became clear we werent going 
to get the hotel built we tried to get our money back by going to 
arbitration in korea 
when northrop couldnt get its money refunded cantafio said 
the defense contractor filed a civil lawsuit against its korean 
partners to recover the 625 million that it paid into one of the 
ventures 
eventually northrops program to develop the f20 jet fighter 
failed with development costs tagged at 12 billion without a 
single plane being sold 
cantafio said the executives ordered to appear before the grand 
jury were thomas v jones northrops chairman and chief executive 
officer welko e gasich an executive vice president and william 
c mcgagh identified by cantafio as northrops former chief 
financial officer 
although mcgaghs retirement was announced in april he has been 
working with the company during a transition period

prime minister hussein musavi was 
reelected by parliament today and warned that iran must prepare 
for allout struggle against iraq and its other enemies irans 
official news agency reported 
he was reinstated for a fourth term with an overwhelming vote of 
confidence by the majlis or parliament the islamic republic news 
agency said 
the agency monitored in nicosia said 204 of the 217 deputies 
present in the majlis voted for musavi eight voted against him and 
five abstained 
the remainder of the 270 members apparently did not attend the 
session 
the radical musavis reelection had been expected following 
parliamentary elections in april and may in which his supporters 
and their allies made sweeping gains at the expense of conservative 
factions 
musavi 44 has been prime minister since 1981 he said he will 
introduce members of his new cabinet in the majlis next week 
though he said last week that he would be making few changes 
in a speech before todays vote musavi declared that a 
massive mobilization by irans enemies is a warning that we must 
prepare for an allout struggle against them 
he stressed we are faced with an historic confrontation the 
most important manifestation of which has emerged in the 
warfronts with iraq 
he did not elaborate but he was clearly referring to a string 
of iraqi victories since midapril in which the iranians have been 
driven out of three of their four bridgeheads on iraqi soil in a 
dramatic turnaround in the nearly 8yearold conflict 
the iranians also claim the united states is actively helping 
the iraqis the us navy sank or crippled six iranian naval craft 
in a series of clashes april 18 
the main objective of the iraqius campaign is to destroy the 
iranian revolution musavi said 
but he declared that iran is potentially capable of putting up 
a durable resistance against an allout economic and arms embargo 
by the great satan irans catchword for the united states 
without mentioning any figures musavi said the governments 
financial and foreign exchange resources are limited but he 
said that if they are not being used to full capacity at present 
they will be in the future 
irans foreign exchange holdings are estimated at around 55 
billion 
they were about 75 billion in 1986 but tehran had to draw on 
them heavily to compensate for the collapse of oil prices that year 
musavi said irans arms industry built up over the last two 
years to sidestep arms embargoes now produces enough hardware and 
ammunition to save the country 50 million a year irna reported

a college student using a tv knowledge 
of childbirth delivered a baby girl on a city sidewalk while 
several passersby looked on 
im still high patrick combs 21 a senior at san francisco 
state university said wednesday i couldnt believe i was the 
first person to touch this baby when her eyes opened up and she 
looked around i just started screaming the feeling was so 
incredible 
shortly after 7 am wednesday when combs left his apartment 
for his job at the levi strauss co he saw a woman lying in a 
stairwell next to the sidewalk she told him she was pregnant and 
needed an ambulance 
he went to call the ambulance then helped the woman onto the 
sidewalk several people looked on he said but none offered to 
help 
they just stood there it was like she was being shunned 
after a neighbor brought a blanket and pillow combs went into 
action he removed the womans pants and spent 15 minutes soothing 
her and encouraging her to push 
i just kept telling myself you can have babies anywhere 
anywhere he said 
the babys head appeared 
it was so purple i didnt know what it was said combs who 
said he had only seen deliveries on television 
i had a baby head sticking out right there i didnt know what 
to do i figured doctors would hold the head but did they pull on 
it to help the baby out i didnt know 
combs cradled the tiny head in his hands just as the woman 
pushed again that contraction pushed the baby all the way out and 
left him holding what he called a slippery noodle of a human 
being 
an ambulance arrrived 40 minutes after combs stopped to help 
the mother and daughter were taken to san francisco general 
hospital

has a schoolage member of your family landed a 
summer job 
good news and a hearty welcome for that youngster to the wide 
world of taxes and tax planning 
sad to report even a couple of months of waiting on tables 
painting houses or serving as a lifeguard at the local swimming 
spot may bring a date of reckoning with uncle sam 
if the summer worker has no unearned income he or she wont 
have to pay any income tax on wage salary or tip earnings up to 
the standard deduction of 3000 notes the accounting firm of 
price waterhouse 
but for workers who do have income from some source other than a 
job even interest from a modest savings account the situation 
is likely to be more complicated 
furthermore anyone who wont owe taxes still needs to play the 
game right to avoid having money withheld that cant be retrieved 
until a tax return is filed in early 1989 claiming a refund 
the assignment starts with form w4 the internal revenue 
service document filed with the employer to determine a workers 
withholding status 
if the child paid no income tax in 1987 and expects to pay 
none in 1988 he or she can avoid withholding by completing only 
the bottom of the w4 certificate price waterhouse says in a 
current report on the subject 
however the youngster cannot claim exempt status if he or she 
can be claimed as a dependent by you or someone else has nonwage 
income and expects his or her total income both earned and 
unearned to be more than 500 
if withholding is necessary the trick as for all taxpayers is 
to set it neither too high nor too low 
overwithholding means effectively giving a taxfree loan to the 
government underwithholding can incur penalties and interest 
charges from the irs 
if your child works only parttime or only for the summer 
months the boss may withhold too much from his or her wages if 
withholding is based on a workers annual pay price waterhouse 
points out 
to forestall this the employer can be asked to apply a 
different method of withholding that projects summer wages over a 
full year and thus reduces the amount taken out of each paycheck 
to prevent problems with underwithholding the youngsters 
withholding payments and any quarterly estimated taxes for the 
year must total at least 90 percent of the tax ultimately due or 
100 percent of the previous years tax bill 
in cases where summer workers have significant amounts of other 
income from savings or investments price waterhouse says they may 
want to request withholding beyond what the job itself would call 
for 
that could serve as a substitute for filing quarterly estimated 
returns to cover the taxes owed on the investment income 
it is also sensible to be aware of strategies available to 
reduce a summer workers tax burden 
most people of school age are eligible to deduct on their tax 
returns annual contributions of up to 2000 to an individual 
retirement account 
of course many of those same people arent disposed to toil 
through the summer and then put what they earn in a place where 
they wont see it for 40 years or more chances are immediate 
expenses have first claim on the money 
but if parents financial position allows it they can reimburse 
the child for the ira contribution with a gift that isnt taxable 
unless it exceeds 10000 per year 
that way the youngster comes away from the summer job with some 
current income and an investment for the future that has a long 
time to compound and grow

afghan rebels have killed 10 soviet soldiers by 
shelling garrisons since the red army began withdrawing from 
afghanistan but the soviets are no longer actively fighting the 
guerrillas the military said 
about 20000 soviet soldiers have left afghanistan since may 15 
lt gen boris gromov said wednesday 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 more than 
100000 soldiers were helping the marxist government fight 
usbacked moslem rebels before an agreement providing for their 
withdrawal was signed in april 
gromov was in moscow as a delegate to the 19th communist party 
conference representing soldiers in afghanistan 
he denied reports by western diplomats in pakistan of rebel 
successes in border areas that soviet forces have abandoned 
col gen nikolai chervov of the military general staff was also 
at the press conference 
from may 15 there were losses not considerable but about 10 
killed and 15 wounded gromov said 
they took place not while the withdrawal was being carried out 
but as a result of shelling of our garrisons that were supplying 
materiel to other garrisons he said 
the soviet troops are not taking part in action gromov 
said adding that his main problem is to avoid losses on our 
side and the other side let alone the population 
he said he could not give figures for casualties among the 
afghan army or moslem insurgents 
soviet soldiers have been attacked near the eastern city of 
jalalabad and other places along their route out of the country 
gromov said but all these attempts were cut short we had no 
losses in men and materiel 
western diplomats in pakistan have said that soviet soldiers in 
the afghan city of kandahar had to move to the airport outside of 
the city because of rebel pressure on the town itself 
the diplomats also have reported that rebels had taken their 
first provincial capital kalat in neighboring zabul province 
thereby cutting a major road between kandahar and the capital 
kabul 
gromov called both reports false soviet soldiers supply 
kandahar with food and other goods daily from the airport he said 
i can say quite officially that kalat was not captured he 
added the opposition couldnt capture kalat from the military 
point of view it is only one more proof that the afghan armed 
forces are capable of carrying out their duty 
in islamabad pakistan today western diplomatic sources said 
moslem guerrillas were still fighting for a provincial center just 
west of kabul that contradicted rebel claims that they had driven 
communist forces from the area 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the rebels 
succeeded in routing soviet and afghan government troops from 
maidan shahr 18 miles southeast of kabul on june 24 
however the insurgents were pushed out a day later by communist 
artillery the sources said they said the battle was still raging 
some guerrilla groups reported sunday that the town was under 
rebel control opening a new attack route to the heights 
overlooking western kabul

mandatory random drug testing of transportation 
workers is the only effective reliable method for weeding out 
drug abusers says transportation secretary jim burnley but unions 
disagree 
at a news conference wednesday burnley announced a 
transportation department proposal for such testing among more than 
350000 mass transit workers merchant seafarers and pipeline 
industry workers the proposal is in line with burnleys earlier 
call for testing in the airline railroad and trucking industries 
burnley said he hoped to have rules imposed in all six sectors 
by the end of the year 
if enacted as proposed the rules would require workers 
throughout the transportation industry to submit to drug tests 
before they are employed at random intervals while they are 
working whenever there is probable cause to believe they are 
abusing drugs and whenever they are involved in an accident 
nobody has a right in this country to have a job in which 
they can put the lives of other people in mass transportation at 
risk through narcotics ingestion burnley said wednesday 
but transportation unions denounced the proposal as overkill 
obviously nobody whos taking drugs and drinking on the job 
should be operating a train or a bus said jim gannon spokesman 
for the transport workers union representing 100000 mass transit 
workers but i think the percentage of those people is so low 
that just to approach it in a gestapotype manner is not right 
gannon said the twu supports mandatory drug testing before 
employment during annual medical examinations and when there is 
probable cause to suspect drug use 
a spokesman for the seafarers international union which 
represents 18000 deepsea sailors said he couldnt comment on 
burnleys proposals until he had seen them but he said 
generally we have not supported mandatory random testing 
burnley called mandatory random testing the only effective 
reliable method of enforcement and said the benefits outweigh 
the loss of privacy to workers 
the departments proposal will be subject to 60 days of public 
comment before final rules are drafted he said

police sweeps and threats of the gas chamber 
cannot stop street gangs from killing to protect their highly 
profitable drug trade two gang members testified 
when im out there doing my thing i dont think about the 
consequences i wont think about the death penalty at the time 
because im just thinking about getting away a gang member 
identified by the pseudonym john told a state task force meeting 
wednesday to plot a war on gangs and drug trafficking 
testimony from john and another member of the citys 
predominantly black crips gang identified by the pseudonym jack 
highlighted the first day of a twoday hearing 
the meeting followed a night of violence in which 11 people were 
wounded in shootings many of them gangrelated 
the testimony was piped by loudspeaker into the hearing room at 
the county hall of administration while the two men remained 
concealed in an adjacent room the two said they were arrested more 
than 10 times each on such charges as robbery and illegal firearms 
possession 
john 28 became a gang member at age 10 and has spent three 
years in state prison and four years in california youth authority 
facilities 
his death penalty comment was in response to a question by task 
force chairman robert philibosian former county district attorney 
john also said the police departments antigang sweeps were 
useless although they have resulted in 16000 arrests so far this 
year 8000 of whom were gang members 
as soon as you arrest one it will be replaced with another 
john said 
other witnesses said gangs had become so sophisticated they hold 
outofstate seminars on expanding their drug empire 
jack and john said they were enticed by a narcotics business 
that can net them 1000 a day but that competition had become so 
fierce in los angeles that gang members were exporting their 
illegal trade elsewhere 
bakersfield sacramento seattle texas dallas and houston 
its really going on up there thats where its at texas is the 
hot spot john said you take 100 worth of dope make 600 or 
700 off of it 
los angeles police chief daryl gates suggested incarceration as 
a solution to the gang problem 
lets take those old military bases put some barbed wire 
and land mines outside it why not he said 
the chief said the lapd has found gang members living in 
milliondollar houses while lt larry carter of the suburban 
inglewood police department said a local gang member was arrested 
in seattle with 35000 in his pocket 
called urban terrorists by philibosian county street gangs 
accounted for 387 slayings in 1987 and more than 140 murders 
already this year authorities said gangs are using such 
militarystyle weapons as uzi machine guns ak47s and ar15 
assault rifles 
they go out like cowards and shoot little kids and innocent 
people they have no conscience and concern its a hideous thing 
like you found in nazi germany and we have it here and our people 
have to live with it gates said

marcel lefebvre speaks softly but his 
benign smile belies his fierce fight to rid the roman catholic 
church of what he calls the satanic influence of liberalism 
our future is the past the 82yearold french 
traditionalist declares 
he says the church has been infiltrated by wolves and 
thieves he blasts the neomodernist and neoprotestant 
tendencies created by vatican reforms and says the church must be 
saved from autodestruction 
the rebel archbishops crusade culminated today with the 
consecration of four traditionalist bishops in this hamlet where he 
founded the st pius x fraternity named for the pope who condemned 
modernism in a 1907 encyclical 
the vatican announced the excommunication of the five shortly 
afterward citing church rules that prohibit consecration of 
bishops without papal permission 
it led to the first major split in the church since 1870 when 
the old catholics broke with rome after the first vatican council 
proclaimed the doctrine of papal infallibility 
followers venerate lefebvre as a representative of the true 
church to critics he is an incorrigible reactionary who admired 
gen francisco franco the late spanish dictator and would like 
the french monarchy restored 
he says a french cardinal gabrielmarie garrone once called 
him a lunatic 
lefebvre was ordained in 1929 after obtaining doctorates in 
philosophy and theology in 1932 he was sent to gabon then a 
french colony and spent 13 years there as a missionary 
after a brief spell in france after world war ii he returned to 
africa as apostolic delegate the popes personal representative 
for all frenchspeaking regions of the continent 
he was appointed archbishop of dakar senegal in 1955 and was 
succeeded in the post by a native senegalese now cardinal 
hyacinthe thiandoum whom he had ordained 
pope john xxiii made him a member of the commission that 
prepared the second vatican council 
during that council in 196265 lefebvre was among the leaders 
of a group committed to uphold the traditional faith he 
refused to sign two of the councils 16 documents those called 
religious freedom and the church in the modern world 
traditionalists say the campaign against lefebvre originated in 
france they claim the french hierarchy facing a decline in its 
own system was envious of the increasing number of seminarians at 
econe 
lefebvre issued a declaration in 1974 saying his fraternity 
refuses to follow the rome of neomodernist and neoprotestant 
tendencies 
he continued celebrating mass in the latin liturgy and dismissed 
the bastard rites in the vernacular that took its place under 
the second vatican council 
in 1976 pope paul vi suspended him from priestly functions 
because of the scandal caused to the christian people by your 
obstinacy 
that barred him from celebrating mass and giving the sacraments 
but lefebvre called the sanction illegal and has ignored it 
ordaining more than 220 traditionalist priests 
his organization operates seminaries thoughout the world and 
lefebvre says bishops must be consecrated to carry the movement on 
after he dies 
he toned down his comments after the election in 1978 of pope 
john paul ii whom liberal theologians consider proconservative 
reconciliation with the vatican seemed near when he and cardinal 
joseph ratzinger signed a protocol may 5 but lefebvre finally 
rejected the accord because of a clause giving vatican 
representatives the majority on a commission to settle differences 
in interpretation of vatican ii documents 
it is to guard carefully the faith of our baptism that we must 
oppose the spirit of vatican ii and all the reforms it inspired 
he wrote the pope on june 2 
in his reply a week later john paul urged lefebvre to renounce 
his plan warning that such a schismatic act would have 
inevitable canonical consequences 
lefebvre remained unimpressed it is no longer possible to 
trust rome he told a news conference june 15 at which he said he 
would go ahead with the consecrations

the arrest of a british man who allegedly plotted 
to sell 10 us militarytype helicopters to iran for 30 million 
has triggered a search for other us military supplies destined 
for the boycotted nation 
colin breeze 33 was held without bond wednesday at the 
metropolitan correctional center for allegedly conspiring to 
violate the us embargo of iran said patrick obrien head of the 
us customs service in miami 
investigators say breeze schemed with the iranian ambassador to 
spain to sell 10 sikorsky s36 helicopters to a european company 
secretly owned by the iranian government the ambassador intended 
to take a cut from the sale said obrien 
we are continuing the investigation to look for diversions of 
military equipment to iran he said 
breezes arrest tuesday at the fort lauderdale airport 
apparently ended attempts to lure other conspirators into the 
country but agents suspect the operation was part of a much larger 
network 
breeze appeared wednesday before a federal magistrate who 
ordered him held without bond another hearing was scheduled for 
friday 
the s36 is a militarytype helicopter obrien said 
declining to give details of the case they are basically a troop 
carrier a civilian version of the blackhawk these things are 
great over the desert 
the helicopters were originally sold to the jordanian air force 
in 1979 and 1980 six were later traded back to sikorsky but 
remained in jordan and all 10 were for sale at 675000 each 
sikorsky spokesman bob stangarone in stratford conn confirmed 
the company owned the six helicopters but said it had never dealt 
with breeze 
in may the arrest affidavit says breeze allegedly approached an 
informant for the customs service about buying the helicopters for 
iran the informant advised customs and authorities taped 
conversations between the two 
in the conversations some of which took place in spain and the 
united kingdom breeze a british subject told the informant the 
ultimate purchaser was iran 
breeze further advised that negotiations for the purchase were 
being conducted through a spanish national middleman and the 
iranian embassy in madrid fort lauderdale customs agent thomas 
bailey said in the affidavit 
breeze told the informant last week that the sales agreement was 
on its way by diplomatic pouch from madrid to iran for final 
approval but he later said it was held up because the ambassador 
was insisting on a larger share of the profits

rep richard gephardt of missouri rode a 
48000 hyundai and a message of economic nationalism to fleeting 
stardom in the democratic presidential campaign 
to the suprise of many gephardt transformed himself from a 
congressman little known outside of capitol hill to winner of the 
iowa caucuses now he is among those mentioned as possible running 
mates for massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
but gephardt 47 says he doesnt think hell be asked to join 
the ticket and predicts the nominee will look to the south to 
fill that bill 
i dont expect to be asked but if i were asked i would do it 
because i want to help gov dukakis win the presidency and the 
democrats win the presidency in 1988 and if he feels i can help in 
that way ill do it says gephardt 
he declines to say whether he has discussed the no 2 spot with 
dukakis or any of his campaign aides 
those who point to gephardt suggest he could provide dukakis 
with needed strength in the midwestern farm belt they also say his 
skills as a campaigner one who demonstrated he could excite voters 
with his populist its your fight too oratory would offer a 
counterbalance to the governors staid demeanor 
but dukakis and gephardt clashed on issues during the campaign 
particularly on trade and some political professionals say that 
those differences could hurt the democratic ticket by providing 
republicans with plenty of ammunition for the general election 
it was the dukakis camp that broadcast perhaps the most pointed 
attack on gephardt a television commercial pointed to gephardts 
flipflops on issues including abortion and showed an 
acrobat who looked like gephardt doing somersaults 
some democrats also worry that dukakis could anger supporters of 
the rev jesse jackson if he fills the no 2 spot with one of his 
former rivals and doesnt offer it to jackson 
gephardt serving his sixth term in the house representing a 
mostly bluecollar district in st louis wears a capitol hill 
reputation as a leader among a new generation of house democrats 
he is known as a legislators legislator who excels in the molding 
of compromises 
he also has demonstrated a knack for positioning himself on the 
cutting edge of issues he and sen bill bradley dnj were 
early advocates of an overhaul of the federal income tax system 
but gephardt made his mark on the campaign trail for his tough 
talk on trade 
he championed a proposal for mandatory retaliation against 
foreign competitors failing to lower their trade surpluses with the 
united states critics including dukakis denounced it as 
protectionism the proposal initially approved by the house was 
ejected from the trade bill eventually passed by congress and 
vetoed by president reagan 
gephardt won the iowa caucuses after bouncing back from 
singledigit fourth place standings in opinion polls six weeks 
before the contest 
his prescription for recovery was a sharply antiestablishment 
theme in his speeches and a television blitz featuring an 
advertisement with gephardt criticizing koreas tariffs on american 
automobiles the candidate vowed in the ad to retaliate if trade 
barriers didnt disappear how many americans are going to pay 
48000 for one of their hyundais 
but gephardts victory in farm country proved to be his 
brightest moment in the political sun he finished second in new 
hampshire received a brief boost with a victory in south dakota 
but ran low on money and was buried in the super tuesday primaries 
and caucuses on march 8 he abandoned the race on march 28 after 
limping to a thirdplace finish in the michigan caucuses 
before entering the presidential race gephardt was known as a 
centrist or moderate even conservative on some social issues he 
once backed antiabortion constitutional amendments and sponsored 
legislation to prohibit busing of school children for 
desegregation he no longer supports either however saying there 
are more effective ways of achieving the same results 
critics say gephardt has become more liberal because of his 
national political aspirations gephardt says the changes reflect 
growth and flexibility 
he arrived in congress in 1977 after coming up through the ranks 
in st louis politics where he was one of several activist 
democratic aldermen called the young turks 
he earned a coveted seat on the taxwriting ways and means 
committee as a freshman since 1985 gephardt has served as the 
chairman of the house democratic caucus the no 4 leadership spot

officials are considering turning disputed 
nagornokarabakh over to mikhail s gorbachevs home region until 
the demands of two ethnic groups can be resolved a delegate to the 
communist party conference said today 
eduard m dzhrbashyan director of the institute of literature 
of armenias academy of sciences said the proposal was one of 
three under consideration 
armenians who make up the majority of nagornokarabakhs 
population have been demanding since february that the region be 
taken out of the republic of azerbaijan and be annexed to 
neighboring armenia the armenian parliament endorsed the demand 
but azerbaijan rejected it 
nagornokarabakhs legislature proposed a compromise june 21 in 
a move to calm tensions between armenians and azerbaijanis that 
have led to strikes demonstrations and riots the legislature 
suggested turning the region over to the central government in 
moscow until a longterm solution is found 
at a moscow news conference dzhrbashyan offered another 
temporary compromise he said nagornokarabakh classified as an 
autonomous region of azerbaijan should be put under the control of 
the russian republic specifically of the stavropol region of 
southern russia 
dzhrbashyan did not make clear who was considering the 
compromise but his mention of it as a conference delegate 
indicated it had some official support 
gorbachev was born in a farming village in the stavropol region 
in 1931 after completing law school in moscow in 1955 he returned 
to his home district along with wife raisa and worked there for 23 
years serving successively as head of the communist youth league 
city party boss and party chief in the region which is about the 
size of south carolina 
sergei a ambartsumyan head of yerevan university in armenias 
capital and a conference delegate also mentioned at the news 
conference the possibility of temporarily transferring 
nagornokarabakh to the russian republic 
grant m voskanyan armenias president told the news 
conference he is on a commission of the conference that is drafting 
the resolution and that it contains no specific proposals for 
resolving the nagornokarabakh dispute but he said the partys 
central committee recommended the conference discuss perfecting 
federation of the country and expanding the rights of republics 
voskanyan refused to endorse any of the proposed solutions to 
the nagornokarabakh dispute 
the question is extremely complicated because two union 
republics have taken practically opposite decisions voskanyan 
said in such a situation governmental wisdom to resolve the 
issue in the interests of all people is demanded of our 
republic and all of us 
the communist party conference is scheduled to adopt a 
resolution outlining policy toward the countrys more than 100 
ethnic groups

archbishop marcel lefebvre today 
defied the vatican and consecrated four bishops of his 
traditionalist movement provoking the first major split in the 
roman catholic church since 1870 
the vatican responded shortly afterward by excommunicating 
lefebvre and the four new bishops rome had warned that 
consecrations without the approval of pope john paul ii would bring 
automatic ejection from the church 
we are convinced we are following the call of god the 
frenchborn lefebvre told about 10000 supporters in a halfhour 
homily before the ceremony 
the prelate accused the church of accepting modernism 
liberalism communism zionism and said the changes are not 
catholic 
john paul urged lefebvre in a telegram wednesday to refrain from 
his plans for the love of christ and his church 
lefebvre said the pope sent him a car wednesday night to take 
him to rome he said he was surprised at this effort to make him 
cancel the elevation 
today the rebel prelate placed his hands over each of the new 
bishops to complete the consecrations they highlighted a festive 
ceremony in a tent on a vast meadow in front of the traditionalist 
seminary in this swiss hamlet surrounded by vineyards and alpine 
peaks 
in rome a statement read by vatican spokesman joaquin navarro 
said the consecrations were a schismatic act carried out against 
the wishes of the pope 
a schism is a formal rupture with the holy see excommunication 
means lefebvre and the four bishops are excluded from the rights 
sacraments and privileges of the church 
this is not a schism we are not schismatic lefebvre said 
there is no question at all of this on the contrary we are here 
to manifest our attachment to the church of all times 
rome has followed a course of grave errors since the reforms 
of the second vatican council in 196265 that was about to 
destroy the church lefebvre said 
he said he had to go ahead with the consecrations because we 
have tried everything to make rome return to the traditions but it 
was in vain 
this is an operation of survival of the tradition and 
signing an accord with the vatican would have been operation 
suicide lefebvre said 
about 180 traditionalist priests and 150 seminarians were among 
the faithful assembled under bright sunshine today 
econe is the birthplace of lefebvres st pius x fraternity 
founded in 1970 for clerics opposed to the second vatican council 
whose reforms included modernizing the liturgy 
lefebvre continues to celebrate mass in latin dismissing the 
bastard rites in the vernacular that took its place 
named after a pope who condemned modernist trends in the 
church in a 1907 encyclical lefebvres movement claims to have 
millions of sympathizers 
lefebvre 82 says his age makes the consecrations urgent to 
ensure continuity of the fraternitys struggle against 
selfdestructive trends 
church law allows only bishops to perform ordinations so 
lefebvre says the fraternity would be orphaned unless he 
consecrates new bishops before dying 
lefebvre in a recent magazine interview dismissed 
excommunication as worthless and said it will not slow him in 
pushing for a true renewal of the church 
these events will strengthen our unity he was quoted in the 
conservative french weekly figaromagazine in 10 years one will 
see that i have defended the last bastion of faith 
the four newly consecrated bishops were richard williamson 48 
englishborn head of the ridgefield conn seminary bernard 
tissier de mallerais 43 secretary general of the fraternity 
alfonso de galarreta 31 spanishborn head of the seminary in 
argentina and bernard fellay 30 administrator of the fraternity 
a swiss 
the vatican did not immediately excommunicate brazilian prelate 
antonio de castro mayer bishop of campos and lefebvres assistant 
in the rites the vatican said his role was unclear 
de castro mayer 84 is not a fraternity member but has formally 
associated himself with lefebvres crusade against the vatican 
three weeks ago the pope exhorted lefebvre in a personal letter 
from a paternal heart to renounce the consecrations which 
would bring a new wound to the church 
the pontiff warned the consecrations could only appear as a 
schismatic act 
the last split in the church occurred when the old catholics 
broke with the vatican because they opposed the doctrine of papal 
infallibility proclaimed at the first vatican council in 1870 
defying earlier vatican sanctions lefebvre has ordained about 
220 traditionalist priests including 16 on wednesday that 
ceremony drew at least 7000 sympathizers to econe 
the cancer of liberalism is spreading in the church since 
the second vatican council lefebvre said in his homily wednesday 
join the fight against liberalism that false notion of 
freedom he said 
traditionalist sources have hinted they still hope for an 
eventual settlement with the vatican an accord was close last 
month after a protocol was signed in rome but lefebvre reneged

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states may ban virtually all lawyer advertisements 
featuring testimonials or client endorsements 
the justices said they will review a california rule that 
presumes such ads are false or misleading 
todays order comes just two weeks after the high court ruled in 
a kentucky case that states may not ban all directmail 
advertisements sent by lawyers to potential clients 
mark h oring of los angeles was reprimanded by the california 
bar association for a radio commercial in which a client who had 
been involved in an auto accident praised oring and his partner 
the client said that thanks to orings firm an insurance 
company paid her twice the amount of money she originally was 
awarded when her lawsuit went to trial 
state bar officials said the commercial inherently tended to 
confuse and mislead the public because it failed to explain that 
the clients case was highly unusual and that such doubling of 
awards in accident cases generally does not occur 
bar officials said the burden was on oring to prove the ad was 
truthful 
oring said the state rule presuming testimonials are deceptive 
violated his freespeech rights he said the rule has the effect of 
banning truthful ads 
the california supreme court rejected orings challenge to the 
rule last october 
the nations highest court in 1977 ended the legal professions 
longtime ban on all lawyer advertising but left it to the states to 
ensure that ads are not deceptive 
the court said lawyer advertising like other commercial speech 
is not constitutionally protected if found to be false or 
misleading 
in a series of decisions since the justices have forced states 
to relax certain restrictions on lawyer advertising such as 
kentuckys ban on directmail solicitation 
orings partner david a grey also was reprimanded for the 
firms radio commerical and lost a similar appeal to the high 
court in 1987 
the case acted on today is oring vs california 871224

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether lawyers who do not live in the virgin islands should be 
allowed to practice there 
the court said it will hear appeals by bar association officials 
seeking to reinstate attorney residency requirements in the us 
territory 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled last march that the 
residency restrictions are unlawful 
the appeals court struck down a rule that applicants for 
licenses to practice law in the virgin islands must live there for 
one year before applying for admission to the bar and must state 
their intention to reside there 
the appeals court rejected arguments that the residency rule is 
needed to assure adequate legal representation for criminal 
defendants in the virgin islands 
alternative rules could validly be adopted that would impose 
reasonable requirements on nonmembers of the virgin islands bar to 
assure that they would bear professional responsibilities 
comparable to those now imposed on resident attorneys the 
appeals court said 
the appeals court also said it had the authority to throw out 
the residency requirement which was adopted by the district court 
of the virgin islands the appeals court said the district court is 
akin to a state court and is subject to supreme court rulings on 
lawyer residency 
the appeals court ruled in favor of susan esposito thorstenn of 
brooklyn ny and lloyd devos of mountainside nj 
the supreme court has ruled in favor of liberalized residency 
requirements for lawyers in recent decisions 
the court on june 22 struck down a virginia rule that allowed 
lawyers living in the state to practice there without passing the 
virginia licensing examination if they were licensed for at least 
five years in another state that gives virginialicensed lawyers 
the same privilege outofstate residents had been denied the same 
treatment by virginia 
the justices in 1985 said states generally may not require 
lawyers to be residents to practice within their borders striking 
down a new hampshire rule 
the cases acted on today are barnard vs thorstenn 871939 and 
virgin islands bar association vs thorstenn 872008

can a pig farm be a form of political protest 
the supreme court today refused to answer that unusual legal 
question in a case from the ski resort community of stowe vt 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by developers who 
set up a pig farm on their property after their plans for a large 
motel were blocked 
the developers normand ramsey and his son raymond sought in 
1981 to add to their chain of motels by building a 79unit motel on 
a parcel of land in stowe 
the plans were challenged by neighbors including the owner of a 
gift and gourmet food shop and a couple that own a motel 
the ramseys were given a permit to build a 15unit motel but 
the proposal for the larger motel was blocked as a violation of a 
state environmental protection law 
in apparent retaliation the ramseys abandoned the motel plans 
and instead applied successfully for a permit to operate a pig farm 
a few days after the permit was approved according to court 
records the ramseys had tons of wet chicken manure dumped along an 
edge of their property and a large rusty storage tank was placed in 
their meadow 
in the ensuing months untended manure attracted an infestation 
of flies and caused a powerful stench the owners of the nearby 
motel installed air conditioners for their rooms because of the 
odor 
scores of pigs cows sheep and roosters were brought in but 
were not cared for adequately the court records said when the 
animals died decomposing carcasses were left lying around 
the decaying pig farm also had become a tourist attraction of 
sorts causing traffic congestion 
the ramseys were sued in state court by their neighbors and 
were deemed to be causing a public nuisance they were ordered to 
pay nearly 568000 in damages 
the vermont supreme court upheld the decision that the ramseys 
had caused a nuisance and ordered further hearings that could mean 
additional punitive damages 
the state court said the weightiest factor in the punitive 
damages assessment was the degree of malice involved short of 
physical violence it is difficult to imagine a situation entailing 
greater animosity and malevolence than that exhibited here 
the state court also noted that normand ramsey operates 
businesses worth more than 3 million 
in the appeal acted on today the ramseys said they were being 
punished in effect for their political protest 
they said the pig farm while complying with landuse 
regulations was a constitutional visual protest against the 
arbitrary action that denied them a permit to build a 79unit 
motel 
such a protest is protected by constitutional guarantees of free 
expression they said 
the case is ramsey associates vs victor and mary coty 871856

the supreme court today refused to become 
involved in a california dispute over the power of cities to charge 
fees to companies that operate oil pipelines under city streets 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that santa 
monica calif may charge shell oil co 237000 a year to carry 
crude oil through 39 miles of underground pipeline within the city 
while a lower court ruling in the case largely favored the city 
santa monica officials as well as shell asked the high court to 
intervene because one important aspect of the lower court decision 
exposed the city to suits for restricting interstate commerce 
unlawfully 
santa monica has permitted shell oil and its former owners to 
use the portion of the pipeline within the city limits since 1941 
the 39mile segment is part of a pipeline stretching 82 miles from 
ventura county to shells wilmington refinery in los angeles county 
shell transports more than 32000 barrels of crude oil each day 
through the pipeline 
shell had been paying santa monica 1029 a year to use the 
pipeline within the city until the companys lease expired in 1981 
since then the company and city officials have disagreed over 
the fee 
shell at one point agreed to pay up to 12500 a year but the 
city insisted on 237000 with annual adjustments for inflation 
the oil company has been permitted to use the pipeline for 
around 10000 a year pending the outcome of the court battle 
shell filed a federal lawsuit that said the 237000 fee 
violates the constitution because it places an unreasonable 
burden on interstate commerce 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last october dismissed the 
companys lawsuit but the appeals court stopping short of a 
complete victory for santa monica said cities are subject to the 
constitutions commerce clause restrictions in such cases 
the appeals court rejected the citys argument that it should be 
immune from attack under the commerce clause because the city is 
acting as a market participant rather than market regulator 
the fact that santa monica has a contractual relationship with 
shell does not make the city a market participant insulated from 
commerce clause scrutiny the appeals court said 
in deciding whether or on what terms to grant a franchise 
for the use of public streets the city may not burden interstate 
commerce in a manner that violates the commerce clause the 
appeals court said 
but the appeals court said the franchise fee the city seeks to 
charge shell is reasonable because it is based on an evenhanded 
appraisal of the value of the property adjacent to the pipeline 
the cases are shell vs santa monica 871685 and santa monica 
vs shell 871841

michael dukakis today blamed the reagan 
administration for economic policies that have left average family 
income right where it was 20 years ago 
dukakis told employees at a reynolds aluminum plant that the 
average weekly wage for jobs lost between 1979 and 1985 was 440 
while the average weekly pay for new jobs during that period was 
only 270 the numbers that dukakis used did not take into account 
the last three years of economic recovery 
today there are more americans working than at any time in our 
history but average family income in america is right where it was 
20 years ago even though theres been a huge increase in the 
number of families where both parents work the certain 
democratic presidential nominee said in remarks prepared for 
delivery at the plant the largest manufacturing facility under one 
roof in illinois 
too many of our families are struggling to hold on challenged 
by change anxious about their jobs burdened by the rising costs 
of health care and housing and college tuition troubled by the 
lack of quality affordable child care dukakis said 
as dukakis began a second day of campaigning in the troubled 
midwest he kept his counsel on his search for a vice presidential 
nominee 
i cant say at this point if im close or not so close the 
democratic presidential candidate said wednesday after meeting with 
members of congress including four senators often mentioned as 
potential running mates 
at a farm in norwalk iowa sen paul simon of illinois one of 
dukakis defeated rivals in the fight for the democratic 
presidential nomination offered this praise for the massachusetts 
governor 
theres not a phony bone in mike dukakis body hes genuine 
on wednesday dukakis told farmers gathered at the 160acre farm 
of howard hughes its good to be home dukakis recalled the 
months he spent campaigning before the iowa caucuses last winter 
only to finish third behind rep richard gephardt of missouri and 
simon 
hughes and other midwest growers face heavy losses from a 
prolonged drought 
but as dukakis spoke the sky was obscured by thick dark clouds 
and the ground was damp from rain the night before 
the corn dukakis inspected in one of hughes fields towered at 
least a foot above the head of the 5foot 8inch governor 
that corn looks awfully good over there said simon you 
cant judge that by its being green that doesnt mean it will 
produce anything dont get any false impression even though that 
looks better than a lot of corn in illinois and south dakota and 
everywhere else 
but this healthier looking corn was only four miles from the end 
of the runway at the des moines airport making it a convenient 
stop on the candidates fivestate midwest swing 
sen tom daschle dsd said midwest farmers have lost 10 
percent to 15 percent of their corn crop and stand to lose much 
more if the drought continues 
in north dakota and some parts of south dakota its the worst 
drought since 1934 said the senator who along with simon and 
sen tom harkin of iowa flew to the midwest with dukakis 
one of the senators dukakis met with on wednesday was sam nunn 
of georgia a favorite of many southern democrats who believe nunn 
would help dukakis throughout their region 
but the senator told dukakis he wasnt interested in the second 
spot on the democratic ticket 
during an hourlong meeting during which they discussed other 
possible choices nunn said he told dukakis i was still not 
interested in the vice presidency 
the georgian who is chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said his feelings about the vice presidency had 
absolutely nothing to do with gov dukakis 
others with whom dukakis met privately were sens john glenn of 
ohio lloyd bentsen of texas and bob graham of florida all of 
whom have been mentioned as among the most prominent potential 
choices 
things have a way of sorting themselves out said dukakis 
were making progress 
during his midwest campaign tour dukakis was expected to be 
joined by glenn in ohio and rep lee hamilton of indiana in his 
home state hamilton also is considered a top contender to join 
dukakis on the democratic ticket

here is the official englishlanguage text 
of the vatican statement on archbishop marcel lefebvre the 
original was issued in italian 
with regard to rumors voiced in monsignor lefebvre circles 
concerning the excommunication latae sentetiae automatic 
mentioned in canon law n 1382 the vatican press office notes that 
according to canon 1013 no bishop is allowed to consecrate 
another bishop without the explicit papal authorization the 
consecration of bishops on june 30 by mons lefebvre in spite of 
the admonition on june 17 have been carried out explicitly against 
the popes will this is a formally schismatic act according to 
canon 751 in as much as he openly refused submission to the holy 
father and communion with the members of the church under his 
jurisdiction 
consequently both mons lefebvre and the bishops consecrated 
by him bernard fellay bernard tissier de mallerais richard 
williamson alfonso de galarreta have ipso facto incurred 
excommunication latae sententiae reserved to the apostolic see in 
this case canon 1323 is inapplicable because the circumstances 
mentioned in the canon have not obtained the socalled case of 
necessity has been intentionally fabricated by mons lefebvre in 
order to maintain an attitude of division within the catholic 
church notwithstanding the ecclesial communion and the concessions 
offered by the holy father john paul ii

the supreme court today refused to kill a 
libel lawsuit against a tennessee congressman who criticized a 
legal services lawyer 
the court by a 63 vote let stand a ruling that rep don 
sundquist rtenn may be sued for statements he made in a news 
release and in a letter to the us attorney general 
justices sandra day oconnor harry a blackmun and byron r 
white voted to hear arguments in the case one vote short of the 
four needed to grant such review 
sundquist in january 1985 urged thenatty gen william french 
smith to investigate the memphis area legal services program and 
one of its lawyers wayne chastain 
sundquist said chastain was trying to undermine efforts by 
juvenile courts in the memphis area to collect childsupport 
payments 
chastain and other lawyers in the legal services program since 
1978 had been involved in a dispute in which they said juvenile 
court procedures to collect the payments were violating the rights 
of indigent parents 
in his letter to smith sundquist said the legal services 
program seems to be employing at least one attorney wayne 
chastain to do nothing but harass juvenile court officials 
sundquist said smith should investigate alleged 
irregularities and the possibility of the obstruction of the 
law 
chastain sued the congressman charging that the letter and a 
related news release defamed him 
a federal judge here threw out the suit but it was reinstated 
last november by the us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court in a 21 decision said sundquists 
statements were not covered by the constitutions speech or debate 
clause that shields members of congress from lawsuits arising from 
their official duties 
the speech or debate clause protects all lawmaking activities 
undertaken in the house and senate but affords no constitutional 
immunity beyond its carefully defined scope the appeals court 
said 
the appeals court relied heavily on a 1979 supreme court ruling 
that permitted sen william proxmire dwis to be sued over one 
of his socalled golden fleece awards 
proxmire had given one of the tongueincheek awards to a 
scientist who conducted governmentfunded research the senator said 
was a waste of taxpayer money 
the appeals court here said the proxmire case made it plain that 
members of congress do not enjoy absolute immunity from defamation 
suits 
the speech or debate clause provides members of congress with 
an immunity that is coextensive with their constitutional 
responsibilities the appeals court said 
when they move beyond the requirements of their legislative 
responsibilites they do so as volunteers and at their own risk 
however important their myriad other activities may be in the 
texture of contemporary political life the appeals court said 
the ruling was written by judge james l buckley a former 
republican senator from new york judge abner mikva a former 
democratic member of the house from illinois dissented 
sundquists appeal to the supreme court was supported by 
numerous news media organizations including the national 
association of broadcasters the american society of newspaper 
editors the national newspaper association the reporters 
committee for freedom of the press the society of professional 
journalists time inc and the washington post 
they told the justices if members of congress are forced to 
assess their risk of liability before they speak openly on issues 
of public concern the quality of public debate in which the press 
is an important participant will be impoverished 
the case is sundquist vs chastain 871756

city and community leaders are trying to reduce 
tensions between arab shopkeepers and their black neighbors in the 
wake of the shooting death of a black man and a series of store 
firebombings 
tempers have erupted since june 18 when a black man was shot and 
killed by an arab store clerk after the two quarreled and the black 
man later returned to the store with a shotgun and fired at a store 
display the clerk was charged with involuntary manslaughter the 
following night a crowd ransacked the store 
there also has been a rash of firebombing attacks in the black 
neighborhoods where arabs have businesses including one store set 
afire three times in as many weeks 
city council member helen knipe smith whose district includes 
the neighborhood said most of the groceries and delicatessens in 
the area are operated by arabs 
patricia blackmon the citys chief prosecutor has met with 
community groups in recent days to calm tensions she said concerns 
among blacks focus on food quality prices and a demand for more 
courtesy from shopkeepers 
the middle eastern shopkeepers including egyptians lebanese 
and palestinians have complained about thefts and police response 
time ms blackmon said 
mayor george voinovich said wednesday the city has increased 
health code violation inspections at the groceries which some 
black community leaders have complained are selling outdated items 
neither the proprietors of stores or any member of our 
community should take the law into their own hands voinovich 
said 
police have increased patrols in the neighborhoods said police 
spokesman detective robert bolton 
the tensions could be a perception problem or lack of 
information bolton said were trying to work with both 
groups 
in addition to extra police patrols near araboperated 
businesses police community relations specialists are working with 
community leaders on the problem bolton said 
we dont want it to escalate to anything if there are 
problems that have to be fixed thats fine he said 
mrs smith blamed tensions on a need by ghetto businesses to 
charge higher prices than large chain stores operating in the 
suburbs and a concern by arabs about crime 
these are the kinds of issues that are out there that have 
been there for 30 40 50 years as long as weve had black and 
minority neighborhoods mrs smith said

the supreme court today let stand the way 
cable television operators pay copyright royalties for 
retransmitting broadcast programming 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments that 
the the us copyright office is overcharging the cable industry by 
at least 40 million a year 
the payment system had been challenged by cablevision co a 
cable television operator in new york and new jersey and the 
national cable television association 
under the copyright act of 1976 cable television systems are 
entitled under a compulsory license to retransmit copyright 
broadcast programming to cable subscribers in return the cable 
systems must pay royalties into a copyright royalty tribunal for 
distribution to copyright owners who file claims 
failure to pay a governmentestablished fee by a cable operator 
retransmitting programs from overtheair television stations is 
deemed a copyright infringement 
each cable system must pay a fee equal to a specified 
percentage of the gross receipts for the basic service of 
providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast 
transmitters 
at issue in the dispute acted on today is the definition of 
gross receipts under the 1976 law 
cablevision sued in 1983 contending that the royalties fee 
should be based only on revenue from retransmission of local 
broadcast signals and not on revenue from cableoriginated 
stations such as espn and cnn and socalled superstations such as 
wtbs in atlanta and wgn from chicago that may be included in a 
cable systems basic service 
cablevision had been threatened by the motion picture 
association of america a group of copyright owners with possible 
infringement lawsuits for underpaying royalty fees 
the mpaa filed counterclaims contending that cablevision had 
infringed on the copyrights held by the associations members 
us district judge june l green here rejected the 
interpretation of gross receipts that was favored by the mpaa 
and had been adopted by the copyright office 
but the us circuit court of appeals here reversed the judges 
ruling last jan 5 the appeals court ruled that the copyright 
offices interpretation was entitled to judicial deference and 
ordered judge green to restudy the mpaas claims for higher royalty 
fees from cablevision 
in its supreme court appeal lawyers for cablevision argued that 
the copyright office lacks the authority to issue a binding 
regulation on how royalty fees should be calculated 
the national cable television associations appeal made the same 
argument 
the appeals said annual copyright royalties paid by the cable 
industry exceed 100 million and that the copyright offices 
regulation on calculating royaltyfee liability cost the cable 
industry an additional 40 million in this past year alone 
the federal communications commission recently approved a policy 
that could alter significantly copyright considerations for cable 
operators 
the policy would let local overtheair television stations buy 
exclusive rights to syndicated programs cable systems that 
transmit the same programs in a local stations viewing area would 
have to black out the shows or substitute other programs 
the cases are cablevision co vs motion picture association of 
america 871642 and national cable television association vs 
columbia pictures industries 871814

a man accused of murdering two of six 
kidnapped women he imprisoned in a basement house of horrors 
was attacked by two other inmates while a jury deliberated the 
charges against him officials said 
gary heidnik 44 suffered only bruises in wednesdays attack 
which occurred in a holding cell one floor above where the jury was 
meeting 
the guards told me he took the fetal position when they 
knocked him down and he didnt fight back said heidnicks 
attorney a charles peruto who argued in court that his client 
was insane hes upset but hes going to have to get used to it 
if he gets sent to a prison 
the jury wednesday spent 3 hours deliberating before common 
pleas judge lynne abraham sent them back to their hotel to get 
some rest and come back refreshed this morning the panel resumed 
work shortly before 9 am 
heidnik was arrested in 1987 after a captive escaped and alerted 
police he is accused of luring women to his basement where he 
chained them and raped them repeatedly in hopes of breeding a 
superior race 
he used a chain saw to cut up one corpse and then fed the 
remains mixed with dog food to the other women according to police 
and trial testimony the body of the second woman was found in the 
woods in new jersey 
heidnik and his assailants were together at lunchtime when he 
was punched several times said sheriffs office spokeswoman janet 
pina no charges against the men a murder suspect and a robbery 
suspect were filed 
on wednesday the judge took nearly three hours to outline the 
19 charges against heidnik to the jury and explained all the 
possible verdicts among them innocent by reason of insanity and 
guilty but mentally ill the charges included murder kidnapping 
rape aggravated assault and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse 
the panel was chosen in pittsburgh because the judge said 
pretrial publicity here hampered the selection of impartial jurors 
the prosecution said it would seek the death penalty if it gets 
a firstdegree murder conviction 
after wednesdays attack the judge advised sheriffs deputies 
to keep heidnik in a room designated for psychiatric prisoners and 
to try to keep him segregated 
it was the second time heidnik has been attacked since his 
arrest in march 1987 when one of his captive women escaped and 
brought police to the socalled house of horrors 
heidnik later tried to commit suicide and since then he has been 
kept in isolation and on a suicide watch

the vatican today announced the 
excommunication of archbishop marcel lefebvre and four bishops he 
consecrated 
a statement read by vatican spokesman joaquin navarro cited 
church law for the excommunications noting the prohibition on 
consecrating bishops without papal approval 
in such cases the excommunication is automatic requiring no 
formal act by the vatican only the pope can lift the sanction 
navarro said 
the statement made shortly after lefebvre carried out the 
consecrations in econe switzerland said it was a schismatic act 
carried out expressly against the wishes of the pope 
a schism is a formal rupture with the holy see 
excommunication puts a roman catholic outside the church and 
unable to receive its sacraments such as communion and extreme 
unction or last rites 
earlier this week lefebvres traditionalist movement challenged 
the excommunications claiming that church law permits such 
ordinations in an emergency 
the vatican said the only necessity in the case was raised 
by lefebvre to conserve an attitude of division in the catholic 
church despite the offers of communion and concessions made by the 
holy father john paul ii 
navarro said a statement would be issued in coming days on the 
position of lefebvres lay followers 
the communique identified those excommunicated as lefebvre and 
the four bishops bernard fellay bernard tissier de mallerais 
richard williamson and alfonso de galarreta 
brazilian prelate antonio de castro mayer bishop of campos 
assisted at the rites in econe navarro said the vatican was 
awaiting clarification on his role in the ceremony before making a 
decision on excommunication 
john paul carried out official duties as usual today including 
receiving five soviet journalists but lefebvres action provoked 
considerable bitterness at the vatican a symphonic concert 
scheduled for thursday evening was canceled to express deep 
pain over the schism 
the italian bishops conference immediately called for prayers 
for the pope 
archbishop albert decourtray of lyon and president of the french 
council of bishops said it is a day of mourning for the 
catholic church for all those who are attached to christian 
unity 
navarro has estimated that lefebvres traditionalist movement 
has 80000 to 100000 followers although other vatican officials 
have said as many as half a million lay people turn to his priests 
for various church functions 
navarro said the vatican plans to announce friday the legal 
position of the priests and lay supporters of lefebvre 
the vatican spokesman estimated that relatively few catholics 
incur excommunication and that many of the cases today involve 
catholic doctors who perform abortions however he noted that 
these are matters of individual conscience and no records are kept

the supreme court today rejected the appeal of 
a minnesota woman severely injured in a 1983 car crash turning 
away arguments that her cars manufacturer negligently failed to 
install airbags 
the justices without comment let stand rulings dismissing that 
portion of dr jan marie wickstroms productliability lawsuit 
against toyota motor corp and its us subsidiaries 
minnesota courts ruled that the national highway traffic safety 
act and federal regulations by implication bar such a claim 
because car manufacturers are allowed to install seatbelts and 
shoulder harnesses instead of airbags 
trial courts in other states also have ruled that car 
manufacturers cannot be held legally liable for not installing 
airbags 
but according to wickstroms lawyers some state trial courts 
including those in california massachusetts and pennsylvania 
have allowed noairbag claims to reach juries in similar cases 
this is an important question which has not been but should 
be settled by this court to assure justice and fairness to all 
tort victims regardless of the jurisdiction of the injury 
wickstroms appeal contended 
after robbing a minneapolis bank on march 31 1983 louis 
chapman fled from police by speeding the wrong way down interstate 
94 his fullsize 1973 pontiac crions 
leading airlines challenging californias antieavesdropping rule 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last november upheld a 
regulation adopted in 1982 by the california public utilities 
commission prohibiting the secret listening to or recording of 
telephone conversations by others 
a person wishing to listen in on a conversation must notify both 
parties to the conversation that it is being overheard 
the penalty for violating the order is termination of phone 
service 
the air transportation association of america and leading 
airlines sued in federal court to block enforcement of the 
regulation 
they said it interfered illegally with their monitoring of calls 
to ticket agents to assure agents are being courteous accurate and 
efficient the airlines listen in on from 1 percent to 2 percent of 
phone calls 
the airlines said the california ban affects interstate phone 
calls because they have telephone reservations facilities in 
california that take calls both from within and outside the state 
the 9th circuit court overturning a federal judges ruling 
said the airlines have not established any basis for the federal 
courts to interefere in the operation of the state regulation 
the airlines said californias rule violates provisions of the 
federal communications act banning unjust discrimination against 
any class of customers 
the airlines also said the state rule is preempted by the 1978 
airline deregulation act which bars states from regulation rates 
routes or service for the airline industry 
the airlines compared the california rule to a state roadblock 
that interferes with traffic on an interstate highway 
the case is air transportation association vs california public 
utilities commission 871859

vice president george bush said today that after 
eight years of republian rule in the white house some good people 
yearn for a change and thats why the gop ticket faces an uphill 
struggle 
its our job to let them know that this time in this case 
change and improvement come from the republican party bush said 
in remarks prepared for a gop fundraising luncheon 
the vice president the certain republican presidential nominee 
also accused liberals of champing at the bit to raise taxes 
again and said the trouble with the democrats in congress is 
that they havent learned to just say no 
bush praised the current economic recovery the longest 
peacetime expansion in history and took a swipe at economists for 
being pessimistic 
he said that as recently as 1986 60 percent of the members of 
the national association of business economics predicted a 
recession in 1988 
wrong wrong wrong bush said no wonder its called the 
dismal science 
referring to polls showing him in a tough race against democrat 
michael dukakis bush said its an uphill fight for our 
republican team this year after eight years of one party in the 
white house no matter how successful some good people yearn for a 
change hoping that change will mean improvement 
bush compared himself with former president harry truman noting 
that democrat truman too had been the underdog when he ran in 1948 
the crowds would yell give em hell and hed shout back 
i dont have to give em hell i just tell the truth and they 
think its hell bush said 
in the final analysis liberals promise compassion but they 
deliver misery bush said we promise hope growth and 
opportunity and we deliver hope growth and opportunity 
on wednesday bush criticized dukakis for illfounded ideas 
about the soviet union and arms control and he said it would be 
ridiculous to proceed with the nuclear weapons cuts dukakis wants 
at the same time bush spoke cautiously about the sweeping 
reforms advocated by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev including 
a redistribution of power in the soviet union 
bush said the changes would be revolutionary and 
historic if they were implemented 
however he said weve got to remember the cold war is not 
over in contrast to the upbeat tone adopted by president reagan 
after the moscow summit bush said the west should be prepared for 
a protracted conflict with the soviet bloc 
bush certain to be the republican presidential nominee 
stressed foreign policy in a speech wednesday in san francisco and 
in an interview on air force two as he flew back to washington 
he stopped in the farming community of marion wisto talk 
about the drought 
while announcing no new initiatives bush said i want to say 
that leave aside the politics of the moment and my ambitions for 
the fall what we want to do as a part of the administration is do 
as much as possible under the circumstances 
the vice presidents message wednesday was that dukakis who is 
virtually assured the democratic presidential nomination is weak 
on national security and foreign affairs and particularly fuzzy 
about why the soviet union has been willing to negotiate nuclear 
arms agreements 
dukakis has voiced opposition to the mx missile and midgetman 
missiles and also has said he would replace the administrations 
strategic defense initiative with a buildup in conventional forces 
he wants to do away with a lot of these systems and i think 
to negotiate an arms control agreement with the soviet union it 
would be ridiculous to do that bush said 
the vice president said it was the united states refusal to 
make unilateral concessions on arms that persuaded the soviets to 
sign an agreement to abolish us and soviet intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles 
bush said dukakis emphasis on conventional or nonnuclear 
forces leads you inextricably to the question is he proposing 
the winnability of a conventional war and leads you to ask the 
question what about the united states whats going to happen in 
defense of the united states 
the vice president said in fairness i dont know really what 
his approach is yet but if the conventional force buildup is his 
approach towards dealing with the soviet union i have a distinct 
difference with him

the supreme court today agreed to hear the 
appeal of a texas man sentenced to death who the justices were 
told has the reasoning capacity of a 7yearold 
the justices said they will study arguments that executing 
johnny paul penry for the oct 25 1979 killing of pamela 
carpenter would be cruel and unusual punishment banned by the 
constitutions eighth amendment 
penrys appeal also contended that his confession to police 
should not have been used as evidence against him because given 
his mental capacity it was not made voluntarily 
prosecutors said penry beat ms carpenter and then stabbed her 
repeatedly with a scissors at her home in livingston texas 
ms carpenter survived long enough to give police a description 
of her attacker 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals previously rejected 
penrys arguments and upheld his murder conviction and death 
sentence 
the case is penry vs mccotter 876177

acid rain is destroying vegetation in the tourist 
city of hangzhou and in the former capital of nanking official 
reports say 
acid rain has destroyed foliage and damaged ancient statues and 
stone tablets in the city of hangzhou the official china news 
service said in a report seen in beijing today hangzhou is in 
coastal zhejiang province 
in nanking capital of the nationalist government until the 
communist takeover in 1949 acid rain is also causing serious 
problems the report said nanking is in jiangsu province 
in may 1986 leaves of 400 snow pines planted in hangzhous 
parks and hotel grounds turned yellow and withered as a result of 
acid rain 
around hangzhous famous west lake stone statues and stone 
tablets bearing inscriptions by historical figures are being eroded 
by the rains as are stone buddha images at the monastery of the 
spirits retreat the citys bestknown monastery 
experts say the problem is caused by pollution from industries 
which burn lowquality coal that has a high sulphur content and by 
the citys thousands of boilers and tens of thousands of family 
coal stoves that release sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere the 
report said 
earlier news reports said acid rain is a major problem in 
sichuan province in southwestern china and neighboring guizhou 
province in the southern provinces of hunan and guangxi and in 
shanghai 
the problem is most serious in the south where the soil is 
basically acidic in the north the alkaline soil neutralizes the 
acid in the rain experts said 
china started its research into acid rain in 1981 and last 
september passed the countrys first air pollution prevention law

a brother and sister burned their 
filthy 70000 house which allegedly had a stronger odor than 
fresh asphalt rather than clean up garbage that had accumulated 
for years police say 
although the house owned by terry w key 41 and his sister 
barbara j key 54 was paid for and was not insured police said 
the two can be charged with willfully burning their own house a 
felony that carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison 
i think his temper got to him said officer cc perdue iii 
who questioned key on wednesday he just figured hey we cant 
clean it up theres no way to clean it up lets burn it up 
thats the way he was thinking thats strange 
perdue said key told investigators he doused the brick house 
with gasoline monday and set it afire key was treated for burns on 
his face ear and arms 
he said that he just wanted to get out of the neighborhood 
perdue said he didnt think about selling the house he didnt 
think about anything but just eliminating the problem 
although neighbors said they had been enduring the stench of the 
house for years the events that led to mondays fire began last 
friday when police investigated a complaint from a crew paving 
streets in the rural neighborhood 
the road crew told police they could smell the house through the 
odor of freshly laid asphalt 
perdue told the greensboro news amp record that he and another 
officer went to the house and found sewage soaking the back yard 
from a broken septic tank and mounds of garbage festering in ripped 
plastic bags under the carport 
when they opened the door you felt like you just wanted to go 
behind a tree or something it smelled so bad perdue said 
both had to kick the trash out of the doorway to get out they 
couldnt even open the door all the way 
the officers told the keys their house posed a health risk and 
that it must be cleaned up by monday or the forsyth county health 
department would be called to investigate 
perdue said the keys made excuses for the houses condition 
that his night job and her recent knee surgery had kept them from 
getting the garbage to the curb they had lived in the house for 
more than 20 years 
but this problem was building up for several years perdue 
said this didnt just happen 
gary almond who lives across the street said the keys house 
has been an odorous eyesore ever since he moved to the neighborhood 
in 1980 he said neighbors had called the health department many 
times seeking relief but got nowhere 
i dont understand how anyone could live in something like 
that he said they used to feed the cats inside and then throw 
the cans out the door the cans would be piled up on each side of 
the steps 
were going to try to charge them said agent curtis douglas 
of the state bureau of investigation it may have been their own 
property and they may not have had any insurance on it but the 
danger they created with that explosion and fire in a neighborhood 
with kids and everything we cant let that go 
the keys could not be reached for comment perdue said they had 
gone to live with a relative

a woman who was abducted from a convent by her 
family doesnt want to go back one of her brothers says however 
the spiritual leader of the convent said he doesnt believe it 
mary susan greve 22 took off her habit tuesday and mailed it 
back to the convent dave greve said from the familys home here 
wednesday 
one of their rules is that by taking off the habit it means 
you dont want to be a part of it she gave up wanting to belong to 
that order she didnt give up wanting to be a nun greve said 
but the spiritual adviser the rev clarence kelly said the 
order had not received any package or message from the woman known 
as sister mary cecilia 
i cant believe the kidnappers quite frankly kelly said in 
an interview in new york wednesday the only thing that disturbs 
me is for the family to impose what they believe on mary susan 
and do it illegally 
police in new york and ohio have been looking for the woman 
since her father james and brothers dave mark and john pushed 
her into a waiting car sunday as she walked with two nuns on a 
street near st joseph novitiate convent in roundtop ny in the 
catskill mountains 
new york state police have said they would not press charges 
unless the woman wants to file them it was the second time miss 
greve had been abducted by her family 
dave greve said his sister and parents were at a catskills 
motel which he would not identify when he left them tuesday he 
said he did not know when they plan to return to cincinnati 
sister mary cabrini the orders secretarygeneral and senior 
sister arrived in cincinnati on wednesday to try to contact the 
womans family she said she spoke with the fbi 
we are sincerely concerned about our sister she said we 
want to establish she is safe and free we have to know it from 
her and thirdly we want to establish that this will not happen to 
anyone ever again or nobody will be safe 
the st joseph novitiate convent calls itself a traditionalist 
roman catholic convent said the rev michael a farano chancellor 
of the roman catholic archdiocese of albany ny however he said 
it is not recognized by the catholic church its services are in 
latin and it has rejected all of the teachings of the second 
vatican council of the 1960s 
john greve said the family opposed his sisters decision to 
become a novice at the convent after the family broke with a 
traditionalist catholic church in the cincinnati suburb of 
sharonville 
dave greve said the family abducted his sister because of the 
familys suspicions of kelly kelly heads an ultratraditionalist 
catholic sect called the society of st pius v which broke from 
the traditionalist catholic society of st pius x in 1983 
miss greve first joined st josephs in september 1986 in 
april her mother drove to the convent and tricked her into getting 
into the car then brought her back to cincinnati the convents 
mother superior persuaded miss greve to return to the convent 
dave greve said his sister still wants to become a nun and that 
the family is searching for a convent for her to join

the archdiocese of seattle plans to take over 
sponsorship of a mass for gay catholics from dignity a group that 
opposes traditional church teaching on homosexuality it was 
reported today 
announcement of the change to take place about aug 1 was 
expected today the seattle postintelligencer reported it was 
negotiated during the past year the newspaper said 
dignity has been forced out of churches in several cities 
including new york and san diego since a 1986 vatican letter 
labeled all homosexual activity a sin and said even a tendency 
toward homosexuality is an objective disorder the directive 
warned bishops not to support any group that condones homosexual 
activity 
the change was expected to be announced today in the form of an 
edict from archbishop raymond hunthausen and coadjutor archbishop 
thomas murphy 
the seattle change would follow the lead of cardinal joseph 
bernardin who earlier this month took similar steps in chicago 
his solution to the dignity dilemma was initially hailed by gay 
activists as an acceptable alternative to an outright ban of the 
group from church property but the issue has since split chicagos 
homosexual catholic community 
mass for homosexuals was never formally sanctioned by the 
seattle archdiocese but the groups presence at st joseph church 
was approved by the parish council and supported by a large number 
of the clergy religious and laity 
that tolerance figured prominently in the vaticans decision to 
discipline hunthausen who in 1983 delivered on videotape the 
welcoming address at dignitys national convention in seattle and 
permitted the group to celebrate mass at st james cathedral 
although archdiocese officials declined to provide details of 
its ministry to homosexuals the newspaper quoted sources as saying 
that the rev gerald stanley pastor of st edward parish would be 
coordinator 
characterizing negotiations between the church and dignity as 
painful and frustrating one priest who didnt want his name 
published said many dignity members are struggling to determine if 
they can accept the archbishops decision and still maintain their 
integrity 
dignity a national support group with more than 100 chapters 
has sponsored mass sacraments educational and social programs 
and has worked for equal rights for homosexual catholics for more 
than 20 years according to the organizations statement of 
purpose homosexuals can express their sexuality in a morally 
responsible way 
soon after hunthausen addressed dignitys 1983 convention he 
became the target of a papal investigation and eventually was 
stripped of much of his authority 
hunthausens authority has been restored but ending dignity 
sponsorship of the mass at st joseph apparently was a condition 
set by the commission of us bishops appointed to supervise the 
seattle church 
the commission has until october to make its final report on 
hunthausen who was criticized for encouraging a climate of 
permissiveness

there wont be any rockets red glare or bombs bursting in air 
this fourth of july in many droughtdevastated communities across 
the midwest plains and south where tinderdry conditions have 
sparked fears of a conflagration 
scores of towns and counties in iowa ohio illinois missouri 
kansas indiana nebraska north dakota south dakota and tennessee 
have canceled or limited independence day displays of rockets 
sparklers and other fireworks 
right now is not the time to be shooting fireworks said 
dwight barnett a spokesman for the state forestry division in 
tennessee where authorities are encouraging localities to save 
it for the rain 
were creatures of habit and were used to shooting fireworks 
on the fourth of july but this fourth of july is different 
theres a high degree of risk out there barnett said 
restrictions vary and are widespread in some states with some 
officials wavering because of recent rain in north dakota one of 
the most droughtravaged states 19 of 53 counties have banned the 
use and or sale of fireworks while the danger remains 
indiana gov robert orr announced today that he had banned 
unsupervised fireworks displays on state properties such as parks 
and urged hoosiers to attend supervised public displays he said he 
had wanted to declare a complete ban on private fireworks during 
the holiday weekend but that state law was so complex such a 
restriction would likely be unenforceable 
in wisconsin gov tommy thompson signed an order tuesday 
banning private fireworks displays local governments and the state 
may make exceptions and community displays are exempt if they take 
fire precautions 
things are so dry that we are seeing grass and brush fires in 
cities and villages thompson said we have to do what is right 
and necessary to protect lives and property 
the national safety council also issued a warning monday saying 
fireworks which are linked to 11000 to 12000 injuries each year 
will be even more dangerous this year because of parched forests 
and fields 
in tennessee a fire that scorched three to four acres at 
lavergne on tuesday night was blamed on fireworks more than 150 
firefighters were called to fight the blaze 
we think it was possibly started by juveniles shooting 
fireworks said john goodrum a rescue worker we found a lot 
of bottle rockets 
though the bans have prompted a few lawsuits the head of a 
fireworks group said he doesnt oppose the restrictions if they 
make a decision their local conditions are that bad were 
certainly not going to take issue said john conkling executive 
director of the american pyrotechnics association 
however he said cancellations will be a blow to the 170 
millionayear industry which has about 80 percent of its business 
tied to the holiday 
fireworks companies are very likely to be additional 
casualties of the drought conkling said it very likely will 
have impact on every fireworks company in this country 
the largest in the nation zambelli fireworks internationale 
said this is the first time in 40 years drought has affected 
business the midwestern states are backing out the fastest 
george zambelli sr said wednesday 
some towns have planned alternative celebrations or have 
postponed events the chicago suburb of addison will have a 
fireworks show in september independence mo and hoffman 
estates ill are planning laser light shows 
other towns going ahead with fireworks are taking special 
precautions in champaignurbana ill for example workers at the 
university of illinois stadium will water the area heavily before 
july fourth and firefighters will stand by erecting sandbags to 
prevent stray sparks from catching fire 
iowa state fire marshal wilbur johnson is advising towns that if 
they proceed with fireworks shows they should make sure a firetruck 
is standing by 
but even with safety measures some officials say fighting a 
fire would further deplete water supplies and conditions are just 
too risky 
i dont know who would take the responsibility if anything 
happened said dennis ballou fire chief in exira iowa 
everything is so dry now lawns are so cracked it hurts to walk

the american medical association today approved a 
package of policies designed to help check the spread of aids 
including a recommendation that states begin tracing the sex 
partners of people infected with the deadly virus 
the nations largest doctors organization also renewed its call 
for mandatory testing of all prison inmates to see if they are 
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes aids 
the ama adopted a similar prisontesting proposal last year and 
reapproved it today despite objections from several doctors that 
it would accomplish little and cost too much 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal incurable 
disease primarily spread by sexual intercourse and sharing 
contaminated hypodermic needles 
on wednesday the amas house of delegates policymaking body 
for the organization of 295000 doctors moved to offset the 
nations severe nursing shortage by testing a new class of bedside 
hospital worker 
the delegates also approved two major policies calling for a new 
direction in the nations war on drugs and an overhaul of the 
governments medicaid insurance program for the poor 
the decisions by the house of delegates were made by voice vote 
to deal with the shortage of nurses the amas governing board 
of trustees will develop pilot programs for training new 
registered care technologists to handle chores like taking 
vital signs and bathing patients 
the technologists would receive from two months to 18 months of 
training and work under the direction of nurses handling such 
chores as changing bandages making beds and dispensing some 
medications 
the american nurses association strongly opposed the proposal 
contending the answer to the nursing shortage is to raise salaries 
and improve working conditions not create a new category of worker 
i really am appalled that in the face of opposition from all 
of organized nursing that medicine has gone ahead with this 
decision to test the creation of a new category of caregiver 
said judith ryan executive director of the group which represents 
188000 nurses 
ms ryan contended that the new technologists wouldnt have 
enough training and would duplicate the work of nursing assistants 
licensed practical nurses and technical registered nurses 
ama leaders lashed out at the nursing officials for failing to 
fill out their ranks and turning people away from the profession by 
working to require all nurses to have fouryear college degrees 
its a bankrupt policy declared dr william hotchkiss who 
completed his term as ama president wednesday theres a shortage 
of 300000 nurses in united states hospitals at this time and that 
is expected to double by the turn of the century 
in calling for major changes in the war on drugs the delegates 
said real progress will only be made by shifting the attack 
from catching smugglers to treating abusers 
the policy recommends that the federal government expand 
treatment programs ease regulations to permit private doctors to 
treat opiate addicts with methadone and beef up drug education 
programs aimed at adolescents 
shifting their attention to another pressing social problem the 
lack of medical care for the poor the ama policymakers proposed 
creating uniform nationwide eligibility standards for medicaid and 
uniform payments for medical care 
the delegates voted to lobby the federal government to create 
the standards and expand medicaid to cover 27 million more poor 
people at an increased annual cost of 24 billion at 1988s 
spending levels 
the program administered by state governments now covers an 
estimated 19 million poor people at a projected cost of 52 billion 
in 1988 
also wednesday dr james e davis a surgeon from durham nc 
was sworn in as ama president in his inaugural speech davis 
proposed that county and state doctors associations organize and 
staff free of charge medical ombudsman offices to serve the 
public 
they will receive the publics questions concerns 
suggestions and recommendations about health matters and follow 
through on consumer complaints he said

on a lawn where their predecessors 
traded musket fire us and canadian soldiers today honored 28 
american servicemen who died during the war of 1812 in the first 
repatriation ceremony between the two nations 
although the repatriation and burial of the servicemen is more 
than a century and a half overdue they are being treated as if 
they died only yesterday said lt col robert trotter 
this is the day these men waited 174 years for said 
trotter they are coming home 
us and canadian military details stood by as cannon saluted the 
fallen men 
fort erie mayor heinz hummel told the crowd of about 500 that 
the soldiers sacrifice paved the way to an undefended border 
between the two nations 
their death was the beginning of our peace he said 
the remains of the servicemen were discovered during a 
construction project in fort erie in october 1987 and taken to a 
toronto laboratory for study 
archaeologists were able to determine that the skeletons were 
american but could not come up with individual identifications 
they are believed to have been killed during a british siege on an 
american position at snake hill in 1814 
george hees canadian minister of veterans affairs transferred 
possession of he remains to thomas niles us ambassador to 
canada saying there can be no finer expression of the good 
relation between our countries than the reverence we show for these 
men 
before the ceremony an honor guard of us and canadian 
soldiers stood vigil over the 28 caskets draped with american 
flags and lined up in rows on the lawn at old fort erie in the 
early morning chill 
though the bones are being treated with reverence now the dead 
were given a hasty burial at the time said ronald williamson head 
of the team in charge of the excavation the soldiers dodged 
british artillery and patrol attacks to bury the soldiers in 
separate but unmarked graves 
the victims ranged in age from midteens to about 40 and at 
least 12 of the men showed evidence of severe injuries presumably 
from musket or cannon fire williamson said 
after the ceremony 28 hearses carried the caskets over the 
peace bridge into buffalo they were to be buried at bath national 
cemetery in steuben county 
the ceremony marked the beginning of the annual friendship 
festival between the united states and canada which celebrates 
continuous peace between the two nations since 1814 
we could not ask for a more symbolic gesture said patrick 
mines a festival organizer from fort erie

secretary of state george p 
shultz today pledged continued us support to this central 
american nation but he expressed concern about an increase in 
politically motivated killings of civilians 
during a fourhour visit shultz signed a 125 million balance 
of payments agreement he urged the couuntry to reject the 
challenge of the guerrillas and their communist allies 
they dont want democracy they dont want freedom shultz 
said in a statement shortly after his arrival from guatemala he 
planned to fly to honduras from el salvador 
after a meeting with acting president rodolfo castillo 
claramount shultz conferred with commanders of the salvadoran 
armed forces 
us officials said shultz expressed concern about an increase 
in killings of civilians to an average of 34 a month last year 
the average was 27 civilian slayings each month 
the administration is worried that a major setback in human 
rights performance could jeopardize congressional support for us 
aid to el salvador the country is receiving 400 million in 
economic and military aid this year 
speaking of the leftist insurgency shultz said they want to 
achieve with bullets the power that the people of el salvador 
refuse to give them by the ballot 
in guatemala on wednesday night shultz set the tone for his 
fournation central american journey by contrasting nicaraguas 
performance with that of the regions democracies 
he said the democratic countries have been making political and 
economic progress with us help while hopes raised by nicaraguas 
1979 revolution had given way to repression and stagnation and 
deepening misery 
the economy is a bust shultz said ideology is plentiful 
but milk is rationed the standing army has grown from 6000 to 
80000 men 
shultz signed a 75 million balance of payments support 
agreement with guatemalan officials and met with president vinicio 
cerezo cerezo is now in his third year as the countrys first 
elected civilian president since 1970 
while criticizing nicaragua shultz said the picture is 
different elsewhere in the region 
in the last decade three countries guatemala el salvador 
and honduras have each made significant progress more than most 
believed possible he said 
ten years ago costa rica was central americas only 
democracy today nicaragua is central americas only 
dictatorship 
despite shultz upbeat assessment el salvador and guatemala 
both face potential instability there have been signs of military 
unrest in guatemala and the political situation in el salvador is 
becoming increasingly polarized 
shultz said us support will continue for central americas 
democracies regardless of who wins the us presidential election 
in november because the policy enjoys bipartisan support 
shultz returns to washington on friday night after a visit to 
costa rica 
shultz said his visit is not focusing on administration plans to 
seek additional aid for the rebels fighting nicaraguas leftist 
government 
in his lengthy arrival statement wednesday night shultz made 
only scant reference to the rebels perhaps reflecting the 
guatemalan governments steadfast coolness to the contra cause 
under questioning from reporters during his flight here shultz 
acknowledged that the military effectiveness of the contras has 
lessened substantially since us military aid ended in 
february 
he accused the sandinistas of compiling a record of evasions 
and noncompliance in negotiations dating back to the 1979 
revolution 
the sandinistas he said continue to support subversion in 
neighboring countries 
theirs is not a record of honest negotiations it is a record 
of negotiations corrupted by the sandinistas efforts to destroy 
those who do not agree with them he said 
negotiations between the sandinistas and the contras broke down 
earlier this month and no new talks have been scheduled each side 
has blamed the other for the breakdown of the negotiations over an 
end to their 6yearold war

a courtappointed overseer should take over the 
illinois department of children and family services because 
officials of the childcare agency are leaving thousands of young 
people at risk according to a lawsuit 
the suit filed wednesday in federal court by the american civil 
liberties union on behalf of 14000 wards of the state charges 
that the department is overburdened and often houses youngsters in 
overcrowded violent shelters or sends them to foster homes where 
they are abused 
thousands of them wards are consigned to a life of drift 
disruption and despair according to the lawsuit 
the department had to deal with 91715 abuse complaints last 
year up 30 percent from the previous year officials said the 
1988 total is expected to be higher 
department director gordon johnson named as the defendant said 
a lack of money is the problem 
i am in charge of the department and the buck stops here 
johnson said but i am not the one who appropriates money to the 
department or raises money in taxes that is for the legislature to 
do 
he said that despite shortcomings the department is one of 
the best agencies in the country 
johnson also disputed the need for appointment of an overseer 
is the federal overseer going to bring federal dollars he 
asked 
the lawsuit charges the agency with violating the childrens 
constitutional rights of due process and equal protection under the 
law 
aclu attorney benjamin wolf said the agencys shortcomings were 
the result of 10 years of gov james thompsons cruelty 
thompson is not named as a defendant 
wolf said the fourterm governor has consistently failed to 
provide sufficient funds to manage the agency and other human 
services and has never asked for enough money to address the needs 
of the children in his care 
dave fields a spokesman for the governor in springfield said 
today that mr wolf is engaged in demagoguery 
the fact is that the governor has given dcfs money to vastly 
increase the network of child abuse reporting in this state over 
the last 10 years this year under the tax increase proposal he 
submitted dcfs would have gotten 48 million more than the 334 
million it got this year 
thompson declared his tax increase proposal dead tuesday because 
of opposition in the legislature 
johnson said appropriations for his agency have increased by 
100 million since he took over in 1983 
the lawsuit contends caseworkers routinely have three times the 
number of cases the department itself considers manageable that 
staffing at state facilities is short of adequate levels that the 
agency does not have enough foster homes in which to place 
children and that the agency does not make adequate attempts to 
reunite families 
wolf said the departments shortcomings have long been apparent 
but johnson never addresses serious problems until they appear on 
the front page 
we respond to childrens needs not newspaper stories 
johnson said 
wolf said the lawsuit was unusual but warranted 
we only do something like this he added when the whole 
system has collapsed

romania ordered hungarys cultural center 
in bucharest closed and told the embassy to leave the building a 
hungarian diplomat said today 
the move was the latest in a diplomatic war prompted by 
hungarys contention that romania is mistreating ethnic hungarians 
who live within its borders 
in budapest premier karoly grosz said tensions between the two 
countries were only temporary and that he still intended to visit 
romania as planned 
grosz was invited to visit romania as government leader before 
he was appointed party leader last month the visit will be the 
first to romania by a hungarian communist party chief since 1977 
no date has been set 
i am convinced that if we dont talk to each other we cannot 
understand each other grosz said speaking through an 
interpreter 
the hungarian foreign ministry summoned the romanian acting 
charge daffaires and expressed its regret at romanias 
expulsion of hungarian diplomats 
relations between the two soviet bloc neighbors have been 
strained for years over what hungary maintains is romanias 
discrimination against the 17 million ethnic hungarians in 
romania bucharest has accused hungary of interfering in its 
internal affairs 
on tuesday in an unprecedented action involving two warsaw pact 
allies romania ordered hungarys consul general in the 
transylvanian city of cluj to leave the country and declared the 
consulate closed 
the romanian foreign ministry told the hungarian embassy on 
wednesday that the cultural center which never opened to the 
public must be vacated within 48 hours the diplomat said in a 
telephone interview from romanias capital 
both decisions apparently came in retaliation for a rally monday 
night of about 50000 hungarians in budapest who protested 
romanias plans to destroy 7000 romanian villages including 
hundreds of hungarian communities 
romanian communist leader nicolae ceausescu was angered over 
what he said was hungarian government support for the protesters 
who filed past the romanian embassy he hinted in a speech tuesday 
that he may order the hungarian missions operations scaled down 
hungarian newspapers and government officials said the 
villagedemolition scheme would destroy the 17 million hungarians 
cultural heritage in the romanian province of transylvania 
romanian officials said the villages to be razed by the year 
2000 would be replaced by modern agriculturalindustrial centers 
and remove differences between country and city dwellers 
the decision to open cultural centers in bucharest and budapest 
the hungarian capital was made in 1977 at a meeting between 
ceausescu and former hungarian party chief janos kadar 
hungary rented a bulding in downtown bucharest where it planned 
to open the center complete with a library and a projection room 
but romania never used its reciprocal right to do the same in 
budapest and has not said why 
the hungarian cultural center was never issued a permit to start 
operation the diplomat said in recent years the building was used 
as a storage for the hungarian embassy 
the united states france west germany czechoslovakia great 
britain and italy have received permission and opened similar 
centers in bucharest in the past 20 years

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that forced a defense contractor to pay damages for an onduty 
accident involving a navy pilot 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by grumman 
aerospace corp ordered to pay 840556 to the pilots family who 
died when his plane crashed off the california coast in 1979 
the courts action comes just three days after the justices 
ruled that government contractors enjoy sweeping legal immunity 
from personal injury lawsuits 
in mondays ruling the court said contractors cannot be sued if 
they designed the equipment according to government specificiations 
and notified the government about any hazards they knew about 
it appears a federal appeals courts ruling in the grumman 
aerospace case focused on the navys lack of notification about any 
hazards 
the death of navy lt gary s shaw of fort lauderdale fla was 
blamed on a design defect in grummans a6 plane the plane crashed 
within seconds after taking off from the aircraft carrier 
constellation about 100 miles off the coast of san diego 
navy investigators said the most likely cause of the crash was 
the loss or failure of a bolt in the planes system for controlling 
its upanddown movement 
although the a6 is the mainstay of the navys carrierbased 
attack fleet there have been at least six other accidents 
involving the planes flight control mechanism since the 1960s 
in 1981 shaws father edwin lees shaw sued over his sons 
death 
last december the 11th us circuit court of appeals upheld the 
840556 jury award against grumman 
the appeals court said military contractors in such cases are 
not exempt from liability 
grumman contended that forcing it to pay undermines the 
militarys independence and violates the separation of powers by 
giving courts too much power 
but the appeals court said although the navy did formally 
approve grummans a6 specifications and design changes that 
approval did not constitute the sort of informed military decision 
to accept the risk of a dangerous product to which this court must 
defer under separation of powers doctrine 
in such cases the appeals court said the defense contractor 
has more information about risks and the military may simply be 
working in the dark 
the appeals court added our central concern is whether or not 
the military actually made a decision to use a product that it knew 
to be dangerous to servicemen 
since the military was not sued by the shaw family it was up to 
grumman to prove it followed very specific orders in designing the 
a6 the appeals court said adding that the company failed to do 
so 
grumman had argued that allowing monetary damages in such 
lawsuits would undermine servicemens confidence and give comfort 
to enemies of the united states 
if anything persuades pilots to tremble and the enemy to 
rejoice it will be the a6s accident record itself not this 
courts recognition of it the appeals court said 
in the appeal acted on today grummans lawyers said four other 
federal appeals courts have disagreed 
most of the nations defense industry joined in support of 
grumman arguing the 11th circuit court ruling undermines military 
independence 
but lawyers for the shaw family said the companies were trying 
to deceive the supreme court into believing the government was the 
defendant in the case 
neither the united states nor the navy are on trial they 
said 
the high court has ruled that members of the armed services may 
not sue the government over injuries suffered in connection with 
their military service 
the case is grumman vs shaw 851529

french television stations will be limited to 
showing two films a week in prime time in a bid to boost attendance 
at movie houses the government announced thursday 
culture minister jack lang said on frances annual cinema 
day that he also would be putting together an emergency plan 
to provide 12 million for promoting films and movie houses 
the culture ministry said in a statement that the heads of 
frances six television networks had agreed to cut back film 
broadcasts during the primetime hours from 830 pm to 1030 pm 
regulations giving the limit the force of law are being drawn up 
it is a first step and other measures will have to be taken 
to assure a new balance among the media the statement said 
the networks currently are forbidden from showing movies in 
prime time only on wednesdays and saturdays some channels have 
scheduled films on the other five nights 
the french are the most active moviegoers in europe but cinema 
admissions have been falling in recent years as film buffs stay 
home to watch tv 
bernard vidal spokesman for the national federation of cinema 
halls said about 500 movie houses have closed since january 1987 
he said the proliferation of movies on tv was the prime culprit 
with 1300 films broadcast last year 
this situation without precedent in france does not have an 
equal anywhere in the world he said 
on cinema day an annual event started in 1985 anyone who buys 
a single cinema ticket at full price can then go from one movie to 
the next all day long paying just one franc about 16 cents per 
ticket

two laotian tribesmen who became us citizens 
were sentenced by a judge to learn english and study american 
heritage and culture following their convictions on battery charges 
i recognize that they came from a different society and a 
different culture and one that unfortunately experienced violence 
on a daily basis cook county circuit judge michael jordan said 
during sentencing tuesday 
ching xiong 71 who had been mayor of a laotian village and 
his son bravo xiong 38 were accused of beating a man in a 
disagreement on an expressway ramp 
the xiongs had wanted the judge to allow a tribal test of truth 
in which both parties tell their side of the story and then drink 
water containing rooster blood 
in the march 1987 incident the xiongs stopped their car on a 
ramp after michael speropulous 23 of chicago honked his cars 
horn at them several times because their car cut his off 
authorities said 
prosecutors say the elder xiong who was convicted of battery 
held speropulous while the younger xiong who was convicted of 
aggravated battery hit speropulous on the head with a metal bar 
the xiongs claimed they acted in selfdefense but five 
witnesses backed up speropulous 
a northwestern university professor who testified on the xiongs 
behalf called the sentence the ultimate outrage 
they came to this country with no resources stripped of their 
land and money said dwight conquergood they have suffered 
enough 
the xiongs who are hmong tribesmen were wounded in the vietnam 
war fighting on the side of the united states they left laos in 
1975 and lived in a refugee camp in thailand for five years before 
moving to chicago 
bravo xiong said at trial that the rooster blood test works 
because it is believed that a person who drinks the blood after 
telling a lie soon will die usually in hmong standoffs the liar 
does not drink the water he said 
assistant states attorney cathy crowley said the younger xiong 
should have been sentenced to jail 
you dont take a tire iron or a locking device to someones 
cranium because you dont appreciate them honking their horn she 
said 
in addition to the cultural education jordan sentenced the 
father to a years court supervision and sentenced the son to two 
weekends in jail and 600 hours of community service and placed him 
on 30 months probation

fled when a network of alarms was activated 
guerrillas have blown up the countrys main oil pipeline 79 
times since last year diaz said his troops captured 90 pounds of 
dynamite 
the pipeline carries 215000 barrels of oil daily from the cano 
limon field to port covenas on the caribbean the guerrilla attacks

the lower house of parliament today overwhelming 
approved the governments decision to accept 72 us f16 fighter 
jets being evicted from their base in spain 
the chamber of deputies in a secret ballot voted 298196 with 
24 abstentions to back the plan to move the jets to crotone in 
the puglia region of southern italy 
in his appeal to the legislature before the vote foreign 
minister giulio andreotti called acceptance of the fighter wing a 
decision in tune with the politics of peace that our country has 
always pursued 
italys government on june 4 announced that it had accepted a 
nato request to accept the jets which spain has had at the orrejon 
air base spain has decided that the jets must go within three 
years 
a coalition of communists italys secondlargest party and 
smaller leftist groups had opposed accepting the jets but premier 
ciriaco de mitas fiveparty coalition has a comfortable majority 
in parliament 
the vote on whether to accept the jets came on the oppositions 
request 
the opposition has also asked for a vote in the senate but no 
date has been set for it the government coalition also has a 
majority in the upper house 
the coalition had viewed keeping the jets in the mediterranean 
an essential key to guaranteeing security in natos southern flank 
opposition parties in the lower house argued on wednesday 
during the first day of debate that italys acceptance of the 
planes would upset the strategic balance between east and west and 
hamper efforts to ease tensions between the two blocs 
andreotti addressed those concerns today saying that the f16 
issue certainly has not damaged the relations between our 
government and moscow he noted that soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze in recent talks with italian officials did 
not raise the subject 
andreotti told the chamber that basing the planes at crotone 
would serve to keep the balance between nato and warsaw pact forces 
outside parliament several members of the small leftist 
proletarian democracy party including one parliamentarian joined 
by members of communist party youth groups and some independent 
peace activists demonstrated peacefully against the basing of the 
missiles the italian news agency ansa reported

some health experts suspect dust from construction 
sites that filters into air conditioning systems may cause 
legionnaires disease a magazine reported thursday 
the magazine new scientist quotes christopher bartlett a senior 
epidemiologist at the communicable diseases surveillance center as 
saying the air conditioners could be sucking up dust which 
neutralizes the sterilizing agents in the cooling systems and 
converts them into food for the bacteria that cause the disease 
it also quoted patrick osullivan a specialist on building 
hazards from the welsh school of architecture as saying there were 
construction sites near 90 percent of the buildings where outbreaks 
of legionnaires disease occurred 
the governments health and safety executive called the theory 
a bit farfetched linda allen of the institute of 
environmental health officers told the magazine that in large 
cities like london everyone is near a building site 
the report came a month after an outbreak of the disease at 
british broadcasting corp headquarters in london in which two 
people died 
it quoted bartlett as saying engineers should make frequent 
checks of cooling systems whenever building activity is going on in 
the area 
the government has reacted to the threat of legionnaires 
disease by issuing stricter guidelines to engineers these require 
weekly checks of cooling systems at hospitals

two soviet cosmonauts from the mir space station 
took a walk in space today to repair a telescope but were unable to 
complete the job after more than five hours the tass news agency 
said

station for five hours and 10 minutes trying to replace a detector 
unit on an xray telescope the telescope is on the kvant orbiting 
observatory which is attached to the mir 
tass later said the work was incomplete and would have to be 
resumed later it was unclear whether the unit was replaced or what 
work remained to be done 
the cosmonauts left the mir station at 933 am tass said it 
said they had some problems unfastening the clasp holding the 
detector unit to the telescope 
tass said a new detector would permit the telescope to be used 
for a longer period 
the cosmonauts made a similar walk on feb 20 to replace a solar 
battery that walk lasted four hours and 25 minutes 
titov and manarov took over from cosmonaut yuri romanenko on 
dec 21 when they blasted off from the central asian cosmodrome 
romanenko returned to earth on dec 29 after a space endurance 
record of 325 days

a judge today blocked implementation of a new 
georgia law that bans nude dancing at businesses serving alcohol 
13 hours before it was to have gone into effect at midnight 
superior court judge luther alverson granted a temporary 
restraining order sought by operators of the gold club of atlanta 
which contended the law is so broad it could be applied to 
theaters art museums hotels motels and even private homes 
alversons 16page ruling stresses that the order was issued 
strictly to give him time to hold further hearings but he added 
that he believed the gold club would win the lawsuit because the 
ban violated georgias constitution 
alverson agreed that federal court rulings may support the ban 
but said the court finds that the general assembly of the state 
of georgia lacked the power to enact the ban and it is 
therefore unconstitutional under the georgia constitution 
he also ruled that the gold club may be able to prove that the 
law is too broad and therefore violates even federal law 
supporters of the ban had relied heavily on rulings giving the 
state widespread control of liquor laws but alverson said other 
rulings had undermined some of that authority restrictions will 
not pass constitutional scrutiny if the result is to eliminate 
totally the activity he said 
while the record is not complete on this issue the gold 
club may be able to show that by restricting the activities 
prohibited through the liquor laws of this state the result will 
be to eliminate totally the activities which are otherwise 
protected by the united states constitution 
in fact some might argue that the true purpose is not to

the supreme court today agreed to study 
alleged race discrimination in alaskan salmon canneries setting 
the stage for an important sequel to a onedayold ruling that 
makes it easier for workers to prove their bosses are guilty of 
illegal bias 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by two companies 
based in washington state and oregon that operate canneries in 
alaska 
the court will review a ruling that the companies must stand 
trial on bias charges by nonwhites primarily filipinos alaskan 
natives and asians who say they are relegated to the lowestpaying 
jobs 
a ruling by the justices is expected sometime in 1989 
by an 80 vote wednesday the justices said employees can use 
statistical evidence to prove that some subjective decisions made 
by their employers violate federal law the court reinstated a suit 
by a black woman who charged a texas bank with discrimination 
but only four justices in the texas case agreed on how difficult 
it should be to prove with statistics that subjective decisions 
are illegally discriminatory 
justice anthony m kennedy the newest member of the court did 
not take part in reviewing the texas dispute 
by agreeing to study the alaskan cannery case the justices will 
have the opportunity to elaborate on some of the guidelines it 
provided wednesday their eventual ruling could have widespread 
impact for jobbias claims 
nonwhites charged discrimination against wards cove packing co 
inc of seattle wash and castle amp cooke inc of astoria ore 
the companies operate salmon canneries in remote areas of alaska 
during the summer salmon run 
the nonwhites said that while they hold nearly half the jobs at 
the canneries the jobs are racially stratified with whites 
dominating in the higherpaying positions such as machinists 
carpenters and administrative slots 
the nonwhites also said that discrimination is so pervasive 
that mess halls and bunkhouses are racially segregated 
even the salmonbutchering machine at one of the canneries has a 
name with racial overtones the iron chink they said 
but lawyers for the cannery companies said any racial divisions 
are caused by legitimate businessrelated reasons they said for 
example that most of the higherpaying jobs require skill and 
prior experience that it is difficult for the nonwhites to acquire 
because they are seasonal workers from remote regions of alaska 
moreover the companies lawyers said the lower paid cannery 
workers are hired through a union which is primarily nonwhite 
the companies said statistics showing nonwhites hold most of 
the seasonal cannery worker jobs should not be allowed as proof of 
discrimination the companies said what is relevant is that they 
hire for the higherranking positions from a labor market that is 
only 10 percent nonwhite the companies said they have filled 
those better jobs with more than 20 percent nonwhites 
a federal judge ruled in favor of the companies in 1983 but the 
9th us circuit court of appeals reinstated the bias suit by the 
nonwhites last september 
the appeals court said statistics showing a concentration of 
nonwhites in the lowerpaying jobs can be used as evidence of 
discrimination in the better jobs the appeals court also gave the 
nonwhites broad leeway to cite a host of company employment 
practices to support their discrimination claims placing a heavy 
burden on the company to disprove those claims 
for example the nonwhites said the firms are guilty of 
nepotism hiring relatives for the better jobs the federal judge 
who ruled in favor of the companies said any nepotism was 
permissible because those hired had greater skills and were not 
given jobs because they are relatives of other employees or bosses 
but the 9th circuit court in reviving the suit said the 
companies must prove that any nepotism was a business necessity 
the case is wards cove vs antonio 871387

the withdrawal of vietnamese forces 
from cambodia has conjured fears of a comeback by the dreaded khmer 
rouge one of the most brutal regimes of modern times 
although it has been nearly a decade since the khmer rouge were 
toppled by the vietnamese invasion there is a fear in southeast 
asia of a reprise of their 197578 reign of terror in cambodia 
according to some estimates up to 3 million people died 
one has to be either naive or an idiot to believe that the 
khmer rouge in the 80s can be different from the khmer rouge of 
the 70s prince norodom sihanouk cambodias former leader said 
recently 
having been both their prisoner and their ally few outsiders 
know the khmer rouge as well as sihanouk 
similar apprehension is being voiced in the now bustling capital 
of phnom penh whose citizens died by the tens of thousands in a 
forced march into the countryside during the khmer rouge rule 
and somewhat ironically alarms are being sounded in countries 
that in recent years have called for the withdrawal of the 
vietnamese and tried with considerable success to brand hanoi an 
international pariah because of its late 1978 invasion of cambodia 
we cannot preclude the possibility that a vietnamese 
withdrawal might create conditions in which the khmer rouge could 
return to power said us rep stephen solarz dny and 
chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on asia 
solarz recently described a khmer rouge comeback as morally 
unthinkable and politically unacceptable and called for an 
international conference to face this dilemma 
there have been other proposals such as holding internationally 
supervised elections disarming warring parties and creating a 
united nations peacekeeping force to prevent khmer rouge domination 
of a postwar cambodia 
i would like people to know who really is the obstruction to 
peace in cambodia the vietnamese or the khmer rouge said former 
thai prime minister and elder statesman kukrit pramoj 
thailand has been a vocal opponent of hanoi and allows chinese 
arms to flow through its territory to the khmer rouge 
such concern was set off by hanois partial withdrawal thursday 
of some of its 50000 troops vietnam apparently with some soviet 
urging has promised to pull out all its remaining forces by 1990 
and said it would enter talks to find a political solution to the 
protracted conflict 
in the absence of a vietnamese military shield the 
35000member army of the peoples republic of kampuchea would be 
left alone to face the threeparty coalition of the khmer rouge and 
two noncommunist groups khmer peoples national liberation front 
and sihanouks followers 
despite hanois claims that the phnom penh regime can stand on 
its own virtually all western analysts regard its army as 
substandard 
western analysts and the two coalition partners themselves have 
pointed out that the khmer rouge have done little fighting but have 
stockpiled much weaponry in recent months the conclusion drawn is 
that the guerrillas are trying to put themselves in the strongest 
position possible in the event of a ceasefire 
china the prime backer of the khmer rouge is key to their 
future although denying recent american newspaper reports that it 
was prepared to grant asylum to the top khmer rouge leaders says 
beijing appears ready to show some flexibility on the cambodian 
issue the us state department says 
some analysts speculate that if peace comes the khmer rouge will 
have difficulty retaining their rank and file who may rally to the 
side of sihanouk 
still widely popular the 65yearold sihanouk has been 
cambodias king head of state and nominal chief of a front which 
included the khmer rouge that fought the usbacked phnom penh 
government in the 197075 war 
after victory sihanouk became a prisoner of the khmer rouge 
who released him as vietnamese troops moved into cambodia so he 
could plead the countrys case before the world community 
during their rule khmer rouge leaders turned cambodia into a 
vast labor camp and charnel house 
by conservative estimates hundreds of thousands were killed 
phnom penh says three million perished schools were closed 
buddhist temples destroyed all private property was abolished and 
millions were forced to labor in the fields on nearstarvation 
diets 
the top khmer rouge leaders including pol pot ieng sary and 
khieu samphan reverted to being guerrillas after the vietnamese 
invasion and admitted only to some mistakes during their rule 
they claimed to have renounced communism 
the khmer rouge dropped the harshest aspects of their rule but 
human rights groups and defectors have consistently reported severe 
punishments in areas of the thaicambodian border under their 
control 
the united nations recently said it might cut off aid to a 
second khmer rouge border camp because its leaders have blocked 
outside aid efforts and reportely prevented refugees from being 
evacuated for medical treatment 
a un official cited bizarre violations of human rights

the supreme court agreed thursday to 
grant a retrial in the case of an air force officer whose spying 
conviction was based on circumstantial evidence 
his attorney said he was confident the court would clear the 
officer lt col bertil stroberg who maintained he was innocent 
stroberg completed half his sixyear sentence and was released 
on parole in 986 
stroberg said he was doing a favor for an acquaintance when he 
went to a post office to pick up a letter indicating he offered to 
sell military secrets to poland 
the letter was planted by police who earlier were alerted to a 
spy operation by another letter sent to the polish embassy 
containing military secrets and offering more information for 
payment 
there was no direct evidence that stroberg had written the 
letter to the embassy nor that he had delivered it said his 
lawyer ulla jacobsson 
the 1983 case received notoriety in part because stroberg 
continued to receive 90 percent of his military salary while he was 
in jail

conditions for a political solution to the 
long cambodian conflict have improved with a vietnamese troop 
withdrawal and plans for discussions among all sides in the 
conflict later this year in indonesia administration officials 
said thursday 
recent events in indochina suggest reasons for being 
cautiously optimistic about ending the seemingly intractable 
conflict in cambodia said karl d jackson deputy assistant 
secretary of defense for east asia 
jackson and david lamberston a deputy assistant secretary of 
state for the region cited the withdrawal of 50000 vietnamese 
troops from cambodia that began this month and the prospect for 
informal talks among cambodian factions vietnam and other 
interested parties in indonesia in late july 
we do not expect concrete decisions to result from these 
initial talks but we believe that they reflect increasing momentum 
in the direction of a political settlement of the conflict 
lamberston told the house foreign affairs subcommittee on east asia 
both officials reiterated us concern that the withdrawal of 
vietnamese occupation troops could create an opening for the 
resumption of power by the khmer rouge which was responsible for 
the genocide of more than a million cambodians in the 1970s under 
the ruthless leadership of pol pot 
also testifying at the hearing was kitty dukakis wife of the 
apparent democratic presidential nominee massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis mrs dukakis asked for a greater us commitment 
to improving the lives of the 300000 or more cambodian refugees 
now living in camps along the thaicambodian border 
living conditions in the camps have deteriorated she said 
residents have no space in which to grow fresh vegetables and the 
60 percent of their inhabitants who are children have no place to 
play rapes and brutality have increased and thai officials are 
failing to provide adequate security she said 
while some education is available to the refugee children it is 
of poor quality mrs dukakis added it is a tragic loss of the 
future of cambodia we must provide a sense of hope

with a new plan intended to bring peace and reconciliation to my 
country 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said after sabimvi spoke 
with reporters that generally speaking reagan supports 
savimbis plan fitzwater did not go into detail 
in a speech to the national press club following his white house 
meeting savimbi listed the four points of the plan 
us military assistance should continue for unita as long as 
the soviet union and cuba continue to provide military assistance 
to the angolan government his guerrillas are battling 
the united states should maintain contact with the governments 
of angola cuba the soviet union and south africa to force the 
withdrawal of all foreign troops from angola as soon as possible 
the united states and key african states should promote a 
dialogue between unita and the angolan government to discuss the 
formation of an interim government leading to free elections 
the united states and african countries should obtain 
agreeement from both unita and the angolan government on a date for 
free elections 
the united states says cuba has about 45000 cuban troops in 
angola backing that nations marxist government savimbis unita 
organization receives about 16 million in us aid including 
shoulderfired antiaircraft missiles a year 
savimbi who has said he is satisfied with the us aid said he 
did not mention the subject to reagan 
but he said he did support ussponsored negotiations between 
the angolan government south africa and cuba intended to gain the 
withdrawal of the cuban troops as well as south african soldiers 
who support savimbis guerrillas 
many us civil rights leaders oppose savimbi because of his 
south african support democrats in congress are calling for a new 
ban on us aid to unita

were joined later by abernathy and the black republicans who 
included charles evers mayor of fayette miss and maurice 
dawkins candidate for the senate in virginia

people of america and the world and white people of goodwill and 
all mankind in his effort to bring peace to angola 
before coming to washington this week savimbi toured the 
southern united states in an effort to build support in 
predominantly black churches

a government watchdog group on thursday urged 
members of the house taxwriting committee to reject a proposal to 
give lawmakers a bigger deduction on their homes 
this action would enhance preferential tax treatment for 
members of congress that is available to no other taxpayer said 
fred wertheimer president of common cause a group which advocates 
higher ethics standards in goverhment 
we strongly urge you to resist any efforts to repeal or 
increase the deduction for living expenses for members of 
congress he said in a letter sent to committee members 
ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill has 
proposed to repeal the current 3000 limit on deductibility for 
members washington living expenses as part of a plan allowing 
higher congressional salaries in exchange for banning acceptance of 
speaking fees 
the committee is currently drafting a catchall bill of changes 
to the 1986 income tax law and could include rostenkowskis 
proposed tax break in that legislation 
rostenkowski argues that his plan would treat lawmakers in the 
tax code the same as businessmen and women who travel frequently 
wertheimer said that argument was false since washington becomes 
the normal residence for most lawmakers 
because of this special provision members of congress 
are eligible to take business deductions for what are actually 
the normal everyday costs of living at home wertheimer said

scientists today began innoculating an 
acre of corn stalks in the first field test of a genetically 
engineered microbe designed to combat the european corn borer one 
of agricultures most destructive pests 
although researchers have conducted other experiments of 
genetically altered materials in the environment the tests of 
cxcbt at the federal experimental station here are the first 
approved of a genetically altered plant vaccine scientists and 
federal officials said 
proponents of the crop genetics international project call the 
testing a step toward an era of chemicalfree pest control 
the companys chief scientist peter carlson said today he 
hoped cxcbt will have the effect of making the corn borer sick 
but he said the main purpose of the test is to determine whether 
the pesticide will spread from plant to plant an undesireable 
effect 
the microbe works by attacking the alkaline stomach of corn 
borers giving them ulcers it doesnt affect humans because 
peoples stomachs are acid and are unaffected by the bt protein 
according to researchers in previous experiments in petrie dishes 
and in a greenhouse the microbe killed the borers in the petrie 
dishes and sickened them when tested in the greenhouse 
the pest costs american farmers 400 million annually 
critics worry that cxcbt experiment could set a precedent and 
are concerned that genetically engineered materials could spread 
uncontrollably once released into the environment 
environmental groups including the national audubon society and 
the environmental defense fund did not oppose the limited field 
tests begun today 
environmental experts said if their questions about spreading 
are answered with more tests they may support the final product 
the crucial question for environmental groups is whether there 
will be adequate testing and regulation because cxcbt is just the 
beginning of a rush of dozens perhaps hundreds of similiar 
products said maureen hinkle the audubon societys director of 
agriculture policy 
only one other genetic crop protector a microbe altered to 
fight frost has been approved for field testing by the us 
environmental protection agency 
jeremy rifkin president of the washingtonbased foundation on 
economic trends said the pesticide hasnt been shown to work in 
greenhouse tests 
rifkin said today his organization did not oppose todays test 
because this product doesnt work it does not kill corn borers 
the companys evaluation data supplied to the epa shows the 
product does not kill the insects it poses no immediate threat 
because it doesnt work

in 1976 a knot of dissident teamsters agitating 
against multiple salaries jet air fleets and other abuses by some 
union leaders were showered with verbal abuse by union president 
frank fitzsimmons 
twelve years later the teamsters for a democratic union is a 
minority party within the giant union with its own constitution 
bylaws and annual conventions tdu goals were echoed by the reforms 
the federal government sued this week to try to force on the 16 
millionmember international brotherhood of teamsters 
the 11000 members of tdu have won little more than abuse and 
busted heads for their efforts 
at the teamsters convention in 1976 in las vegas nev dock 
worker peter camarata representing the fledgling tdu urged 
changes from the convention floor he was met with jeers power was 
cut to his microphone and he later was beaten up at a convention 
party 
in 1983 a crowd loyal to current teamsters president jackie 
presser shoved its way into a romulus mich hotel where the tdu 
was meeting they trashed the meeting room but missed the 
dissidents who slipped out a side door 
tdu influence may be wider than its 11000 members according to 
frank depirro a national organizer of the detroitbased group he 
said he mails about 50000 copies of the groups 10timesyearly 
newsletter convoy dispatch of which he is editor 
in the us justice department suit filed this week the 
government proposes taking over the union and setting up direct 
election of officers 
if you beat your head against a stone wall for long enough 
either your head gets bloody or the wall gets a chink in it maybe 
this is a little bit of both said washington attorney arthur 
fox who represents the tdu 
the tdu agrees that direct elections are needed but depirro 
said the rank and file doesnt trust the government to run the 
union 
fox said tdu grew out of a meeting of truck drivers sponsored in 
1971 by consumer advocate ralph nader who urged members to 
petition the government for protections their union did not provide 
such as limits on driving hours 
in 1976 fox and a law student published teamsters democracy 
and financial accountability a book that rocked the union with 
accounts of officers drawing two three or more salaries abuses of 
the union jet fleet and widspread nepotism 
fox treasures a tape of a radio interview that year in which 
fitzsimmons berated him and the 6000 teamsters then in the 
dissident group 
frank fitzsimmons called me lots of names he said we 
werent fit to sweep the floors of the teamsters union fox said 
camarata voiced the tdus positions at the 1976 convention 
proposing direct election of officers and limiting officers to a 
reasonable salary not to exceed 100000 
then as now top union officers were chosen through a delegate 
system that put power in the hands of 16 regional vice presidents 
they make up the convention said camarata now a driver for a 
detroit trucking company 
when i went down there i walked into a total snake pit he 
said they are just not open to any kind of opposition they just 
hated my guts 
camarata was shouted down on the floor of the convention later 
at an international executive board party he was jumped and beaten 
up camarata left the convention under the protection of hotel 
security guards 
at the teamsters next convention in 1981 tdu members nominated 
camarata for union president i got about 10 votes he said

feminists and lawmakers launched a new drive 
thursday to add an equal rights amendment to the constitution 
vowing to introduce the measure as soon as the 101st congress 
convenes in january 
my dream today is that 1989 will be the last time they swear 
in a president of the united states under a constitution that does 
not treat women as equals rep patricia schroeder dcolo told 
about 300 people at a capitol rally sponsored by the national 
organization for women 
schroeder and rep don edwards dcalif said they will 
introduce the new era next year with the backing of the house 
democratic leadership and according to edwards even some 
republicans who have seen the light 
schroeder said petitions containing hundreds of thousands of 
signatures collected by now members across the country would be 
delivered to appropriate house delegations in order to build 
advance support for the new era bill 
now scheduled the rally for june 30 because the most recent 
drive for the era ended on that day in 1982 when an insufficient 
number of state legislatures had met the deadline for ratifying the 
measure 
women wearing green tshirts that said put women in the 
constitution cheered as sen dennis deconcini dariz and a 
string of house members exhorted them to keep era alive 
watch out all of you era is coming all the signs are 
here said edwards chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee 
on civil and constitutional rights 
edwards cited the congressional override of president reagans 
veto of a major civil rights bill earlier this year and the house 
vote wednesday in favor of a fair housing bill that bans 
discrimination against families with children he also cited the 
gender gap afflicting the republican party and suggested it 
stems from gop opposition to the era 
the era says that equality of rights under the law shall not 
be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on 
account of sex other sections of the brief amendment give 
congress the power to enforce it and say it shall take effect two 
years after ratification

the united states offered a reward of up to 
500000 thursday for information leading to the apprehension and 
punishment of the killers of navy capt william nordeen the 
american defense attache in athens greece 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said it was the 
largest sum offered since a 1984 law authorized rewards to catch 
terrorists 
information received will be handled confidentially and the 
identities of the informants will be protected mrs oakley said 
the amount of the reward will be determined by the value of the 
information received 
a greek organization called november 17 has claimed 
responsibility for planting a bomb that killed nordeen as he drove 
to work tuesday in an article published in a greek newspaper the 
group said it would attack more americans until the us military 
presence in greece ends 
a team of agents from the fbi and state department has gone to 
greece to aid authorities in the investigation 
five previous terrorist attacks against americans have generated 
reward offers but no claimants have ever come forward mrs oakley 
said 
theres always a first time in a situation like this she 
said 
offering rewards is a wellestablished practical tool for 
aiding in the investigation of criminal activities the 
spokeswoman said the rewards also may have the effect of helping 
to disrupt some terrorist activities since those who are planning 
terrorist attacks can never been sure who among them might take 
advantage of the offer 
the rewards also show the us governments resolve to combat 
terrorism and to continue to work on this case she added 
the state department offered rewards of up to 250000 in the 
case of the bombing of a trans world airlines plane over greece in 
1986 the hijacking of a twa flight on which navy diver robert 
stethem was murdered in 1985 the hijacking of a kuwaiti plane on 
which two employees of the us agency for international 
development were killed and in the seizure of the italian cruise 
ship achille lauro an american leon klinghoffer was killed in 
the ship takeover 
a 100000 award was offered for information in the case of four 
us marines and two civilians shot in el salvador in june 1985

military investigators today 
examined debris of two jet crashes that killed an american pilot 
and destroyed three us air force f16 fighter planes in one day 
a newspaper report said cracks were found in the engine blades 
of some f16s and were the likely cause of the crash of one of the 
jets in april 
the accidents wednesday brought to five the number of f16 
fighter jets that have crashed in west germany in the past three 
months 
a leader in chancellor helmut kohls coalition government called 
for the immediate grounding of f16 fighter jets stationed in west 
germany 
if the f16 which has recently piled up a number of crashes 
has a technical fault it must be temporarily grounded said 
werner hoyer a military expert and member of the free democratic 
party 
the air force said in a statement later that it had halted all 
routine flight operations to prepare for a safety day on friday 
to review all flying ground and weapons safety operations 
the statement made no mention of the f16 crashes 
two of the jets collided in the air wednesday and a third 
crashed and exploded in the black forest 90 minutes earlier 
tracy burnett a spokeswoman for the 50th tactical fighter wing 
at hahn air base said one pilot was killed after the f16s 
collided during a training maneuver near this small town about 35 
miles west of frankfurt 
burnett identified the dead pilot as capt michael a crandall 
30 his hometown was not available 
the pilot of the other aircraft ejected to safety before his 
plane plunged into a field and exploded he was identified as capt 
robert mccormack 31 of delmar calif 
mccormack was being treated for minor back and neck injuries at 
an air force hospital in wiesbaden she said 
no one was injured in the crash in the black forest 
following crashes of f16s in march and april the west german 
defense ministry asked that the singleengine jets be grounded 
however us air force european commander gen william l kirk 
said at the time the move would be premature before determining 
what caused the crashes 
in a report from its washington bureau the militarys 
unofficial stars and stripes newspaper said today the us air 
force had replaced the engines of 31 f16 jets because of 
potential cracks in highspeed engine blades 
it said blade cracks found in some general electric f110 engines 
that are used in some f16s were the likely cause of an april 
18 crash near erzberg west germany 
citing an interview with general electric co spokesman bill 
schumann the newspaper quoted him as saying the erzberg crash was 
caused by an engine problem and as far as i know that engine 
problem was believed to have been caused by one of these blade 
cracks 
the newspaper said the air force had found cracks in several ge 
f110 engines and as a precaution 23 engines were removed in 
europe and eight from planes in japan and korea 
lt col ed neunherz spokesman for the us air force european 
headquarters at ramstein air base declined immediate comment on 
the cracked blades or possible grounding of the f16s following the 
latest crashes 
a us army oh58 observation helicopter crashed into lake 
starnberg in bavaria on june 14 critically injuring the pilot and 
killing the copilot 
on june 9 a us army helicopter crashed after hitting power 
lines near a busy highway in bavaria state killing the threeman 
crew 
a british chinook helicopter on may 6 hit a loading ramp with 
its rear rotor at the hanover air show throwing debris over a wide 
area and killing two people on board twelve people were injured on 
the ground 
on april 18 a us air force f16 crashed near an ammunition 
depot and hospital south of trier near the luxembourg border the 
pilot was slightly injured when he ejected 
on march 31 a us air force f16 crashed into the town of 
forst north of karlsruhe killing the pilot and a resident 
the crash came one day after a french military mirage jet 
fighter crashed in southern bavaria near a nuclear power plant

an entry this year he said it could still be the largest but 
it might be five feet shorter than last year 
the drought creates problems for michigans 9 to 19yearold 
4h youth program exhibitors who entered 3704 swine 3615 cattle 
and 2919 sheep in county fairs last year said ken geuns 4h 
livestock youth specialist at michigan state university 
feed corn and hay prices are rising in anticipation of short 
harvests out in droughtstunted hayfields geuns said a lot of 
people are harvesting whatever forage they can 
but many of the youths have no hayfields he said where its 
going to affect the kids right now is in terms of buying feed a 
reasonably high percentage of the kids their families are not 
fulltime farmers 
geuns said about 200 head of cattle were entered in the recent 
michigan youth all breed beef and sheep show at ionia down 50 from 
last year 
the show may have lost exhibitors to a competing show in 
maryland he said but i think some of it was due to the 
weather 
many youths may have to put off their fall or early winter 
purchases of cattle to fatten for next years exhibits geuns said 
with a month before the aug 1 deadline for entering livestock 
in the state fair joanne schwedt of the fairs entries office said 
registrations particularly of heatsensitive swine seem to be 
trailing last years 
part of the problem is general schwedt said its no secret 
farmers are not doing well the fewer farmers the fewer exhibits 
there are 
but she said farmers who do want to enter probably are waiting 
for a break in the heat 
its extremely expensive to bring your animals down to the 
state fair to show them in these weather conditions they just 
wont do it she said and the vegetables will be hurt i dont 
think you will see a lot of big pumpkins and so on 
malburg raised his sunflowers and his wife pam raised last 
years largest pumpkin 182 pounds on a oneacre plot on the 
180acre farm of joes parents in romeo 
their plot with potential prize pumpkin plants squash and 
indian and other decorative corn varieties gets some special 
treatment said malburgs mother clara we have it right by our 
house here weve been keeping it going with the sprinkler from the 
house 
but that is no substitute for a wet summer she said 
its so windy and dry and hot that even if you irrigate the 
next morning its gone

a steelworker harangued government leaders 
thursday for their failure to deal with ecological problems he said 
have reached the level of a chernobyllike catastrophe 
veniamin a yarin a middleaged mill operator at a huge steel 
mill in the ural mountains was one of several delegates to the 
nationwide communist party conference who raised the problem of the 
environment either at the rostrum or in written suggestions to the 
forum 
but yarins speech hit home particularly hard because he comes 
from the city of nizhny tagil 10000 of its 403000 inhabitants 
took to the streets earlier this year to protest pollution caused 
by two 45yearold cokeburning furnaces at a steel mill 
soviet media accounts in april quoted a crying woman at the 
demonstration demanding who will answer for 54 stillborn 
children in 1987 
yarin dramatized his plea for urgent action by telling the 5000 
delegates that an old bolshevik had told him to go before this 
weeks conference and sing a line from a popular song where pigeons 
fly over town roofs 
at our works weve long had no pigeons we dont even have 
crows yarin said we look up at the sky and we are horrified 
but city inhabitants were just as shocked when they studied the 
text of a national government resolution for action to clean the 
air in their town 
our hair stood on end at how little action was going to be 
taken he said 
yarin said he believed there were 50 to 100 cities in the soviet 
union where ecological damage had become a serious health threat 
he demanded an immediate government resolution on a group of these 
cities and funds to resolve their problems within two years 
im not afraid to say that this problem has reached the level 
of a chernobyllike catastrophe yanin said referring to the 
explosion and fire at a ukrainian nuclear plant on april 27 1986 
that led to at least 31 deaths 
a 14 billion program was launched to clean up the contamination 
caused by the accident and to rehouse an estimated 135000 people 
who were evacuated 
environmental problems have a huge social resonance yanin 
said they should be discussed at this conference 
also thursday the communist party chief of the central asian 
republic of uzbekistan addressed one of the nations most serious 
ecological catastrophes the drop in the water level of a vast 
inland sea the aral sea 
a newspaper account in 1983 said excessive tapping of the sea 
for irrigation in central asia had halved its depth in a decade and 
caused its shoreline to recede 40 miles in just a few years 
that account was ahead of its time in sounding the alarm on 
ecological problems which in the past two years have received 
increasing attention in the media and from intellectuals 
in 1986 an active campaign by wellknown writers led the ruling 
politburo to overturn a potentially catastrophic decision to 
reverse the flow of several northwardflowing rivers to the arid 
south for irrigation 
but the media still are full of ecological horror stories like 
the one from nizhny tagil in december the communist party daily 
newspaper pravda quoted intellectuals in the urals city of ufa as 
saying their city was no longer fit for human habitation because of 
chemical pollution 
all three baltic republics have brought written resolutions to 
the conference about the urgent need to deal with ecological damage 
in their areas

arab students threw stones and smashed 
windshields during protests in jerusalem on thursday and 
authorities shut down seven palestinian schools 
a 17yearold arab was shot and wounded in a clash with soldiers 
during a funeral in the occupied west bank 
an arab teenager shot by soldiers two weeks ago died in a west 
bank hospital bringing to 213 the number of palestinians killed 
since the intefadeh or uprising began dec 8 four israelis 
also have been killed 
in jerusalem prime minister yitzhak shamir told reporters that 
israel was closer to the end of the uprising against the 
21year occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
dozens of high school girls staged rockthrowing protests in 
several parts of arab east jerusalem and police responded with 
tear gas israel radio reported it said several car windshields 
were smashed and two girls were arrested 
two male students were arrested after throwing stones at police 
from a high school in the walled old city the radio said it said 
police closed the dar el aytam school 
in the west bank the army closed six schools following violent 
protests in the past few days against the israeli occupation said 
olivier rafowicz spokesman for the military government in the west 
bank 
rafowicz said thursdays closures brought to 38 the number of 
schools shut since june 6 when classes on the west bank resumed 
after a fourmonth suspension that began in february 
if the disturbances are not going to be stopped we will be 
forced to close all the schools and we will not allow students to 
take final exams rafowicz said 
the army shut down more than 1000 schools in the west bank on 
feb 2 israeli officials had hoped that the reopening of schools 
in the west bank would help restore normal life in the area 
in the west bank city of nablus on thursday soldiers shot a 
17yearold in the left leg officials at al ittihad hospital said 
soldiers opened fire when youths some wearing masks threw 
stones and tried to incite a riot among people taking part in a 
funeral of a heartattack victim an army spokesman said one youth

washington institute for near east policy he said the army 
reported a drop in the past few days in violent incidents in the 
west bank and gaza 
asked if the uprising was at an end shamir replied i cant 
determine that there is no doubt that we are getting closer to the 
end 
shamir told the american group that the uprising wasnt about 
land at all 
the experience of the last few months should have taught all 
that the problem is not of territories but of arab refusal to 
recognize the legitimacy and permanence of the state of israel 
he said 
shamir repeated he saw no reason to negotiate with the plo 
because they oppose peace with israel 
a magistrates court sentenced four israeli leftists to 
sixmonth jail terms for violating a law that forbids contact with 
the plo they were the first israelis sentenced under the 1986 law 
the four were convicted june 2 in the court in ramle near tel

costinesti romania in november 1986 the jails terms were 
postponed until aug 4 to allow an appeal

palestinians accused of taking part in a clash with hikers from a 
jewish settlement a 15yearold israeli girl was killed in the 
april 6 clash in the west bank village of beita 
the incident caused a furor among israelis after jewish settlers 
said the villagers shot the girl tirza porat but an army 
investigation later determined she was accidentally shot by one of 
the guards accompanying the hikers 
among the charges against the arab defendants are 
stonethrowing causing serious bodily harm making threats and 
trying to seize and conceal the weapons of the two guards

automatic rifles attacked a leftist university president thursday 
the second attempt against him in seven months police said three 
bodyguards were killed 
the educator five aides and a pedestrian were wounded but none 
seriously police said 
the ambush occurred as nemesio prudente and his party approached 
the campus of the governmentrun polytechnic university of the 
philippines 
no group claimed responsibility the first attack in november 
was blamed on rightwing extremists 
this second attempt on the life of dr prudente is brutal 
brazen and contemptible president corazon aquino said in a 
statement read by spokesman teodoro benigno she ordered a speedy 
solution 
shortly before the attack three suspected communist urban 
guerrillas shot and killed a policeman in the manila suburb of 
malabon 
sen ernesto maceda chairman of the senates defense committee 
criticized police for failing to maintain order in the capital 
which has been rocked in recent years by killings blamed on 
leftwing and rightwing extremists 
it seems easy for anybody to shoot and kill anybody in this 
country maceda said 
police said prudente and his aides were ambushed as they 
approached the university campus at 845 am the group was 
traveling in a van followed by a security car 
four gunmen waited for prudentes party to pass under a concrete 
bridge and then opened fire with grenades and automatic rifles 
police said two others acted as lookouts police said

the son of former prime minister menachem begin 
and former un ambassador benjamin netanyahu were among the 
parliamentary candidates chosen thursday by the main faction in the 
rightwing likud bloc 
the political newcomers in the herut party election won more 
votes than most of the veterans in prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
cabinet including industry minister ariel sharon and deputy 
premier david levy 
herut is the senior partner of shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
which shares power in a shaky alliance with the leftleaning labor 
party also in the likud is the liberal party 
herut was founded by begin as an outgrowth of his etzel 
underground militia that fought the british rulers in palestine in 
the 1940s 
the results of the secret balloting by 2092 central committee 
members do not determine the place any of the 35 candidates will 
hold on the party list for the november election 
the nominees will be ranked july 7 with shamir assured the top 
spot only about 30 of the nominees are likely to be elected 
but the showings made by netanyahu and benjamin begin meant they 
were likely to be ranked high they also boosted shamirs standing 
in his fractious party while dealing a blow to his rival sharon 
during the convention at a country club in herzliya north of 
tel aviv many of the 104 candidates used americanstyle gimmicks 
to attract the attention of the central committee members 
candidates showered delegates with buttons stickers balloons 
wine and perfume campaign methods new to israel 
it also was an attempt to keep up with the labor party whose 
convention earlier this month was marked by carnivalstyle antics 
netanyahu and begin among 14 new faces on the partys list are 
expected to enhance likuds chances of defeating the labor party 
which elected a slate of young new candidates earlier this month 
shamir pleased by the results told reporters we have an 
excellent list which will also give the public incentive to vote 
for us 
pollsters predict a close race between the two parties and the 
latest survey shows labor with a slight edge of likud 
begin a 44yearold geologist is the first offspring of an 
israeli prime minister to enter politics successfully 
begin said his victory showed party members were repaying his 
father with extraordinary love 
his father a recluse since he resigned in 1983 issued a 
statement broadcast on israel army radio saying he was happy with 
his sons victory 
the younger begin became active in the party shortly after his 
father resigned but refrained from declaring himself a legislative 
candidate until just before the convention 
netanyahu 39 and son of a cornell university professor spent 
most of his teenage years in the united states he went to high 
school in philadelphia and studied business administration at the 
massachusetts institute of technology 
he made arab terrorism a chief target of his speeches in his 
four years as un ambassador he stepped down this year to run for 
parliament 
it is very flattering to see this kind of support a beaming 
netanyahu said on israel television 
netanyahu won the highest number of votes with 1408 
iranianborn moshe katsav a labor minister in shamirs cabinet 
was second with 1324 while begin finished third with 1233 
sharon came in fifth levy seventh 
in the balloting committee members had to cast votes for 21 of 
the 104 candidates the top 35 made the slate but only about 30 
have a realistic chance of being elected to parliament 
under israels electoral system voters choose a party not 
individual candidates the party is apportioned seats in the 
120member parliament according to the number of votes it gets

the government has renewed its offer 
of general amnesty for tamil rebels if the dominant militia agrees 
to surrender its weapons and stop fighting for a separate homeland 
a communique said thursday 
the government also promised to free all tamil political 
prisoners in jails and military detention camps more than 600 
tamils are believed still in custody 
in addition it pledged to complete arrangements for an election 
for a new regional council in tamildominated areas by the end of 
july the council would give tamils a greater voice in their own 
affairs 
according to reports the dominant rebel group the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam is close to an agreement with india to end 
the 5yearold insurgency for a separate homeland in north and east 
sri lanka 
if the tamil militants would lay down arms and support the 
indosri lankan agreement the detenus will be released and all 
tamil militant groups would be granted general amnesty and would be 
allowed to return to the mainstream of the democratic process 
said the statement issued by the presidential secretariat 
the statement appeared aimed at assuring the tigers that the 
terms of the peace accord would be carried out despite the tigers 
intransigence 
the peace accord brokered by india was signed july 29 1987 
by president junius r jayewardene and indian prime minister rajiv 
gandhi it included amnesty for the guerrillas and a pledge to 
release all prisoners 
the tigers at first accepted the accord but later resumed 
fighting the sri lankan government withdrew the amnesty promise 
and india moved an estimated 50000 troops to the island to put 
down the insurgency 
talks between the tigers and members of the indian research and 
analysis wing an intelligence branch of the indian government 
have been under way in recent weeks in southern india 
the top indian diplomat in sri lanka high commissioner jn 
dixit was called to new delhi last weekend for talks with gandhi 
on the negotiations with the tigers dixit returned to colombo on 
wednesday and briefed jayewardene according to officials at the 
indian high commission or embassy 
the statement issued by the government thursday said that gandhi 
informed jayewardene that the tigers militia has given 
indications of their williness to lay down their arms and cooperate 
in the implementation of the indosri lankan agreement 
it gave no clues on when a final deal with the tigers might be 
reached 
tamils are mostly hindus and make up 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million population they claim they are discriminated against by 
the majority sinhalese buddhists who control the government 
militant tamils began fighting for an independent homeland in 
july 1983 authorities have said at least 8000 people have died 
india became involved because it is the dominant power in south 
asia and its own 60 million ethnic tamils are sympathetic to their 
sri lankan brethren

a pentagon spokesman today rejected 
congressional proposals to freeze the award of new contracts and 
said drastic action could raise costs cause layoffs and detract 
from the readiness of the armed forces 
the spokesman fred hoffman said he was unaware whether any 
documents involved in the pentagon bribery probe had been destroyed 
in the defense department but that the department was looking into 
such allegations 
people implicated in the investigation have destroyed documents 
on at least two occasions in the past two weeks according to 
prosecutors who say making key information public would trigger a 
coverup by major felons 
in the short time since the execution of the search warrants 
became public june 14 the government has already become aware of 
several incidents of destruction of documents related to this 
case us attorney henry hudson who is coordinating the probe 
said in a court brief released wednesday 
in an affidavit assistant us attorney joseph aronica said 
prosecutors have learned of two incidents of document destruction 
on capitol hill members of congress called on defense secretary 
frank c carlucci to make a dramatic move such as halting new 
pentagon contracts to win back public credibility in the wake of 
the bribery probe 
were fighting a credibility problem here and it seems as 
though tough action is required said rep john kasich rohio 
we would be glad to discuss with the congress the question of 
freezing awards of new contracts while the justice department is 
investigating allegations of procurement fraud said hoffman 
but at this point we feel it would be imprudent to apply such 
a freeze or moratorium he told reporters at a briefing 
the innocent would suffer as well as the guilty and such a 
freeze would be equivalent of debarment without due process you 
may be sure that we will take precautions in any awards 
our contracts have adequate clauses which can be brought into 
play to repen them and take other action to protect the public 
interest he said 
however we wonder whether the members of congress calling for 
a freeze or a moratorium have thought through the possible 
consequences such as higher program costs production line 
shutdowns widespread plant layoffs and damage to the readiness of 
our forces he said 
hudson in his court brief discussed the possibility of further 
document destruction in arguing against release of sealed court 
documents 
revealing the precise contours of the governments intentions 
and current information may well encourage document destruction and 
other acts which would have the practical effect of putting 
major felons beyond the reach of justice said hudson the us 
attorney in alexandria va 
newsday inc is asking us district judge edward korman in 
brooklyn ny to lift the seal on several search warrants and 
supporting affidavits in the probe for unisys corps plant in 
great neck ny charles gardner a defense consultant to unisys 
and former unisys vice president dennis mitchell an employee at 
the great neck unisys plant and the hazeltine corp in greenlawn 
newsday said the seals should be lifted because the 
investigation has been extensively reported in the media but 
hudson said previous news stories havent disclosed significant 
portions of the material particularly the wiretap information 
hudson also said disclosing the affidavit in support of a search 
warrant at hazeltine would reveal the identity of a confidential 
source cooperating in the investigation 
hudson did not provide any details on who destroyed what types 
of documents how they were destroyed or how they might have been 
related to the probe of alleged bribes to pentagon personnel in 
exchange for confidential information funneled to consultants and 
defense contractors 
in washington the pentagons top purchasing official robert b 
costello testified before congress and said he would talk with 
carlucci today about a suggestion to halt pentagon contracts 
rep les aspin dwis said carlucci should order absolutely 
no contracts signed for 60 days or six weeks with companies 
involved in the criminal investigation 
carlucci could make a dramatic move aspin told costello 
the undersecretary of defense for acquisition policy 
were going to write some tough language into these contracts 
so that we can recoup some of this stuff and make sure that all 
contracts that are let from here on out are legal said aspin 
aspin noted that contractors and weapons involved in the 
investigation include mcdonnelldouglas and the fa18 the 
topline navy fighter after the twoyear investigation became 
public the pentagon went ahead with contract awards for the plane 
aspin said 
on june 23 the pentagon announced it was granting 
mcdonnelldouglas a 960 million contract for fa18 work aspin 
noted 
its clear the pentagon hasnt come up with any plan for 
dealing with contractors under a cloud he said 
costello during a daylong meeting of the house armed services 
committee repeatedly defended the defense department procurement 
policies of the reagan administration 
congress can enact new laws and the pentagon can pass new 
regulations but there is no way to ensure against cheating 
costello said 
costello shied away from his may 5 proposal last month to give 
defense department officials authority to prevent searches of 
contractors facilities by fraud investigators costello said he 
wouldnt write the same memo he had written may 5 
rep j roy rowland dga told costello his proposal is not 
appropriate it doesnt look good it doesnt smell good 
costello declined to agree it was inappropriate but added that 
he wouldnt write it now i can change my mind he said

its time for americans to begin commemorating 
the birth of president john f kennedy rather than his 
assassination sen edward m kennedy writes in the sunday edition 
of parade magazine 
the shock of that tragic moment in dallas is still vivid in 
peoples minds and it is easy to understand the natural desire 
of many americans to honor jack on that day his brother wrote 
but the nov 22 anniversary with its traumatic pictures and 
tv replays is always a depressing time for our family 
instead he suggests americans remember the late president on 
may 29 his birthday 
kennedy also said his brothers idealism remains alive around 
the world 
few things move me more deeply than to visit a hut in a 
distant povertystricken land and come upon his picture on the 
wall he wrote in the brief time jack had he touched our 
hearts with fire and the glow from that fire still lights the

consumer advocate ralph nader took the giant 
american automobile association to task thursday for its alleged 
laxity in defending consumer interests 
the national association of auto clubs performs a wide variety 
of services for its nearly 30 million members nader said but that 
contrasts with its abdication of the consumer cause in other 
quite consequential fronts he said 
naders charges came in a 10page letter addressed to aaa 
president james b creal 
he was critical of the club for generally opposing government 
regulations for example pointing to club statements that safety 
and emissions rules should not be imposed without verifiable 
evidence of their need and value 
nader asserted that the aaa has been weak in its efforts to 
encourage more recalls and said the organization has too quickly 
accepted as adequate industry efforts to improve fuel efficiency 
and he was critical of club support of higher speed limits 
limited member involvement its cautious position on mass transit 
and club activities in insurance 
asked about the letter j kay aldous a vice president of the 
falls church vabased aaa said we dont plan to reapond other 
than to say that ralph nader is like a 17year locust he emerged 
july 1 1971 to make the same irresponsible charges

american followers of rebel archbishop marcel 
lefebvre say they are sticking with his movement rejecting roman 
catholic reforms despite his break with the official church 
his consecration of four bishops in switzerland on thursday in 
defiance of rome brings his automatic excommunication and marks the 
first split in the church in 118 years 
i dont know of a single priest or seminarian who is leaving 
because of this socalled excommunication said the rev charles 
ward of st louis administrator of the movements us district 
were holding fast to the faith which is what a true catholic 
does we know he lefebvre is teaching the truth 
other american adherents of the lefebvre revolt organized 
internationally as the priestly society of st pius x expressed 
the same determination 
theres no dissenion in our ranks said jason huvar of 
victoria texas one of about 15 seminarians refurbishing new 
quarters for their st thomas aquinas seminary near winona minn 
its a dire situation he said in a telephone interview 
but what is being done had to be done 
its a matter of life and death for the faith of keeping 
traditional priests you cant have them without bishops to ordain 
them 
lefebvre 82 under suspension since 1976 for condemning key 
reforms of the 196265 second vatican council has continued to 
ordain priests and celebrate other sacraments 
but the further step of consecrating new bishops to perpetuate 
his revolt beyond his lifetime formalizes the breach with rome 
marking failure of recent vatican negotiations for reconciliation 
he is taking measures to insure continuation of the catholic 
priesthood the traditional mass and survival of the church said 
timothy mcdonnell a seminarian from manitowoc wis 
he said other us priests and bishops are no longer teaching 
the faith and lefebvre is consecrating new bishops to maintain 
the faith most of us have been openly for it 
he and others followers echoed charges by lefebvre that romes 
embrace of religious liberty ecumenical relations with other 
churches and the vernacular liturgy violated catholic tradition and 
were democratizing it 
mcdonnell said the changes parallel those of 16thcentury 
protestant reformers martin luther john calvin and thomas cranmer 
other than ward top officers of the lefebvres us movement 
were in switzerland for the consecrations including the movements 
superior the rev francois laisney of st louis and its seminary 
rector the rev richard richardson 
ward compared lefebvres excommunication to the fourthcentury 
papal excommunication of alexandrian bishop athanasius later made 
a saint lefebvre ward said cant truly be ecommunicated he 
will be by the letter of the law but not by the spirit of the 
law 
the us wing of the lefebvre movement has 29 priests about 95 
centers across the country for worship in the traditional 
tridentine latin mass an estimated l0000 lay participants and 
various substantial properties 
those listed include st vincents church in kansas city mo 
immaculate conception church and a grammar school at post falls 
idaho queen of angels church and printing press for its magazine 
angelus at dickinson texas and a grammar school high school and 
twoyear college at st marys kan 
internationally the movement has 220 priests and an estimated 
100000 followers with seminaries in switzerland argentina 
australia germany and france enrolling about 250 seminarians 
some vatican officials have said the movement has as many as a 
halfmillion followers 
kenneth novak of downers grove ill one of about 40 
seminarians in this country said the society is the only 
institution organized to perpetuate the faith rome is no longer 
defending the faith and tradition 
he said most people in the lefebvre movement had already made 
up their minds beforehand and would stick with him despite 
excommunication 
if any leave it will be the weaker types the fringe he 
said 
its a bad thing that were being condemned for being what 
catholics should be said huvar thirty years ago wed be 
considered good now were considered schismatics outcasts and 
rebels

a consumer group said thursday it was urging 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng to rewrite regulations that 
it contends allow millions of chickens contaminated with bacteria 
to reach american homes 
officials at the washingtonbased community nutrition institute 
along with the government accountability project a group that 
provides legal support for government whistleblowers said they had 
written a letter to lyng asking him to rescind the current 
regulations that allow processors to wash poultry 
no amount of washing can help poultry once bacteria become 
firmly attached said rodney e leonard executive director of 
community nutrition institute 
instead the groups want lyng to impose new regulations that 
would require poultry processors to cut away contamination portions 
or to throw away the whole chicken if the body cavity is 
contaminated 
however both leonard and tom devine of the accountability 
project said properly cooked chicken is safe to eat they suggested 
that consumers thoroughly clean kitchen surfaces that the raw 
chicken has touched 
the agriculture department had no immediate response to the 
letter although it has in the past defended its inspection 
procedures 
a spokesman for the broiler industry steven pretanik said 
poultry producers make every effort to reduce chicken 
contamination but said it is impossible to produce a chicken that 
is bacteriafree 
any raw food product whether its of animal or plant origin 
naturally has bacteria present said pretanik director of 
science and technology for the national broiler council thats 
one of the reasons we cook food to destroy the bacteria 
the exact amount of bacterial contamination in poultry is 
unclear however estimates have ranged from 35 percent to 60 
percent nationally salmonella and other organisms can be spread 
when slaughtered birds are put through eviscerating machines and 
contents of the birds intestines are spilled

iraq said its warplanes bombed irans 
biggest gas production plant and attacked an offshore oil field 
today and it claimed major victories in the northern and central 
sectors of the war front 
staterun baghdad radio interrupted programming to announce that 
iraqi troops backed by tanks and helicopter gunships recaptured 
four strategic border heights along the shehabi ridge in the 
central sector of the 733mile front 
the enemy is collapsing baghdad radio declared the four 
heights were purged of the filthy enemy 
earlier baghdad radio reported that the northern mawat basin 
in the kurdistan mountains was liberated after fierce battles 
with the iranians 
it said the iraqi flag was hoisted on 24 strategic heights 
overlooking the town of mawat town at 245 pm it said two border 
outposts occupied by the iranians also were seized 
the radio monitored in nicosia said the iraqis launched the 
offensive at 730 pm wednesday there was no immediate reaction 
from tehran 
the iraqis have been inching into iranianheld territory in 
northern sulaimaniyeh province for several weeks but they have not 
totally dislodged their enemy from the strategic mountain region 
inhabited mainly by proiranian kurds who are fighting the iraqi 
government for autonomy 
earlier the official iraqi news agency said its aircraft bombed 
the gas plant on sheik shoeyb island in the southern persian gulf 
and the cyrus oil field in the northern gulf 
it said all the planes returned safely to their bases 
irans official islamic republic news agency said iraqi jets 
bombed an industriallabor complex on its southern gulf coast 
killing or wounding an unspecified number of workers and causing 
some damage 
the iranians also claimed their air force fighters shot down an 
iraqi warplane over the gulf at 829 am 30 minutes before the 
iraqis said their fighterbombers hit sheik shoyeb 
the iranian news agency also monitored in nicosia said a 
second iraqi jet was shot down over western iran by antiaircraft 
fire 
the iraqi news agency quoted a military communique as saying 
large numbers of iraqi warplanes were involved in the two gulf 
raids and left their targets engulfed with fire and smoke after 
penetrating iranian air defenses 
the iranian regime today received a strong blow which will 
have an extreme effect on its economy and oil resources the 
communique said 
the raids came several days after iraqi forces drove the 
iranians out of their last major bridgehead in southern iraq the 
majnoon islands in the oilrich howeizah marshes 
the iraqis recaptured the southern faw peninsula on april 18 
two years after the iranians had seized it and a month later drove 
them from a position east of the port city of basra 
these battlefield defeats dramatically swung the military 
balance in the nearly 8yearold war in iraqs favor after years of 
iraq being on the defensive 
the military setbacks have badly jolted tehran prime minister 
hussein musavi said today when he was reelected by parliament that 
iran faces a historic confrontation with its enemies and must 
prepare for an allout struggle against them 
the iraqi communique declared the iranian regime must realize 
that after the successive victories of the iraqi army and air force 
that it has to accept peace and nothing but peace 
the iraqi air forces last major raids against iranian oil 
installations were june 23 when 10 targets in the southwestern 
ahwaz bibi hakimah and sarran oil fields were bombed

three environmental groups have filed a 
lawsuit to block what they contend are illegal lowlevel flights by 
air national guard jets over the boundary waters canoe area 
wilderness in northeastern minnesota 
in the lawsuit filed wednesday in us district court the 
environmentalists contend the flights over the millionacre area 
violate federal law disrupt the areas solitude and harm wolves 
and other wildlife 
they contend the air guard and the federal aviation 
administration have failed to assess the environmental impact of 
the flights 
since 1949 the federal government has banned flights over the 
bwca lower than 4000 feet above sea level the environmental 
groups contend military jets have flown below that level which in 
most places is 2000 to 2500 feet above the ground 
suing are the national izaak walton league friends of the 
boundary waters wilderness and friends of animals and their 
environment named as defendants are the top officials of the faa 
and the national guard bureau which oversees the air guard 
don leyden an faa spokesman in washington dc said wednesday 
the agency could not comment 
the environmentalists were joined in complaints about the 
flights last year by the us forest service air guard officials 
challenged the contentions saying no military flights are flown 
below 4500 feet in the area they also said perhaps 80 percent of 
guard flights over the area were more than 8000 feet above the 
ground 
brian oneill a lawyer representing the environmentalists said 
lowlevel military flights also are a problem at other wilderness 
areas and national parks

republican george bush blamed liberals and 
economists thursday for seeking to cloak the good news about the 
us economy and compared his presidential candidacy to the 1948 
comefrombehind effort of democrat harry truman 
were in for a real battle in the fall everybody knows 
that the vice president told a 10000acouple gop fundraising 
luncheon that raised 2 million toward a fund to be used by the 
republican national committee for the fall election according to 
organizers 
the 83 million fund is exempt from the 2000aperson limit 
on direct campaign contributions to a candidate according to 
federal election laws that also prevented bush from mentioning his 
democratic rival michael dukakis in his speech 
although recent public opinion polls show a narrowing of 
dukakis early lead bush said republicans still face an uphill 
struggle in part because a republican has been in the white house 
for two terms 
after eight years of one party in the white house no matter 
how successful some good people yearn for a change hoping that 
change will mean improvement the likely nominee told the gop 
audience and its our job to let them know that this time in 
this case change and improvement come from the republican party 
the vice president also accused liberals of champing at the 
bit to raise taxes again and said the trouble with the 
democrats in congress is that they havent learned to just say 
no 
they rush to enact every softhearted idea that crosses their 
desks eyes closed to the social and economic consequences bush 
said 
he praised the current economic recovery which began in late 
1982 as the longest peacetime expansion in history and took a 
swipe at economists for being pessimistic 
economists arent any help he said noting that leading 
economists have been projecting a recession since 1984 and two 
years ago 60 percent of the members of the national association of 
business economics predicted a downturn in 1988 
wrong wrong wrong bush said no wonder its called the 
dismal science 
im feeling like harry truman bush added forty years 
ago he was fighting against the odds and when he went out to 
speak the crowds would yell give em hell and hed shout back 
i dont have to give em hell i just tell the truth and they 
think its hell bush said 
bush also reiterated his call for tougher sentences for drug 
abusers in a speech to the national organization of black law 
enforcement officers 
only 14 percent of the drug felons convicted in new york city 
last year were sentenced to as much as a year with no probation 
he said in prepared remarks 
he said that states should make more use of habitual 
offender laws that make repeated conviction on felony charges a 
separate crime and proposed providing federal jail space for 
them when needed 
bush was scheduled to leave thursday night for his vacation 
resort in kennebunkport maine where he will spend most of the 
holiday weekend on the fourth of july bush planned to visit four 
cities including detroit and st louis to participate in 
independence day events

john demjanjuk appealed his conviction and 
death sentence for nazi war crimes thursday contending a lynch 
atmosphere pervaded the court that found him guilty of mutilating 
and killing death camp inmates 
the retired ohio autoworkers lawyers asked the supreme court to 
reverse his conviction due to lack of proof and much more than 
substantial doubt that he was the brutal ukrainian guard called 
ivan the terrible by inmates of the treblinka concentration 
camp 
demjanjuk who is 68 and was born in the ukraine was sentenced 
april 25 a week after being found guilty of operating the gas 
chambers that killed 850000 jews in 194243 at the camp in 
nazioccupied poland he claims to be a victim of mistaken identity 
speaking in an interview at the supreme court defense lawyer 
yoram sheftel said the 101page appeal challenged every finding 
of the court as far as facts and legal aspects and accused the 
three district court judges of acting in a biased and uncivilized 
way 
it accused the judges of extreme and unprecedented involvement 
in questioning witnesses that in effect made them prosecutors 
state television which broadcast the trial daily and other 
israeli media conducted an organized massive campaign 
against the defendant the appeal said and all this 
contributed to a lynch atmosphere which completely undermined 
any possibility of a fair trial 
defense lawyers also contended in the appeal that two groups of 
photos used by camp survivors to identify the defendant were 
unpermissibly suggestive 
they said no evidence was produced to challenge demjanjuks 
story that he was in a german prisonerofwar camp during the time 
in question he was taken prisoner while serving in the soviet army 
sheftel said he visited demjanjuk last week at his maximum 
security cell in ayalon prison near tel aviv and he was fine he 
is optomistic and looking forward to the appeal 
supreme court spokesman shmaryahu cohen said a fivejudge panel 
headed by chief justice meir shamgar will hear the appeal from dec 
57 and dec 1214 
the prosecution is scheduled to reply sometime between dec 19 
and dec 29 chief prosecutor yonah blattmans office declined to 
comment on the appeal saying prosecutors had not yet received a 
copy 
demjanjuk moved to the united states after world war ii and 
settled in the cleveland suburb of seven hills he was stripped of 
us citizenship asnd extradited after a court ruled he had lied on 
his application to become an american citizen 
if demjanjuk is hanged he will be the first person executed in 
israel since nazi war criminal adolf eichmann was put to death in 
1962 after a trial in jerusalem 
israeli agents kidnapped eichmann the architect of adolf 
hitlers mass extermination of jews in argentina in 1960

mikhail s gorbachev today made an impassioned 
appeal to delegates at a communist party conference to adopt his 
proposed overhaul of the soviet system and said socialism will die 
if they dont 
the kremlin leader recalled that previous attempts in the 1950s 
and 1960s to reform the soviet economy were swallowed up by the 
system he said those failures made clear that this time there must 
be change in the political system itself 
it was the second time gorbachev had taken the floor at the 
conference he called to assess his 3yearold reform program and 
set a course for the future 
in a 40minute speech broadcast later on national television 
gorbachev told the 5000 delegates socialism lenin that is the 
creative activity of the masses 
but that activity will die unless we reform the political 
system he said 
gorbachev recommended in his opening address to the conference 
on tuesday a a structural overhaul of the political system that 
would make the presidency a more powerful post than the largely 
ceremonial office it is now the president would be elected by a 
new 2250member congress of deputies 
gorbachev noted that some of the 40 or so delegates who have 
spoken at the conference so far had complained there were no real 
results yet from the three years of reform since he became party 
leader in march 1985 
getting overnight results would be the simplest shortest but 
most mistaken way to pretend successful reform had already taken 
place gorbachev said 
earlier a communist party official told delegates that some 
people believe party stalwarts like andrei a gromyko are no longer 
fit to hold office because they cant work under gorbachevs 
reforms 
and a steelworker said that three years after the reform program 
was launched his town still doesnt have meat and consumer goods 
have vanished 
delegate vladimir i melnikovs remarks were the first reported 
by staterun media in which top party figures were attacked by name 
a delegates note read at the conference later praised gromyko 
but also said he has fallen behind the times 
despite the freer climate created by the kremlin campaign for 
glasnost or openness criticism of top leaders is still 
largely offlimits to the soviet press and members of the ruling 
politburo generally maintain an image of monolithic unity 
melnikov party leader in the russian federation region of komi 
said restructuring of the partys policymaking central committee 
is proceeding too slowly the tass news agency said in a summary of 
his remarks 
both communists and nonparty members melnikov said have said 
that people who in previous times actively conducted the policy 
of stagnation cannot now be on or work in central party or soviet 
organs in the period of recontruction 
tass said gorbachev sitting on the dais broke in saying 
maybe you have some concrete suggestions were sitting here and 
dont know is he talking about me or somebody else 
i was referring first of all to comrade solomentsev and to 
comrades gromyko afanasyev arbatov melnikov replied 
mikhail s solomentsev 74 and gromyko 78 are both members of 
the politburo and have held seats on the central committee since 
the days of nikita s khrushchev in the late 1950s and early 1960s 
as politburo members they have seats on the dais close to 
gorbachev television showed solomentsev listening as melnikov 
spoke but did not show or say whether gromyko was there 
tass said a delegate identified only as mamayev sent a note to 
the presidium that was read to delegates it praised gromyko as a 
man who has popular respect and love 
according to tass the note said gromyko had devoted his life to 
communism but added we have worked him too hard and comrade 
gromyko today has fallen behind the times but he has done his job 
and his noble deeds are remembered by the people 
central committee official georgy kryuchkov asked by reporters 
about reaction to melnikovs remarks said there were no other 
immediate expressions of support for the men attacked by name none 
of them spoke up immediately in their own defense he said 
gromyko served as foreign minister for 28 years and was shifted 
to the mostly ceremonial post of president in 1985 solomentsev is 
chairman of the partys control committee 
georgy a arbatov one of the soviet unions veteran specialists 
on american affairs is frequently seen on us television has led 
the usacanada institute since 1967 and has been a voting member 
of the central committee since 1981 
it was not clear which afanasyev melnikov was referring to 
there are at least two men by that name among the conference 
delegates the most prominent is viktor g afanasyev who has been 
editor of the communist party daily pravda and a full member of the 
central committee since 1976 
veniamin a yarin a mill operator at a huge industrial complex 
in the ural mountains told delegates that despite promises to 
reward workers for increased productivity the government has cut 
housing subsidies 
and although gorbachevs program of perestroika or

archbishop marcel lefebvre has challenged 
some of the most important reforms in the modern history of the 
roman catholic church 
the french prelate contests the reforms of the second vatican 
council of 196265 which he charges have led to neomodernist 
and neoprotestant tendencies 
major points of contention with the vatican include 
vatican ii documents on the church in the modern world and 
on religious freedom which lefebvre refused to sign as a 
council member 
the 16th century tridentine mass lefebvre continues to 
celebrate this mass which the council replaced with a simplified 
and modernized liturgy to be said in the modern local language 
rather than in latin lefebvre has described the modern mass as 
bastard rites a few years ago the vatican said the tridentine 
mass could be celebrated with special permission 
ecumenism or the opening to other churches and faiths the 
second vatican council formally recognized that other faiths have 
elements of truth and that their members stand in the love of god 
lefebvre objects to the concept of religious freedom as a 
horrible apostasy because it put the church on equal footing 
with all other including nonchristian churches he condemned as 
appalling pope john paul iis meeting with leaders of other 
religious faiths in 1986

kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev appealed to 
delegates of the communist party conference on thursday to adopt 
his proposed overhaul of the soviet system and said that socialism 
will die if they dont 
taking the floor for the second time at the conference he called 
to assess his 3yearold reform program and set a course for the 
future gorbachev recalled that previous attempts in the 1950s and 
1960s to reform the soviet economy all were swallowed up by the 
system 
in an impassioned 40minute speech broadcast later on national 
television gorbachev told the 5000 delegates assembled in the 
kremlin he had decided to address them again because he felt there 
was a certain lack of understanding of the proposals he made 
tuesday at the conference opening 
gorbachev the general secretary of the party and the nations 
most powerful leader proposed to redistribute political power 
investing authority in a president to be elected by a new 
2250member congress of deputies he has not indicated whether he 
would seek the new presidency 
he said executive power should be similarly transferred to local 
and regional governing councils that would be headed by local 
communist party chiefs 
the new national congress would meet annually to set policy and 
would elect a considerably smaller fulltime legislature to conduct 
government business 
on thursday gorbachev argued that the failure of earlier reform 
efforts made clear that this time there must be change in the 
political system itself 
socialism lenin that is the creative activity of the 
masses gorbachev said in an emotional speech punctuated by 
frequent sweeping gestures with his hands and only occasional 
glances at his notes but that activity will die unless we reform 
the political system 
he noted that some of the 40 or so delegates who have spoken at 
the conference so far had complained there were no real results yet 
from the three years of reform since he became party leader in 
march 1985 
getting overnight results would be the simplest shortest but 
most mistaken way to pretend successful reform had already taken 
place gorbachev said 
without naming names the soviet leader noted some party members 
want to fix percentages of representation or administer the economy 
by directives from the seat of power 
no comrades he said we have to give a general 
direction we have to work out a political line 
the nation he said is faced with critical problems in ethnic 
relations and youth affairs and he noted that all were agreed that 
something should be done about them 
these are all questions of the fate of the country he said 
and thats why it is necessary to free the party of other 
functions 
very few of the speakers in the closeddoor debate so far have 
specifically addressed gorbachevs proposals for structural 
overhaul 
excerpts shown on television or reported in the staterun media 
have reflected lively discussion of concrete problems such as food 
shortages ecology or ethnic questions 
talking about his proposal to make communist party chiefs the 
heads of their local governing councils known as soviets 
gorbachev stressed we have to give full power to the soviets 
gorbachevs intervention at the end of the morning session on 
the third day of the conference had the tone of a personal appeal 
to the delegates to understand what he wants from them 
at least three times gorbachev noted the need to return to the 
principles of vladimir i lenin and make the communist party the 
political vanguard of soviet life

some doctors and other health workers 
exposed to the aids virus through needle sticks tainted blood or 
other accidents are taking the drug azt in hopes of preventing 
infection by the virus 
the theory is that azt now known as zidovudine if taken 
early after exposure might prevent the aids virus from installing 
itself in the genetic material of the cell thus preventing 
infection 
interest is so high that burroughs wellcome co maker of the 
drug launched its own nationwide study last month of health 
workers exposed on the job 
company spokeswoman karen collins said thursday that only a 
handful of subjects have enrolled in the study so far but the 
company expects 5000 to 7000 participants within the next few 
years 
health workers are required to enroll within five days of the 
exposure half will receive a sixweek series of the drug free of 
charge and half will receive a placebo collins said in a telephone 
interview from research triangle park nc where the company is 
based 
ive been bombarded with calls from health care workers around 
the country said dr julie gerberding director of an aids 
health care worker study at san franciso general hospital and the 
university of california at san francisco her study examines the 
risk of aids infection among health workers but does not involve 
participants taking azt 
gerberding said the callers want to know whether the possible 
toxic effects of zidovudine outweigh the 1in200 chance of 
infection after a worker is stuck by an aidstainted needle 
the toxic and experimental drug can cause muscle aches nausea 
headaches and severe anemia since it works by impeding cell 
replication it cannot be given to pregnant women 
no one knows the number of health workers taking the treatment 
under the guidance of their private physicians a sixweek supply 
of the drug costs about 800 
like everything else with aids its quasiunderground said 
dr june fisher who runs the citys center of municipal 
occupational safety and health 
gerberding said she knew of two workers at san francisco general 
who had taken the drug after they were exposed through tainted 
blood 
william owen a private doctor who treats aids patients said he 
prescribed the drug to a surgeon who cut his hand with a scalpel 
while operating on an aids patient 
preventive use of the drug is gaining credence among aids 
authorities including dr paul volberding of san francisco 
general volberding said he has enough faith in the drugs 
effectiveness that he cannot in good conscience advise any worker 
to enroll in the burroughs study for fear they will be among those 
receiving the placebo 
volberding said 22 health workers worldwide have become infected 
with the virus he also said that with a deep cut the odds of 
infection may run as high as one in 100

the vatican excommunicated archbishop marcel 
lefebvre and the four bishops he consecrated thursday and 
condemned the rebel french traditionalist for provoking a schism in 
the roman catholic church 
a statement issued two hours after the consecration ceremony at 
lefebvres seminary in econe switzerland said the five men 
excommunicated themselves by defying papal authority and by 
ignoring warnings and a lastminute appeal from pope john paul ii 
leading catholic clerics rallied around the pope and urged 
lefebvres supporters not to follow him out of the church 
john paul performed his official duties as usual thursday 
including a meeting with five soviet journalists but lefebvres 
decision to consecrate bishops without his approval caused 
considerable bitterness here 
a performance of beethovens missa solemnis scheduled for 
thursday evening in the paul vi auditorium was canceled to express 
deep pain over the schism the first major split in the church 
in 118 years 
an excommunicated roman catholic is not permitted to receive the 
churchs sacraments which include communion and extreme unction 
previously known as last rites 
no one is put to hell or condemned a vatican official said 
on condition of anonymity he lefebvre has put himself outside 
the communion of the church and takes responsibility before god 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said only the pope can lift 
the sanction against lefebvre 82 and the four bishops 
lefebvre caused the first schism or formal break with the 
vatican since the socalled old catholics rebelled in 1970 after 
the first vatican council proclaimed the doctrine of papal 
infallibility 
navarros statement said the consecrations were carried out 
explicitly against the popes will 
this is a formally schismatic act according to canon 751 in 
as much he openly refused submission to the holy father and 
communion with the members of the church under his jurisdiction 
and automatic excommunication was the result it said 
the spokesman rejected claims by lefebvres st pius x 
fraternity that the consecrations could occur because of an 
emergency situation 
the socalled case of necessity has been intentionally 
fabricated by monsignor lefebvre in order to maintain an attitude 
of division within the catholic church notwithstanding the 
ecclesial communion and the concessions offered by the holy father 
john paul ii 
lefebvre and his followers reject many modernizing reforms of 
the second vatican council 196265 including openings to other 
religions and christian denominations 
pope paul vi suspended lefebvre from priestly duties in 1976 but 
he has continued ordaining priests including 16 on wednesday 
john paul considered to be a doctrinal conservative had hoped 
to woo the french archbishop back and the two sides were reported 
close to agreement last month but lefebvre reneged on a compromise 
those excommunicated were lefebvre and the four bishops bernard 
fellay bernard tissier de mallerais richard williamson and 
alfonso de galarreta 
antonio de castro mayer bishop of campos in brazil assisted at 
the rites and also faced automatic excommunication navarro said 
however that the vatican was awaiting clarification on his role in 
the ceremony 
the italian bishops conference immediately called for prayers 
for the pope 
archbishop albert decourtray of lyon and president of the french 
council of bishops said it is a day of mourning for the 
catholic church for all those who are attached to christian 
unity 
cardinal basil hume archbishop of westminster and head of the 
church in england and wales said all catholics will be saddened 
by the action taken today by archbishop lefebvre he urged those 
sympathetic to lefebvre to reaffirm their loyalty to the pope 
navarro said recently that lefebvres supporters numbered 80000 
to 100000 but other vatican officials have said about half a 
million people turn to his priests for various church functions 
the vatican spokesman said he would announce friday the position 
in the church of lefebvres priests and lay followers

in a masterpiece of timing a government 
agency this week told united parcel service it had to transport 
shipments of fireworks then said three days later the order wont 
take effect until july 8 
the interstate commerce commission gave no reason for 
effectively reversing itself except to say it was acting on a 
petition by ups the package delivery service had wanted out of the 
fireworks hauling business because of the difficulty of obeying all 
the different local state and federal laws 
it was a great administrative burden said bob kenney a 
spokesman for ups in greenwich conn he said that while ups had 
been one of the leading shippers of fireworks which cant go 
through the us mail it was only a minor part of its business 
last year ups asked the icc to be let out of shipping fireworks 
and the commission said ok in march four fireworks manufacturers 
asked that the decision be reversed and on monday the icc did 
the commission ruled that the ups action is unreasonable 
discrimination and therefore unlawful it gave the parcel 
delivery service two days to reinstate the service it had stopped 
on jan 8 
the commissions action was not unanimous chairman heather j 
gradison dissented saying it was ironic that in its overweening 
zeal to use regulatory intervention to keep the bang in the 
fourth of july the commission showed the fragility of the 
liberties being celebrated 
for business reasons ups has made the deicsion that it no 
longer wishes to invest its time labor and capital carrying 
fireworks she wrote the commission is in effect taking from 
ups its right to exercise its control over its property 
icc vice chairman frederick andre also dissented 
ups is now being ordered to immediately transport 
fireworks for the upcoming fourth of july holiday he wrote in 
return for such a radical readjustment ups is merely offered the 
promise of an adequate explanation to be issued at a later date 
ups filed its objection on tuesday and the fireworks companies 
objected to the objection 
the last word was the commissions our prior decision is 
stayed until july 8 1988 said the order on thursday

iraq said its jets bombed an iranian 
natural gas plant and an offshore oil field thursday during raids 
in the persian gulf and claimed its land forces drove iranian 
troops from key border regions 
baghdad radio said iraqi forces recaptured four border points 
along iraqs shehabi ridge in the central sector of the 733mile 
war front 
it said troops also recaptured iraqs mawat basin region in the 
northern kurdistan mountains after an offensive launched late 
wednesday it said the iraqi flag was raised on 24 strategic 
positions in the region 
it also said two other border outposts were recaptured from the 
iranians 
the enemy is collapsing baghdad radio declared 
it said the offensive in the central sector lasted more than 12 
hours and ended when the iranians retreated to the prewar border 
leaving their dead littering the battlefield 
tehran had no immediate comment on the reports 
but tehran radio said iranian warplanes strafed troop positions 
in iraqs northern sulaimaniyeh province wednesday night and 
inflicted heavy losses on the enemy 
iraq had claimed its forces retook mawat two weeks ago 
thursdays communique claimed the entire mawat basin two miles 
west of the border has been recaptured 
the official iraqi news agency also said its aircraft bombed a 
natural gas plant on the iranian mainland in the southern gulf and 
the cyrus oil field in the northern gulf it said all the planes 
returned safely to their bases 
tehrans official islamic republic news agency also monitored 
in nicosia said iraqi jets bombed an industriallabor complex 
on its southern gulf coast killing or wounding an unspecified 
number of workers and causing some damage 
it said irans air force fighters shot down an iraqi warplane 
over the gulf at about the same time iran reportedly raided the gas 
plant 
iraq said the gas plant which it called irans biggest was on 
the mainland across from the island of lavan also known as sheik 
shoyeb 
the iranian news agency said a second iraqi jet was shot down 
over western iran 
baghdads official iraqi news agency denied any plane was downed 
during the two gulf raids the agency quoted an unnamed spokesman 
as saying large numbers of warplanes were involved in the two 
raids and left their targets engulfed with fire and smoke 
the iranian regime today received a strong blow which will 
have an extreme effect on its economy and oil resources he said 
the iraqi air forces last major raids were june 23 when 10 
targets in the southwestern ahwaz bibi hakimah and sarran oil 
fields were bombed 
the iraqi spokesman declared the iranian regime must realize 
that after the successive victories of the iraqi army and air force 
that it has to accept peace and nothing but peace 
last week iraqi forces drove the iranians out of their last 
major bridgehead in southern iraq the majnoon islands in the 
oilrich howeizah marshes 
they also recaptured the southern faw peninsula april 18 two 
years after the iranians had seized it 
the battlefield defeats dramatically swung the military balance 
in the nearly 8yearold war in iraqs favor after years of being 
on the defensive 
an authoritative oil source said the apparent target of one of 
the iraqi raids was the kangan natural gas plant 
meanwhile irans parliament reelected prime minister hussein 
musavi on thursday irans official news agency reported 
irans islamic republic news agency said 204 of the 217 deputies 
present in the majlis or parliament voted for musavi eight voted 
against him five abstained and the remainder did not attend 
in a speech before todays vote musavi declared that a 
massive mobilization by irans enemies is a warning that we must 
prepare for an allout struggle against them 
he stressed we are faced with an historic confrontation the 
most important manifestation of which has emerged in the 
warfronts with iraq 
he did not elaborate but he was clearly referring to a string 
of iraqi victories since midapril

democratic presidential hopeful michael dukakis 
won the backing thursday of the political arm of the national 
education association the nations largest teacher union 
the decision came during a closeddoor meeting of neas 
political action committee in new orleans where the teacher group 
will hold its annual convention next week the unions endorsement 
wont be official until friday when the nea board of directors is 
scheduled to meet and almost certainly concur with neapacs choice 
nea officials said the endorsement applies only to the 
democratic nomination the 19 millionmember union wont make a 
final presidential endorsement until sept 8 after both parties 
have held their conventions 
dukakis believes in and supports a view and a vision of 
education policy consistent with our efforts to assure every child 
a quality education said nea president mary hatwood futrell 
on wednesday dukakis picked up his first formal labor 
endorsement from the 59000member national treasury employees 
union a group that represents mostly federal internal revenue 
service and customs service workers 
the labor movement stung by charges that it contributed to the 
landslide defeat of walter mondale in the 1984 presidential 
campaign with its strategy of early endorsements has mostly held 
off endorsements so far in 1988 
it is unlikely that george bush who has clinched the republican 
nomination will gain the teachers blessing because he has refused 
to respond to the unions questionnaires on education issues or to 
meet with union officials said futrell in a recent interview 
the nea has frequently locked horns with the reagan 
administration on a variety of subjects especially federal aid to 
school programs 
the american federation of teachers the rival teacher union 
with 680000 members wont endorse a candidate until after the 
political conventions but the afts president albert shanker and 
political director rachelle horowitz will both be dukakis 
delegates in atlanta 
futrell said she had met with democratic candidates jesse 
jackson and dukakis but she said she was rebuffed by the bush camp 
my indication is that they think it wouldnt be desirable he 
has eliminated himself from the process she said 
in her discussion with jackson she said she indicated our 
concern that we should come out of the convention united we 
stressed the unity issue 
futrell a mondale delegate in 1984 and a political activist in 
her home state of virginia will not be a delegate this year but 
kenneth melley the neas director of government relations said 
the union will have 280 delegates and 77 alternates in atlanta 
with a large majority for dukakis the nea will send 28 members as 
delegates to the republican national convention 
the nea fielded 279 delegates and 84 alternates in 1984 at the 
democratic convention 
in nea questionnaires submitted to presidential hopefuls of both 
parties last year dukakis backed nearly every item on the unions 
legislative agenda including opposition to any englishonly 
constitutional amendments or public funding of private schools 
through vouchers 
but he parted company with the union with his opposition to 
federal tax deductions for union dues

the united states foreign debt burden climbed 
to 3682 billion in 1987 a sharp 368 percent rise over the 
previous year as the country lengthened its lead as the worlds 
largest debtor nation 
the commerce department said the new debt total was 99 billion 
higher than the 2692 billion in debt to foreigners that the 
united states owed at the end of 1986 
the debt means that foreigners now own more in us assets than 
americans own abroad for 1987 the government reported that 
foreign holdings in the united states increased to 154 trillion 
from 134 trillion at the end of 1986 american investments 
overseas totaled 117 trillion at the close of 1987 up from 107 
trillion a year earlier 
the difference between foreign investments in this country and 
american holdings overseas represents the 3682 billion debt 
burden the country is carrying 
the country now has a debt load greater than the combined total 
of brazil mexico and argentina the third world countries with the 
largest debt burdens 
critics have charged that the transformation of the united 
states from the worlds largest creditor nation a position it held 
as recently as 1983 to the worlds biggest debtor is the chief 
failure of president reagans economic policies 
democrats who hope to use the issue to their advantage in this 
years presidential campaign have charged that the burgeoning debt 
is eroding americas political and economic standing in the world 
but the administration on thursday sought to minimize the annual 
accounting of the countrys investment position contending that 
the figures were a sign of strength showing foreigners still 
believed america was an excellent place to invest 
the united states had an investment surplus of 894 billion as 
recently as 1983 that surplus fell to 35 billion in 1984 and 
disappeared altogether in 1985 the year the country became a net 
debtor for the first time in 71 years with a debt of 1107 billion 
americas investment surplus has evaporated as the country ran 
up huge merchandise trade deficits during the 1980s transferring 
billions of dollars into the hands of foreigners to pay for color 
televisions stereo equipment and automobiles 
these dollars now in foreign hands have been reinvested in the 
united states in everything from government bonds to real estate 
triggering alarm bells and calls in congress for curbs on foreign 
investment 
commerce undersecretary robert ortner briefing reporters 
thursday said the administration was adamantly opposed to curbs 
being placed on foreign investment in the united states he also 
objected to comparing the united states to third world countries 
saying unlike brazil the united states owes its debt in its own 
currency 
private economists have contended that the growing debt burden 
has already begun to lower americans standard of living as more 
and more money must be transferred into the hands of foreigners in 
the form of interest payments and dividends 
but ortner said he believed most americans regarded the entire 
debate as a big yawn he said that even with the growth in 
foreign investment the debt still represents only about 4 percent 
to 5 percent of the countrys total assets 
ortner said foreigners own about 17 percent of us treasury 
securities and about 12 percent of manufacturing assets in the 
united states 
i am not calling this report good news i am trying to argue 
that it isnt terrible news he said 
ortner refused to make any projection about how large the debt 
would grow in coming years but private economists have estimated 
it could top 1 trillion in the early 1990s before it begins to 
level off 
we are losing control over our own economy and our capital 
markets this money doesnt come free said lawrence chimerine 
president of the wefa group an economic consulting firm in bala 
cynwyd pa 
c fred bergsten director of the institute for international 
economics said the united states has become hostage to the whims 
of foreign investors he said foreign uneasiness with a plunging 
us dollar and rising interest rates was an underlying cause of 
last octobers stock market collapse 
as long as the united states has to rely on foreign financing 
of such magnitudes events could at literally any moment trigger a 
sharp turndown in our economy he said 
the commerce department report said that foreign direct 
investment in the united states defined as ownership of at least a 
10 percent stake in a company had climbed 188 percent to 2619 
billion in 1987 
the nation whose citizens had the biggest share of that 
investment was britain with 749 billion followed by the 
netherlands at 47 billion and japan at 334 billion

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
banning the death penalty for all juvenile murderers a day after 
issuing a decision that could end capital punishment for killers 
not yet 16 when they committed their crimes 
the justices said they will decide sometime next year whether 
use of the death penalty for anyone under 18 when the crime was 
committed violates the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual 
punishment 
the court voted to consider overturning the death sentences of 
georgia death row inmate jose martinez high who was 17 when he 
participated in a 1976 murder and missouri death row inmate heath 
wilkins who was 16 when he commited a 1985 murder 
the court wednesday overturned the death sentence of an oklahoma 
man convicted of a murder committed when he was 15 
four of the eight justices who voted in that case said the death 
penalty for convicted murderers who committed their crimes before 
reaching 16 always amounts to unlawfully cruel and unusual 
punishment 
three justices said no such age limitation on imposing capital 
punishment can be derived from the constitution 
justice anthony m kennedy did not participate in wednesdays 
ruling but will vote in the two cases decided next year 
in her controlling vote wednesday justice sandra day oconnor 
voiced serious doubts whether states may execute people for crimes 
committed when only 15 
although i believe that a national consensus forbidding the 
execution of any person for a crime committed before the age of 16 
very likely does exist i am reluctant to adopt this conclusion as 
a matter of constitutional law without better evidence than we now 
possess oconnor said 
but she supplied a fifth vote to overturn william wayne 
thompsons death sentence ruling that the states death penalty 
law could not be applied to him because it has no minimum age 
wednesdays ruling left unclear whether oconnor would vote to 
strike down a death penalty law that explicitly made 15yearold 
murderers eligible for execution 
the decision also left unclear whether the court would find 
fault with death penalty laws in which convicted killers who were 
16 or 17 when they committed their crimes are eligible for 
execution 
those questions could be answered when the court completes its 
study expected to begin when the court starts its new term in 
october of the appeals filed in behalf of high and wilkins 
high was sentenced to death for killing an 11yearold boy 
during a gas station robbery in taliferro county ga 
he was convicted in the july 26 1976 shooting death of bonnie 
bulloch the stepson of a gas station attendant 
high was weeks short of his 18th birthday when the crime was 
committed 
wilkins was 16 when on july 27 1985 he helped rob an avondale 
mo liquor store 
nancy allen a clerk in the store was fatally stabbed during 
the robbery 
in other action today the court 
apparently removed the last legal obstacle to a 180 million 
settlement between vietnam veterans and manufacturers of the 
herbicide agent orange 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that dismissed 
lawsuits by about 300 veterans who challenged the settlement in 
which some 120000 others are expected to participate 
agreed to study alleged race discrimination in alaskan salmon 
canneries setting the stage for an important sequel to a 
onedayold ruling that makes it easier for workers to prove their 
bosses are guilty of illegal bias 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by two companies 
based in washington state and oregon that operate canneries in 
alaska 
on tuesday the court made it easier by an 80 vote in a texas 
case for workers to prove their bosses are guilty of illegal 
discrimination by expanding the way employees can use statistics to 
prove bias 
agreed to hear the appeal of a texas man sentenced to death 
who the justices were told has the reasoning capacity of a 
7yearold 
the justices said they will study arguments that executing 
johnny paul penry for the oct 25 1979 killing of pamela 
carpenter would be cruel and unusual punishment banned by the 
constitutions eighth amendment 
agreed to decide whether states may ban virtually all lawyer 
advertisements featuring testimonials or client endorsements 
the justices said they will review a california rule that 
presumes such ads are false or misleading 
rejected the appeal of a minnesota woman severely injured in a 
1983 car crash turning away arguments that her cars manufacturer 
negligently failed to install airbags 
the justices without comment let stand rulings dismissing that 
portion of jan marie wickstroms productliability lawsuit against 
toyota motor corp and its us subsidiaries 
refused to kill a libel lawsuit against a tennessee 
congressman who criticized a legal services lawyer 
the court by a 63 vote let stand a ruling that rep don 
sundquist rtenn may be sued for statements he made in a letter 
to the us attorney general the lawsuit also alleges he repeated 
the libelous statements in a news release 
refused to answer the unusual legal question can a pig farm 
be a form of political protest 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by developers who 
set up a pig farm on their property after their plans for a large 
motel were blocked 
lawyers around the country still were absorbing the impact of 
wednesdays ruling on the death penalty for young offenders 
as a practical matter l5yearolds will not be executed in 
this country predicted paul l hoffman a los angeles lawyer for 
amnesty international justice oconnor walked right up to the 
edge of saying that 
in oklahoma assistant attorney general david lee said the 
line has been drawn in my opinion our reading of the opinion is 
that the court used 16 as the line 
if hoffman and lee are correct the decision will affect only 
three of the some 2100 people now on death row nationwide but 
thompsons case nevertheless had captured worldwide attention 
of the 100 men and women executed in us prisons since the 
supreme court in 1976 allowed states to resume capital punishment 
three died for murders committed when they were 17 
since 1948 no one has been executed in this country for a crime 
committed while under the age of 17 
of the 37 states with death penalty laws 19 of them do not 
specify a minimum age of the 18 state laws tht do impose a minimum 
age none of them allows execution of killers younger than 16 when 
they committed their crimes 
thirteen states and the district of columbia do not allow 
capital punishment 
justices john paul stevens william j brennan thurgood 
marshall and harry a blackmun voted to ban the death penalty for 
any crime committed by someone not yet 16 
writing for the four stevens said killing such criminals is 
nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain 
and suffering and thus an unconstitutional punishment 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
and byron r white voted to let thompson be killed writing for the 
three scalia said he found thompsons age inadequate grounds for 
reversal of his sentence 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court after 
thompsons case was argued did not participate in the case 
thompson now 20 was one of four people convicted in the jan 
29 1983 death in grady county okla of charles keene his 
former brotherinlaw 
the court although postponing for one day issuing a list of 
orders in new cases ended its 198788 term wednesday in other 
decisions it 
upheld the power of independent counsels to prosecute illegal 
acts by highranking government officials a momentous 
constitutional decision and a defeat for a handful of former white 
house aides such as oliver l north and michael k deaver 
severely limited state efforts to shield young sex abuse 
victims from trauma when they testify at criminal trials the 62 
ruling in a case from iowa jeopardizes the use of such protective 
devices for witnesses as oneway screens and videotaped testimony 
ruled 54 that the federal government may give money to 
religious groups to promote chastity among americas teenagers as 
long as the groups do not teach religion while using the federal 
aid 
in a highstakes defeat for organized labor voted 53 to make 
it easier for millions of nonunion workers to withhold financial 
support from the unions that represent them in collective 
bargaining 
barred states from placing strict regulations on professional 
forprofit organizations that solicit contributions for charities 
the 72 ruling struck down a north carolina law as a violation of

a house subcommittee on thursday approved a 
bill to seize land that was to be used for a disputed shopping 
center adjacent to a civil war battlefield near the nations 
capital 
the interior and insular affairs subcommittee on national parks 
and public lands acted to take control of a 542acre tract 
bordering the manassas national battlefield park the site of two 
major civil war battles 
a developer has planned a massive shopping residential and 
office complex next to the 4600acre battlefield park located in 
prince william county va 27 miles west of washington but 
historians and local groups have claimed the development would 
destroy the stillrustic sanctity of the park 
this is a remedy the congress and the american people have 
available said rep bruce vento dminn chairman of the panel 
i dont see any other alternative to dealing with this problem 
the bill which combines prior measures proposed by reps robert 
mrazek dny and michael andrews dtexas and a separate 
proposal by rep frank wolf rva also would close us 29 and 
state route 234 which run through the park and provide up to 30 
million for the construction of new roads around the site the 
federal government also would pay the sites developer the 
hazelpeterson cos for the land that was seized 
the land was sold to developer john t hazel for an estimated 
12 million in 1985 land experts estimate repurchasing the land 
and paying for road closings could cost the government up to 150 
million 
we will eventually pay probably three times what we have spent 
in the past year on acquisitions for national parks said rep 
ron marlenee rmont oh for the shame of taxpayer abuse we have 
in this legislation 
he said the roads in the park should be closed but the 
development plans should be allowed to proceed 
the bill now moves to the full interior committee which is 
chaired by rep morris udall dariz 
on wednesday the house passed a transportation bill that 
included an amendment offered by mrazek that would prevent federal 
involvement in the costly construction of bypasses or access roads 
associated with the development 
hazel plans to build a complex featuring 12 million squarefeet 
of retail space 17 million squarefeet of office space and 560 
homes 
the development site is next to the area in which the first and 
second battles of manassas were fought

government and community leaders said 
thursday that the thousands of layoffs announced by the tennessee 
valley authority will be devastating in limited areas without 
destroying the regions economic foundations 
and many said tvas stated goal of keeping its power rates low 
will be a boon in years to come 
there seems to be a tradeoff here that tva is trying to 
address said matthew murray an assistant economics professor at 
the university of tennessee the shortrun impact will be 
negative for the knoxville area and the tva region in general but 
tva apparently has decided the longrun benefits outweigh the 
shortrun costs of the dislocations and terminations 
the tva the nations biggest supplier of electricity announced 
wednesday that it will lay off 7500 of its 34000 workers to 
remain competitive and ensure its survival 
the 22 percent reduction to be completed by oct 1 is in line 
with tva chairman marvin runyons goal of making the utility 
businesslike and capable of competing with privately owned 
utilities the layoffs as well as other changes are an effort to 
avoid a rate increase of about 300 million in the budget year that 
begins oct 1 
tva will lay off 988 workers in knoxville its headquarters and 
transfer 250 additional jobs to chattanooga that will leave 
knoxville with about 3300 tva employees 
chattanooga will suffer a total reduction of 775 jobs leaving 
the city with about 4800 tva jobs an additional 329 employees 
will be laid off at muscle shoals ala leaving that city with 
more than 1800 tva jobs 
its tough on some of those laid off said knox county 
executive dwight kesselim sure they have house and car 
payments but in a community our size 1000 people laid off is not 
a disaster although it certainly is very real to those people 
knoxville has a population of about 175000 the county has a 
population of some 321000 kessel said 
the largest employer in the knoxville area is martin marietta 
energy systems with 15700 employees martin marietta also runs 
the department of energys facilities in oak ridge about 25 miles 
away 
kessel estimates the layoffs will have some ripple effect 
because there will be fewer paychecks spent on goods and services 
george korda a spokesman for mayor victor ashe said 
obviously in the short run its a difficult thing thats why 
the mayor and chamber of commerce and tva are cooperating on a 
largescale job fair in july to help people who have been affected 
get back on their feet hopefully in the knoxville area 
that job fair is just one of several efforts to provide tva 
employees who are losing their jobs with new opportunities similar 
efforts are under way in chattanooga and northern alabama tva also 
is putting together a job bank with cooperation of area businesses 
certainly this will have some impact korda said but 
overall the areas economy is strong and diversifying more than 
ever the outlook with a healthy tva is very good

the remains of composer bela bartok 
arrived in europe from new york on thursday for burial in his 
native hungary next week 
a brownpainted wooden box with brass corners and orangered wax 
seals along the edges of the lid held the remains of the master of 
modern musical composition who died in 1945 and was buried in new 
yorks ferncliff cemetery 
the box stood in an otherwise empty storeroom on a lower deck of 
the liner queen elizabeth 2 which left new york on saturday and 
arrived at its home port of southampton in bright sunshine 
earlier reports said bartok who died of leukemia in new york in 
1945 was buried in new yorks ferncliff cemetery in a steel coffin 
because all who knew him were certain he would one day be 
reinterred in his native land 
a steel coffin would have been easier to move but someone 
cheated us in 1945 said the composers younger son peter 64 a 
sound recording engineer from homosassa fla north of tampa 
steel was ordered but the undertakers buried him in wood when 
we dug up our father the wood had disintegrated and there wasnt 
enough left to cover my thumbnail he said 
peter and his brother bela 78 an engineer who lives in 
budapest and is president of hungarys unitarian church crossed 
the ocean with their fathers remains 
the brothers will attend the funeral in farkasret cemetery 
budapest july 7 their mother is buried there as is hungarys 
other famous modern composer zoltan kodaly who died in 1967 
when reporters saw the box in 5 deck aft recess it was 
undecorated although in new york it had been covered with ribbons 
in the hungarian red white and green colors 
the sons were met on the quayside by matyas domokos hungarys 
ambassador to britain and pat bear mayor of southampton who wore 
her gold chain of office over a blue dress 
we felt we had to be here to show respect to bela bartok 
said mrs bear 
i think it is good that we are doing this i know hungary 
wants it said the composers elder son 
the two sons were driven to city hall for tea and then taken on 
a tour of southampton 
a memorial concert was scheduled at the turner sims concert 
hall part of southampton university 
bartoks body was in a coffin enclosed in a shipping crate 
covered with ribbons in the hungarian colors red white and green 
we know that bela bartok did not want to rest in eternal 
exile but the family for a long time were reluctant to disturb his 
grave said gabor horvath press attache at the hungarian embassy 
it has been a longstanding wish of our government and nation 
to rebury bela bartok in budapest as one of hungarys greatest sons 
and our greatest composer of the 20th century horvath said 
the diplomat said the coffin would remain on the liner overnight 
for fridays sailing to cherbourg in france the coffin will then 
travel through france west germany and austria to hungary where 
bartok was born at nagyszentmiklos on march 25 1881 his 
birthplace is now in romania and renamed sinnicolau mare

a member of chancellor helmut kohls 
coalition government on thursday called for the immediate grounding 
of f16 fighter jets stationed in west germany 
three us air force f16s crashed wednesday in two incidents in 
west germany the crashes which occurred 90 miles apart rekindled 
controversy over lowlevel military training flights 
if the f16 which has recently piled up a number of crashes 
has a technical fault it must be temporarily grounded said 
werner hoyer a military expert and member of the free democratic 
party 
the party is the junior partner in kohls coaliton goverment 
five f16 fighter jets have crashed in west germany in the last 
three months 
us air force officials declined comment on the possible 
grounding of the f16s or on a published report that said cracked 
blades might have caused one of the accidents 
a us air force pilot was killed wednesday when his plane 
collided with another f16 on a training flight near bodenheim 
about 35 miles west of frankfurt the other pilot ejected safely 
later wednesday another us air force pilot ejected to safety 
when his f16 crashed in the black forest 
military air crashes in march and april triggered a storm of 
public controversy after fighter jets went down near a nuclear 
power plant and an ammunition dump an f16 also crashed into a 
small village killing the pilot and a resident on the ground 
west german defense minister rupert scholz in an interview with 
suedwestfunk radio said thursday that he had asked us officials 
to work with the west germans to do an exact analysis of a number 
of potential causes of the crashes and to do all possible to 
prevent such accidents from being repeated 
but scholz added that it was premature to ground the aircraft 
the us air force european commander gen william l kirk also 
has said the cause of the crashes must first be determined before 
making any move 
florian gerster a member of the main opposition social 
democratic party told reporters in bonn that military flights over 
densely populated west germany had reached the stage where it is 
as if we must protect ourselves against attacks from our own air 
defenses 
gerster charged that west german and us air forces try to 
outdo each other in practicing lowlevel and other flight training 
exercises 
the militarys unofficial stars and stripes newspaper said 
thursday that the us air force recently has replaced the engines 
of 31 f16 jets because of potential cracks in highspeed engine 
blades 
it said blade cracks found in some general electric f110 engines 
that are used in some f16s were the likely cause of an april 
18 crash near erzberg west germany 
most f16s are powered by a prattwhitney engine but the air 
force ordered the ge f110 engines in 1984 as part of an effort to 
increase competition among engine manufacturers the newspaper said

michael dukakis dismissed as meaningless thursday 
new polls showing his lead over george bush had shrunk dramatically 
and said he always had anticipated a very tough and very 
competitive race for the presidency 
he refused to speculate publicly about his next big campaign 
decision the choice of a democratic running mate ill make a 
decision when im ready to make a decision he told reporters 
jesse jackson who has pressed for an offer of the no 2 
position will meet monday night with dukakis said dayton duncan 
dukakis campaign press secretary duncan said jackson and his wife 
would have dinner with dukakis and his wife at the massachusetts 
governors brookline home and then accompany them to the july 
fourth fireworks and boston pops concert alongside bostons charles 
river 
the aide gave no indication what dukakis and jackson might 
discuss 
dukakis in illinois on the second day of a campaign swing 
through the midwest told workers at a reynolds aluminum co plant 
that reagan administration talk of economic prosperity is 
misleading 
too many of our families are struggling to hold on he said 
the massachusetts governor spent most of wednesday in washington 
talking to members of congress including four senators often 
mentioned as potential running mates 
he planned a return trip to the capitol on july 13 less than a 
week before the democratic national convention 
aides have speculated that he might not wait until the 
convention to announce his choice but he responded that i 
havent made any judgment about timing when asked if the july 13 
trip could be taken as assurance that no decision would be 
announced before that date 
i have the luxury of having the time and of being able to do 
this thoughtfully and deliberately he said id rather spend 
more time than less and make the right decision im not going to 
hurry it 
one of the senators dukakis met with on wednesday sam nunn of 
georgia took himself out of the running for a spot on the 
democratic ticket others with whom dukakis met individually were 
sens john glenn of ohio bob graham of florida and lloyd bentsen 
of texas all from states considered critical to a democratic 
victory in the presidential election 
during the past two months national polls have said dukakis 
holds leads of from seven to 17 points over the republican vice 
president but two surveys made public this week showed a much 
smaller margin 
one by the gallup organization said voters favored dukakis 
over bush by a margin of 46 percent to 41 percent slightly more 
than the threepoint margin of potential sampling error the other 
by abc news and money magazine had 45 percent for dukakis to 42 
percent for bush less than the fourpoint margin of error 
asked about the new surveys dukakis replied i can only say 
what ive been saying for 16 months early polls are meaningless 
he added this is a wide open race it always has been and 
this is going to be a very tough and very competitive race just as 
the primary was 
in the past week dukakis has approved a new cigarette tax to 
help balance his state budget and also has had questions raised 
about a possible scandal involving acquisition of land for a new 
state prison 
in addition both bush and president reagan have hit hard at the 
massachusetts governor particularly on the tax issue 
in his speech to workers at the aluminum plant dukakis 
questioned the the republican administrations claim to have 
created millions of new jobs 
today there are more americans working than at any time in our 
history he said but average family income in america is right 
where it was 20 years ago he said new jobs opening up between 
1979 and 1985 paid far less than jobs lost during that period

a british man in custody here for allegedly trying 
to smuggle helicopters to iran claims federal agents turned the 
single sale of one aircraft into a major crime his attorney said 
thursday 
colin breeze 33 of manchester england is charged with 
violating us export laws by trying to secretly deliver 10 
militarytype sikorsky helicopters to iran with the help of that 
nations ambassador to spain customs officials also said a suspect 
in the case is a man said to be a member of the spanish royal 
family 
in spain the iranian embassy said thursday it had no 
information on the case and that ambassador hadi soleimanpour was 
unavailable for comment 
henry m bugay a public defender representing breeze here 
thursday blamed the us customs service for trying to turn the 
smalltime broker into an international smuggler 
breeze is a fixedwing aircraft broker who works out of his 
home in manchester with no expertise in helicopter sales bugay 
said 
bugay said the case began when breeze agreed to sell one 
helicopter for tourist sightseeing purposes to juan perez de 
guzman whom he identified as a nephew of spains king juan carlos 
ii 
perez de guzman said to be a relative of the king of spain 
is a major suspect in the case confirmed patrick obrien head 
of customs here 
however a spokesman for the royal household in madrid told the 
associated press they have no record of perez de guzman and 
obrien said customs had not established if the man was indeed a 
relative of the king 
bugay said that when breeze unknowingly approached a 
confidential informant for the customs service about the 
helicopter the informant pushed him to expand the deal eventually 
raising it to 10 helicopters with perez de guzmans cooperation 
breeze was led down the garden path said bugay the 
original deal was concerning one single helicopter the whole 
case we believe borders on entrapment 
the attorney refused to say whether breeze knew iran was the 
eventual buyer of the helicopters but acknowledged his client 
understood the deal was bordering on a gray area

minute he delayed the sale by trying to raise his percentage said 
obrien

politburo member alexander n yakovlev a close 
adviser to mikhail s gorbachev is now the overseer of ideology in 
the communist party a senior party official said thursday 
byelorussian party head yefrem sokolov was asked at a news 
conference to outline the individual responsibilities of the 13 
members of the ruling politburo following a complaint by a delegate 
to the communist partys national conference that he did not know 
which leader does what 
i may make some mistakes sokolov said you know very well 
that yakovlev is responsible for ideology 
he said politburo member yegor k ligachev who was once thought 
to have the key task of overseeing ideology is responsible for 
organizational work in the politburo 
central committee official georgy kryuchkov said ligachev chairs 
the sessions of the policymaking bodys secretariat which is 
responsible for daytoday handling of party affairs that is a job 
that customarily falls to the no 2 member of the ruling politburo 
there were unconfirmed reports last spring that ligachev had 
lost the ideology portfolio after engineering a public attack on 
gorbachevs harsh criticism of the nations stalinist past 
neither sokolov nor kryuchkov would confirm or deny when pressed 
by reporters that ligachev has specifically lost the ideology 
portfolio 
he was dealing with and is dealing with these questions 
said kryuchkov he has never relinquished these duties 
sokolov made it clear however that he considered that all 
politburo members deal with ideology leaving unclear whether 
ligachev has any special responsiblities in that field 
rumors that ligachev had lost the key ideology portfolio 
surfaced after the publication of a letter march 13 from leningrad 
teacher nina andreyeva 
mrs andreyeva attacked the reforms and the criticism of josef 
stalin that has grown in the soviet media the publication of her 
letter in the daily sovietskaya rossiya triggered protest from 
intellectuals and led to a public outcry and rebuke from the party 
newspaper pravda in april 
pravda editor viktor g afanasyev confirmed monday mrs 
andreyeva had written a reply to that article but he declined to 
give details 
kryuchkov said thursday mrs andreyeva had written a letter to 
the conference presidium he said it was similar to her other 
letter but declined to elaborate

an executivebranch task force recommended 
thursday that businesses receiving government contracts be required 
to show they plan to have drugfree workplaces 
the national drug policy board headed by attorney general edwin 
meese iii met with president reagan at the white house and later 
released a summary of recommendations the president had sought in 
his campaign against drug abuse 
among the chief recommendations was a call by the task force to 
have private companies adopt the sort of drugtesting program that 
reagan called for at the federal government level in an executive 
order he signed on sept 15 1986 
the task force also recommended that federal aid to education be 
subject to a college or university certifying that it has an 
effective antidrug program it urged that federal student 
financial aid be withheld from young people with drug offenses 
the board also lent its support to the administrations prior 
advocacy of legislation authorizing the death penalty for 
defendants convicted of murder while engaged in a continuing drug 
enterprise 
the board consisting of top law enforcement and drug policy 
experts said a way should be found to make drug treatment programs 
more accountable by requiring users to share the cost and to submit 
to drug tests after completing such programs 
it also recommended increased international drug eradication 
efforts and economic assistance for developing countries whose 
business health often depends on the drug trade 
reagan said in a statement that he plans to present the 
recommendations next week to a joint executivelegislative branch 
drug task force 
the white house however acknowledged in a fact sheet that 
congressional democrats have yet to appoint their members to the 
task force 
sources close to house speaker jim wright of texas house 
majority leader thomas foley of washington and senate majority 
leader robert c byrd of west virginia have said the democrats do 
not plan to participate in reagans joint task force 
reagan said in his statement that the drug policy boards work 
builds upon the solid foundation already laid by this 
administrations strategy to reduce the supply and demand for 
illegal drugs 
these recommendations send a strong message to drug law 
offenders including users and traffickers it said i join the 
chairman meese in emphasizing that we cannot tolerate drug users 
who provide the illegal market for the drugs or who benefit from 
the taxpayers generosity through federal grants contracts or 
loans 
we must hold people responsible for their drug use through 
accountable treatment programs and through our parole and probation 
systems reagans statement said 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics abuse and control said the administration 
is desperate to come up with anything that sounds like a policy 
because of its failure to have one for 7 12 years the 
administrations emphasis on penalizing users is just a new brush 
to paint the same tired old slogans zero tolerance and just say 
no 
the fact that attorney general meese heads the policy board 
making todays recommendations said rangel demonstrates one 
of the most disturbing aspects no one is in charge full time of 
finding answers to the drug crisis 
the administrations support of the death penalty rangel 
said is an emotionally charged hollow gesture to create the 
impression that something is being done about the problem an 
effort to shift attention away from a needed comprehensive attack 
against drugs

the white house on the heels of revelations 
that five employees were relieved of their duties as authorities 
investigate drug use said today it will soon begin mandatory 
random drug tests 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the monthsold investigation 
which has resulted in the dismissal of two national security 
council clerks and the suspension of three white house guards 
illustrates all too well the terrible fact of drug use in our 
society 
reagan asked at a picturetaking session about the 
developments first reported in todays washington post said 
yes of course i am upset that it drug use is found anywhere 
asked if he thought his security had ever been endangered the 
president replied no i dont think so 
reagan posing with republican congressmen who had come to the 
white house to discuss drug policy options said that if white 
house workers are found to have used drugs he would like to see 
them enter drug treatment programs 
if it was just a case of using drugs reagan said then i 
would like to see us do our best to get them into a drugtreatment 
organization with a view to attempting a cure let the people 
know that then we will do our best to salvage anyone who has been a 
victim 
on wednesday white house spokeswoman liz murphy said the two 
clerks had admitted drug use and were separated from the nsc 
fitzwater today told reporters that the clerks agreed to 
resign several months ago during the winter 
asked at what level the nsc clerks worked fitzwater said he 
could not specify except to say they were at the secretary 
level 
pressed to say whether the two were involved in handling 
sensitive matters he responded its fair to assume that 
everyone who works at the nsc has access to sensitive material 
fitzwater said reagan and first lady nancy reagan who has led a 
campaign to just say no to drugs have known of the 
investigation by the drug enforcement administration and the secret 
service for several months 
it was started last winter when allegations were brought to 
the attention of the secret service fitzwater said he said the 
tip had come from a member of the uniformed division whose 
officers guard the executive mansion but the white house later 
today corrected fitzwaters statement saying the information had 
come from outside the secret service 
fitzwater would not say today what drugs had been involved 
the post however quoted an unnamed source as saying that a 
transaction involving cocaine had taken place on the white house 
grounds fitzwater said today there was no evidence produced by the 
investigation so far to substantiate that any such drug sales 
occurred 
fitzwater said that white house employees will be sent a letter 
giving them 60 days notice of the mandatory random drug testing 
fitzwater said the tests will be conducted six times a year 
with each round involving about 2 percent of the approximately 
1600 employees of the executive office of the president 
included are employees of the office of management and budget 
the national security council and the office of the vice president 
and first lady 
the spokesman also said that the secret service will begin on 
july 13 a program of preemployment drug testing for job applicants 
we have been advised that drugs were not used or sold on the 
white house premises and there was no breach of security he 
said although fitzwater cautioned that the investigation by the 
us attorneys office secret service and dea was continuing 
names of the five employees were not released 
evidence in the investigation begun several months ago has 
been turned over to the us attorneys office secret service 
spokesman robert snow said wednesday 
no arrests have been made snow said these are only 
administrative actions at this point 
two of the guards were relieved of their duties last friday the 
third was placed on leave monday it was not clear when the nsc 
clerks were fired 
asked why the clerks were no longer on the payroll while the 
secret service officers were on paid leave fitzwater said the 
guards have the protection of civil service appeal processes while 
members of the executive office serve at the pleasure of the 
president 
in addition to guarding the white house grounds uniformed 
members of the secret service guard the vice presidents home and 
foreign embassies they also travel with the president to provide 
security 
the nsc chaired by the president advises the president on 
matters of national security

the seattle archdiocese will assume sponsorship 
of mass for homosexuals the archbishop announced thursday but the 
group that had run the ministry is divided over whether to accept 
the change or move elsewhere 
while accepting homosexuals within the church archbishop 
raymond g hunthausen made clear that church teaching rejects 
homosexual acts 
the seattle chapter of dignity a group for homosexual 
catholics was evenly split sunday in a vote on whether to endorse 
hunthausens decision or to move the mass elsewhere calls to the 
organizations office thursday were answered by a recording 
hunthausen is the best bishop we have in the country an 
unidentified dignity spokesman told the seattle times after 
sundays vote 
the spokesman said the group was convinced dignity would never 
have been pushed out except for vatican pressure on hunthausen who 
was relieved of some duties in 1986 because of his tolerance of the 
group 
hunthausen said the decision was in response to the challenge 
offered in a sept 30 1985 letter from rome in which he was 
strongly criticized for allowing dignity to celebrate weekly mass 
in st josephs church in seattle 
for 16 years dignity has assumed a ministry to catholic gay 
and lesbian persons which has included a celebration of weekly 
liturgy hunthausen said however because dignity has taken 
public positions that are contrary to the teaching of the church 
dignity will no longer retain the sponsorship of the celebration of 
the eucharist that has taken place at st josephs church 
hunthausen said he was appointing the rev gerald stanley 
pastor of st edwards church here to coordinate the ministry 
along with other priests 
the ministry must be based on catholic moral teaching 
hunthausen said such teaching must ensure that the churchs 
position on human sexuality is presented clearly and without 
ambiguity 
church teaching rejects homosexual acts but not homosexual 
people 
the 1985 letter critical of hunthausen followed a 1983 
apostolic visitation in which a delegation examined whether the 
bishop was lax in certain areas of his ministry 
in september 1986 the vatican appointed an auxiliary bishop to 
relieve hunthausen of certain duties including authority over 
ministering to homosexuals 
that unprecedented move upset many us bishops and the vatican 
last year restored hunthausens powers appointed coadjutor 
archbishop thomas j murphy to assist him and named a threebishop 
commission to review hunthausens administration 
in 1983 hunthausen delivered on videotape the welcoming 
address at dignitys national convention in seattle and permitted 
the group to celebrate mass at st james cathedral he was 
upbraided for that in the 1985 letter by cardinal joseph ratzinger 
prefect for the congregation of the doctrine of the faith who 
wrote that the archdiocese should not support a group that doesnt 
accept church teaching concerning the intrinsic evil of 
homosexual activity 
dignity with more than 100 chapters has sponsored mass 
sacraments programs and worked for homosexual catholics for more 
than 20 years the organization maintains homosexuals can express 
their sexuality in a morally responsible way 
but the group has been forced out of churches in several cities 
including new york and san diego since a 1986 vatican letter 
labeled all homosexual activity a sin and said even a tendency 
toward homosexuality is an objective disorder 
the directive warned bishops not to support any group that 
condones homosexual activity 
hunthausens decision follows the lead of cardinal joseph 
bernardin a member of the commission overseeing hunthausen in 
may bernardin said his chicago archdiocese would take over the 
mass and ministry to catholic homosexuals 
bernardins decision was initially hailed by gay activists as an 
acceptable alternative to a ban of the group from church property 
but the issue has since split chicagos homosexual catholic 
community 
dissidents have begun celebrating mass in a lutheran church in 
defiance of bernardins decision 
in san francisco archbishop john quinn another commission 
member permits the dignity chapter to meet in a catholic church 
the ground rules for this thing are that so long as they dont 
take a public position in opposition to church teaching theyre as 
welcome as anybody else said archdiocesan spokesman norman 
phillips

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods fell 06 percent in may as a sharp drop in demand for 
aircraft offset strength in other areas the government reported 
thursday 
the commerce department said factory orders declined 136 
billion to a seasonally adjusted 21797 billion in may it was the 
largest one month decline since a 14 percent plunge last august 
orders had been up sharply in the previous two months rising by 
15 percent in april and 16 percent in march analysts said the 
onemonth breather would be good for the economy giving factories 
more time to catch up with a backlog of unfilled orders 
orders had been growing at an unsustainably high rate said 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc of lexington 
mass this is a welcome sign because it eases the pressure a bit 
on an industrial sector that is operating at close to full 
capacity 
the weakness in may was confined to the transportation sector 
which fell 102 percent to 282 billion because of a big drop in 
orders for new aircraft without this weakness orders would have 
climbed a healthy 1 percent during the month 
analysts said orders were likely to jump sharply in june as 
aircraft demand rebounds reflecting large orders placed with the 
boeing co 
the us manufacturing sector is the star of the economy this 
year because of a boom in exports brought about by the weaker 
dollar 
the setback in may came in orders for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years they declined 19 percent 
also the biggest drop since august a week ago in an advance 
report the decline was put at a slightly larger 22 percent 
orders for military equipment plunged 195 percent to 802 
billion while orders in the category of nondefense capital 
investment fell 59 percent to 3152 billion analysts said both 
of those declines were related to the drop in aircraft orders 
orders for nondurable goods rose 08 percent to 1029 billion 
with most of the increase coming in tobacco products analysts said 
this represented price increases and a boost in export sales 
shipments of manufactured goods rose 14 percent in may to 
2178 billion the fourth consecutive month that shipments have 
increased

archbishop marcel lefebvre defied the 
pope and consecrated four bishops thursday causing the first roman 
catholic schism in a century and his own expulsion from the church 
that was his life for 60 years 
the 82yearold rebel prelate who has spent a generation 
fighting the satanic influence of modernism rejected a 
lastminute appeal from pope john paul ii he looked pale and tired 
under his white goldembroidered miter as he conducted the rite 
that split the faith for the first time since 1870 
lefebvre performed the historic act in a huge sweltering tent 
in a meadow below the seminary he founded in this hillside hamlet 
18 years ago and named the st pius x fraternity for the pope who 
condemned modernism in a 1907 encyclical 
his chosen mass as usual was the 16th century tridentine rite 
in latin which was replaced by the vernacular under the 196265 
second vatican council reforms he detests 
a vatican statement issued less than two hours later condemned 
the consecrations as an act of schism a formal break with the holy 
see that had not occurred since the socalled old catholics 
rebelled when the doctrine of papal infallibility was proclaimed 
it announced the excommunication of lefebvre and the four new 
bishops british french spanish and swiss graduates of 
traditionalist seminaries for refusing to submit to papal 
authority the briton richard williamson 48 heads a 
traditionalist seminary in ridgefield conn 
an excommunicated catholic is not permitted to receive the 
churchs sacraments which include communion and extreme unction 
previously known as last rites 
no one is put to hell or condemned a vatican official said 
on condition of anonymity he lefebvre has put himself outside 
the communion of the church and takes responsibility before god 
during the fourhour ceremony the french archbishop told 
thousands who crowded the tent that he was creating new bishops as 
an operation of survival for his movement to ensure continuity 
of the church of all times 
lefebvre says the church has been infiltrated by wolves and 
thieves and is being consumed by the cancer of liberalism 
the lord may soon call me home he said thursday i must 
not leave you orphaned with no one to ordain new traditionalist 
priests 
john paul sent lefebvre a telegram wednesday urging him not to 
betray the episcopate and summoning him to rome at the 
consecration his audience laughed when the archbishop said the 
pope sent the official car of the papal nuncio to take him to rome 
the same night 
he called the vatican sanctions null and void and told his 
supporters not to pay any attention to them he said canon law 
permits his actions in a state of emergency which the vatican 
denies 
in a homily beginning the ceremony he renewed his argument that 
the vatican not he was on a schismatic course because it 
accepted errors once condemned that were leading to 
destruction of the church 
among those errors he said were ecumenism communism 
socialism and zionism 
this is not a schism we are not schismatic he said 
there is no question at all of this we are here to manifest our 
attachment to the church of all times 
we are convinced we are following the call of god we will 
wait until rome recognizes the value of our witness 
applause interrupted lefebvre several times a lone woman 
protester shouted we remain faithful to the pope in italian 
but no reaction was noticeable in the tent 
on wednesday the archbishop ordained 16 traditionalist priests 
bringing to nearly 250 the number he has ordained in defiance of 
the vatican since pope paul vi suspended him from priestly 
functions in 1976 
lefebvre himself was ordained in 1929 after obtaining degrees in 
philosophy and theology before his rebellion he was a missionary 
archbishop and papal representative in africa and a member of the 
commission that prepared the second vatican council whose reforms 
he rejected 
a vatican spokesman has said that lefebvres supporters numbered 
80000 to 100000 but other vatican officials have said about half 
a million people turn to his priests for various church functions 
thousands of people who could not get into the tent thursday 
listened to loudspeakers outside for those who did not understand 
french priests gave summaries of the homily in german and english 
of lebvres homily 
about 20 small confessionals were set up around the tent and 
many people used them organizers estimated the total audience at 
nearly 10000 
just before noon lefebvre ended the consecration ceremony by 
laying his hands on the four bishops as they knelt before him 
facing the altar they then received the symbols of office miter 
ring and crooked pastoral staff 
assisting him was antonio de castro mayer the only catholic 
bishop who has publicly supported lefebvre 
ordained as bishops and excommunicated thursday were williamson 
a convert from the anglican church bernard tissier de mallerais 
43 secretarygeneral of lefebvres fraternity alfonso de 
galarreta 31 spanishborn head of the seminary in la reja 
argentina and bernard fellay 30 a swiss who is chief 
administrator of the fraternity

the house judiciary committee on thursday 
approved comprehensive antidrug legislation including 
establishment of a national sevenday waiting period before 
purchasers can take possession of handguns 
the gun provision passed by voice vote but james jay baker 
chief lobbyist for the national rife association said his group 
will try to separate the waitingperiod amendment from the overall 
bill and force a separate vote on the provision before the full 
house 
other key portions of the drug bill would 
restrict the availability of chemicals used to refine cocaine 
or make dangerous drugs such as amphetamines and pcp 
create a cabinetlevel drug czar to develop and carry out a 
national antidrug strategy 
authorize 175 billion in 5050 matching grants over the next 
four years for state and local antidrug enforcement efforts 
deny most federal benefits to persons with two or more 
convictions on drug offenses unless they complete a rehabilitation 
program 
establish a mandatory fiveyear prison sentence for possession 
of crack cocaine in certain circumstances 
the handgun waiting period would allow local police time to 
conduct a background check into criminal records or a history of 
mental incompetency but such a search would not be required by 
the legislation 
the provision would leave intact any state law that is stronger 
than the federal language but supercede weaker laws twentytwo 
states have waiting periods with californias the longest at 15 
days 
a purchaser could be exempted from the waiting period by 
presenting a certificate from police stating that the purchasers 
life was threatened 
the waiting period was sponsored by rep edward feighan dohio 
and supported strongly by law enforcement groups and sarah brady 
wife of presidential press secretary james brady who was shot 
with a handgun during the 1981 assasination attempt on president 
reagan the police groups said drug dealers would purchase weapons 
in states with weak gun laws 
we will be incapable of making substantial headway in our war 
against drug trafficking unless we are also prepared to disarm drug 
dealers and drug traffickers and drug users feighan said 
the provision withstood a challenge from rep bill mccollum 
rfla who attempted to substitute an amendment requiring that a 
system be developed to identify felons who attempt to buy firearms 
the mccollum substitute was defeated 2212 
im delighted thrilled very proud of the judiciary 
committee mrs brady said after the committee vote an official

republican leaders accusing the democrats of 
hiding true taxandspend policies in a bland platform promised 
thursday to give the american people a gop platform that spells out 
exactly where the party stands 
the republican platform committee also heard two former rivals 
to george bush sen bob dole and rep jack kemp emphasize a need 
for the republicans to attract independent and crossover 
democratic voters and to bring more members of minority groups into 
the party 
frank fahrenkopf jr the party chairman opened the committees 
hearing with an attack on the bland and featureless document 
that the democrats platform committee approved last saturday in 
denver 
the democrats are trying to hide their true policies said 
fahrenkopf their platform is truly a facade with no interior 
drafted by politicians who have chosen to avoid the issues of the 
election of 1988 he challenged michael dukakis and the democrats 
to meet us on the battlefield of ideas in 1988 
sen bob kasten rwis one of the platform writers said the 
only way for democrats to get elected is to adopt outright 
republican policies of economic growth and freedom or hide their 
liberal policies behind a facade of bogus consensus 
as the election nears he said the disguise will come off and 
michael dukakis will be exposed for the narrowminded liberal wolf 
in sheeps cothing that he really is 
both dole and kemp said after testifying to the platform 
committee that bush was closing in on dukakis in polls because the 
public is taking a closer look at the massachusetts governor 
for the last several weeks he hasnt had jesse jackson to 
beat said dole now people are starting to focus on who is 
this dukakis and how did he get here hes a true 
massachusetts ted kennedy liberal 
kemp said dukakis is not the center of the american political 
mainstream that he looked like when he was campaigning against 
jesse jackson he is from the mcgovern wing of the democratic 
party 
kemp told reporters he does not expect to be picked by bush as a 
running mate but said dole might be 
im not after it because i dont think its going to be 
offered said kemp adding that from all of the signals all of 
the press reports coming out of the bush campaign it sounds to me 
like theyre leaning to bob dole 
dole asked if he wanted the no 2 job said i dont think 
its a question of wanting it its a question of winning the 
election helping your party and trying to help your country id 
want to be majority leader if i had my choice 
the kansas senator who was gerald fords running mate in 1976 
was majority leader until the democrats regained control of the 
senate in the 1986 elections 
dole in his testimony urged the party to fashion a platform 
that pays special attention to the needs of children including new 
childcare grants for states paid for by phasing out the child 
care taxcredit for high income families 
dole said the democrats kept their platform short because they 
dont have much to talk about i mean who wants to talk about 
raising your taxes and more regulation and more spending 
kemp said the party needs to expand its ranks and be more like 
the party of lincoln 
the democrats measure compassion by how many people are on 
welfare i think we ought to tell the american people were going 
to measure compassion by how few people need welfare said kemp 
the platform committee also heard robert vernon an assistant 
police chief of los angeles call for stiff measures against drugs 
and drugrelated crime 
i truly believe we are approaching a civilization crisis a 
literal civilization crisis said vernon he called for a world 
war iilike mobilization to fight drugs including creation of a 
national drug czar and depriving drug users of drivers licenses 
and other social privileges 
a businessman barry baszile testified that drug dealers are 
entrepreneurs too and might turn to legal businesses if economic 
development funds were available in the inner cities

the supreme court on thursday cleared away the 
last legal obstacle to a multimilliondollar settlement between 
vietnam veterans and manufacturers of the herbicide agent orange 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that dismissed 
lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged the 1984 
settlement 
weve been waiting for four years for this appeals process to 
end said frank mccarthy president of the vietnam veterans agent 
orange victims inc 
the money will be put to good use most of all a lot of 
children who arent getting help will begin to receive that help 
now for their birth defects mccarthy said 
agent orange which was sprayed over southeast asia during the 
1960s by the us military as a defoliant contains highly toxic 
dioxin veterans contend that exposure to it causes cancer and 
other illnesses they say agent orange exposure caused miscarriages 
by wives of servicemen and birth defects in their children 
the 180 million settlement has grown and with interest now 
totals about 240 million 
estimates on how many people will receive some payment from the 
settlement fund range as high as 250000 
the chemical companies sued over their making agent orange were 
monsanto dow uniroyal hercules th agriculture and nutrition 
diamond shamrock and thompson 
we are pleased dow spokeswoman pat brink said after the 
high courts action thursday what pleases us the most is that the 
veterans will now get the money theyve been waiting for 
she noted however that dow has never conceded that agent 
orange was responsible for any health problems 
the lawsuit acted on thursday was filed by veterans who opted 
out of the huge class action lawsuit that ended in a settlement 
the smaller suit was dismissed when a federal judge ruled that 
the agent orange manufacturers were immune from being sued over the 
alleged health effects of the herbicide 
the ensuing appeals from that ruling had been pending before the 
nations highest court for months held until a key decision about 
government contractors legal liability 
three days ago the court ruled that government contractors 
cannot be sued over governmentapproved design defects unless the 
contractors failed to notify the government about hazards they knew 
about 
us district judge jack weinstein threw out the suits filed by 
the 300 veterans relying on three findings 
that no plaintiff could prove a particular illness was caused 
by agent orange 
that no plaintiff could prove which defendant manufactured the 
agent orange that allegedly caused his or her injury 
and that all the claims were barred by the military contractor 
defense 
his dismissal was upheld by the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals

a former continental illinois national bank amp 
trust co officer and an exbanker from oklahoma accused of 
contributing to continentals near collapse pleaded guilty thursday 
to criminal charges 
john r lytle pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds and 
william g patterson pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting lytle 
before us district judge milton i shadur 
shadur had been scheduled to preside over a retrial of the men 
on charges of wire fraud and misapplication of bank funds after 
the defendants initial trial ended with a deadlocked jury two 
months ago 
lytle 53 a former continental vice president was accused of 
taking on millions of dollars in risky loans from customers of penn 
square bank of oklahoma city in return for alleged kickbacks 
patterson 38 former head of energy lending at penn square was 
accused of arranging the kickbacks in the form of 585000 worth 
of unsecured personal loans to lytle between 1980 and 1982 
each man faces up to five years imprisonment and a 5000 fine 
said shadur who set sentencing for aug 30 
the plea agreement reached by prosecutors and defense attorneys 
will avert the need for another long trial like the 6week 
proceeding that ended may 3 when a jury said it was deadlocked 
after deliberating five days 
the panel however cleared a third defendant oklahoma drilling 
contractor jere sturgis of wire fraud charges for allegedly 
participating in a purported scheme to defraud continental 
as far as were concerned this is it this puts to rest the 
continental bank chapter book encyclopedia whatever you want to 
call it assistant us attorney joesph duffy said after shadur 
accepted the plea agreement the object was justice and we think 
theres justice in the guilty plea 
shadur last month approved a retrial of lytle and patterson at 
the request of prosecutors who cited the fact that 11 jurors had 
voted to convict the pair and one had held out for acquittal 
penn square failed in 1982 and continental came close to 
collapse two years later after the largest run on deposits in 
banking history the government kept continentals doors open with 
a 45 billion bailout 
prosecutors charged that patterson manipulated lytle and sturgis 
in schemes to save his own failing bank 
the government accused lytle caught in spiraling personal debt 
to finance a luxurious lifestyle of accepting kickbacks from 
patterson in exchange for buying risky energy loans from penn 
square for continental 
attorneys for lytle and patterson contended continental was 
saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive 
lending policy not because of a fraud scheme

a us inspection team was headed to moscow to 
carry out the first baseline inspection under the treaty signed 
last december to eliminate superpower mediumrange nuclear 
missiles officials said thursday 
a soviet team also was expected to announce a visit to the 
united states starting on friday the beginning of a 60day period 
during which the two sides may inspect scores of sites associated 
with the missiles to be eliminated 
the baseline inspections are to verify the exact number of 
missiles and related components to be destroyed under the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty signed at the washington 
summit last dec 9 
at 1230 edt on thursday the united states notified the soviet 
union through a new risk reduction center located in the state 
department that a team headed by brig gen roland lajoie chief of 
the onsite inspection agency would arrive in moscow at about 330 
pm moscow time 
they will travel to the soviet union on a us air force c141 
from rheinmain air force base near frankfurt west germany the 
pentagon said in a statement 
under the terms of the treaty the two sides must give each 
other 16 hours notice of their intent to make an inspection the 
us team had not given notice of the exact sites to be inspected 
preferring to wait as late as possible said kendell pease a 
spokesman for the american agency 
in addition to the shortnotice spot inspections the inf treaty 
allows the soviets to station up to 30 inspectors for the next 13 
years in magna utah site of hercules plant no 1 where 
mediumrange american missiles were produced 
the us government in turn has the right to station 
inspectors near a soviet missileproducing site the votkinsk 
machine building plant 
the treaty the first to allow such onsite inspection is 
viewed as a trial for the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty 
which would slash arsenals of longrange superpower nuclear weapons 
by 3050 percent and involve much more complicated verification 
procedures

the reagan white house chafing over 
revelations of drug abuse by presidential employees in sensitive 
jobs announced thursday that all 1600 workers on its payroll will 
be subject to random narcotics tests in about 60 days 
president reagan said he was not surprised by the disclosure 
that two national security council clerks resigned and three secret 
service officers were suspended during a drug probe weve known 
this for some time and the investigation goes on he said 
this problem crosses all kinds of lines reagan said 
reagan did say that i am upset nancy reagan who has been 
carrying a justsayno message to americas youth said drugs 
are everywhere and spokesman marlin fitzwater said private 
business should use the sort of random drugtesting program the 
white house plans to invoke shortly after labor day 
neither the white house nor the us secret service would 
describe what drugs were involved in the investigation which led 
to the resignations of the two nsc clerks and placement of three 
uniformed division officers on administrative leave the washington 
post said the probe focused on cocaine use 
the members of the uniformed division protect the white house 
grounds and people who work for the national security council have 
access to highly sensitive government material 
the post which first reported the drug investigation and 
suspensions in thursday mornings editions quoted an unnamed 
source as saying that at least one sale of cocaine allegedly 
occurred on white house property fitzwater said that we have 
been advised that drugs were not used or sold on the white house 
premises secret service spokesman bob snow would not comment on 
that although he did say that no charges had yet been filed 
the disclosure of the drug investigation shook the white house 
at a time when reagans zerotolerance antidrug abuse 
campaign is in disarray and the president was playing host to a 
group of republican members of congress who wanted to discuss the 
problem 
moreover the latest uproar came on a day in which reagan was 
receiving recommendations from his drug policy board headed by 
attorney general edwin meese iii on new strategies among the 
proposals was one which would require firms doing business with the 
government to demonstrate effective plans for a drugfree workplace 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics abuse said the fact that meese heads 
the policy board making todays recommendations demonstrates no 
one is in charge full time of finding answers to the drug crisis 
rep connie morella rmd told reporters the incident 
demonstrates how it drug use can reach anybody in any area in 
any place in any position mrs morella said she supported random 
testing only in high security positions which would mean public 
safety also 
reagan gave a urine sample in the late summer of 1986 and he and 
his wife made a nationally televised appeal from the white house 
living quarters as the first couple sought to dramatize the 
administrations antidrug abuse offensive 
but a volunteer program of drug testing in which senior white 
house staff members would follow reagans lead was a onetime 
affair used by the administration in 1986 to kick off its 
antidrug abuse campaign fitzwater said i dont believe there 
have been any voluntary tests since then 
the white house had been working for some time to bring about a 
program of random drugtesting of employees in the executive office 
of the president but the revelations of actual abuse within its 
own ranks apparently gave the plan new impetus 
fitzwater opened his daily briefing with an announcement that 
letters will be sent to the 1600 presidential employees next week 
these letters will warn them that a mandatory random program of 
drug testing will commence 60 days hence that program will not 
directly affect secret service workers since they are on the 
treasury department payroll 
meese announced monday that the justice department would start 
drug testing also in about 60 days the next day 42 lawyers and 
paralegals from the department filed suit claiming the program 
violates their fourth amendment right against unreasonable search 
and seizure and fifth amendment dueprocess rights 
neither fitzwater nor snow would identify the two clerks ousted 
from the nsc and the three suspended secret service uniformed 
division officers fitzwater did say none of the allegations 
involved the presidents detail the secret service officers 
who directly protect the president 
reagan when asked if he thought his security had been 
compromised replied no i dont think so 
snow said the three secret service officers were placed on 
administrative leave with pay and that their status will depend on 
whether charges are brought by the us attorneys office in the 
district of columbia 
fitzwater said the random tests of presidential employees will 
be conducted six times a year with each round involving about 2 
percent of the staff 
included are employees of the office of management and budget 
the national security council and the offices of the vice president 
and the first lady 
the spokesman also said that the secret service will begin on 
july 13 a program of preemployment drug testing for job applicants 
we think it is worthwhile for all private employers to 
consider the spokesman said 
fitzwater confirmed that the drug investigation by the us 
attorneys office secret service and federal drug agents was 
continuing asked whether others have been implicated the white 
house spokesman replied there are others within the uniformed 
divisiion that are part of the investigation a small number i 
cant give you the specific number 
there are approximately 960 men and women in the uniformed 
divisiion of the secret service but the agency would not divulge 
how many of them are involved in direct protection of the white 
house grounds these officers also have responsibility for 
protecting the vice presidents mansion foreign missions and other 
executive offices

the american federation of teachers 
announced thursday it is launching a program to reform the most 
basic teaching methods in us public schools 
albert shanker president of the aft made the announcement at a 
news conference kicking off the convention for the 500000member 
federation 
he said the aft center for restructuring could lead the way 
in bringing about a revolution in teaching 
the center will critically examine the assumptions on which 
traditional schooling have been based he said with the center 
in the afts washington headquarters acting as a kind of clearing 
house for innovative ideas passed up from the teachers working as 
a team 
we think this is the first time in the history of the country 
that there has been an effort sponsored by teachers devoted to 
the notion that the best kind of change comes through a process of 
continuous experimentation shanker said 
the biggest problem for 40 million students in american 
elementary and secondary schools right now is that the schools 
have been the same for the last 200 years the union leader 
declared 
the center will supply general outlines and suggestions on 
methods of interesting district boards and parents to try new ways 
to teach he said adding that many of these things do not 
involve additional money 
my guess is that if teachers and principals at school level 
begin to do exciting things the public will later on say youre 
doing such terrific things that we are now more willing to invest 
money 
the center will encourage the formulation of new ways of 
testing and assessing what students do with the idea of drawing a 
more accurate picture of students in given schools he said 
shanker took aim at the basic granite of american public 
education starting with organizational and academic orders issued 
from district boards and superintendents to the principals and 
teachers 
he spanked the school bell class periods daily teacherchanges 
and finally multiplechoice tests which sourly described as a 
tool principals and superintendents hope will make them look 
good 
shanker said the aft does not have all the answers but added 
if we keep doing the same things as in the past we are going 
to have the same results we dont like the results 
shanker criticized education reform efforts over the past few 
years which are aimed at tightening teaching standards and moving 
back to a classic curriculum 
we welcome these moves he said however we do not 
believe the implementation of these forms will bring about 
substantial improvement in student achievement in most areas

angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi on thursday 
presented president reagan with a plan calling on the united states 
to sponsor a peace settlement for southern africa 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said that generally 
speaking reagan supports the plan which calls on the united 
states to continue providing arms to savimbis unita forces as long 
as the soviet union and cuba back the angolan government 
in a speech to the national press club savimbi said the plan 
urges the united states to pursue negotiations with cuba the 
soviet union and south africa for the withdrawal of all foreign 
troops from angola as soon as possible 
it also calls on the united states and key african states to 
promote a dialogue between unita and the angolan government that 
would lead to an interim government and free elections 
the us government is sponsoring talks among south africa 
angola and cuba to seek the withdrawal of south african and cuban 
troops from angola and independence for neighboring southwest 
africa or namibia which is controlled by south africa 
according to us officials cuba has about 45000 cuban troops 
in angola doing much of the fighting with unita savimbi said cuba 
sent in an additional 12000 troops in march and april and now has 
57000 troops there in addition he said there are 2500 soviets 
3000 north koreans and 600 east germans 
the soviets have helped the angolan forces with military 
planning and provided them with mig23 jet fighters helicopter 
gunships missiles and radar sights he said 
savimbi declined to say how much aid he received from the united 
states and south africa but it is estimated he gets about 16 
million a year in us aid including shoulderfired stinger 
antiaircraft missiles 
he credited the missiles which he declined to name since the 
united states doesnt officially acknowledged that it is providing 
them with stopping air strikes against his forces enough so unitas 
hospitals schools and factories can operate 
he claims to control onethird to onehalf the territory of 
angola a country nearly twice the size of texas 
vice president george bush who also met with savimbi issued a 
statement calling the guerrilla leader a true patriot bush 
said he used the meeting to reaffirm my strong support for his 
struggle and the struggle of unita to rid angola of communism 
bush the republican presidential nomineetobe added that a 
cutoff of support of dr savimbi as suggested by the democrats 
would be an immoral sellout of a loyal friend and a foreign policy 
disaster 
democratic presidential candidates michael dukakis and jesse 
jackson have called for an end to aid for unita savimbi said he 
had sent letters to the two candidates seeking to explain his 
position and had met with aides to jackson 
we think something will come out he said 
governor dukakis did not get yet the correct information about 
what we are doing said savimbi we believe that he is a very 
good american the day he knows we are working for peace and 
democracy and stability in the whole of southern africa i think he 
will have a different approach 
savimbi noted that the angolan government had sent a rival 
delegation to washington to lobby against him during his visit and 
said he had tried to meet with the officials but they had not 
responded to his request 
about 25 protesters chanting antisavimbi slogans demonstrated 
outside the national press building during his luncheon speech and 
a man interrupted his speech from the open door of the dining room 
to shout three times savimbi is a murderer 
i think thats democracy said savimbi its good

a delegate to the communist party conference 
bluntly criticized president andrei a gromyko and other longtime 
kremlin fixtures thursday suggesting there is highlevel support 
for removing them from office 
the delegate vladimir i melnikov specifically mentioned 
gromyko and the others after soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
asked him to name the targets of his criticism 
gorbachev in an impassioned speech to the 5000 communists 
gathered at the kremlin appealed for their support in overhauling 
soviet institutions warning that socialism will die unless we 
reform the political system 
he expressed concern there had been misunderstanding about one 
of his recommendations that local party leaders serve as chairmen 
of government councils at all levels that plan has been been 
openly criticized by delegates to the conference gorbachev called 
to set a future course for the party 
we do not abandon the role of the ruling party in the 
country gorbachev said on the contrary we want to affirm 
it while getting the party out of daytoday administrative 
affairs 
earlier melnikov had said those who in the past actively 
promoted the policy of stagnation may not serve and work on the 
central party and government bodies now at the time of 
perestroika they should answer for everything and do so 
personally 
one communist official said he took the speech as a signal 
that its time for the old guys to retire 
on the third day of the conference the partys first in 47 
years delegates have openly disagreed on the concrete results of 
gorbachevs drive for perestroika or economic and social 
reconstruction launched after he took power in march 1985 
but the remarks from melnikov at the closeddoor conclave were 
the first reported by staterun media that named names and called 
members of the party leadership on the carpet including gromyko 
78 and fellow politburo member mikhail s solomentsev 74 who 
chairs the partys control commission 
the speech by the relatively obsure conference delegate was 
televised during the evening news program vremya which is 
watched nightly by millions of soviets not accustomed to hearing 
their leaders criticized by name 
a delegates note later read from the dais at the conference 
praised gromyko and won warm applause but it also noted that he 
has fallen behind the times 
melnikov the balding bespectacled party leader in the russian 
federation region of komi said restructuring of the partys 
policymaking central committee is proceeding too slowly and that 
communists and other soviets want people responsible for stagnation 
brought to account 
gorbachev sitting on the dais interrupted melnikov saying 
maybe you have some concrete suggestions were sitting here and 
dont know is he talking about me or somebody else 
i would refer first of all to comrade solomentsev and to 
comrades gromyko afanasyev arbatov and others melnikov 
replied delegates applauded loudly 
as politburo members solomentsev and gromyko have seats on the 
dais close to gorbachev but television showed neither mans 
reaction to melkinovs comments 
the stout bespectacled georgy a arbatov one of the soviet 
unions veteran specialists on american affairs is often seen on 
us television has headed the usacanada institute since 1967 
and has been a voting member of the central committee since 1981 
it was not clear at which afanasyev the criticism was directed 
there are at least two men by that name among the conference 
delegates however the most senior and prominent is viktor g 
afanasyev who has been editor of the communist party daily pravda 
and a full member of the central committee since 1976 
gorbachev indicated in his opening address to the conference on 
tuesday that gromyko could be replaced in a structural overhaul 
that would make the presidency a more powerful post than the 
largely ceremonial office gromyko now holds 
tass said a delegate identified only as mamayev sent a note to 
the presidium that was read to delegates praising the dourfaced 
gromyko as a man who has popular respect and love 
according to the official news agency the note said gromyko 
who spent 28 years as foreign minister before being shifted to the 
presidency in 1985 had devoted his life to communism but the note 
added 
we have worked him too hard and comrade gromyko today has 
fallen behind the times but he has done his job and his noble 
deeds are remembered by the people 
the note sparked stormy applause when it was read aloud 
georgy kryuchkov a central committee official told a news 
conference 
asked about the personal attacks on leading party members 
kryuchkov warned reporters at a news conference against jumping to 
conclusions the men would lose their jobs 
a communist party official speaking on condition he not be 
identified further said the criticism should not be interpreted as 
a signal the old guard would be forced out at the conference but as 
an indication that change almost certainly is in the wind 
after being so protected for decades theyre suddenly being 
told to their faces what no one would ever whisper about before 
the source said he added the speeches amounted to a challenge to 
the kremlin old guard to come to its own defense or go home 
think about what was said and act accordingly 
another delegate vasily starodubtsev from an agricultural 
enterprise in tula called for a reexamination of the practice 
that insulates the leadership from criticism saying it has created 
a caste of untouchables among senior party officials 
despite the freer climate created by the kremlin campaign for 
glasnost or openness independent criticism of soviet leaders 
has been largely offlimits to the press and members of the 
politburo and other top party bodies maintain an image of 
monolithic unity 
in another speech thursday a steelworker from the ural 
mountains said that three years after the party instituted 
gorbachevs reform program consumer goods have vanished 
completely 
workers are asking straight out where is the perestroika 
veniamin a yarin told his fellow delegates for example in 
stores the way it was before with food products is the way it 
still is on top of that they have introduced rationing for sugar 
there wasnt any meat and we still dont have any

thursday as one of the first pieces of legislation resulting from 
the pentagon bribery and fraud investigation 
the current bribery probe at the pentagon is not surprising 
said rep tom ridge rpa one of the 55 house cosponsors and 
also a cochairman of the congressional military reform caucus 
it has happened before and it will happen again unless we 
change the fundamental way we do business said ridge 
the bill would create a single buying office known as the 
defense acquisition agency to replace the current mix of 
purchasing agencies scattered throughout the defense department 
for example each of the four services buys weapons separately 
for the nations 21 million uniformed personnel in addition 
there are separate purchasing agencies for the 1 million defense 
department civilians 
the current investigation focuses on allegations that defense 
contractors and consultants many of whom are former military men 
bribed pentagon officials for contracting details that could be 
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
the bill is the first piece of legislation resulting from the 
2yearold probe which became public only two weeks ago more 
legislation is expected later according to rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee 
the bill provides that the defense acquisition agency would only 
have civilian employees they would be trained at a defense 
acquisition university that would also be created by the 
legislation 
rep dennis hertel dmich another cosponsor said the 
pentagon needs a change in its mindset the american people will 
not tolerate these annual procurement scandals while nothing 
fundamentally changes at the department of defense 
hours later rep charles bennett dfla introduced a bill he 
said would close the revolving door between defense contractors 
and the pentagon it would require pentagon officials to wait two 
years after they quit before working for a defense contractor 
our whole procurement system will continue to be suspect if 
on a friday someone can sit on the government side of the table 
with responsibility for millions of taxpayer dollars and then on 
monday be sitting on the contractors side of the table bennett 
said

political appointees may be attempting to 
sabotage the farmers home administration the lender of last resort 
to the nations farmers rep glenn english dokla charged 
thursday 
a house committee report last week declared management of the 
agency inadequate and unable to properly oversee the operations of 
1900 county offices english said may be a sign political 
appointees dont like the program and they dont think the 
government should have this program 
if you look at it in a sinister way you could draw the 
conclusion that theyre doing their best to make sure the program 
does not work you could say they were sabotaging the program 
said english 
fmha administrator vance clark appointed by president reagan in 
march 1986 said he did not know what english meant when he 
referred to sabotage 
its a nice rhetorical flourish which is consistent with the 
intemperate tone of the report as well as the season of the year 
clark said but this level of discourse lends little in the way 
of credit or credibility to the report or its chief author 
english chairman of the government information justice and 
agriculture subcommittee said the fmhas inability to supervise 
its own affairs has meant that farmers have not had access to 
valuable programs the law intended for them 
english based his findings on a hearing he conducted last 
november to determine the fmhas effectiveness in administering 
farm programs in its jurisdition the house government operations 
committee chaired by rep jack brooks dtexas released a report 
on that hearing last week 
in summary the report found that in many instances the 
national office does not know what is going on in the county 
offices and does not have any way of finding out 
all of the problems at fmha identified by the committee could 
have been alleviated or avoided altogether by competent 
professional effective management the report said 
the committee in its report recommended that the secretary of 
agriculture require fmha to institute effective management 
procedures so that the department the congress and the public may 
be assured that the agency is meeting its mission 
witnesses complained of racial discrimination farmer 
intimidation by fmha county supervisors disregard of regulations 
by local fmha workers and loans that sometimes were made too late 
for farmers to produce their crops 
the report said that despite strict prohibitions against selling 
farmland from inventory if it would depress price levels 14 fmha 
state directors sold land without conducting the analysis required 
by the national office

a voice of america writer filed suit thursday 
challenging a requirement that she obtain government permission to 
publish an article accusing the reagan administration of 
politicizing agency broadcasts 
the suit by carolyn weaver is the first court challenge to 
regulations that require voice of america employees to obtain prior 
approval before publishing articles or making speeches about us 
foreign policy or the operation of the agency according to her 
attorney stephen m kohn 
all books or manuscripts of official concern must be 
submitted for clearance by the us information agency which 
operates the voice of america the regulation also covers employees 
of the state department and the agency for international 
development 
the government has the right to delete passages or stop 
publication of publication of material it considers inaccurate 
inconsistent with current foreign policy or can reasonably be 
expected to affect adversely us foreign relations according to 
the regulations 
weaver a parttime writer and editor is preparing an article 
that accuses the voa of failing to observe requirements of its 
charter that it be an accurate objective and comprehensive 
source of news for foreign listeners 
her lawsuit filed in us district court charges that the 
clearance requirement is a form of prior restraint prohibited by 
the first amendment 
the suit seeks an injunction barring usia from requiring her to 
submit the article for its review before it is sent to the columbia 
journalism review 
the magazine must have the manuscript by july 14 in order to 
publish the piece in its septemberoctober issue according to the 
lawsuit 
in a series of cases federal courts have upheld prepublication 
review of manuscripts by former cia employees to prevent 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information 
but weaver who has no access to classified information 
contends that in at least one decision a court has explicitly 
prohibited restrictions on the publication of unclassified material 
in 1972 the supreme court declined to review a federal appeals 
court finding that the first amendment limits the extent to which 
the united states contractually or otherwise may impose secrecy 
requirements upon its employees and enforce them with a system of 
prior censorship 
in that case former cia agent victor marchetti was barred from 
publishing confidential information but the appeals court said he 
kept the right to speak and write about the cia and its 
operations and to criticize it as any other citizen may 
kohn said the regulation denies the american public access to 
critical views of united states foreign policy 
even if an employee is given permission to criticize us 
foreign policy it is approved criticism approved criticism is 
not real criticism he said 
lois herman a usia spokeswoman said the agency did not have a 
comment on the lawsuit

scientists called thursday for a 20 percent 
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2005 to combat 
the socalled greenhouse effect that is trapping heat like a 
blanket around the earth 
every day we wait for a reduction in greenhouse gases will 
bring us closer to disaster dutch environment minister eduardus 
nijpels told the closing session of a fourday conference on the 
changing climate hosted by the canadian government 
scientists use the term greenhouse effect to refer to 
manmade pollution trapped in the atmosphere that is warming up the 
earths surface 
carbon dioxide one of the pollutants is naturally emitted by 
animal and plant life an excessive buildup of that and other gases 
results from the burning of fossil fuel in power plants factories 
homes and cars as well as agricultural and industrial pollution 
more than 300 scientists and government officials from 40 
countries and agencies warned in a closing statement that the 
increase in greenhouse gases will raise temperatures by 3 to 8 
degrees before the middle of the next century unless something is 
done 
many scientists believe that warming due to greenhouse gases 
has begun the statement said it said that unless the global 
warming is halted the expected rates and magnitude of climate 
change will greatly exceed those experienced since civilization 
began 
the scientists said that merely to stabilize carbon dioxide 
concentrations emissions would have to be reduced 50 percent 
but after european countries pointed out they have already taken 
many clean air measures the conference recommended an initial goal 
of reducing carbon dioxide emissions approximately 20 percent of 
1988 levels by the year 2005 
about half of the recommended reduction can come from more 
efficient use of existing energy supplies the statement said 
noting some countries have shown they are energy savings of 2 
percent annually 
in an opening day speech monday sen timothy e wirth dcolo 
said the united states could save more than 200 billion a year in 
energy costs through improved efficiency in transportation 
construction and government 
he cited photovoltaic solar energy as a promising alternative to 
fossil fuel and said it was time to reexamine nuclear power 
those nations that have halted the nuclear option are going to 
have to reconsider he said 
the scientists called on all nations to ratify the 1987 montreal 
protocol on halting the depletion of the earths ozone layer by 
reducing the use of chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs on thursday 
canada became the fourth country to do so 
cfcs are used in aerosol sprays refrigerator coolant 
insulation and industrial cleaning once released the cfcs break 
down the ozone layer allowing the suns harmful ultraviolet rays 
to reach the surface of the earth and thus increasing the incidence 
of skin cancer 
the scientists also said global warming from carbon dioxide 
methane nitrous ozide cfcs and the depletion of the ozone layer 
could raise sea levels by up to five feet by the year 2050 
inundating coastal areas 
in opening the conference host prime minister brian mulroney 
said canada would like to see an international law of the air to 
protect the atmosphere as the existing law of the sea defends the 
oceans 
but the conference endorsed a suggestion from keynote speaker 
gro harlem brundtland prime minister of norway for work towards 
an international convention on atmospheric protection 
the conference also urged the establishment of a world 
atmosphere fund financed by a tax on oil gas and coal in 
industrialized countries to pay for global protection efforts 
the conference had few representatives from the soviet bloc and 
no representative from the us environmental protection agency 
us rep george e brown jr dcalif sent a message 
complaining that washington will drag its feet on environmental 
issues until an enlightened leader occupies the white house 
meetings are planned in ottawa next year and in geneva in 1990

hog farmers are continuing to expand 
production in the face of rising feed costs prompted by the 
drought an agriculture department report showed thursday 
as of june 1 the us inventory of hogs and pigs was estimated 
at 562 million head up 8 percent from a year ago and 15 percent 
more than two years ago industry analysts had expected a smaller 
increase 
the number of breeding hogs at 753 million head was up 7 
percent and 17 percent from june 1 of 1987 and 1986 respectively 
that indicated further production increases in the months ahead 
officials said the june 1 inventory of market hogs animals 
headed for slaughter and the consumer market totaled 487 million 
head up 8 percent and 15 percent from the previous two years 
the pig crop during the first half of the hog marketing year 
that began last dec 1 was estimated at 466 million head a gain 
of 8 percent from a year ago and 15 percent from two years ago 
looking at future prospects the report said hog farmers 
surveyed intend to have 62 million sows give birth in the 
junenovember period a 7 percent increase from the same six months 
of last year and 14 percent more than two years ago 
but the report cautioned that the farrowing intentions do not 
reflect conditions after the june 1 survey date 
leland southard of the departments economic research service 
said in a telephone interview the industry had expected the total 
inventory to be up only about 4 percent as of june 1 
but southard said a spike in feed costs has raised doubts 
about further expansion however 
i think there is a question whether producers will carry 
through with these farrowing intentions to the extent that theyve 
indicated in the june 1 survey he said we can blame that on 
higher feed costs costs of production 
the following list shows the june 1 inventory in the 10 leading 
hog states which account for about 79 percent of the nations 
pork the first number in thousands is the total number of hogs 
in the state the second is the june 1 figures percentage of a 
year earlier

they were good kids from good families june 
graduates of a prestigious jesuit prep school 
so why did a simple problem as simple as a classic premise for 
a situation comedy begin a series of events that left one dead 
and four others in disgrace 
you just sit back and say how the hell could this happen 
fordham preparatory school headmaster cornelius mccarthy said 
thursday i think it was immediate gratification they perceived 
the need to solve this problem immediately 
james patrick cooney 18 was shot to death by an offduty 
policeman during a bronx robbery spree designed to raise 1000 for 
car repairs police said cooney and his friends allegedly tried to 
rob the officer minutes after they held up a grocery store at 
gunpoint early sunday 
after cooney was shot the other 18yearolds who were in the 
car with him dumped his body in a park wiped blood from the car 
and burned some bloody clothing police said 
the body was found wednesday after one youth barry bootan 
bragged of the incident to a girlfriend who told police 
authorities said 
it all began with the kind of problem that has formed the basis 
for teenage sitcoms like happy days or movies like risky 
business a teenager loans his fathers station wagon to a 
friend for a date when the car is damaged in an accident the kids 
plot how to raise the money to get it fixed before dad comes home 
in this case cooney borrowed a station wagon friday belonging 
to the father of his classmate bootan but cooney drove the car 
into a utility pole scraping and denting the vehicle bootan was 
frantic because his father was returning from a fishing trip sunday 
and he could find no one to loan him 1000 
to get the money they allegedly enlisted the aid of another 
fordham student jason katanic who provided a car and a 
22caliber rifle two other students accompanied them 
the solution the youths allegedly devised armed robbery 
seemed inexplicable in light of their seemingly solid pasts and 
promising futures 
cooneys stepfather is a 19year veteran of the police 
department who insisted that his stepson attend fordham prep even 
though the family could barely afford the 3700ayear tuition 
bootan and katanic who face charges of attempted murder 
robbery and attempted robbery were honor students at fordham prep 
two other students alleged to have been riding in the car but 
not charged in the case also came from privileged backgrounds 
brendan moynihan who lives in the expensive westchester county 
town of pelham is the son of a former manhattan prosecutor daniel 
florio who comes from queens reportedly is related to a judge 
speculation however centered on cooney jp to his 
friends who lived with his mother stepfather and older sister in 
a threestory redbrick house on a quiet bronx street 
a nextdoor neighbor described cooney as polite and helpful the 
youth shoveled snow from his walk tended his flower bed and 
carried neighbors groceries the neighbor said 
in school he was a member of the wrestling team and like all 
graduating seniors he performed 60 hours of community service he 
reportedly had been admitted for the fall semester at st johns 
university in queens 
fordham prep is a 147yearold school with a reputation for 
rigid academic standards and strict discipline virtually all 209 
students who graduated june 3 planned to attend college 
this is so out of character said mccarthy none of them 
had any major disciplinary problems he cooney satisfied his 
academic requirements he seemed like the kind of kid who enjoyed 
life 
but some of those who knew cooney said he showed another side 
one classmate said he had begun to hang around with a rough crowd 
many of whose members were not fordham prep students and had begun 
to neglect his studies 
cooney left the school when he was a sophomore because of low 
marks and never seemed entirely happy there when he returned in 
this years yearbook the space beneath cooneys photo reserved 
for student activities and achievements is blank

armenian delegates to the communist party 
conference on thursday offered several solutions to their regional 
dispute with the republic of azerbaijan but the azerbaijanis 
rejected all of them 
eduard m dzhrbashyan director of the institute of literature 
of armenias academy of sciences said one of the proposed 
compromises was turning the disputed region of nagornokarabakh 
over to the home area of mikhail s gorbachev in southern russia 
nagornokarabakh a caucasus mountains enclave is part of the 
predominantly moslem azerbaijan republic but is dominated by mostly 
christian ethnic armenians residents have been agitating for 
annexation by armenia since february 
armenias parliament has endorsed the demand but azerbaijan has 
rejected it leaving the issue deadlocked 
azerbaijan president suleiman tatliev told a news conference the 
solution to the dispute lies in fostering friendship between 
azerbaijanis and armenians restoring a calm atmosphere in the 
region and normalizing the situation 
afrand dashdamirov deputy head of the propaganda department of 
azerbaijans communist party central committee told reporters the 
compromises mentioned by the armenian delegates would lead to the 
disintegration of azerbaijan 
nagornokarabakhs legislature proposed on june 21 that the area 
be turned over temporarily to the central government in moscow in 
an effort to calm tensions that have led to violent strikes 
demonstrations and riots 
dzhrbashyan told reporters that nagornokarabakh now classified 
as an autonomous region of azerbaijan should be put under the 
control of the russian republic specifically of the stavropol 
region north of the caucasus mountains 
dzhrbashyan did not make clear who was considering the 
compromise but his mention of it as a conference delegate 
indicated it had some official support he did not mention it was 
gorbachevs home area 
gorbachev was born in a farming village in the stavropol region 
in 1931 and worked there for 23 years in communist party jobs 
dzhrbashyan said the stavropol region should be considered 
because it was the closest part of russia to nagornokarabakh he 
said the idea of alliance between the two areas dates back to the 
17th century 
the current communist party conference is scheduled to adopt a 
resolution outlining policy toward the countrys more than 100 
ethnic groups 
grant m voskanyan armenias president said a commission 
drafting a resolution on ethnic relations had come up with no 
specific proposals for resolving the dispute but he said the party 
central committee recommended the conference consider perfecting 
federation of the soviet union and expanding the rights of 
republics

certain wetland areas protected under the 
water bank program will be opened up for emergency hay cutting to 
provide forage for droughtstressed livestock the government 
announced thursday 
the approval will be effective friday in some counties and 
within 15 days in others the water bank program or wbp is 
jointly administered by the agriculture and interior departments 
about 524000 acres in 222 counties of 12 states are in the 
conservation program an estimated 350000 of these could be used 
for haying if declared eligible 
under the program participants agree unless otherwise 
authorized not to harvest hay or otherwise use the land for crops 
for 10 years in return they receive annual rental payments from 
the government 
interior secretary donald hodel said the later authorization for 
some counties will protect waterfowl still nesting in wetland areas 
early next week we will review the status of nesting in those 
areas and determine if some can be opened for haying at that 
time he said 
conditions for haying the wbp land include 
ten percent of the land nearest the wetland will not be hayed 
haying will begin on the land farthest from the wetland and 
progress inward 
participants haying on these lands will have their next federal 
rental payment reduced by 25 percent for each acre hayed 
usda officials said counties already approved for haying and 
grazing of land taken from production under annual commodity 
programs along with conservation reserve program land approved for 
haying in arkansas california louisiana michigan mississippi 
nebraska and wisconsin will be eligible for immediate wbp haying

scientists say they took a step toward 
improving bone marrow transplants for people with cancer and 
radiation sickness by purifying or isolating a type of cell 
crucial to development of blood and immunity in mice 
isolation of the special cell type called a stem cell eluded 
researchers for 30 years until achieved by doctors at stanford 
university medical center in northern california and royal 
melbourne hospital in australia 
the research is outlined in fridays issue of the journal 
science 
the researchers are well on their way to purifying human stem 
cells and growing them in the laboratory an accomplishment that 
could make bone marrow transplantation safer and more available 
said dr irving weissman a stanford professor of pathology and 
cancer biology who headed the study team 
bone marrow transplants are used to replace damaged or diseased 
marrow the substance inside bones that produces blood and provides 
immunity from disease 
transplant recipients include some leukemia patients other 
cancer patients made ill by chemotherapy and radiation therapy 
people sickened by accidental radiation exposure and those with 
certain disorders of the blood and the immune system 
only about one in 20000 cells in bone marrow is a stem cell 
said weissman but the rare cells are ultimately responsible for 
making and replacing other shortlived blood cells including red 
cells platelets and the b and t types of white blood cells 
responsible for immunity 
as a result stem cells are the most important part of 
transplanted bone marrow but such transplants often fail unless 
the donor and recipient are matched closely thats because some 
white blood cells in donor marrow attack the recipients tissues in 
a sort of reverse rejection called graftversushost disease 
if human stem cells can be purified they might be transplanted 
without other cells in bone marrow thus avoiding the failure of 
the transplants weissman said 
purified human stem cells also could eliminate the need to find 
closely matched marrow donors making marrow transplants more 
widely available he added 
pure stem cells also could make it safer for leukemia patients 
to have some of their own marrow removed and then have it replaced 
later after they have been subjected to radiation therapy 
radiation kills the remaining marrow at the same time it kills 
cancer cells in marrow he said 
when leukemia patients have some marrow removed and later 
replaced it can contain some cancer cells which spur recurrence 
of the leukemia or blood cancer by separating stem cells from the 
extracted marrow the stem cells can be reimplanted free of any 
cancer cells preventing the cancer from recurring weissman said 
the researcher also said that in several years purifying human 
stem cells could speed development of gene therapy for inherited 
blood diseases gene therapy involves the replacement of 
diseasecausing genes the basic units of heredity with healthy 
genes

the irancontra prosecutor on thursday took a 
swipe at lawyers for fired white house aide oliver l north for 
filing increasingly disrespectful pleadings with the judge in 
the case 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh challenged norths request 
to us district judge gerhard a gesell that the judge reconsider 
his ruling that congressional immunity given three defendants in 
the case does not compromise the case 
norths motion merely reflects the defendants continued 
frustration at this failure to force the court to afford him a full 
pretrial hearing to which he is not entitled walsh said in a 
onepage reply to norths motion 
apart from their increasingly disrespectful tone the 
pleadings raise no additional issues that have not already been 
fully briefed by the parties walsh said 
in their motion filed monday norths lawyers said the 
procedures and reasoning that gesell used to reach his decision 
about the immunity issue are most notable for their 
arbitrariness their superficiality and their unprecedented denial 
of due process 
a failure to reconsider the ruling would signal to the defense 
and the nation the fundamental unfairness of this proceeding and 
the courts singleminded goal of overcoming or ignoring the 
extraordinary legal and factual obstacles to trial of this case 
the defense said in its brief 
gesell ruled last month that the immunity congress gave north 
former national security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealer 
albert hakim did not prevent them from being tried on irancontra 
conspiracy charges 
the three are charged along with hakims former partner retired 
maj gen richard v secord of conspiring to illegally divert 
usiran arms sale profits to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
the judge ordered four separate trials to deal with the problems 
imposed by the congressional immunity and said he would defer 
further consideration of the issue until the conclusion of each 
proceeding

the remains of 28 american soldiers 
killed in the war of 1812 were taken from canada to their native 
soil in flagdraped caskets thursday in the first repatriation 
ceremony held between the two countries 
there can be no finer expression of the good relations between 
our countries than the reverence we show for these men george 
hees canadian minister of veterans affairs said as he transferred 
possession of the remains to us officials 
the ceremony took place near old fort erie the scene of some of 
the worst fighting of the war on a shaded lawn where their 
predecessors traded musket fire 230 us and canadian soldiers 
saluted the 28 caskets 
among the units participating was the 3rd us infantry known 
as the old guard which traces its history to the war of 1812 
this is the day these men waited 174 years for said us 
army lt col robert trotter they are coming home 
thomas niles us ambassador to canada niles praised canadians 
as good neighbors with a respect for history 
niles compared the effort to recover the war of 1812 soldiers to 
the american governments search for servicemen lost in southeast 
asia pledging we will continue to work on that problem until it 
is solved 
after the ceremony 28 hearses carried the caskets over the 
peace bridge that links fort erie and buffalo ny fighter jets 
flew by the bridge in missingman formation 
the procession continued to bath national cemetery in central 
new york where officials dedicated a memorial to the soldiers the 
remains will be buried privately friday 
a crowd of more than 500 stood in chilly air and a strong wind 
off lake erie to attend the fort erie ceremony 
were all americans really north americans that border 
doesnt really mean that much said hugh lyrea a canadian 
veteran 
heinz hummel mayor of fort erie said the soldiers sacrifice 
paved the way to an undefended border between the two nations 
their death was the beginning of our peace hummel said 
the repatriation ceremonies marked the beginning of the annual 
friendship festival between the united states and canada which 
celebrates continuous peace between the two nations since 1814 
we could not ask for a more symbolic gesture said patrick 
mines a festival organizer from fort erie 
the remains of the servicemen were discovered during residential 
construction in fort erie in october 1987 
archaeologists determined that the skeletons were american but 
were unable to make individual identifications the men are 
believed to have been killed during a british siege on a us 
position at snake hill in 1814 
ronald williamson head of the scientific team in charge of the 
excavation said the victims ranged in age from midteens to 40 and 
died gruesome deaths at least 12 of the skeletons showed evidence 
of tremendous wounds presumably from musket or cannon fire he 
said 
historians say many of those who participated in the bitterly

secretary of state george p shultz 
on thursday called on the leaders of el salvador and honduras to 
protect their fragile democracies and warned of the dangers of 
communist rule 
shultz came to tegucigalpa after a fourhour visit to el 
salvador during which he urged the government to keep fighting the 
leftist guerrillas but also expressed concern about an upsurge in 
politically motivated killings of civilians 
at an airport arrival ceremony in this capital city shultz said 
honduras has advanced economically and socially under its 
6yearold democracy while in nicaragua per capita income has 
dropped by 50 percent in the past 10 years 
shultzs message has been essentially the same since he began 
his central american trip in guatemala on wednesday despite 
difficult problems the regions four democracies are performing 
far better than nicaragua the odd man out in the area 
the sandinistas seek to build totalitarian society on the back 
of a massive military machine he said 
in a show of american support shultz signed aid agreements 
worth more than 180 million combined for el salvador and honduras 
he gave a pep talk to about 250 us servicemen at the air base at 
palmerola his first stop in honduras 
these forces are part of an estimated 1200 us troops who 
stationed in honduras partly as a deterrent to any potential 
military move by nicaragua which borders on the south 
shultzs threeday trip to the region ends friday in costa rica 
and is his longest visit to central america in four years 
while criticizing nicaragua shultz has said little about future 
steps now that peace talks have broken down between the sandinistas 
and the ussupported rebels known as contras 
he has spoken only in vague terms about the failed negotiations 
telling his listeners that pressure on the sandinistas must be 
maintained if the goal of peace and democracy is to be achieved in 
nicaragua 
but he has offered no specific suggestions and has made only 
scant reference to the contras 
shultz scheduled a meeting with contra leaders thursday night 
during a return trip to guatemala 
in el salvador shultz met with acting president rodolfo 
castillo claramount and with military leaders 
about 2000 university students who marched through downtown san 
salvador to demand greater government spending on education also 
protested shultzs visit 
we repudiate the visit of shultz shouted the march leader 
through a megaphone 
we repudiate the students responded 
before meeting the officers shultz said i will say to them 
that we must see a strong effort as we have seen to combat the 
terrorist guerrillas and thats going well 
and of course there must always be vigilance on the question 
of human rights and i will emphasize that as well he told 
reporters after meeting with castillo claramount 
us officials said shultz expressed concern about a rise in 
politically motivated killings of civilians in el salvador to an 
average of 34 a month an increase from a monthly average of 27 
last year 
the administration is worried that a major setback in human 
rights performance could jeopardize congressional support for us 
aid to el salvador which is receiving 400 million in aid this 
year 
castillo claramount is acting in place of president jose 
napoleon duarte who is being treated for terminal cancer in 
washington 
in honduras a key ally of the united states in its bid to oust 
nicaraguas government shultz said the drive for democracy 
contrasts with the situation in nicaragua honduras has for years 
provided a safe haven to the contras 
during his fivehour stay in honduras shultz had lunch with 
foreign minister carlos lopez contreras and met with president jose 
azcona hoyo

a team of us counterterrorism experts 
is in greece to help police investigate a carbomb explosion that 
killed a us defense attache a senior police officer said 
thursday 
the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
10member us team would offer specialized assistance to greek 
police supervising the investigation he did not elaborate 
us embassy officials declined to comment on the teams 
presence in greece 
a bunch of pink and white roses lay scattered thursday over the 
twisted metal fence where the explosion on tuesday lodged the car 
of us navy capt william nordeen 
nordeen 51 died when a carbomb exploded next to his 
armorplated automobile just 100 yards from his house in kifissia 
a northern athens suburb 
the former navy pilots body now at the us air force base at 
athens airport will be flown home next tuesday for burial at 
washingtons arlington cemetery a memorial service will be held in 
athens over the weekend diplomats said 
us embassy officials said the state department would offer a 
500000 reward for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of nordeens killers 
the greek terrorist organization november 17 claimed 
responsibility for the bomb the group vowed wednesday to keep 
attacking american targets until the last american soldier leaves 
greece the statement appeared in the leftwing daily ethnos 
there are 3500 american military personnel currently stationed 
at four us bases in greece 
greek government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos denied foreign 
press reports that greece was unable to take effective measures 
against terrorism 
foreign press reports about the lack of eagerness and 
incompetence of the greek security services are completely 
groundless and innaccurate kostopoulos told reporters 
the senior police officer said the investigation had made no 
headway so far 
november 17 has claimed 12 political assassinations in 13 years 
including those of three american diplomats none of its members 
has ever been arrested 
the group is named for the date in 1973 when troops crushed a 
student uprising against the 196774 military dictatorship 
according to police group members placed up to 88 pounds of tnt 
inside a stolen car which they detonated with a remote control 
device as nordeen was driving by they had stacked bags of cement 
on one side of the car to direct the explosion towards nordeens 
car 
the device is the same as the one they tried to use in their 
last attack they are using them to get around the armorplating 
the police official said 
in january police acting on a tip found a powerful bomb in a 
trash can outside the home of george carros an athensbased 
official of the us drug enforcement agency 
november 17 later claimed in a statement it had called off a 
planned attack against carros

a defense contract freeze proposed by 
congressmen irate over alleged procurement fraud could raise the 
cost of weapons force plant layoffs and lower the readiness of the 
armed forces the pentagon said thursday 
we would be glad to discuss with the congress the question of 
freezing awards of new contracts while the justice department is 
investigating allegations of procurement fraud said spokesman 
fred s hoffman but at this point we feel it would be imprudent 
to apply such a freeze or moratorium 
the chairman of the house armed services committee rep les 
aspin dwis said wednesday that defense secretary frank c 
carlucci should order absolutely no contracts signed for 60 days 
or six weeks with companies implicated in the criminal 
investigation 
if the pentagon froze new contracts the innocent would suffer 
as well as the guilty you may be sure that we will take 
precautions in any awards hoffman told reporters in response 
our contracts have adequate clauses which can be brought into 
play to reopen them and take other action to protect the public 
interest he said 
however we wonder whether the members of congress calling for 
a freeze or a moratorium have thought through the possible 
consequences such as higher program costs production line 
shutdowns widespread plant layoffs and damage to the readiness of 
our forces he said 
but aspin said late thursday he had talked to carlucci and i 
dont think were that far apart in what were thinking my goal is 
to make sure the contracts that are being let now not the ones 
involved in the investigation are free of any taint thats his 
goal too 
hoffman said defense department officials were looking into 
allegations by the coordinating prosecutor in the case us 
attorney henry hudson of alexandria va that some suspects had 
destroyed documents since warrants in the case became public on 
june 14 
the investigation centers on allegations that defense 
contractors and consultants many of them former military men 
bribed pentagon officials for contracting details vital in winning 
contracts worth billions of dollars 
hudson said in court papers that the government has already 
become aware of several incidents of destruction of documents 
related to this case he did not say where 
hoffman said he had heard of none destroyed in the defense 
department but we are looking into it our people are taking 
what we believe to be adequate measures to protect critical 
documents he said he could not to specify what measures pentagon 
officials were taking 
the spokesman also rejected aspins assertion the navy should 
have postponed a 960 million contract announced june 23 to buy 
fa18 fighter planes from the mcdonnelldouglas corp one of the 
companies involved in the investigation 
i am informed by navy officials that there is no 
suggestion of any taint in conncetion with that contract hoffman 
said 
because of the justice department action pentagon inspector 
general june gibbs brown was reopening one contract investigation 
previously closed and reviewing five other cases to determine 
whether any were tainted he said 
overall there were some six matters that are being 
examined hoffman said 
the office of the pentagon inspector general which does not 
have the power to prosecute has a longstanding modus operandi 
that as investigative matters are developed or made public its 
procedure is to review related cases to see if there are any 
potential problems or parallel issues hoffman said 
pentagon officials declined to discuss specifics of the cases 
under review at least one of them is known however because of 
interest expressed by rep john d dingell dmich chairman of 
the house energy and commerce committee 
that case involved a tip to a telephone hotline received last 
august alleging that former assistant navy secretary melvyn r 
paisley and two defense contractors had conspired to limit 
competition on contracts for a 1 billion radarwarning system used 
on navy aircraft 
paisley who left the navy job in april 1987 to open a 
consulting business is thought to be one of the central figures in 
the current probe his home and offices were searched two weeks ago 
after receiving word of the hotline tip the inspector generals 
staff opened what turned out to be a sevenmonth investigation the 
case was closed on march 14 for lack of evidence to substantiate 
the charges 
it was reopened at ms browns direction on june 16 two days 
after the fbi investigation was publicly disclosed

defense department officials will conduct 
hearings in july and august near 11 western sites that have been 
designated as possible bases for the railmobile mx missile the 
air force said thursday 
the air force filed a draft environmental impact statement on 
the plan which has been all but sidetracked in congress and which 
is opposed by ecology activists in states where the missile might 
be stationed 
pentagon spokesman fred hoffman said the air force filing 
initiates a 60day public comment period on environmental aspects 
of the basing plan 
the air force will hold public meetings at each of the 
communities which could be affected by the proposal hoffman said 
despite opposition defense secretary frank c carlucci on may 
18 approved 3287 million in contracts for the railmobile mx a 
missile he says is necessary to counter two mobile missiles already 
deployed by the soviets the 10warhead ss24 based on rails and 
the singlewarhead ss25 on trucks 
the mx can carry 10 warheads and air force officials call in 
the most accurate strategic missile in the us arsenal 
we are not terminating the program hoffman told reporters 
at a briefing we are moving ahead on a plan that we have laid 
out 
we live in hope that if not this year then next year the 
congress will see the wisdom of the approach that we have been 
recommending he said 
the united states never has succeeded in deploying a mobile 
intercontinental ballistic missile in large part because of 
community opposition and had demanded that such weapons be banned 
under a proposed strategic arms reduction treaty now under 
negotiation with the kremlin 
but at last months moscow summit diplomats offered a proposal 
to allow a set number of mobile missiles within tightly defined 
geographical areas that could be inspected by satellites or teams 
from each country that proposal will be debated when negotiations 
resume in geneva next month 
the air force wants to deploy 25 mx trains each carrying two of 
the peacekeeper missiles 
they would be kept at fe warren air force base in cheyenne 
wyo in peacetime then scatter along the civilian rail system in 
times of eastwest tension or war making them difficult targets 
and a deterrence against a surprise soviet nuclear attack 
up to four more trains might be deployed later at as many as 10 
other air force bases 
so far congress has approved deployment of 50 mxs to be based 
in existing minuteman silos but has been cool to putting mxs on 
trains 
the air force filed the draft environmental impact statements 
after the 8th circuit court of appeals in st louis ruled on may 18 
that a judge must consider environmental claims against the basing 
plan but could not rule on the relative merits of deploying the 
missiles on rails or in silos 
besides warren the other air force bases at which mx trains 
might be deployed are barksdale la dyess texas eaker ark 
fairchild wash grand forks nd little rock ark malmstrom 
mont minot nd whiteman mo and wurtsmith mich 
the pentagon said copies of the draft environmental impact 
statment could be obtained by writing to afrcebmsdev norton air 
force base calif 924096448 and more information about the 
program can be obtained by calling the peacekeeper rail garrison 
program ballistic missile office at 714 3826631

arrest warrants were issued thursday for 
the father and three brothers of a novice nun abducted from a 
convent by her family and the search for her continued a state 
police dispatcher said 
the warrants for the relatives of mary susan greve 22 also 
called sister mary cecilia charge them with unlawful imprisonment 
said winslow marsters 
police in new york and ohio have been looking for the woman 
since her father james and brothers dave mark and john pushed 
her into a car sunday as she walked with two nuns near st joseph 
novitiate convent here in the catskill mountains 
weve had no contact with them marsters said 
john greve said earlier this week that the family opposed his 
sisters decision to enter the ultratraditionalist convent which 
is not recognized by the catholic church 
state police had said they would not press charges unless the 
woman wanted to file them but the convents spiritual adviser the 
rev clarence kelly said he believed the greene county district 
attorney ordered the warrants 
the district attorney was not immediately available for comment 
thursday his secretary said 
dave greve said from the greves home in cincinnati on wednesday 
that the family abducted her because of the familys suspicions of 
kelly 
he said his sister removed her habit tuesday and mailed it back 
to the convent but the convent hasnt received such a package 
said kelly 
one of their rules is that by taking off the habit it means 
you dont want to be a part of it she gave up wanting to belong to 
that order greve said she didnt give up wanting to be a 
nun 
kelly vehemently denied james greves allegation that the 
spiritual adviser had forbidden miss greve from seeing her family 
our interest is not to get sister mary cecilia back said 
kelly shes still a novice and novices are free to leave any 
time they want we want to know that she is safe and free and 
we want to be told that by her not by the people that abducted 
her 
the st joseph novitiate convent which calls itself a 
traditionalist roman catholic convent holds services are in latin 
and rejects the teachings of the second vatican council of the 
1960s miss greve joined in 1986

the roman catholic church defines 
excommunication as the gravest of all ecclesiastical punishments 
one that canon laws says separates the excommunicate from the 
communion of the faithful 
the penalty deprives an excommunicated catholic of membership in 
the church while still leaving him bound to many of the duties of 
that membership 
an excommunicated catholic cannot participate in worship or 
receive the sacraments and is refused a christian burial 
excommunicated clerics such as archbishop marcel lefebvre and 
the four bishops he consecrated thursday remain priests but are 
forbidden to administer the sacraments except in certain specified 
circumstances for the benefit of the faithful 
in the roman catholic church the seven sacraments are baptism 
confirmation communion penance holy orders matrimony and 
extreme unction or last rites 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said thursday that very few 
catholics incur excomunication and that many of the cases today 
involve catholic doctors who perform abortions however he noted 
that these are matters of individual conscience and no records are 
kept 
the new catholic encyclopedia says the term excommunication 
first appeared in church documents in the 4th century in the early 
days of the church it said excommunication was a general term used 
to designate all ecclesiastical punishments in modern times it 
said the punishment is described as a medicinal penalty 
designed to bring the delinquent back to contrition and a sense of 
duty 
in the roman catholic church excommunicants are either 
vitandi to be avoided or tolerati tolerated 
canon law states that anyone who lays violent hands on the pope 
is automatically vitandi no one else is vitandi unless he 
has been publicly excommunicated by name by the holy see and it is 
expressly stated that the person is to be avoided 
lefebvre and the four bishops were excommunicated automatically 
or latae senteniae which means they are tolerati 
navarro said in their case only the pope can lift the sanction

communist party chief karoly grosz 
appealed on thursday for dialogue with romania in the steadily 
worsening dispute over how the neighboring soviet bloc ally treats 
its ethnic hungarian minority 
istvan oeszi deputy foreign minister summoned the acting 
romanian charge daffaires and told him that expelling diplomats is 
diametrically opposed to the agreements valid between the two 
countries and the norms of european cooperation 
it was the first official hungarian comment on romanias 
decision announced tuesday to close the hungarian consulate at 
cluj in transylvania and expel its staff members 
grosz who also is premier told western journalists in an 
impromptu meeting that he will go ahead with a planned visit to 
romania because if we dont talk to each other we cannot 
understand each other 
no date has been announced for the trip but it is believed 
grosz will go to bucharest after visits in july to moscow warsaw 
and washington 
the issue of romanias 17 million ethnic hungarians always has 
been delicate but in recent months hungarians have become 
increasingly vocal about it 
romanias announcement came one day after 50000 people 
demonstrated in budapest against a romanian plan to level 7000 
villages and replace them with agriculturalindustrial centers 
hungarians claim the project will disperse the ethnic hungarians 
largely concentrated in transylvania destroying their culture and 
tradition 
hungary claims the minority is discriminated against and romania 
accuses the hungary of interfering in its domestic affairs 
both grosz and oeszi as quoted in a foreign ministry 
communique said mondays protest was not directed against romania 
or its leadership 
nicolae ceausescu the romanian leader issued a denunciation 
tuesday of new actions of a chauvinistic nationalistic 
antiromanian antisocialist nature by hungarians 
romania also ordered the closure of a dormant hungarian cultural 
institute in bucharest 
grosz said he does not intend to raise the issue with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev when he visits moscow next week because 
it is a bilateral issue and not an affair of the soviet union 
he will be the first east bloc leader to meet with gorbachev 
after this weeks moscow party conference at which the kremlin 
leader has called for more reforms in his program of 
perestroika or restructuring grosz became hungarian party 
chief in may replacing janos kadar

the government has evidence that britons held 
hostage in lebanon are alive but is uncertain about the fate of 
anglican envoy terry waite a foreign office spokesman said 
thursday 
based on conversations with freed french hostages in may 
british diplomats were able to draw encouragement that 
television journalist john mccarthy 31 and lecturer brian keenan 
are alive said the spokesman 
but so far as terry waite is concerned weve got no hard 
evidence about his wellbeing or whereabouts he said on 
condition of anonymity in keeping with british practice 
the spokesman said the british diplomats gained no evidence 
regarding the nine americans believed held captive by shiite moslem 
extremists in lebanon 
waite vanished on jan 20 1987 in beirut while trying to win 
the release of western hostages 
mccarthy was kidnapped april 17 1986 
keenan of belfast northern ireland has been missing since 
april 11 1986 he holds dual irish and british nationality and his 
release is also sought by the irish government 
in all 18 foreign hostages are still in captivity in lebanon 
most of them believed held by proiranian shiite extremists the 
longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of 
the associated press who was abducted on march 16 1985 
earlier thursday foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe told the 
house of commons the government had received evidence the british 
hostages were alive he did not say what the evidence was 
reports earlier had said former french hostages jeanpaul 
kauffmann and marcel fontaine freed with fellow frenchman marcel 
carton on may 4 had provided britain with such evidence 
howe reiterated thursday that britain would not compromise its 
policy of refusing to negotiate with kidnappers 
four members of parliament recently traveled to tehran and held 
unofficial talks with iranian leaders about improving relations 
between the two countries one of them conservative legislator 
tony hicks urged howe to respond to iranian overtures aimed at 
improving relations with britain 
howe said thursday the iranians must come to accept that 
there are certain necessary standards of international behavior 
which must be observed if they are to have a normal relationship 
with the rest of the world

commuter airlines must have socalled black 
box recorders in most of their aircraft within three years to 
help accident investigators determine the cause of a crash or 
safety incident the federal aviation administration ruled thursday 
large jetliners already are required to have the recorders 
which provide information about an aircrafts performance and 
provide a 30minute loop tape of conversation in the cockpit 
the devices have been crucial in revealing the causes of many 
airliner crashes over the years 
but commuter planes of fewer than 30 seats have not been 
required to have the devices 
under a final faa rule announced thursday multiengine 
turbinepowered commuter planes carrying more than six passengers 
and flown by two pilots will be required to have a cockpit voice 
recorder 
slightly larger commuter planes carrying 20 or more passengers 
will also have to be equipped with a digital flight data recorder 
that stores such information as air speed altitude aircraft pitch 
and heading 
no commuter planes are now required to have such equipment 
under the rule commuter airlines must have the black box recorders 
within three years of the effective date of the rule which is 
expected to be in 90 days 
the cockpit voice recorder must be included in new aircraft and 
retrofitted into planes already in service the flight data 
recorder must be in both new and inservice aircraft when a plane 
has 20 or more seats there is no retrofit requirement on the 
flight data recorder in the smaller commuter planes that have fewer 
than 20 seats 
although the fdr and cvr do not enhance safety by themselves 
they have proven to be invaluable accident investigation tools and 
have led to numerous improvements in aviation safety said faa 
administrator allan mcartor 
last year congress directed the faa to expand its requirements 
for the black box recorders to include the commuter airlines 
which last year carried about 32 million passengers 
the national transportation safety board for years has called on 
the faa to require the recorders in commuter aircraft earlier this 
year the ntsb cited a number of accident investigations which 
would have been much easier had information from such recorders 
been available

fbi agents thursday arrested a 
woman on charges of kidnapping a newborn by posing as a hospital 
employee 
the infant 2dayold brittany owens was returned to brentwood 
hospital in suburban cleveland in excellent condition a day after 
she was taken from her mothers room by a woman in a lab coat and 
scrub outfit said fbi agent joseph griffin 
clara r horton a 43yearold nurse from cleveland heights with 
a history of miscarriages was jailed on a charge of kidnapping 
griffin said the fbi agent did not give the womans place of work 
but said it was not brentwood 
the woman was arrested after two people called authorities in 
response to rewards offered by the warrensville hospital and a 
crime fighters group griffin said 
when agents arrived at her home they found ms horton with her 
commonlaw husband the infant and three other children griffin 
said 
she had no connection to the mother griffin said she 
apparently just picked this hospital indiscriminately 
hospital spokeswoman nancy sayre said the baby appeared to have 
been well cared for the infant was undergoing routine tests 
thursday night 
the mothers elated ms sayre said she doesnt want to 
let the baby out of her arms 
griffin said officers in looking for the kidnapper had worked 
out a profile of the suspect we felt that the kidnapper probably 
was a nurse who has had a miscarriage or perhaps several 
miscarriages in the past he said 
ms sayre said the kidnapper had entered the maternity ward 
during a shift change wednesday and mingled with family members 
visiting the baby nurses apparently thought she was part of the 
babys family ms sayre said 
at 620 pm the kidnapper took the baby from the mother 
saying she planned to weigh it and return it to the nursery the 
spokeswoman said 
the father of another infant saw the woman carrying the baby in 
the opposite direction from the nursery and alerted a nurse ms 
sayre said the nurse called security but the woman disappeared by 
time a guard arrived 
hospital officials said the mother beverly owens did not want 
to talk to reporters and would not put calls through to her the 
hospital and police declined to release the name of the father or 
other relatives 
the hospital and cuyahoga county crimestoppers had offered 
rewards of 5000 and 2000 respectively for information leading 
to the return of the baby 
ms sayre said the hospital had its usual three security guards 
on duty at the time the baby disappeared 
the obstetrics department is familycentered because families 
want access she said we go by standards and there was a lot 
of activity with family visits

president daniel ortega extended a 
unilateral ceasefire until july 31 and proposed new talks with 
rebel leaders 
speaking to 1200 military officers thursday soon after 
returning from a trip to cuba ortega called the moves a 
demonstration of common sense and responsibility because we dont 
want to give up the possibility of a negotiated solution 
he added however this does not mean that we are going to let 
down our guard because we know that they are not going to keep 
their word and are infiltrating forces from honduras 
ortega proposed holding the talks july 2729 in managua there 
was no immediate response from the usbacked rebels known as 
contras who began fighting the leftist sandinista government nerly 
seven years ago 
earlier talks broke down june 9 
the current ceasefire announced by the government at the end 
of may when a temporary truce declared by both sides expired ended 
at midnight thursday 
a march 1 agreement between the sandinistas and contras included 
a 60day ceasefire to allow for negotiations on a permanent truce 
and democratic reforms demanded by the rebels 
the governments extension of the truce came during a visit by 
secretary of state george p shultz to us allies in central 
america his threeday visit includes guatemala el salvador 
honduras and costa rica 
ortega said shultz was bringing the region a message loaded 
with hate for the people of nicaragua directed at seeking how to

scientists injected 2200 corn stalks 
with a microbe effective against the destructive european corn 
borer thursday in the first approved outdoor test of a genetically 
engineered plant vaccine 
environmental groups did not oppose the tests which were 
approved by the us environmental protection agency and the 
department of agriculture 
the tests of the cxcbt at the federal experimental station here 
are the first approved of a genetically altered plant vaccine 
said peter carlson chief scientist of crop genetics international 
which developed the biological pesticide 
cxcbt was also injected into an acre of corn owned by crop 
genetics on marylands eastern shore a company spokesman said 
only one other genetically engineered crop protector frostban 
a frostinhibiting microbe has been approved for field testing by 
the epa 
i think the result could be reduced use of chemicals for crop 
protection carlson said he said that would be good for 
farming good for the environment and good for the food supply 
the corn borer a moth larva introduced to the united states in 
1908 is one of agricultures most destructive pests attacking 
about 200 plant species crop genetics said it costs american 
farmers 400 million a year according to the us agriculture 
department 
the audubon society and environmental defense fund took a 
waitandsee attitude 
the important question is whether testing and regulation will be 
adequate because cxcbt is just the beginning of a rush of perhaps 
hundreds of similiar products said maureen hinkle the societys 
director of agriculture policy 
carlson said the main purpose of the test is to determine 
whether the pesticide will spread from plant to plant an 
undesireable effect 
the microbe works by attacking the alkaline stomach of corn 
borers giving them ulcers it doesnt affect humans according to 
researchers 
in previous laboratory experiments the microbe killed the 
borers in petrie dishes and sickened them when tested in a 
greenhouse the company said 
jeremy rifkin president of the washingtonbased foundation on 
economic trends said the pesticide hasnt been shown to work in 
greenhouse tests and has lowered corn yields during some tests

teamsters president jackie presser 
stricken with brain cancer and hospitalized with a lung clot had a 
clotcatching screen implanted in a vein below his kidneys 
thursday a hospital spokesman said 
mr pressers vital signs are good following his surgery 
lakewood hospital spokesman david hopcraf said in a statement we 
expect him to continue his recovery throughout the evening 
dr james r bekeny who specializes in blood vessel surgery 
implanted a greenfield filter in the 61yearold labor leaders 
inferior vena cava a vein below the kidneys 
the screen shaped like an umbrella is pushed through an 
incision in the necks jugular vein and is opened and lodged 
permanently to catch potentially lifethreatening clots moving from 
the legs to the lungs 
if he has no more clots it will sit there said bekeny 
bekeny said pressers size frequent bed rest and 1987 lung 
cancer and openheart surgery combined to increase the risk of 
clots forming in his legs presser weighed about 300 pounds before 
he was stricken with cancer 
bekeny said the danger of the clot in his right lung has passed 
the clot which made presser dizzy and weak tuesday and prompted 
his hospitalization has stabilized and eventually should dissolve 
the doctor said 
he was in good enough spirits to thank me following the 
45minute procedure during which presser was conscious but 
sedated bekeny said 
presser was hospitalized just hours after the government filed a 
lawsuit in new york to break the mafias alleged domination of the 
16million member teamsters the nations biggest labor union 
presser had a brain tumor removed may 17 at a phoenix hospital 
and later was treated for a smaller tumor affecting his pituitary 
gland 
he relinquished his duties as union president may 4 to 
secretarytreasurer weldon l mathis because of poor health 
three weeks ago a federal judge in cleveland accepted a request 
by pressers attorney to postpone pressers july 12 trial on

the man who prosecuted a teenager for 
murder and the attorney trying to keep her out of the electric 
chair applauded the us supreme courts decision thursday to 
consider the constitutionality of executing juveniles 
at the same time lake county prosecutor jack crawford and 
william l touchette the attorney for inmate paula cooper agreed 
that just because the justices will consider the issue next year 
doesnt mean they will resolve it 
touchette pointed out the court has heard two oklahoma cases 
involving teenage killers one in 1981 and the other on wednesday 
and neither case has definitively settled anything regarding 
the execution of juveniles 
he said both cases were decided on narrow grounds meaning they 
affect cases with similar factual situations and state statutes 
without addressing the more sweeping eighth amendment issue of 
cruel and unusual punishment 
if they keep hearing the cases eventually they wont have 
narrow state law to decide it on it will be the general 
constitutional issue he said 
on wednesday the high court overturned an oklahoma youths 
death sentence but failed to reach the majority needed to resolve 
the juvenile death penalty issue 
just 24 hours later the justices announced they will accept 
cases from georgia and missouri to reconsider the fate of young 
killers 
court watchers cautioned against reading too much into the 
courts willingness to restudy the issue so promptly 
its foolish to try and predict what the court will do said 
henry schwarzschild of the american civil liberties union in 
washington 
crawford agreed i think its very premature to assume 
theyre going to strike down the death penalty for all juveniles 
he said it is significant theyre going to hear it but it 
doesnt dispose of the issue 
we need an answer it can end a lot of litigation one way or 
another touchette said 
cooper 18 was 15 when she stabbed a 78yearold bible studies 
teacher 33 times during a 1985 robbery in gary that netted her 
about 10 and a car she pleaded guilty 
three other teenage girls were convicted or pleaded guilty but 
cooper was the only one to receive the death penalty 
well continue to press for the death sentence for cooper in 
light of the seriousness of the crime and the maturity of the 
defendant in the case said crawford who described cooper as a 
vicious killer 
in my opinion you cant assess penalties on the basis of age 
because of the wide disparity of maturity he said any time 
you consider a factor that is not a part of the crime you have a 
lot of unfairness 
an international outcry about coopers sentence prompted the 
1987 legislature from 10 to 16 the minimum age at which a person 
can receive the death penalty cooper was not affected because the 
law was not retroactive

ligachev who is reputedly more conservative than gorbachev 
speaking at the conference german zagainov an administrator in 
a scientific institute turned to gorbachev and said in the 
interview with foreign journalists during the summit with president 
reagan you said it would be interesting for you to know what 
comrade yeltsin said to foreign journalists for us ordinary

supporter of gorbachevs reforms and asked why didnt he give 
an interview to our press we would like to know his explanation at 
the conference if it is leftist eccentricity it will get the

janes defense weekly says the united states will 
deploy 51 f111 bombers in britain armed with cruise nuclear 
missiles but the pentagon on thursday denied any such plans 
the british weekly viewed as being authoritative on defense 
matters said in its issue published thursday that the jets armed 
with cruise missiles would replace landbased missiles banned under 
the superpower arms control agreement 
pentagon spokesman fred hoffman said in washington on thursday 
when asked about the report there are no plans to equip f111 
aircraft with any type of cruise missile in the future 
replacement of the aging f111 force is one of several force 
modernization plans that are currently under consideration 
hoffman added 
the recently upgraded fb111a will be transferred to the 
tactical air forces in the early 1990s and will be redesignated the 
f111g the final determination of basing will be fully 
coordinated with all relevant parties including foreign 
governments 
on wednesday the british defense ministry acknowledged in a 
statement that the north atlantic treaty organization was 
considering transferring usbased longrange aircraft to western 
europe it did not elaborate 
however the ministry said deploying airlaunched cruise 
missiles in western europe is not under consideration 
a spokesman at us air force european headquarters at ramstein 
west germany lt col ed neunherz said plans have been under 
consideration for years to adapt f111s to carry cruise missiles 
but no nato goahead was given 
janes said gen william kirk commanderinchief of the us 
air force in europe said the 51 f111s would augment the 
capability of striking targets deep in the soviet union from their 
new bases in the uk united kingdom when armed with nuclear 
cruise missiles 
the intermediate nuclear forces treaty between the united states 
and the soviet union signed in december and ratified last month 
provides for elimination of 1800 soviet and 800 allied 
mediumrange missiles over three years 
janes said f111s will be transferred from strategic air 
command bases in new york and new hampshire late next year or early 
in 1990 to bolster natos flexible response strategy 
the inf treaty covers only landbased missiles with a range from 
300 miles to about 3100 miles 
the us air force said wednesday that kirk confirmed in a june 
2 interview with the omaha neb worldherald that the 51 f111s 
will be transferred on the basis of a oneforone swap with f111s 
already in britain

with gov michael dukakis out of state campaigning 
for president massachusetts ended the fiscal year with a nearly 
400 million deficit thursday and headed into the new fiscal year 
without a budget 
dukakis awaited final action by the legislature on his plan to 
close the books on fiscal year 1988 and on a compromise spending 
plan for 1989 
at the same time a series of tax bills and feeraising measures 
to help the state pay for expanded spending in fiscal 1989 neared 
enactment 
the revenue department meanwhile was busy opening envelopes in 
a drive to collect every possible tax dollar that can be attributed 
to fiscal 1988 
the agency will not close its books before next week but one 
administration official said thursday that there was no good 
news in the final month of the fiscal year 
the dukakis administration has acknowledged that state 
government is technically 397 million short for 1988 
to deal with that shortfall the governor has filed the final 
supplemental budget of the year a proposal that includes a plan to 
tap cash reserves and make bookkeeping adjustments to close the 
gap state law requires a balanced budget 
in recent years massachusetts has often gone several days or 
even weeks into a new fiscal year without a budget 
house minority leader steven pierce charged thursday that it was 
inconceivable that the governor would be out of state 
campaigning with the budget crisis unresolved 
dukakis spokesman steve crawford said the government would be in 
his office friday saturday and possibly monday 
he is in constant contact with his office his chief of staff 
and his secretary of administration and finance are regularly 
discussing the budget process with legislative leaders crawford

the worker craig fogle 19 had collapsed in tuesdays accident 
while trying to rescue coworkers authorities said he died at 
parkview memorial hospital in fort wayne said westley falcaro a

tank to release the cyanide gas investigators said 
in addition to the five dead 24 people mostly employees and 
rescue workers were injured one remained hospitalized a police 
officer listed in satisfactory condition at dekalb memorial 
hospital a spokeswoman said 
the accident raised questions about the training workers receive 
in handling chemicals 
chemical training is extremely important for all employees 
because if something like this happened they would have the 
information so they could react said sonny painter an inspector 
for the indiana occupational safety and health administration 
kirk carpenter an attorney for bastian plating said he 
believes the company met government safety standards 
lance baughman who has worked at the plant five years said he 
was required to pass a written test before he began he said the 
test dealt with proper clothing to wear around chemicals and a 
coding system for identifying the degree of hazard presented by 
particular chemicals 
but he said test basically doesnt tell you anything about the 
chemicals themselves ive been there for five years and i 
basically have had to learn everything on my own just trial and

the first official report to acknowledge that a 
peasant protest took place last week in a village near beijing said 
friday that police who broke it up were unarmed and denied that 
anyone was killed 
the xinhua news agency did not comment on statements by chinese 
witnesses that 60 to 70 protesters were seriously hurt by police 
using electric cattle prods and clubs and that at least 10 people 
remain under arrest 
peasants in guce 37 miles southwest of beijing told the 
associated press on thursday that more than 1500 villagers clashed 
with thousands of armed police before dawn june 21 
some villagers told western reporters that three people were 
killed but those who spoke to the ap said they could not confirm 
this 
the peasants were trying to stop a local petrochemical plant 
from releasing contaminated water from a reservoir into a stream 
poisoning their wells 
the peasants gathered at the reservoir to try to halt the 
release of water but police beat them and used cattle prods 
indiscriminately witnesses said 
xinhua gave the number of villagers involved as hundreds 
and said most left when officials explained that the water level 
was dangerously high and the dam might collapse causing a flood 
the rest who refused to leave were led away by unarmed 
police and the water was released the report said it gave no 
number nor did it say what happened to those led away 
nobody was killed xinhua quoted local party secretary wang 
zuosheng as saying he made no comment on injuries 
peasants told the ap that about 150 people were arrested but 
that all but 10 were released within 48 hours 
on thursday workers were digging trenches down the main village 
road to install water pipes to hook up alternate water sources the 
villagers said their well water was made undrinkable by the release 
of contaminated water and claimed some people had been sickened by 
it 
officials have refused to say what chemicals were dumped in the 
reservoir and the xinhua report did not say it confirmed that 
work was under way to provide drinking water and said 110 tons of 
flour were distributed as compensation to about 4000 affected 
farmers 
the report quoted an official of the yanshan petrochemical 
corp which released the contaminants as acknowledging the water 
contained more pollutants than the amount permitted by state 
regulations he said the company was installing new equipment to 
process waste water in the future

cheering cambodians lined an airport 
road thursday as vietnam pulled its military leaders out of 
cambodia loosening its grip on this longsuffering country after 
nearly a decade of combat 
vietnam disclosed its casualties in the war for the first time 
it said 55000 of its troops had been killed since 1977 when 
vietnam began clashing with the chinabacked khmer rouge regime 
which then ruled cambodia 
on thursday vietnam officially turned over control of its war 
against antivietnamese insurgents to cambodian commanders 
we think the cambodian armed forces can shoulder their 
responsibilities themselves said lt gen le kha phieu a former 
deputy commander of vietnamese forces in cambodia 
gen le ngoc hien the vietnamese commander in cambodia and 
about 300 of his officers were greeted by thousands of vietnamese 
after flying from phnom penh to ho chi minh city once known as 
saigon 
earlier in phnom penh an estimated 50000 cambodians lined the 
citys broad boulevards and the road to the airport as the 
vietnamese officers departed aboard sovietmade aircraft for the 
short flight to vietnam 
robed buddhist monks offered blessings for a safe journey 
onlookers waved both cambodian and vietnamese flags 
the military commanders are among 50000 vietnamese troops that 
hanoi says will head home by the end of the year in the largest of 
seven annual pullouts from cambodia 
officials said 3000 soldiers also returned to vietnam thursday 
by buses and trucks 
the vietnamese have been fighting a coalition of guerrilla 
forces in cambodia that includes the communist khmer rouge the 
noncommunist khmer peoples party and followers of former leader 
prince norodom sihanouk 
cambodian premier hun sen played down fears that a total 
vietnamese withdrawal promised by 1990 would lead to a return 
to power of the khmer rouge 
in washington the state departments top official for asia said 
the world would not accept a khmer rouge resurgence 
we do not believe that that can happen and we are fully 
confident that the international community will never accept 
that said gaston sigur assistant secretary of state for east 
asia and pacific affairs 
as part of recently intensified efforts to find a political 
solution to the cambodian conflict un special envoy rafeeuddin 
ahmed was coming to phnom penh for talks with hun sen it would be 
the first time a un envoy would hold formal talks with the 
cambodian government which the united nations does not recognize 
knowledgeable thai sources said the envoy last weekend traveled 
to the thaicambodian border to meet prince norodom sihanouk 
leader of the threeparty antivietnamese coalition that is 
recognized by the un 
phieu disclosed that 30000 vietnamese died in border clashes in 
197778 with the khmer rouge who killed more than a million 
cambodians between 1975 and 1978 phieu said an additional 25000 
vietnamese troops were killed in cambodia since vietnam invaded in 
1978 
he said hanois troops have been sustaining fewer casualties in 
recent years indicating that the guerrilla forces were becoming 
weaker the threeparty coalition backed and supplied by china is 
said by western analysts to field about 50000 fighters 
the khmer rouge remain a force in cambodia but are in decline 
because they receive no support from the kampuchean cambodian 
people phieu said 
he said 13000 troops have returned home so far this year 
leaving less than 100000 in the country all military advisers and 
experts had also been pulled out he said 
analysts attribute the withdrawal to crushing domestic economic 
problems and pressure from moscow hanois chief backer 
at a departure ceremony cambodian defense minister koy buntha 
pledged to strengthen his forces said to number about 35000 to 
replace the vietnamese whom he thanked at the airport for your 
blood and sacrifice 
hien and his party were presented with garlands by cambodian 
girls dressed in ancient dress as they boarded the aircraft at 
pochentong airport 
more than 70 foreign journalists followed the departing command 
on a separate airplane 
on arrival in vietnam a band played while hien sweat rolling 
down his face under a scorching sun shook hands and accepted 
flowers from youths dressed in white uniforms and red kerchiefs 
deputy defense minister tran van quang saluted and embraced the 
officers

apartheid is the policy of race segregation that preserves power 
and privilege for south africas 5 million whites and denies rights 
and a voice in national affairs to the 26 million blacks

anglican archbishop desmond tutu leaders of presbyterian 
methodist baptist and evangelical churches and the rev allan 
boesak president of the world alliance of reformed churches 
we cannot participate in the elections and we call on all 
christians not to participate in the implementation of their own 
oppression or the oppression of others by voting or by seeking 
office it said 
these elections cannot be free and fair many of the 
leaders of the people are in detention and the peoples 
organizations are banned 
it was the clearest act of civil disobedience by church leaders 
since february when several were arrested trying to march on 
parliament with a petition protesting the banning of 17 major 
antiapartheid groups 
clergymen said at the time they would try to fill the gap 
created by the banning orders and subsequently have pledged direct 
nonviolent action against apartheid laws and emergency regulations 
the council of churches which is holding a fiveday national 
conference this week at st barnabas college in johannesburg 
represents all major protestant denominations in south africa 
except the white branch of the dutch reformed church to which most 
of the governing afrikaners belong

slovenian journalists and an army officer with revealing military 
secrets it was reported thursday 
janez jansa and david tasic both columnists of the liberal 
mladina youth weekly and sgt maj ivan borstner were indicted 
for possessing and revealing a military secret the official 
tanjug news agency said 
all three have been in military custody since the end of may 
when a police search of their homes and offices uncovered photostat 
copies of a classified military document allegedly dealing with the 
yugoslav armys command structure and the combat readiness of some 
units 
the same charges were filed against mladinas outspoken chief 
editor franci zavrl the agency said but he has not been 
detained tanjug cited a statement released by military prosecutor 
col zivko mazic 
supporters of jansa said thursday he had started a hunger strike 
jansa started a hunger strike wednesday that he said will last 
until he is set free bojan korsika spokesman for an unofficial 
human rights committee told the associated press by telephone from 
the city of ljubljana 
the arrests have sparked an unprecedented wave of public protest 
in slovenia where at least 60000 people have signed a petition 
demanding the release of the three 
about 400 church groups unofficial forums trade union 
chapters companies and communist party cells have donated money to 
a special defense fund 
some 30000 people recently attended a cultural gathering in 
ljubljana which featured a rock concert and speeches by prominent 
slovenian public figures 
all three journalists have in the past sharply criticized the 
yugoslav army and former defense minister branko mamula accusing 
him of misappropriating public funds 
borstner was accused of having leaked the topsecret military 
document to the journalists the tanjug statement said he cut off 
the top part of the document which contained the classified 
stamp before handing over the paper 
jansa and tasic were arrested soon after mladina published what 
it said was proof the army was plotting to stage a coup in slovenia 
on behalf of conservatives in yugoslavias southern republics in 
order to quell growing dissent 
although slovenias leadership has refuted the allegations it 
has demanded that the group be tried by civilian courts 
slovenia is the countrys economically most developed region 
its liberal marketoriented communist leadership has been the 
target for frequent attacks from party hardliners in the countrys 
southern republics for allegedly not cracking down on 
nonconformist tendencies 
the date of the trial was not disclosed

federal programs that encourage farmers to 
produce less and export more could be cut back because of the 
drought gripping the farm belt us agriculture secretary richard 
e lyng said thursday 
i think we will continue to export crops lyng said but 
we may not be as aggressive as we have in the past because it looks 
like we will have a reduction in surplus stocks 
lyng told a meeting of producers processors and retailers that 
the agriculture department is working with congress to devise a 
droughtrelief plan adding that it was too early to tell how 
damaging the drought will be 
during july well look at the status of each crop to see if we 
need to make changes in any government programs lyng said 
lyng said the department had begun several emergency programs to 
help farmers and ranchers locate hay and forage for livestock 
several officials at the meeting predicted consumers would soon 
be paying less at the meat counter because the drought by drying 
up pastures and driving up feed prices has forced producers to 
sell off cattle early and at reduced prices 
beef prices should be going down right now said dean 
kleckner president of the american farm bureau if the consumers 
dont see lower prices in the supermarket within the next few 
weeks its time to ask the store manager why not

a 48hour general strike called to 
protest the killing of six coca leaf farmers shut down many 
factories mines trains and domestic airline flights on thursday 
but in this capital city and other major towns banks 
businesses government offices and city transportion operated 
normally 
the strike began thursday and was organized by the workers 
central which represents most of bolivias labor force 
the labor federation also called on farmers to block roads and 
suspend providing food supplies to the cities but there were no 
reports of roadblocks in the vicinity of la paz or other major 
cities 
workers central said in a statement that it organized the strike 
because we can no longer support the abuses crimes and social 
injustice committed by the government 
the statement criticized police for the deaths and demanded the 
removal of us military and drug enforcement administration agents 
operating in the chapare a tropical region to the east of la paz 
where mondays confrontation took place 
the six men were killed by bolivian police gunfire monday when 
thousands of coca leaf farmers surged toward a police and dea camp 
trying to take it over they were protesting usbacked bills in 
the bolivian legislature that would outlaw most of the chapare coca 
plantations 
at least 300000 bolivian farmers depend on coca leaf farming 
and cocaine processing for their livelihood coca leaf is the raw 
material for cocaine 
the countrys conservative government attributed the violence to 
cocaine traffickers and politicians who are trying to prevent the 
approval of the law the us government is conditioning part of 
its economic aid to passage of the measure which would also impose 
stiff penalities on traffickers 
a joint session of congress that was meeting this week to pass 
the bill postponed consideration of the measure after mondays 
violence until a new session of congress convenes aug 6 
bolivia an impoverished country of 67 million in the heart of 
south america produces an estimated one third of the cocaine that 
reaches us and european markets the dea says

time ran out thursday for 19 and 
20yearold drinkers in wyoming which capitulated to what the 
governor called federal blackmail and became the last state to 
raise its drinking age to 21 
a casper bar promoted discounted drink prices thursday night and 
free tshirts during the final countdown 
after several years of bucking the governments dictate that 
wyoming raise the age limit to 21 or lose a percentage of its 
highway funds the legislature earlier this year reluctantly 
acceded 
gov mike sullivan issued a plea this week for a smooth 
transition when the law took effect at 1201 am friday 
we were the last state in the union to adopt the national 
21yearold drinking age and now the attention of the country is 
focused on us briefly he said wednesday 
let us make this change go smoothly and effectively and let 
us hope that it brings the results for which it is intended a 
reduction in alcoholrelated deaths and injuries on our highways 
the democratic governor urged 19 and 20yearold drinkers to 
observe the change with the maturity that you have shown 
consistently throughout this debate 
many 19 and 20yearolds voiced their opposition to the law 
thursday night 
just when my friends all turn of age they smack it to me 
said 19yearold tom evans if i get arrested for drinking under 
age im going to raise hell they shouldnt be taking our rights 
away if im old enough to go to war im old enough to drink 
wayne hassinger a 20yearold at a bar in cheyenne agreed 
once youve given someone a right i dont think you ought to 
take it away he said 
ill just drink at home said 19yearold jim satorius 
while sullivan said the state would not tolerate drunken drivers 
at any age he expressed displeasure with the way the state was 
forced to raise the limit 
to the nation i say that wyoming has complied somewhat 
reluctantly with the edict that the national drinking age be 21 
many of us did not and do not agree with the manner in which this 
came to pass he said federal blackmail should not be 
arbitrarily substituted for thoughtful rational debate on complex 
issues 
while the legislature raised the age limit it did not ban 
19and 20yearolds from bars some communities passed ordinances 
banning them as of friday in other communities liquor 
associations decided on bans of their own 
the natrona county liquor dealers association voted unanimously 
wednesday to ban 19 and 20yearolds from its watering holes after 
the casper city council failed to institute such a ban 
id rather not serve a 19 or 20yearold than see him get 
killed in a wreck afterward said nick kamboris of the paradise 
lounge in casper 
cheyenne tavern owners also agreed to ban the younger customers 
wed really like to be able to keep them in said kc ryan 
assistant manager for mingles a lot of that age group are really 
good regular customers well lose a lot of business but with the 
fines and insurance rate problems we just cant let them in

the military announced a 
shakeup on thursday reassigning three generals and 27 colonels 
during a time of growing instability 
president jose napoleon duarte is dying of liver cancer his 
governing christian democratic party is divided and a leftist 
insurgency persists into its eighth year 
the changes thursday the most sweeping in five years were 
announced hours after us secretary of state george p shultz met 
top officers at the defense ministry to discuss the civil war and 
allegations of human rights abuses by the military 
gen adolfo blandon head of the joint chiefs of staff 
announced the changes at a news conference at his headquarters 
last week blandon and acting president rodolfo castillo 
claramount acknowledged there had been talk of a military coup but 
they dismissed it as idle musing 
the armed forces which have great power and influence under the 
civilian government called thursdays changes routine 
the changes are comparable in scope to those of 1983 when 
what was achieved was a more dynamic army blandon said 
the commanders of the brigades based in chalatenango and morazan 
provinces the two zones where the insurgency is strongest were 
among those replaced 
shultz told reporters he planned to tell the military brass 
that we must see a strong effort as we have seen to combat the 
terrorist guerrillas 
the united states has poured huge amounts of aid into el 
salvador but the army has been unable to end the civil war that 
has killed an estimated 65000 people since 1979 
blandon also said it was probable he would retire in the 
coming months he has headed the joint chiefs since 1983 
he said several senior officers had retired after completing 30 
years of service making way for younger officers to rise 
recent armed forces unrest has been blamed on unhappiness among 
younger officers who believed their careers have been stagnating 
since the 1983 shakeup 
security forces were blamed for the murder of tens of thousands 
of suspected leftists in the early 1980s 
the record improved markedly after duarte took office but 
politically motivated killings have been rising this year many 
were blamed on security forces or rightwing death squads 
duartes diagnosis early in june added to the general climate of 
instablity in el salvador 
the president is now in washington for treatment his doctors 
say he probably has a few months to live his party has split over 
chosing a candidate for the march 1989 presidential elections

in a rare public demonstration of star wars 
technology rocketdyne on thursday tested what it calls the free 
worlds most efficient rocket engine a 2ounce thruster designed 
for use on a missilekiller 
the engine tested at a company laboratory in the hills above 
suburban simi valley was designed for use as a divert thruster 
for a spacebased interceptor in the proposed strategic defense 
initiative rocketdyne said 
it would guide the interceptor also known as a kinetic kill 
vehicle from its base on a satellite toward an incoming nuclear 
missile the company said in a statement the kkv would then 
destroy the incoming missile rocketdyne said 
a kkv would destroy targets through force of impact and is 
conceived as a nonnuclear device the company said 
officials from the air force space division rocketdyne and its 
parent company rockwell international deemed the test successful 
with a weighttothrust ratio of 1to1200 the thruster is the 
most efficient in the free world rocketdyne said 
the engines we were running with around five years ago were 
1to20 said ernie bunch a rocketdyne engineer in the 
spacebased interceptor or sabir program 
officers from the air force space division in el segundo and 
managers from rockwell international watched the demonstration 
rocketdyne officials did not put a price on each engine but said 
the companys contract to develop it was worth about 30 million 
the engine was fired or pulsed for five milliseconds while 
fixed on a stand and then was shut off for a tenth of a second 
this cycle was repeated dozens of times the result sounded like 
machine gun fire

two members of congress said they expected 
many indictments in the investigation of fraud and bribery in 
pentagon contracts after they were briefed in secret session 
thursday by the director of the naval investigative service 
the officials are very very sure of their case re barbara 
boxer dcalif said after rear adm ted gordon met with members 
of the house armed services committee 
its pretty ironclad she said adding that she expects 
many indictments 
rep larry hopkins rky said many many indictments will 
be forthcoming i dont think it will be too long before the 
first of them will be coming down 
hopkins cautioned that this case has a long long way to go 
but when its finished people are going to go to jail 
committee chairman les aspin dwis sounded an even more 
cautious note saying the information collected so far is not 
much of an investigation its been more like an 
informationgathering process from now on with the subpoenas the 
search warrants the investigation is just beginning 
the real test of the system said aspin is how many 
indictments there are 
under investigation are allegations that defense contractors and 
consultants many of them former military men bribed pentagon 
officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning 
contracts worth billions of dollars 
aspins call wednesday for defense secretary frank c carlucci 
to order absolutely no contracts signed for 60 days or six 
weeks with companies implicated in the criminal investigation was 
rejected thursday by the pentagon 
we would be glad to discuss with the congress the question of 
freezing awards of new contracts while the justice department is 
investigating allegations of procurement fraud said pentagon 
spokesman fred s hoffman but at this point we feel it would be 
imprudent to apply such a freeze or moratorium 
if the pentagon froze new contracts the innocent would suffer 
as well as the guilty you may be sure that we will take 
precautions in any awards hoffman said 
meanwhile the washington post reported in fridays editions 
that a company headed by two representatives of defense contractors 
intervened in a foreclosure case to relieve rep bill chappell 
dfla and his companies of 266322 in unpaid debts related to a 
failed health club in florida 
the intervention by racquet club of ocala inc canceled 
chappells and his partners personal liability for a large part of 
their indebtedness and removed them from a lawsuit related to 
foreclosure the newspaper said citing court papers other 
documents and interviews the racquet clubs principal officers 
were leonard kilgore a former chappell aide who then was an 
official of rocket manufacturer avco corp and george dalferes an 
employee of martin marietta 
chappell chairman of the house appropriations defense 
subcommittee told the newspaper that kilgore learned of his 
financial problems and put together a deal to buy out a banks 
outstanding notes on the health club chappell said no one had done 
him any favors and that the deal was an independent transaction 
between the bank and an investors group

the hot dry weather plaguing america is 
likely to shift east and south in the next month and forecasters 
offer little hope that the widespread drought will be broken 
the 90day outlook issued by the national weather service on 
wednesday does indicate a chance of more rain than normal in some 
western sections of the great plains by the end of september 
but in the nearer term the watchwords were for more of the same 
weather that has been parching fields and reservoirs stalling 
river traffic and baking crops and livestock

over half the female state department 
employees in a survey said they were harassed sexually at work 
giving the department the worst record in a study of the problem in 
the federal workplace 
but the department is by no means alone in having a dismal 
record the survey by the us merit systems protection board said 
sexual harassment is pervasive costly and systemic in the 
federal workplace 
in a report issued wednesday the board said 42 percent of women 
and 14 percent of men who responded to its survey of federal 
employees experienced some form of sexual harassment from may 1985 
to may 1987 that figure was virtually identical to findings in the

said in a science article for publication friday that jurors or 
other citizens can make psychological judgments as accurately as 
the professionals thus raising substantial doubt that 
psychologists or psychiatrists meet legal standards for expertise 
psychological experts often are used in criminal trials to 
assess the mental health and the potential for violence of 
defendants in many states the punishment phase of capital murder

europes ancient cities built on waterways know 
well the hazards of depending on bridges some have experienced the 
kinds of problems new york city and other areas of the united 
states are now beginning to recognize 
the oldest bridges in europe cared for over the centuries as 
treasures of heritage have fared very well some for a thousand 
years some bridges built in roman times in italy still stand 
virtually in their original form 
most of europes older bridges are small and not burdened by 
heavy traffic but the modern spans that carry heavy trucks and 
cars are a constant expense and a frequent inconvenience at 
maintenance time 
the us federal highway administration said last year that of 
575607 american bridges at least 20 feet long 243646 or 423 
percent were in need of some kind of repair no comparable figures 
are available for europe 
in new york city the williamsburg suspension bridge between 
brooklyn and manhattan which carried some 400 subway trains and 
100000 motor vehicles a day was found to be dangerously eroded 
and closed in april creating a massive traffic dislocation the 
williamsburg built in 1903 has since reopened but only for cars 
and subway trains 
one of western europes relatively newer bridges did fall down 
12 years ago the reichsbruecke empire bridge in vienna austria 
caved in aug 1 1976 tossing a city bus and a passenger car into 
the danube but it was a sunday morning and the bus was empty the 
bus driver saved himself but the motorist died 
a 1500foot stretch of bridge fell a commission said because 
of a defective pier and shortcomings in its construction less than 
50 years before 
in copenhagen denmark authorities are trying to decide whether 
to repair or replace the landmark knippelsbro drawbridge one of 
three links between the capital and amager island site of the 
airport and major industries 
the first wooden knippelsbro was built in 1618 but the 
existing iron bridge went up in 1937 designed for 9000 cars a 
day by 1986 40000 vehicles and about 20000 bicycles were 
crossing daily the drawbridge opens about eight times a day with 
frequent breakdowns 
i dont like being responsible for that wreck said city 
engineer jens boerbach somethings got to be done about it soon 
because someday the bascules maybe will get stuck and then well be 
in trouble 
bascules are counterweighted seesawlike devices that make 
drawbridges go up and down 
boerbach said renovation would cost 17 million replacement 
would cost 5 million dollars more 
stockholm swedens capital is built on the water and regular 
maintenance of its more than 100 bridges causes long detours 
forcing drivers into a confusing oneway maze 
europes longest bridge the 37mile olandsbron running from 
swedens southeast coast to the island of oland is about to 
undergo a fiveyear repair project costing 10 million to 15 
million 
although only 16 years old steel reinforcements in the bridges 
concrete pillars are corroding 
the dutch having wrested more than half their lowland country 
from the sea have developed bridge maintenance into an art 
the 3300foot moerdijk bridge spans the hollands diep a branch 
of the rhine estuary and when completed in 1936 it overcame a 
formidable water barrier between the northern and southern 
netherlands 
but as it became a bottleneck in the rotterdamantwerp highway 
the dutch managed to widen it from two to six lanes while retaining 
the nine original brick and concrete piers 
in 1978 its 10 steelgirded parts each 330 feet long were 
removed one by one over 10 consecutive weekends and replaced by a 
sixlane concrete highway resting on the old piers which were 
adapted for the extra width during the threemonth project 
traffic used the bridge on weekdays 
the thrifty and resourceful dutch even sent two of the old 
segments to hoogvliet near rotterdam to serve as a local bridge 
west germany lost most of its bridges in world war ii and 90 
percent of the existing ones are about 30 years old 
the west german government spends about 1765 million annually 
maintaining thousands of bridges on its highway system by 1995 it 
expects to be spending about 470 million a year to keep the 
bridges in top shape says heinrich poppinga of the west german 
transport ministry 
england will get 917 million for bridge maintenance in 198889 
of which 385 million will go to 33 bridges the poundsterling 
equivalent of 875 million is earmarked for some of the oldest 
bridges but not for londons 25 thames river spans whose upkeep 
is financed by the capitals boroughs 
the massive tower bridge as evocative a part of londons 
skyline as big ben is not nearly as old as its mockgothic style 
suggests 
opened in 1894 it is a drawbridge raised by victorian 
stateoftheart hydraulics until 1976 when it was electrified the 
stoneclad steel towers contain elevators that carry pedestrians 
mostly sightseers nowadays to highlevel walkways 
the great victorian bridge pile shrugs off serious damage when 
from time to time a wayward tidal current smashes a ship into it 
the city of london spent 7 million fixing it up in 1982 it 
still opens about five times a week for tall ships 
the latest london bridge was built in 1971 after the 1831 
version was shipped stone by stone to lake havasu city in arizona 
as a tourist attraction 
europes ancient bridges do not usually carry heavy traffic 
an exception is paris pont neuf new bridge completed in 
1608 which endures thundering car traffic in the city center as 
one of the french capitals 35 bridges across the river seine 
pont neuf has been restored many times but its basic 
construction is unchanged all material used in repairing it and 
the four others classed as historic monuments is scrupulously 
chosen to respect its character 
no city depends more on its bridges than italys venice built 
around a network of canals the absence of cars is a help and only 
one bridge the 408yearold ponte delle guglie over the canale di 
cannareggio is undergoing some restructuring forcing the 
suspension of one waterbus route 
cement and resins are being injected into the bridge which was 
showing signs of structural weakness it was restored once before 
in 1776 
the ponte fabricio built in ad 62 between central rome and 
tiberina island is entirely original but it takes no vehicular 
traffic ponte cestio linking the island to the trastevere 
district was built in 46 bc and restored in 1892 with a new 
central arch its car traffic is restricted to those using the 
islands hospital 
the ponte vecchio crossing the arno in florence was built in 
1345 and underwent major structural restoration because of world 
war ii damage in the early 1950s and again in the 1960s when iron 
bars were inserted in the pylons it now takes only pedestrian 
traffic 
they really dont make bridges like they used to said paolo 
mazzoni florences environment commissioner if it wasnt for 
the world war ii blasts there would never have been a need for 
structural renovation of the ponte vecchio

for a decade henry cisneros has been 
the preeminent hispanic leader a successful mayor an articulate 
speaker a thoughtful politician a powerful role model 
at the height of his prestige he is moving to the sidelines 
maybe even getting out of politics 
hes turned down an offer to speak at the democratic national 
convention quashed any talk of the vice presidency and ruled out 
trying to spread his san antonio miracle with a statewide race 
in texas in 1990 
even as national attention turns to the power of hispanic 
political clout this year cisneros says he may not seek 
reelection as mayor 
cisneros said of his move out of the national arena its a 
decision that ive made 
for the moment my total and exclusive focus is on san antonio 
issues he said were in a period of tremendous resurgence in 
san antonio after the texas slump and we have many many 
initiatives here that are setting this city in position for the 
long run 
his attention is also focused on a yearold son with a 
congenital heart defect who will require extensive surgery at about 
the same time as the 1990 campaigning season 
cisneros also talks regularly with two businessmen about joining 
them in a corporate venture 
to other hispanics leaders across the country not having henry 
cisneros out front carrying the torch will be a setback 
he leaves a huge vacuum said los angeles city councilwoman 
gloria molina his softspoken yet direct way is what we need and 
i dont know if anyone else can sit down with presidential 
candidates labor leaders or whoever and look them in the eye and 
not give in 
as he steps to the sidelines hell be sorely missed molina 
said 
everyone thinks its a shame but they respect his 
priorities said harry pachon director of the national 
association of latino elected and appointed officials 
cisneros interviewed four years ago by walter mondale as a 
possible running mate says hell campaign for democrat michael 
dukakis this fall and hell announce sept 15 his decision on a 
possible fifth term as mayor 
he often points out hes never put himself forward as any sort 
of official hispanic spokesman or leader and says he turned down a 
chance to address the democratic national convention in atlanta 
because he just didnt have the time 
to take weeks off to prepare a quality major speech and then 
deliver it just adds to the weight of what i need to do here on 
things i have promised to do including projects on water 
education drugs and a domed stadium he said 
he says he doesnt see a gap in hispanic political leadership 
i can see from the jesse jackson experience that it might be 
useful to have someone who could bring people together and speak 
for people in a way that jackson is doing cisneros said 
but frankly the hispanic community doesnt lend itself to 
that there are more differences in the hispanic community than 
there are in the black community my sense is what is happening 
is very productive and that is a lot of leadership is being 
developed across the country

projectionist willie brewer flipped a switch 
at the mountain view drivein sending a stream of film into some 
humming equipment that quickly shot a powerful beam of light over 
car roofs to a huge screen 
the warner brothers logo that appeared was visible to motorists 
driving up the mountain parkway into eastern kentucky where as in 
other parts of the country only a handful of drivein theaters 
survive in an era of video rentals and high land values 
i dont know why people arent coming now like they did two 
years ago said david baker who has owned the theater since 
1957 business is down vcrs have hurt us more than anything else 
that has come down the pike 
baker frowned about onethird of his grassy parking spaces were 
filled a disappointing turnout for a saturday night especially 
considering that the mountain view was showing familyoriented 
firstrun films 
bakers frustrations are shared by the owners of other drivein 
theaters across the country the new yorkbased national 
association of theater owners reports 2074 drivein movie screens 
were in operation last year 
that compares to 3670 drivein theaters operating 20 years ago 
including hundreds that had two or more screens and the peak of 
4063 drivein theaters in 1958 according to the association 
malcom green president of the theater owners group said 
several factors have prompted the decline in driveins including 
suburban real estate development the faded novelty of automobiles 
smaller numbers of traditional families and competition from 
multiscreen theaters in shopping malls 
i cant see where theres much hope for a turnaround 
especially with the high land values said green who is senior 
vice president of hoyts cinemas corp a large east coast theater 
chain based in boston 
drivein theaters were highly popular immediately after world 
war ii green said adding that their golden age lasted from 
around 1950 to about 1970 when the industry entered slow but 
steady decline 
most of the outdoor theaters were built before 1960 on plots 
larger than 12 acres usually far outside of a city on 
welltraveled highways green said in the 1960s and 1970s cities 
expanded and land values increased but the outdoor theaters only 
generated money after dark and in good weather 
driveins became suburban green said the land became 
valuable it became too valuable to devote to a seasonal 
operation 
loading the kids into the family car for an outing to the 
drivein or just for an aimless drive were common evening 
activities in the 1950s and early 1960s green said 
people now are less devoted to driving around in a car 
green said the idea of just sitting in a car has dwindled 
driveins which often show the same films for one to three 
weeks also have a tough time competing with indoor theaters with 
multiple screens that offer several films at the same time green 
said 
many driveins lost their qualifications to show firstrun 
movies in the 1970s and switched to actionoriented films 
frequently with sexual themes green said as a result parents 
stopped taking children to driveins and a generation has missed 
the outdoor movie experience he said 
jack absher who owns indoor theaters with 15 screens in eastern 
kentucky closed the prestonsburg drivein the last of three 
driveins he once owned two years ago unlike green he sees only 
one reason for the decline of driveins 
i blame it solely on daylightsavings time absher said 
when daylightsaving time was introduced permanently in the late 
1960s the starting time for summer drivein movies went from about 
8 pm to around 9 pm many people absher said found they could 
no longer attend and then get up in time to go to work in the 
morning 
but in stanton children can still watch the movies on blankets 
next to their parents car the smell of popcorn continues to fill 
the night air as shadowy figures make their way to the concession 
stand amid the soundtrack echos from hundreds of window speakers 
and baker says he plans to hold out until the drivein movie 
business booms again or outdoor theaters become so scarce that 
people will drive long distances to view his big screen 
people will come back he predicted i think one of these 
days people will go out looking for a drivein movie

california and new york bicoastal dynamos that generate much 
of the nations intellectual financial and social energy are far 
apart in tradition outlook and image 
new and old la cool and manhattan brash hollywood hipster 
and madison avenue huckster 
new york and california have long been targets of the nations 
wisecracks yet the profound influence they exert over americans 
way of life finances and collective consciousness is no joke 
nearly onehalf of those who made forbes magazines list of 400 
richest americans live in the two states 
those who make it big in either place from ronald reagan and 
tax rebel howard jarvis to mario cuomo and real estate mogul donald 
trump usually end up as familiar figures in the rest of the 
united states 
in economic terms california is riding the crest of a boom as 
americas gateway to the thriving pacific rim new york which grew 
to dominance as americas chief portofentry from europe is 
enjoying an upswing itself 
but the empire state is also struggling to phase out its 
decaying manufacturing industries and replace them with the kind of 
hightechnology and defenseoriented companies that have become a 
mainstay of californias economy 
while new yorks metropolitan area is still the largest in the 
country with 18 million inhabitants including many in new jersey 
and connecticut suburbs metropolitan los angeles estimated 
population in 1986 was 131 million and growing so fast it could 
have more people than new york by early next century 
the ports of los angeles and san diego have already surpassed 
the port of new york and new jersey in cargo volume 
were no 1 in everything from peaches to phds said 
california gov george deukmejian california is home to more 
engineers more scientists and more nobel laureates than any state 
in america 
cuomo reacts defensively noting that californias governor is 
himself a new york native 
if you compare us to california we do better everywhere 
said new yorks governor they say they have more computer chip 
companies who cares i mean so what you took one category 
computer chips we have more bowling ball manufacturers 
rivalries aside if they were independent countries california 
would have the sixth richest economy in the world and new york 
would be about two places back 
new yorks wall street continues to be the financial nerve 
center of the globe 
californias television and movie industries have long showed 
americans how to walk and talk what to wear and even how to hold 
their cigarettes new yorks madison avenue advertising firms have 
told americans what to buy and where and sometimes why 
new york and california project styles so distinct that many 
americans are repelled without ever visiting either place are the 
stereotypes of laidback californians and gruff new yorkers really 
true 
on a recent sunny day in west hollywood a friend of jane thorne 
told the transplanted new yorker he was going whalewatching i 
said what thorne recalled finding it hard to believe that 
someone would go to sea simply to eyeball a whale 
and janet lowry still thinks about her first visit to a pizza 
parlor after moving to new york from her native los angeles a few 
years ago 
whaddya want snarled the counterman 
im thinking replied ms lowry 
next the counterman yelled 
political consultant david garth has handled campaigns on both 
coasts and saw a clear difference in approach but keep in mind 
hes from new york 
in new york when they stab you they stab you in the 
stomach he said in california when they stab you they stab 
you in the back they rub your back first and then they put a knife 
in it theyre all nice 
californias political system produced president reagan and 
before him richard nixon new yorks produced theodore and franklin 
roosevelt among other presidents 
and yet the two states political systems could hardly be more 
different 
in california voters have directly enacted laws creating new 
regulatory agencies and have used the states unusual voter 
confirmation process to oust their chief justice and change the 
direction of their highest court californias proposition 13 
pushed by jarvis in 1978 cut local property taxes in half chopped 
7 billion a year out of the local government tax base and set off 
a national tax revolt movement 
in new york where there is no initiative process only the 211 
state legislators vote on such issues 
misconceptions about the two states abound 
electronics and tourism not entertainment are californias 
biggest industries farming remains a key component of the economy 
despite being the nations most populous state with more than 28

every night about midway through 
panorama of the day one of polands most popular news 
programs a pert blond american pops up on the screen and says in 
english this is headline news im bobbie battista 
that one line has been enough to make the cnn anchor the 
bestknown american television personality in poland as she 
learned as the official guest of polish television recently 
in krakow children clamored to find out the name of her 
favorite rock star in czestochowa monks lined up for her 
autograph and everywhere her polish fans wanted to know much 
money an american anchor makes 
her celebrity status has both pleased and baffled the sevenyear 
cnn veteran the viewers dont even see me that much every night 
like for two minutes and i barely say anything battista said 
rarely it seems has the global network gotten so much for so 
little 
were on in 60 countries at this point and we get letters from 
all over the place but nowhere has the impact been greater than in 
poland i think it just goes with their fascination with 
anything western she said 
this april cnn signed a deal with poland under which its 
broadcasts will be carried regularly on staterun television poles 
privileged enough to own satellite dishes have been able to pick up 
cnn in english for several years 
under the agreement polish television can use cnns 
international feed for domestic broadcast the sixhour time 
difference makes battistas midday anchor shift in atlanta an ideal 
pickup for panorama which airs nightly at 930 pm in warsaw 
each day panorama uses one cnn headline news report which 
it intersperses with a similar report from the soviet evening news 
program vremya in addition to clips from polish tv 
above all panorama is able to present different points of 
view of what is going on in the world even if the subjects are the 
same there is a different point of view said jozef wegrzy the 
director of polish televisions second channel which produces 
panorama 
the international angle and the programs fastpaced formula 
have earned it an average of 12 million viewers a night since it 
went on the air just over a year ago 
polish tv tapes and translates the cnn report daily and has the 
right to edit it while still in atlanta battista received a 
couple of tapes of the program which the poles had retranslated in 
english and sent back to her 
i was suprised a couple of times because i kind of looked at 
the screen and thought thats not what i said so thats of some 
concern but for the most part theyre being pretty 
straightforward with it she said 
on a recent visit battista the journalist became battista the 
cnn diplomat she taped a talk show with daniel passent editor of 
the weekly polityka and the show closer to your world a 
roundtable discussion program that includes foreign journalists 
it was a new role for a woman used to asking the questions and 
one that precluded her from making a pilgrimage to gdansk to 
interview solidarity leader lech walesa one person most firsttime 
journalists to poland try to see 
despite her success as a television personality battista 
appeared eager to get back on the other side of the camera 
no doubt her polish fans were eager as well while she has been 
visiting panorama was obliged to air its cnn segments without 
her

if the economic news scares you accompanied as 
it usually is with ominous commentary from the experts you 
might consider the undistinquished record of worry over recent 
months 
you can pick your time period but this one begins last october 
when those who claim to know told you the stock market crash would 
scare business and consumers into retrenchment 
neither retrenched they barely flinched business actually 
added more to its spending plans for better production facilities 
consumer spending slowed but not by much whatever it was 
destined to slow anyway 
meanwhile the stock market has recovered about 400 million of 
the trillion dollars lost in the crash 
the anticipated recession didnt come those who claim to know 
still say it is coming someday theyll be correct of course 
because recessions eventually come but the imminent 
descriptive is out wait til next year 
the market crash the recession to come and inflation and the 
big budget and trade deficits and all those other bad things would 
cause the dollar to freefall and cause foreign investors to flee 
the experts warned it didnt happen 
neither did the budget deficit continue to grow to the heavens 
it slowed and now it appears the deficit next year might decline 
to 29 percent of gross national product down from 33 percent 
this year 
the trade balance didnt continue to worsen it improved the 
savings rate didnt continue to decline it has risen since last 
fall the consumer debt position hasnt continued to rise in a 
straight line the rate of growth has turned down 
you may recall that the level of factory utilization was rising 
into very dangerous territory according to some warnings because 
with little idle capacity available there would be production 
snafus and higher prices dangerous territory became a summer 
meadow 
rising employment would mean fewer workers available to operate 
the nations factories that said the people who know would mean 
upward pressure on wages but recent wage agreements have been 
below the inflation rate 
lots of the old problems are still there and most likely they 
will remain a threat for a long time to come and there is a big 
new one the drought which is likely to force up prices of some 
commodities 
but now the popular economic analysis is one that shows 
differences instead of similarities between the crash of 1987 and 
the stock market debacle of 1929 that ushered in the great 
depression of the 1930s 
a typical one commodity prices plunged after the 1929 crash but 
rose after the 1987 crash industrial production fell steeply in 
1929 but rose in 1987 employment fell in 1929 but rose in 1987 
business spending fell in 1929 but rose in 1987 federal reserve 
policy tightened in 1929 but became looser in 1987 
the people who claim to know are quieter now they are less 
inclined to extrapolate into infinity the latest negative change in 
prices or interest rates besides they have fewer listeners 
given time there will be new things to worry about because that 
is the way it has always been oddly a period of good economic 
news is a fertile field for the growing of fears 
but now we know that some of the fears are fiction and that 
given the great volume of them that are presented to us by the 
folks who claim to know relatively few of them come to pass

many old houses in the casbah are in 
danger of collapse and authorities are moving people out of them 
under a plan to turn the famed district into a luxury neighborhood 
people whose houses are condemned are being moved to the 
lowincome apartment blocks on the outskirts of the city 
the massive urbanrenewal project may ultimately cost hundreds 
of millions of dollars the goal is to convert the casbah into a 
luxurious haven that few present inhabitants will be able to afford 
while some residents are happy to get out others say they would 
prefer to stay with the casbah squalor and all as it is 
every house in the steeply sloping district has a roof terrace 
with a clear view of the mediterranean people who want to stay say 
they prefer the vermin the sagging floors and the virtually 
nonexistent plumbing to a modern but featureless housing 
development with no view beyond the next building 
the casbah still has a friendly intimate atmosphere unknown in 
the new developments 
lowincome residents do not qualify for the outside housing 
until their homes are condemned or collapse thousands are 
squatters who live as many as 10 to a room sharing one communal 
washroom on each floor yet many inhabitants own color television 
sets refrigerators and ovens 
i think we must improve the social conditions here said an 
official of the rebuilding project who under government rules can 
only speak on condition that he remain anonymous 
to really preserve the place there must be a higher level of 
wealth if we keep the same type of people we will get the same 
problems in 20 years 
most houses in the casbah date back to the 16thcentury turkish 
pirateconqueror barbarossa the french added a few buildings in 
the 19th century but kept the narrow alleys intact during the 
algerian war for independence against the french the casbah was 
the scene of the battle of algiers when french paratroopers routed 
the concealed nationalist insurgents in months of bloody 
housetohouse fighting 
the yellowed peeling facades contrast sharply with the 
sparkling coastline below children jump over puddles of leaking 
drainage water in alleys teeming with halfstarved cats garbage is 
occasionally carried off in hampers strapped to the backs of mules 
workmen in dark workshops fashion leather soles for shoes or saw 
wood women wearing veils of white lace carry their meager 
groceries into homes that still have long vertical slits in the 
walls the slits once gave harem women their only view of outside 
life 
some of the collapsed or demolished houses have given way to 
paved empty lots now used by children to kick soccer balls around 
the state is beginning to realize that people live in terrible 
conditions here and that the area is a national heritage the 
project official said 
he admitted the project is moving slowly bcause money is tight 
around 15000 people have been moved out since 1985 he said and 
the planners want to remove at least 10000 more of the 
approximately 60000 remaining residents 
detailed plans for the reconstruction have not been published 
and no overall budget has been allocated for a project which could 
take decades to complete 
authorities have no systematic program for the future occupation 
of renovated houses the official said but the casbahs old 
occupants relocated in new houses in algiers outskirts are not 
likely to return 
governmentcontrolled rents on renovated buildings are about 40 
times higher than on the old homes 
dr fadila bastandji a physician recently set up a clinic in 
one of a handful of fully restored houses in an interview she 
said she constantly has to keep out tourists who think the 
building rented from the government is open to the public because 
of its authentic structural design 
under rules set by the government reconstruction must follow 
the style and outline of the old buildings modern materials 
particularly concrete are banned 
art historian ben dabbagh inherited a frenchbuilt 19thcentury 
casbah house from his grandparents 
people have different values nowadays he said they have 
less pride and dignity than they used to have its only by 
evacuating the casbah that it will live unless the dead return

the french have croissants the 
english their kidney pie and italians their ice cream argentines 
have their alfajors 
alfajors simply are cookie sandwiches usally filled with a 
caramellike spread called dulce de leche and covered with white or 
dark chocolate 
theyre equally popular with grownups and children 
delicious vei never get tired of 
them trassens said fingering an inchthick alfajor 
alfajors remain almost exclusively argentine because of the 
popularity of dulce de leche a widely used substance that is made 
by boiling down milk and adding sugar dulce de leche is used on 
everything from ice cream to pancakes toast cakes and pies 
nobody in the world consumes dulce de leche like the 
argentines said abel ayala deputy director of the business 
industry and production union 
trassens first began making his alfajors by using his 
greatgrandfathers cookie recipe and dulce de leche in 1946 at his 
cafe in azul a farm community not far from mar del plata two 
years later he moved to mar del plata 
now the nations sixth largest city with 475000 residents mar 
del plata makes alfajors for everyone except for those who buy 
them from a small factory in nearby uruguay much of mar del 
platas alfajors are bought by the 2 million or so vacationers who 
come every year for the beaches and casinos 
trassens said investors from the united states and brazil have 
tried to woo him to begin production in their countries of his 
brand of alfajors which sell for about 20 cents each less by the 
dozen 
trassens said he is considering expansion noting in particular 
the rising numbers of hispanics in the united states who might have 
heard of the alfajor but he added special problems might arise 
with the dulce de leche which goes dry in about three weeks 
virtually all alfajors are eaten within two weeks or so in 
argentina and they contain no preservatives which trassens said 
would be required to manufacture them in the united states 
packaging most are sold in aluminum wrappers would have to 
change too he said 
in argentina industry statistics indicate that about 300 
businesses make alfajors from roundthecorner sweetshops to 
havanna which began four decades ago when a greek cafe owner 
who probably couldnt spell cubas capital morales said in 
reference to the companys name offered them to customers 
outside mar del plata terrabusi and bagley of buenos aires are 
major sellers of alfajors while smaller drierstyle fruit 
alfajors are made in large quantities in the interior cities of 
cordoba and santa fe 
others use variations that contain mint marmalade coconut rum 
or nuts

the episcopal church is struggling through a 
quagmire of controversy over sex while also straining to reverse a 
gradual decline in membership 
efforts to increase adherents through greater evangelism had 
wide support as the the denomination this saturday begins its 
triennial governing convention in detroit 
but conflict over sexuality was rippling through the 
27millionmember denomination on several fronts regarding 
inclusive liturgical language abortion and sexual relationships 
at the center of the controversy is a report on sexual morality 
from the churchs commission on human affairs and health directed 
three years ago to examine the issue 
also firing up the conflict has been a 110page study guide 
sexuality a divine gift issued by a church headquarters unit 
several bishops have charged it ignores church standards of 
celibacy in singleness and sex only in marriage 
further exacerbating the issue was action early this year by the 
newark n j diocese encouraging ministry to those living out 
alternate patterns of sexuality 
this was interpreted as condoning clergy blessings of committed 
homosexual unions 
however the churchwide study commission headed by bishop 
george n hunt of rhode island makes no such recommendations but 
expresses differences over the morality of some sexual unions apart 
from marriage 
it affirms that lifelong monogamous marriage is the normal 
or ideal context for intimate sexual expression between 
christians and says extramarital sex is immoral because it 
violates the marital bond 
however the report adds that some premarital and postmarital 
sexual relationships intend to mirror at a significant level 
the faithfulness of marriage 
some of them surely have the potential to be lifegiving and 
not lifedraining however a widespread and increasing number of 
these relationships appear to us to witness more to promiscuity 
than to fidelity 
consequently such relationships should not be affirmed by the 
church as acceptable the commission says although it could not 
agree on whether some sex relations apart from marriage are moral 
the commission which heard testimony at seven meetings during 
the past triennium says the debate is perhaps even more 
important than the conclusions the moral standards of our society 
are in flux 
old standards may yet prevail in the future new standards may 
well be the traditional standards adapted and redefined to meet new 
circumstancesone thing of which we are certain is that 
yesterdays standards are being challenged profoundly in this 
generation 
the conventional moral stance of the church proclaiming 
faithful marriage or celibacy as the only moral options open to a 
christian has been weakened considerably in the practice of our 
people the report says 
it says the majority of our church is committed to an attempt 
to call society to traditional sexual standards but a 
significant minorityis convinced the time has come to begin a 
process that will enable christians to think through new moral and 
sexual options in the light of new realities 
citing the aids epidemic the report says society is painfully 
learning that sexual activity is not an individual matter one has 
sex with life and death consequences with everyone who has slept 
with ones sexual partner 
we are once more realizing that sexual activity has both 
private and coporate significance 
the report recommends stiffening the churchs stand on abortion 
condemning it as a means of birth control family planning sex 
selection or for any reason of mere convenience 
abortion always has a tragic dimension the report says 
deploring the numbers of abortions but saying legislation should 
not prohibit all abortions but should protect individual conscience 
about it 
in regard to the churchs loss of about 500000 members in the 
last 25 years a report by a commission on evangelism and renewal 
says 
it is obvious to us that if nothing is done to remedy this 
situation the episcopal church is in very real danger of becoming 
an exotic fossil 
quoting the churchs presiding bishop edmond l browning the 
report says the time has come for active evangelism we 
episcopalians are often accused of talking to much of our heritage 
and too little of god and gods work among us 
a blurred theological vision has sapped the church of 
evangelistic drive the report says adding 
much of the contemporary theology of our church has espoused 
philosophical skepticism which is opposed to certainty commitment 
and conversion a historical god may be affirmed but not an 
empowering god who leads to lifechanging renewal 
we have become a trendy people tossed to an fro and carried 
about with every wind of doctrinethe result is a witness 
shorn of power 
the report cites this attitude evangelize we episcopalians 
dont do that 
but the report says theyve got to get at it and recommends 
actions rallying all members to work at sharing their faith with 
others and urging congregations to be centers for extending the 
gospel

henry kissinger was shocked george bush had 
been a loyal soldier as chairman of the republican national 
committee in the aftermath of watergate and now in late 1974 
president ford was offering a choice of glittering rewards london 
or paris 
no thanks bush said how about the ambassadorship to china 
when henry heard id turned down the ambassadors posts in 
london and paris in order to go to beijing he was baffled bush 
wrote in his memoirs therell be some substantive work from time 
to time bush remembered kissinger as saying but for the most 
part youll be bored beyond belief 
kissinger may have been right according to bush and several 
people who worked with him those 13 months the us liaison 
mission in beijing was set up in the early 1970s to exist not to 
do anything in particular 
kissinger himself handled the tricky diplomacy there were few 
bilateral cultural military or economic ties and there wasnt much 
of a social whirl not at a time when chinese leaders were still 
wary of the west bushs predecessor david bruce rarely left the 
us compound 
boring or not the time bush spent in beijing and as us 
representative to the united nations from 1971 to 1973 gave him 
something rare on a presidential resume service as an ambassador 
only former president william howard taft came close with service 
as governor general of the philippines 
bush now set to become the republican presidential nominee 
became a member of the diplomatic set in 1970 after he lost a 
senate race in texas to democrat lloyd bentsen the consolation 
prize was an appointment to the united nations by president nixon 
who took a lot of heat for putting a diplomatic rookie like bush in 
the prestigious post 
the major controversy during bushs tenure was the fight over 
chinese membership in the world body 
kissinger and nixon eager to foster good relations with china 
without appearing to abandon longstanding allies in taiwan favored 
dual representation that would permit both chinas to stay 
bush lobbied for dual representation but on oct 25 1971 the 
proposal was defeated by the un general assembly and taiwan was 
expelled 
bush said later that when he left the united nations in january 
1973 to head the republican national committee he was more critical 
of the world body than he had been before having seen its flaws 
and limitations first hand 
in september 1974 bush his wife barbara and their newly 
acquired cocker spaniel c fred bush headed for beijing where 
they spent the next year and a month living in a walled compound 
guarded by greenuniformed soldiers of the peoples liberation army 
the pla guards were really there to keep an eye on us and to 
make sure no chinese people could get in to talk to us a member 
of bushs beijing staff said in a recent interview the diplomat 
who still works in the us government spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
i remember one time a us ambassador to another country came 
to visit and the guards wouldnt let the ambassadors wife into the 
compound because she was asian they wouldnt believe she wasnt a 
chinese citizen the diplomat said 
bush found out about it and went crazy he called up the 
foreign ministry and demanded an apology i think if he had an 
ak47 he would have gone down there and shot up the ministry it 
was the only time i saw him lose his temper 
according to the diplomat and others who worked on bushs staff 
including john holdridge the deputy chief of mission there was 
little contact between american diplomats in beijng and the chinese 
government 
for one thing it was not until the carter administration that 
full diplomatic relations were exchanged and in the waning days of 
mao tsetung chinese officials cautious about the succession were 
not eager to stick their necks out and become friendly with any 
western diplomats much less americans 
we were very much isolated said holdridge who later became 
ambassador to indonesia we tried to keep busy to make contacts 
and to carry on diplomacy but there was very little interraction 
with the chinese 
it was tough duty said peter bergin a member of the 
mission staff there really wasnt very much to do 
by all accounts bush spent much of the time improving his 
alreadygood tennis skills he played on courts at beijings 
international club with other diplomats and a club pro provided 
by the chinese government 
the envoy and his wife also spent hours cycling through the 
dusty and windy streets of beijing drawing stares from chinese 
citizens unaccustomed to westerners the sight of bushs dog was 
also a novelty in a country where canine was as common on a menu as 
on a leash 
bush used the time very wisely in a political sense the 
diplomat who spoke privately said in those days it was nearly 
impossible to get a visa to visit china but you could get around 
it by getting an invitation from the head of the liaison office 
bush used it like a political plum and there was a steady 
stream of important visitors from the states it was his way of 
keeping his hand in us politics 
bush wrote that one of the highlights of his tour was a meeting 
with mao who lived in seclusion and died the next year 
i am going to heaven soon bush quoted mao as saying i 
have already received an invitation from god 
bush soon got an invitation too ford asked him to run the 
central intelligence agency and his diplomatic career was over

available at plants in nearby flint pontiac and ypsilanti 
that is a letdown for visitors to the automotive capital of 
north america 
i think theyre surprised and somewhat disappointed said 
mary ellen mccormick program planner for detroit upbeat a company 
offering tours of the area so we attempt to show as much of the 
auto influence by showing the auto baron mansions and by driving 
past some of the plants 
plant closings in the area have left little for visitors to see 
tours at general motors corps fleetwood cadillac plant were 
discontinued before it closed in december and tours at gms fiero 
plant in pontiac will end soon because that facility is scheduled 
to close this year 
one of the areas most popular auto plant tours used to be ford 
motor cos massive dearborn rouge complex the tours were the idea 
of company founder henry ford there visitors could see raw 
materials entering one end of the plant and the finished product 
driven out the other 
you could see the ore boats pull up and the steel being made 
and then go to the assembly plant and see it put together said 
tom kish ford special projects administrator 
rouge tours were discontinued in the early 1980s but that 
hasnt ended requests for a looksee at the facility which now 
produces the mustang 
i get people who call and say i toured your rouge plant 
years ago and it was wonderful now i want to show my 
grandchildren ford spokeswoman judith muhlberg said 
ford is considering resuming tours at rouge and at assembly 
plants near detroit in wayne and wixom ford spokesman jim maxwell 
said 
most detroit visitors looking for an auto plant tour are 
directed to gms buick city plant in flint said colleen robar of 
the metropolitan detroit convention amp visitors bureau 
there visitors can see the buick lasabre assembled during a 
90minute walking tour that includes stops at the stamping area 
trim shop body shop and final assembly area 
about 50000 people a year tour the plant said marcia mcgee of 
gms flint automotive division 
outside detroit general motors maintains an aggressive tour 
program about six months ago 30000 people toured the linden 
nj plant in two days after a 300 million oneyear 
modernization was completed 
family members of plant employees neighbors of the facility and 
auto dealers were invited to visit the plant which had been 
converted to build the chevrolet corsica and beretta said mark 
leddy spokesman for gms chevroletpontiaccanada group 
he said all of the 26 plants in the cpc group offer some form 
of public tours 
chrysler plant tours were a victim of spending cutbacks in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s chrysler spokesman douglas e nicoll 
said 
the no 3 automaker still arranges tours for automotiverelated 
groups including representatives from competing car companies 
occasional groups of students from abroad also visit chrysler 
plants he said 
no tour policy has been established at the detroit areas only 
japanese auto plant owned by mazda motor corp some community 
groups have toured the plant which opened in september in flat 
rock south of detroit company spokesman jim gill said 
those who help organize tours say they polish a companys image 
and boost employee morale in plants hosting visitors ford and gm 
use volunteers from the factory floor to conduct many tours 
theres a great deal of pride in opening up your plant

soaring land prices and commercial developers 
have transformed hong kongs notorious suzie wong redlight 
district into a complex of office buildings international hotels 
and cultural centers 
in a few years developers predict many of the honkytonks in 
the wanchai waterfront area will be memories driven away by 
dwindling business higher rentals and the popularity of classier 
nightspots elsewhere in this british colony 
the transformation of wanchai from aging lowrise buildings to 
commercial and residential skyscrapers and new respectability 
began slowly a decade ago the pace has quickened and today theres 
a construction project on almost every block 
many companies are moving to hong kong to establish a base for 
their china and regional markets and they need offices explained 
richard cheung associate director of jones lang wootton a real 
estate agent and property consultant the traditional central 
business district is full and it is natural to move east toward 
wanchai 
wanchai was a popular hangout for sailors in the 1940s but its 
dingy dark and small girlie bars became internationally famous 10 
years later when author richard mason chronicled the life of a 
gentlehearted prostitute in his bestseller the world of suzie 
wong 
the book was made into a movie starring william holden and the 
hong kong actress nancy kwan 
suzie wong and wanchai became synonymous 
during the vietnam war action in wanchai peaked thousands of 
us servicemen on rest and recreational leaves spent freely on 
women liquor and temporary solace in the numerous bars crowding 
the district 
with the end of the conflict in 1975 hong kong lost its role as 
a regular leave center for the servicemen business suffered and 
many of the girlie bars and hostess clubs closed 
despite wanchais fading reputation as a raunchy and exotic vice 
den the district remains an attraction tour buses still bring 
curious foreigners eager for a glimpse of suzie wongs world where 
bars are staffed by topless hostesses or waitresses in miniskirts 
shorts or the chinese cheongsam sidesplit dress 
the us navy also visits occasionally but veteran hostesses 
say the new generation of servicemen spends less on the girls and 
more on shopping and sightseeing 
suzie cheung the mamasan at the suzie wong bar we just use 
her name said the bars now depend more on the locals and 
tourists 
in june a convoy of 11 us navy ships led by the aircraft 
carrier enterprise spent five days in hong kong us consulate 
officials said its 9000 personnel converted about 500000 into 
hong kong dollars but only a fraction of that was spent in wanchai 
during the vietnam war business was much better said 
selina chin wife of the owner of the san francisco cafe and bar 
fifteen years ago we had about 40 girls now there are seven who 
dance and 10 who sit at the bar 
the club in the middle of the redlight district is open from 
7 pm to 3 am starting at 8 pm dancers in cutaway leotards 
perform on a small stage in the center of the circular bar 
we used to have them dance topless but nobody likes that 
anymore said mrs chin 
lily who declined to give her full name has been a bar girl 
for nearly 20 years and she recalls the big spenders big ships and 
big days and nights of the vietnam years 
there was the midway the constellation the coral sea the 
kitty hawk and they came twice a year she said many sailors 
big business 
with wanchais metamorphosis the price of land has soared a 
prime site measuring 12000 square feet that sold for the 
equivalent of about 83 million in 1986 went for 311 million a 
year later said cheung of jones lang wootton 
but this has not deterred the areas development last year the 
us chain ramada inn opened a 21story hotel in the redlight 
district near the academy for the performing arts the hotel cost 
474 million and has an openair theater 
two other hotels belonging to us chains the 573room grand 
hyatt and the 609room marriott are under construction as is a 
288 million convention and exhibition center that developers say 
will be one of the best in the world for meetings and exhibitions 
alice fok director of sales for ramada inn hong kong said the 
us chain decided to locate in wanchai because the district is 
convenient for businessclass budgetminded travellers 
she added the bars actually complement the hotel and add a 
certain color

the 12000 residents of port angeles 
fretted that the olympic peninsulas persistent rain would dampen 
franklin d roosevelts visit to see for himself the craggy 
mountains and ancient forest proposed for americas newest national 
park 
they neednt have worried for as the president told them that 
september day in 1937 the park was needed for the old and young 
then but also for a whole lot of young people who are going to 
come along in the next hundred years 
on june 29 1938 fdr signed a bill setting aside 634000 acres 
to be preserved as olympic national park 
today the park is 922000 acres of glaciercapped mountains 
alpine meadows temperate rain forest and ocean coastline the 
nations thirdmostvisited national park with more than 3 million 
visitors a year olympic also remains one of the wildest and has 
won distinction from the united nations educational scientific and 
cultural organization as an international biosphere reserve and 
world heritage site 
park officials are gearing up for a series of 50th anniversary 
events this summer but are also focusing on resourcemanagement 
issues ranging from pesky mountain goats and vanishing salmon runs 
to animals of the twolegged variety the burgeoning population of 
human visitors 
the one issue were going to have to address in the long 
haul is human impact particularly in the backcountry but also 
in the frontcountry said assistant park superintendent don 
jackson 
the parks crown 7965foot mount olympus was named in 1788 by 
john meares an english voyager who thought it an appropriate home 
for the gods like greeces mount olympus 
while the presence of gods has not been established by 
researchers the park does boast some rare natural creations 
twelve feet of rain a year bathe the western hemispheres 
largest expanse of temperate rain forest composed heavily of giant 
douglas fir sitka spruce hemlock and western red cedar 
the olympic mountains drained by 14 major rivers are home to 
more than 60 glaciers and in the alpine meadows just below the 
peaks grow numerous wildflowers including some unique to the park 
the worlds largest herd of roosevelt elk estimated at 5000 
head lives within the park along with such other scarce species 
as the bald eagle and peregrine falcon 
lt joseph oneil leader of an 1890 expedition to explore the 
olympics concluded that the interior is useless for all 
practical purposes although the heavily forested outer slopes 
were valuable an assessment that loggers then and now would agree 
with 
today there are some people a few that would just as soon 
see parts of the park dismantled for timber interests or 
whatever jackson acknowledged 
standing watch and arguing in favor of preservation are such 
groups as the sierra club and the olympic park associates 
associates president polly dyer describes group members as 
park supporters as long as the park management is not doing 
things that we think are contrary to protecting the park 
the associates think they can take some credit for having shi 
shi beach and intertidal zones added to the parks coastal strip 
for discontinuing olympic hot springs as a resort and more 
recently for reducing the size of rightofway that was cleared in 
building a new road to sol duc hot springs she said 
charlie raines of the sierra club said the hot springs project 
in which the road was straightened and improved was an example of 
the national parks perhaps overzealous road construction program 
where under the guise of safety and visitor convenience we end 
up cutting down giant oldgrowth trees 
why not let people know that this is an old wagon road and 
youre only going to be going 25 miles an hour and driving around 
trees not through them he asked 
the watchdog groups and the park dont see eyetoeye either 
on what to do about nonnative mountain goats introduced to the 
olympics 60 years ago the goats are blamed for damaging the 
sensitive high country 
the park service is carrying out a plan to capture 800 to 900 of 
the estimated 1000 goats and relocate them to areas where they are 
native such as the cascade range if after a few years the plan 
is found not to be working rangers would move in with guns to kill 
the goats 
ms dyer said she thinks leaving even a few goats is a major 
mistake since their current population grew from only a dozen 
animals to begin with 
while goats have become pests olympic so far has been fairly 
successful at dispersing humans jackson said 
only two spots lake constance and flapjack lakes both easily 
accessible to hikers who have only a weekend to reach the 
backcountry currently have limits on the number of campers 
allowed 
this park is behind the curve so to speak in that the volume 
of human impact has not begun to overrun the resource jackson 
said 
increasing human pressure however has caused concern to the 
wilderness society which recently listed olympic among what it 
considers the 10 mostthreatened national park sites concerns 
range from the potential for offshore oil drilling to logging 
around the parks boundary a practice that critics say disrupts 
everything from scenic views to the continuity of the ecosystem 
meanwhile others are thinking not only about preserving the 
park but also expanding it the nonprofit national parks and 
conservation association has proposed about 180000 acres be added 
to olympic to further protect important watersheds and habitat 
but even as such goals are set the association warns against 
complacency in thinking the existing park lands are necessarily 
safe particularly from timber companies that find oldgrowth 
timber becoming ever scarcer 
rarely a congress goes by when a senator or congressman 
doesnt propose deletions of some parkland somewhere for reasons 
for development said destry jarvis vice president of the 
association its not inconceivable in olympic

the rev ellwood e kieser producer 
of the movie romero believes he is telling the tale of a 20th 
century hero 
im not doing a political tract im not preaching a sermon 
kieser said in a recent interview on the set 
but he clearly sees the story of assassinated archbishop oscar 
arnulfo romero of el salvador as an audiencegrabber with 
impressive moral overtones 
i feel he is for the latter part of the 20th century what 
mahatma gandhi was for the first part kieser said 
the movie starring raul julia in the title role and an almost 
completely hispanic cast may well be the first commercial feature 
by a roman catholic order its budget is in the 2 million range 
kiesers company paulist pictures is associated with the 
paulist fathers he produced their television program insight 
for 23 years until it was discontinued in 1983 
last year he produced the television movie we are the 
children starring ted danson and ally sheedy about the famine 
in africa 
our whole thing is to combine entertainment with audience 
enrichment he said 
although he prefers to be called bud greetings of hello 
father can be heard as he moves about the set he also has 
learned enough spanish to be able to say mass for anyone involved 
in the production who wants to attend 
to kieser romero was a mouse transformed into a tiger a 
withdrawn intellectual who gathered courage in response to the 
horrors around him until he was silenced by an assassin 
i have the chance to tell the story of oscar romero to a 
couple of hundred million people the producer said 
julia however believes the archbishops courage always was 
there 
his change came about as he realized the circumstances 
outside of his world of editing writing and studying the actor 
said in an interview in his trailer 
julia groped for the right words to explain romeros emergence 
as a vocal human rights advocate as the situation deteriorated in 
el salvador and emerged in a fullscale war that still persists 
between leftist rebels and the ussupported government 
he started seeing that other reality julia said costumed 
in priestly garb but i think he always was a committed man a 
religious man an honest man 
julia also insisted that the movie is not a political one but 
rather a movie about people 
yet the films script quotes extensively from romeros homilies 
as the violence escalates before the outset of the war in late 1979 
and as the rightist death squads that claimed thousands of victims 
take their toll 
salvadorans jammed the unfinished metropolitan cathedral to hear 
romero conclude his homily each sunday with his report on the 
weeks grim events loudspeakers were set up outside so the 
overflow crowd could hear and as the movie dramatizes the sermons 
also were broadcast nationally 
when you hear the words of a man telling you to kill remember 
instead the words of god romero said the day before his 
assassination no soldier is obliged to obey an order contrary to 
the law of god 
i beseech you i beg you i order you stop the repression 
a lone gunman killed the archbishop as he said mass at the 
divine providence chapel in san salvador on march 24 1980 
although no one has ever been arrested it is widely believed to 
have been ordered by the death squads 
he was an ordinary person who brought forth his courage 
said julia who has listened to many of the archbishops sermons 
and even his taperecorded musings 
john duigan making his first movie outside his native 
australia is directing the script is by john sacret young who is 
involved in the critically praised tv series china beach 
unlike previous movies about central america such as under 
fire and oliver stones salvador romero does not dwell 
on an american venturing into the region but instead concentrates 
on the native situation 
the story just didnt call for an american sacret young 
said none of them were major enough our choice was not to 
leave them out but to tell it the way romero might have thought 
about it 
he also describes the archbishop in heroic terms 
if you told it as fiction it would be unbelievable the 
writer said eventually in that crucible he changed so he was 
not following events he was leading events

my how things have changed the chevrolet 
cavalier a humdrum compact first introduced in the 1982 model 
year as an import fighter has been transformed into a latterday 
muscle car in a newfor1988 model the cavalier z24 
listen to the rumble of the 28liter fuelinjected v6 feel 
the power as the goodyear eagle gt 4 tires grab the road hear 
them squeal as the car races ahead 
hunker into the comfortable somewhat sporty seats and get 
ready for a fine ride in a reasonably priced car 13209 out the 
door for the test car 
chevrolet first tried out the sporty z24 concept on the cavalier 
two years ago but its only in the 1988 model year that the 
general motors corp division has started to hit the mark 
the 1988 cavalier z24 coupe is a nice mix of sport styling 
including air dam on the front and rocker extensions and oldtime 
american car performance the v6 coupled with a fivespeed manual 
transmission in the test car was responsive 
however the transmission could feel a bit notchy it was easy 
to drive the car hard feel the responsiveness but those quick 
starts took a toll on fuel economy 
the suspension firm but still offering a nice ride was 
commendable 
exterior and interior fit and finish was excellent seats were 
comfortable though not fitted with all the gadgets such as 
adjustable lumbar support that are found in some other sporty cars 
the dashboard was easy to read with traditional gauges though 
an electronic instrument cluster is available a light came on to 
tell the driver when to shift slightly annoying until you get 
used to it 
interior leg room was fine in the front but could be miniscule 
in the rear if the front seats were moved all the way back 
the rear deck lid was a bit heavy but was designed so that 
anyone hoisting items into the trunk would not have to lift them 
over the car body just ease them over the bumper inside the 
trunk was flat and spacious 
chevrolet reports that sales of the z24 have been going well 
the division had a 50day supply in early may compared with a 
70day supply a year earlier and a second shift at one of the z24 
plants has been requested in anticipation of additional demand 
chevrolet said competitors include the ford mustang which has a 
gt versions with eightcylinder engine and base price of around 
13000 and the toyota celica st which starts around 12000 
besides the basepriced 10725 cavalier z24 also offered in a 
15990 convertible the cavalier line includes a twodoor value 
leader with a base price of 6995 a sedan at 8195 a fourdoor 
station wagon at 8490 and a fourdoor rs sedan with a base price 
of 9385

socialist guyana has changed course 
dramatically and declared a moratorium on nationalizations while 
opening doors to private business and foreign investment 
its a matter of life or death a very obvious move that 
should have been made years ago anglican bishop randolph george 
an outspoken critic of the government said in an interview at his 
wooden victorian residence 
weve come full circle agreed george c fungon executive 
secretary of the georgetown chamber of commerce and industry 
president desmond hoyte wants the worlds investors to know that 
guyana on south americas northeastern bulge recognizes it needs 
private capital to stimulate what his planners call a quantum 
leap in economic growth 
hoyte victor in governmentcontrolled elections in december 
1985 has dropped much of the nationalist and socialist rhetoric of 
president forbes burnham the leader of the peoples national 
congress government from 1964 until his death on aug 6 1985 
hoyte told canadian businessmen last year guyanas 
nationalization of private enterprise was a chapter in our 
history which we now consider closed after that he told 
potential investors in miami fla there is business to be done 
in guyana now and guyana is willing to do business 
he carried the appeal to london this past may 
hotels are jammed with canadian and us miners brazilian and 
texas oilmen japanese traders and assorted entrepreneurs checking 
out the investment opening 
already canadian gold mining companies and us oil companies 
have signed exploration agreements 
there are some indicators of a great deal of foreign 
interest said raymond ackloo manager of the national bank of 
industry and commerce which was the royal bank of canada before it 
was nationalized 
but ackloo in an interview predicted a considerable lag time 
before one sees any real impact on the economy 
hoytes speeches acknowledge that guyana must overcome its 
reputation under burnham as a bad investment risk 
guyana is south americas only englishspeaking country and as a 
former british colony has close ties to the nearby caribbean 
islandnations its 780000 people occupy an 83000squaremile 
area about the size of idaho 
hoyte is negotiating an agreement with the united 
nationsaffliated international monetary fund imf in washington 
to help guyana resume payments on its crushing foreign debt and to 
free foreign aid suspended because of the arrears 
the foreign debt exceeds 13 billion or some 2000 for each 
man woman and child in a country where the minimum wage is the 
equivalent of 250 a day 
the imf suspended aid in 1985 the world bank in 1986 others 
dropping direct aid include the united states britain and the 
caribbean development bank the united states donated 44 million 
worth of wheat and 32 million in soybeans and dairy products in 
1987 
in an interview prime minister hamilton green rejected the 
notion that guyana is replacing socialism with private enterprise 
the 1980 constitution which establishes a cooperative republic 
in transition from capitalism to socialism recognizes a 
trisector economy public private and cooperative 
it is our view that at this stage the private sector can play 
a more dynamic role green said 
he said nationalization had strengthened the public sector 
we have passed that stage were marching on and we make no 
apologies for what we did in the past he said 
the countrys foreign exchange reserve is practically depleted 
probably the equivalent of less than 10 million 
economic growth is stagnant although sugar and bauxite which 
bring in more than 80 percent of foreign exchange are expected to 
earn a small profit this year bauxite is the source for aluminum 
inflation estimates range from 37 to 50 percent unemployment 
and underemployment are 25 to 35 percent 
workers earning the minimum wage 25 guyana dollars a day 250 
at the official exchange rate but only 83 us cents on the black 
market face prices of 10 guyana dollars a day for transportation 
25 for a pound of chicken 1750 for beef 170 for a single egg 
250 for a pint of milk 10 dollars for the gallon measurement of 
rice used here and 350 for a pound of wheat 
fuel supplies are sporadic bauxite is traded for petroleum 
from neighboring venezuela and housewives wait in line all day 
for a can of cookstove kerosene

the country is rich in potential exports such as lumber and wood 
products shrimp and precious metals diamonds gold and even 
prawns are smuggled abroad and sold for us dollars that then feed 
a thirsty black market 
economists believe the black market is what keeps guyana alive 
accounting for 80 percent of the countrys business activity a 
parallel market not reflected by official statistics and a safety 
valve that makes consumer goods available to the people 
one us dollar buys 30 guyanese dollars on the street 
stores and sidewalks are jammed with contraband everything from 
toothpaste to 15speed offroad bicycles this is in sharp 
contrast to life under burnham whose insistence on self 
sufficiency went to the extremes of banning the sale of wheat flour 
and bread to encourage the use of flour made from rice which is 
locally grown 
the government now looks the other way even allowing government 
stores and the defense department to buy smuggled goods 
the investment opening has not been accompanied by political 
reform 
bishop george and other government critics say that if free and 
open parliament elections were held today the nowgoverning 
peoples national congress party would be forced to share power 
with a coalition 
there is no democratic opening there is an opening to 
investment especially to foreign investment said eusi 
kwayana a member of parliament and founder of the mixedrace 
leftofcenter working peoples alliance 
kwayana said the patriotic coalition for democracy formed after 
the 1985 elections by five opposition parties has unsuccessfully 
demanded that the government democraticize the country the 
coalition declared the 1985 national elections fraudulent and 
boycotted municipal elections in 1986 
cheddi jagan a former prime minister and now minority leader in 
parliament of the marxist peoples progressive party a coalition 
member said in an interview hoytes program is making living 
conditions worse for the people he maintained that public protests 
would bring repression and the death of democracy 
burnham died and hoyte is now moving backwards back to the 
position where he and burnham put us in 1978 back with the imf 
jagan added in an interview 
race plays an important role in determining political party 
affiliation hoytes party is supported by urban afroguyanese 43 
percent of the population jagans party base is among the the 
mostly rural east indians 51 percent of the population 
indoguyanese merchants dominate the countrys commercial life 
michael mccormack executive secretary of the guyana human 
rights association said in an interview burnhamstyle political 
violence and surveillance of opponents have disappeared 
i cant think in the last couple years of any act of political 
violence mccormack said thats a plus under hoyte 
the association advocates free and fair elections 
the government has tolerated the establishment of a privately 
owned secular newspaper the stabroek news often critical of 
hoytes administration 
prime minister green described relations with the united states 
as good and a recent us embassy report on guyana reflects 
us pleasure with economic developments but added that while 
the business climate has been buoyed by the government declarations 
investors are still wary and want others to test the waters 
before they jump in themselves

in the aftermath of labor unrest this past 
spring the government is moving to hasten economic reform 
increase supplies of consumer goods and legalize some independent 
groups in hopes of heading off more outbursts 
but some opposition quarters doubt the government will succeed 
and that more strikes are inevitable 
an unknown factor however is mikhail s gorbachev the 
reformist soviet leader who is scheduled to visit poland sometime 
soon 
five strikes in poland from april 25 to may 10 and brief 
stoppages or strike threats in 25 more workplaces constituted the 
worst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martiallaw 
crackdown on the solidarity independent trade union 
the spring strikers demanded the legalization of solidarity and 
wage increases to counter price increases of 45 percent so far this 
year 
the rising prices are part of the governments multifaceted 
program to reform the moribund economy 
the program calls for introducing market equilibrium through 
higher prices encouraging private and managerial enterprise and 
reducing central economic controls all similar to what gorbachev 
is attempting in the soviet union 
the recent events produced an impulse to think deeper and move 
faster said one senior communist party activist speaking only 
on condition of anonymity there is no way back the only way is 
forward and forward with much bigger steps 
the polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski emphasized the need 
for quick improvements in production in an unusual eighthour 
meeting june 5 with the directors of the countrys 41 largest 
enterprises 
jerzy malkowski spokesman for the economic reform program said 
the government plans to introduce some steps ahead of schedule 
longawaited laws on setting up private businesses and easing 
limits on foreign investment were approved by the government 
shortly after the strikes and are expected to be enacted by the 
sejm parliament 
in one of the first uses of new special economic powers the 
government cut off tax benefits for companies that increase exports 
at the expense of supplies for the domestic market malkowski said 
on the political front the government has signaled that it will 
grant legal status to several independent groups including the 
economic society whose aim is to promote and aid private 
businesses a warsaw political discussion club and the dormant 
polish chapter of the pen writers club 
but authorities remain firmly opposed to legalizing solidarity 
an issue that many in the opposition regard as the litmus test of 
officials sincerity in reaching an accord 
the communist party activist said legalizing solidarity would 
lead to an escalation of pay demands in the factories which he 
maintained poland cannot afford in its current economic condition 
when the economy improves he argued authorities can then think of 
allowing union pluralism 
the answer does not satisfy solidarity activists 
the basic question at the moment is whether on the part of 
the authorities there is political willingness for deep changes in 
the system said bronislaw geremek a historian and leading 
adviser to solidarity poland at the moment needs a spectacular 
change so that it could create a psychological shock 
otherwise he added there is no possibility of launching 
political and economic changes 
legalizing groups like pen would have been signs of 
extraordinary political significance a year ago before the 
strikes said geremek but now they are too little too late 
because they are addressed to a limited circle of intellectuals and 
do not try to answer worker frustrations he said 
malkowski acknowledges that the average pole has seen very few 
benefits of the economic reform program so far and contends that is 
hindering public support 
obviously one does not convince people by rhetoric and words 
but by facts this is why i say this year the problem is that we 
have too few facts 
the situation should be better next year when he said people 
will see the effects of a freer marketplace and greater competition 
and supplies 
now we have the paradoxical situation in which an item is more 
expensive and not available he added i think this is one of 
the more significant factors arousing social frustration as long 
as the warehouses and stores do not get filled with goods society 
will question the sense of price increases

but halina bortnowska a roman catholic intellectual and 
journalist expressed deep skepticism about economic reforms in the 
absence of any popular control of the program 
there is something in the system that does not tolerate real 
public control and without this control how can we change the 
economy she said we are expected to pay in higher prices and 
austerity and where are the guarantees that this will not be 
wasted again 
malkowski argued the system contains checks against economic 
abuses by authorities he mentioned the constitutional tribunal to 
which citizens can appeal and a much freer and critical press 
compared to previous decades 
i can accept the criticism that it is not all that you or i 
could imagine in central europe but it is due to the reform to a 
large extent 
he added that authorities planned to move further in the 
direction of democratic changes 
geremek said he is convinced that if an essential change in 
the way of exercising power by the communists does not take place 
the situation will become more and more inflamed less and less 
stable 
any kind of normalization of polands place in europe without 
such a change is impossible i think this a problem for the poles 
it is a problem for gorbachev and a problem for europe 
geremek said he sees gorbachevs visit as a key to polands 
future 
the aprilmay events in poland have apparently created a 
certain curve in polands evolution he said in the next few 
weeks it should be determined what the direction of polands policy 
will be 
one may assume that during gorbachevs visit certain key 
decisions for future evolution will be made geremek said it 
will either be a new policy or a new team 
a catholic journalist also closely linked to solidarity said he 
too sensed a new mood since the strikes 
there has been a political change once again said krzysztof 
sliwinski the mood of martial law is finished right now 
something new is going on 
but he added that he doubted the countrys leaders were ready to 
take the big step of offering power to its opponents 
they are deadly anxious about sharing power because they dont 
believe in it they think that if they share power they will 
lose it 
he maintained polish society is demanding a greater say in its 
affairs comparing it to the american revolution slogan no 
taxation without representation 
another thing that has changed is the peoples attitude toward 
the soviets he said 
active people in poland have abandoned totally their 
antisoviet mood rather they are in a mood not to make too much of 
a problem for gorbachev 
several statements from officials have indicated the government 
is interested in increasing dialogue perhaps along the lines of an 
anticrisis pact in which both sides would unite behind a 
program for the economy 
the government spokesman jerzy urban has spoken of creating 
new institutional forums for dialogue 
he has proposed a pricewage commission on which consumers and 
workers would be represented and a round table of 
representatives of associations including groups not yet 
officially registered 
but young workers interviewed at the ursus tractor factory 
outside warsaw say they put little stock in the government moves 
and are expecting another round of strikes

santa fe southern pacific corp said wednesday it 
will retain certain west coast properties it previously planned to 
sell as part of a corporate restructuring 
the decision is expected to boost the companys real estate 
assets nearly 1 billion over the next five years santa fe said 
santa fe had intended to sell the properties in order to help 
pay a 366 billion restructuring debt incurred in a restructuring 
aimed at thwarting a takeover bid by henley group inc of la 
jolla calif 
instead the company said it plans to borrow against a large 
number of the developed properties and continue major building 
projects in the san francisco and san diego areas 
robert d krebs chairman of the chicagobased company said the 
revised plan reflects the progress the company has made in 
implementing its restructuring plan 
so far this year the combined income of the operating units is 
better than anticipated and we have made the debt repayments on 
our bank financing ahead of schedule he said 
this has given us greater flexibility in our real estate 
program permitting retention of properties previously scheduled 
for sale 
under the new plan the company will generate cash to pay off 
its bank debt and still gain from any future appreciation of the 
property values krebs said 
krebs said the new strategy was approved by the companys board 
of directors tuesday he anticipated the plan would receive the 
required approval from a bank group holding the restructuring loans 
the properties to be financed include lowrise office 
distribution and warehouse space located primarily in california 
and arizona as well as 5800 acres of ground leases the company 
plans to build about 1 million square feet of buildings next year 
santa fe said it intends to sell about 300 million in real 
estate assets in 1988 about the same amount as in previous years

gallon 
this is the peak season for gasoline said peter beutel an 
oil analyst with elders futures inc 
beutel said a recent american petroleum institute report showed 
demand for gasoline was at its highest point in about 10 years 
the report said an average 853 million barrels of gasoline were 
transferred from refineries to distributors each day for the week 
ending june 24 that surpassed the previous highest level of 848 
million barrels in july 1978 
because prices have been so low lately a lot of people are 
driving more beutel said 
the api report also showed stocks of gasoline were down 7 
percent from a year ago and that helped send gas prices higher

us crude oil fell 35 cents to 1543 per barrel 
most people still perceive an oversupply of crude oil

a major consolidation by international business 
machines corp is expected to lead to the resignations or early 
retirements of 3000 to 4000 employees the giant computer maker 
says 
the 600 million consolidation by the worlds biggest computer 
company is intended to further reduce costs provide for future 
growth and speed new products to customers ibm announced 
wednesday 
this is a major major restructuring terry lautenbach ibm 
senior vice president and general manager of ibm united states 
said in an interview 
in its last big move to cut costs ibm offered incentives that 
resulted in the early retirement of 13000 employees in the united 
states and 2000 outside the united states in 1986 and 1987 
ibm said it would cut 1600 jobs in boca raton fla the 
birthplace of the original personal computer by eliminating 
manufacturing there and 2800 jobs in tucson ariz where it will 
phase out manufacturing of data storage products 
ibm also will close two plants of rolm systems that manufacture 
telecommunications equipment moving work from the santa clara 
calif operation to a nearby san jose plant and from the austin 
texas site to ibms nearby main austin site 
jobs will be added in other places such as ibms research 
triangle park near raleigh nc which will take over the 
manufacturing of personal system2 computers from boca raton 
ibm will offer jobs to all employees displaced by plant 
closings but in an apparent effort to cut employment it will 
offer two years salary and a 25000 bonus to any employees in the 
boca raton and tucson sites who choose to resign or retire 
lautenbach characterized the payments as a form of assistance to 
people who chose to leave rather than as an incentive to get them 
to leave 
ibm also intends to try to cut its headquarters staff in 
westchester county ny and elsewhere by offering eligible 
employees four weeks salary for every year of service as 
separation bonuses 
the cuts will result in a charge of 600 million against pretax 
earnings in the second quarter ibm said however the impact on 
firsthalf earnings largely will be offset by an accounting change 
related to treatment of deferred income taxes 
ibms stock closed unchanged at 127 a share in consolidated new 
york stock exchange trading 
lautenbach said improvements in manufacturing technology left 
the company with more plants than it needed he said the closings 
had nothing to do with slow growth saying our business is 
growing satisfactorily 
ibm said the key elements of the moves expected to be completed 
by the end of 1989 were as follows 
personal system2 manufacturing in boca raton fla will move 
to ibms research triangle park plant near raleigh nc where 
much personal system2 manufacturing already takes place all other 
operations related to the personal system2 in boca raton will 
remain there 
manufacturing operations at the tucson storage products plant 
will be phased out and the work moved to ibm plants in san jose 
charlotte nc and poughkeepsie ny the tucson development 
laboratory will continue its operations there 
rolm systems telecommunications manufacturing in santa clara 
calif will be moved to ibms nearby san jose facility rolm 
systems manufacturing and development in austin will be 
consolidated with ibms main austin site 
ibm plants in charlotte and austin will take over some of the 
assembly work now done in toronto also an ibm laboratory in 
toronto will get more programming development responsibility 
manufacturing of memory cards and power systems will continue in 
toronto 
a plant in the new york city borough of brooklyn will diagnose 
and process electronic components work formerly done in locations 
across the country brooklyns assembly operations will be 
consolidated in poughkeepsie 
ibm plans to turn its tucson manufacturing plant into an 
industrial park that would attract hightechnology companies to the 
area 
alberta charney an economics and business research specialist 
with the university of arizona said the job cuts probably would 
have a ripple effect resulting in a total loss of 7000 jobs in the 
tucson area over the long run 
ms charney estimated the payroll of the 2800 affected 
employees would be close to a 100 million income loss to pima 
county 
in boca raton ibm will remain the areas largest employer 
spokeswoman marti easterbrook said she noted employment at the end 
of 1989 still will be 30 percent higher than it was in 1980 before 
the company tooled up for production of personal computers 
the boca raton area cannot lose these type of jobs without 
feeling it said mj mike arts executive vice president of 
the greater boca raton chamber of commerce 
but he said it will be a benefit to us since it will be a 
talented labor pool in the area i suspect many of them will stay 
here and this may help us in attracting employers who need these 
workers

prices of grain and soybeans jumped sharply 
this month a bittersweet reminder that drought can deal a stacked 
deck to farmers those whose crops survive can rake in their 
winnings as others leave the game broke 
overall prices farmers got for raw products rose 37 percent 
from may a jump that carried the overall index up 69 percent from 
a year ago the agriculture department said wednesday 
higher prices for soybeans corn and wheat contributed most to 
the june increase the departments agricultural statistics board 
said lower prices for cattle and peaches partly offset the rise in 
other commodities 
most grain prices moved up sharply in june reflecting the 
widespread drought the report said the average soybean price 
was at the highest level since may of 1977 and the fifth highest on 
record corn and wheat also moved up sharply to the highest levels 
since august of 1985 and may of 1984 respectively 
consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent 
this year compared with a 42 percent average increase in 1987 
before the drought took hold usda was predicting a 1988 food price 
hike of 2 percent to 4 percent 
no forecast has been made by the department for 1989 
according to the preliminary june figures based mostly on 
midmonth averages the index for crop prices was up 10 percent 
from may and averaged 18 percent more than a year ago 
the livestock price index dropped 26 percent from may and 
averaged 13 percent below the yearago level 
in a related action agriculture secretary richard e lyng 
announced that mexico will be able to buy 40 million worth of us 
meat under a special credit arrangement designed to help 
droughtstricken american livestock producers 
it was the second action this week by lyng to help bolster 
livestock market prices on monday he announced 50 million has 
been authorized to buy an estimated 45 million pounds of frozen 
bulk ground beef for donation to school lunchrooms in the fall 
as a commodity group prices of feed grains and hay in great 
demand for livestock in the stricken drought areas rose 20 
percent from may to june averaging 40 percent above a year ago 
prices of food grains mostly wheat but also including rice 
rose 14 percent during the month and averaged 14 percent higher 
than in may the june index was up 49 percent from june 1987 all 
of the mayjune rise was due to higher wheat prices while rice 
prices declined during the month 
the index of prices for oilbearing crops which mostly involves 
soybeans jumped 19 percent from its may average and was 48 percent 
more than in june 1987 preliminary figures showed soybean prices 
averaged 856 per bushel up 157 from may 
lower prices for cattle and calves were mostly responsible for 
the june decline in the livestock price index prices of beef 
cattle generally fell to an average of 6520 per hundredweight 
in june from 6930 in may calf prices dropped 670 to 8670 in 
june 
many farmers and ranchers have been forced by drought to send 
cattle to slaughter or to feedlots as pastures and ranges continue 
to burn up that has put extra animals on the market and depressed 
prices 
the price index for poultry and eggs collectively rose 75 
percent from may to june and averaged 11 percent more than a year 
ago 
besides the decline in livestock prices the fruit index dropped 
67 percent from may and averaged 71 percent lower than in june 
1987 prices for peaches grapefruit oranges and strawberries 
were lower than the previous month the report said 
although the projections are subject to review as more is known 
about 1988 crop and livestock production usda economists say now 
that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 53 billion 
to 59 billion this year compared to the record level of 56 
billion in 1987 that is the difference between cash receipts and 
cash expenses during the calendar year 
no new figures for farm production costs were included in the 
report those have been confined to quarterly averages because of 
budget cutbacks 
in april however farm expenses were up 18 percent from 
january and averaged 37 percent above a year earlier the april 
figures were carried forward into june with the next revision 
scheduled in july 
the report said 
cattle averaged 6520 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally down from 6930 in may but up from 6250 reported for 
june 1987 those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 4740 per 100 pounds compared with 4630 in 
may and 5920 a year earlier 
corn at 243 a bushel was up from 195 in may and the 
average of 169 per bushel a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 350 per bushel compared with 299 in may and 244 a 
year earlier 
rice averaged 731 per 100 pounds compared with 771 in may 
and 362 a year earlier 
soybeans were 856 per bushel compared with 699 in may and 
536 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 604 cents per pound compared 
with 589 in may and 662 cents in june 1987 
eggs were 457 cents per dozen compared with 431 cents in may 
and 50 cents a year earlier 
milk was 1130 per 100 pounds compared with 1140 in may and 
1190 a year earlier

hundreds of teamstersrelated prosecutions show 
that union officials made a devils pact with the mafia the 
government says in a 105page memorandum in support of its lawsuit 
to oust the unions leadership 
since approximately 1970 said the memo the government 
has successfully prosecuted well over 300 persons associated with 
the teamsters for teamstersrelated crimes 
the memo accompanied the government lawsuit filed tuesday 
seeking a court order placing restraints on the 18member general 
executive board of the international brotherhood of teamsters 
the document is crammed with details of a recent series of 
successful criminal and civil prosecutions that show the mafia 
has gained control over the teamsters 
the governments court papers noted that four of the last five 
teamsters presidents have faced federal felony charges and three 
were convicted david beck for embezzlement james jimmy hoffa 
for obstructing justice and mail fraud and roy williams for trying 
to bribe a us senator 
among 26 alleged mob figures named as defendants in the lawsuit 
25 have been convicted of teamstersrelated crimes such as 
extortion through threats of union problems embezzlement of union 
funds and illegal labor payoffs 
from 1970 until now the teamsters executive board has rarely 
taken disciplinary action against or even investigated corrupt 
teamsters officials or subordinate entities the government said 
the memorandum of law that claimed the unions leadership has 
made a devils pact with la cosa nostra 
prosecutors noted that maurice schurr a vice president and 
member of the executive board was recently convicted of 
receiving illegal labor payments from teamsters employers 
us district judge david edelsten issued a temporary court 
order that bars the board from making large expenditures of union 
funds or destroying union records the order also banned the 25 
previously convicted mob defendants from participating in union 
affairs 
when he announced the lawsuit us attorney rudolph giuliani 
quoted what the late robert f kennedy and the presidents 
commission on organized crime had to say about the teamsters 
the report of the presidents commission said giuliani 
described the teamsters as the union most controlled by 
organized crime 
giuliani also quoted at length from the enemy within robert 
kennedys 1960 book about a senate probe into the sordid 
dishonesty of organized crimes infiltration of the teamsters 
he was ridiculed he was vilified he was hated irrationally 
but he was right giuliani said of kennedy 
the teamsters executive board which is holding its quarterly 
meeting in montreal sharply criticized the governments lawsuit as 
a vicious antilabor attack and said allegations of ties to 
organized crime were pure myth 
in another development wednesday a canadian board member denied 
any connection between the 91500member canadian branch of the 
teamsters and the mafia 
edward lawson 59 of vancouver a member of canadas appointed 
federal senate said the us lawsuit links every honest canadian 
teamster with a bunch of gangsters we know nothing about

general electric co has released the terms of a 
tentative contract agreement in the hope that it will quell 
rumblings of possible rejection when workers vote on it july 6 
we believe that once union members understand the contract and 
its improvements they will ratify it ge spokesman jack batty 
said wednesday 
tentative agreement on a threeyear pact was reached sunday 
night after five weeks of talks on tuesday union delegates from 
locals across the country unanimously called for the 47000 workers 
to reject it 
approval had been recommended by the unions bargaining 
committee and the international officers of the largest union the 
international union of electronic electrical salaried machine 
and furniture workers iue 
as presented by ge the contract calls for 
an immediate wage increase of 25 percent and 15 percent 
increases in june 1989 and june 1990 also lump sum payments of 
165 in july and 900 in june 1989 
five costofliving adjustments over the term of the contract 
at the current formula of 1 cent an hour for each 015 percent rise 
in the consumer price index 
improved retirement options and bonuses especially for workers 
affected by plant closings productline discontinuation 
automation and layoffs 
increased retraining assistance from 3000 over two years to 
5000 over three years 
waiving of the employees contribution to the retirement plan 
for the first 25000 in annual income up from 14000 and 
increased pension payouts 
obviously we did not get everything we went after you never 
do iue president william bywater said but the agreement is 
solid and it will leave union members and their families better off 
both in the short and the long run 
the iue represents about 40000 workers in 75 locals at about 
100 factories around the country 
the pact negotiated by the iue forms the basis for ges other 
national contract with the united electrical radio and machine 
workers of america ue which covers 6300 employees and with 10 
other unions that represent another 21000 workers 
batty noted that the local delegates who recommended rejection 
did not attend any bargaining sessions and may not have had time to 
fully understand the pact 
but iue spokesman jerry borstel said they just felt it fell 
short of what they ought to get 
if they dont ratify it might mean a strike borstel said 
i dont know the union is free to strike at 1201 am saturday 
we have given them the 10day notice as required by the contract

the governments latest major insider trading 
case is just one of many it is investigating that involve 
foreignbased transactions officials of the securities and 
exchange commission say 
the 19 million insider trading case that became public this 
week has expanded to switzerland sec chairman david s ruder told 
congress on wednesday ruder said authorities have learned that 
fred c lee the hong kong trader accused in the case traded some 
us securities from the european country 
were now seeking information from swiss authorities and 
trying to get a freeze on assets he has there ruder told 
reporters during a break in the hearing by the senate banking 
committees securities subcommittee 
gary lynch the secs enforcement chief told the lawmakers that 
the lee case is one of 40 or 50 investigations under way in which 
foreign trading is involved he said at least one of the 
investigations involves very large dollar amounts and that 
others range down to as little as 40000 to 50000 or less 
ruder declined to say what the value of lees swiss trades or 
assets might be but lynch said the trades lee made from the 
european country were part of the 19 million lee allegedly earned 
by trading on inside information 
the sec has accused stephen wang jr 24 a securities analyst 
for morgan stanley amp co of providing lee with privileged 
information on at least 25 corporate takeovers that morgan stanley 
handled the agency says lee made at least 19 million using the 
information and gave 200000 to wang 
lee 38 is based in hong kong but also has a home in the 
washington suburb of mclean va lynch said lee a native of 
taiwan has claimed canadian citizenship with at least one 
brokerage firm he used 
the sec is seeking 76 million from the two men which would 
cover a repayment of the money they made plus triple damages that 
reward is surpassed by only the 100 million the sec recovered when 
insider trader ivan f boesky settled with the agency in november 
1986 
wangs attorney ira l sorkin has declined to comment on the 
accusations other than to say he is studying them 
lees lawyer michael perlis said in a telephone interview 
wednesday from his san francisco office that lee intended to resist 
the secs accusations but likely would remain outside this country 
asked about press reports quoting perlis as indicating he might 
attempt to settle the accusations for far less than the amount the 
sec is requesting from his client perlis said thats just 
speculation 
but he also said every case can be settled and should be 
settled on terms agreeable to all parties 
sec officials have said lee did some of the allegedly illicit 
trading through a hong kong investment management company 
federated international investment management fe ltd a 
subsidiary of aetna life and casualty 
in hong kong today federateds managing director nigel lester 
confirmed lee was an exclient and the company has been cooperating 
with sec officials he said no allegations of wrongdoing have been 
raised against federated employees but declined to discuss details 
of the sec investigation 
ruder and lynch along with state department legal adviser mary 
v mochary appeared before the subcommittee to testify in favor of 
legislation that would give the sec more powers to conduct 
securities investigations in this country at the request of foreign 
countries 
currently the sec can only force the presentation of evidence 
if there are indications that us law has been broken sponsors 
including sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the 
subcommittee hope that if that power is expanded other nations 
will cooperate when us authorities need records from overseas 
similar legislation was introduced wednesday in the house by 
reps john dingell dmich edward markey dmass norman lent

the european economic community raised 
its 1988 economic forecast thursday predicting the economies of 
its 12member nations would grow an average 26 percent instead of 
falling into recession 
the eec commission the groups policymaking board had 
predicted negative growth following last octobers collapse of 
financial markets 
growth is expected to slow in 1989 to 23 percent due largely to 
an anticipated slowdown in the eecs most dynamic economies 
spain italy portugal and britain growth in the eight other 
member states would likely stablize at an average 2 percent the 
eec commission said 
the commission said levels of employment would continue 
increasing by about 08 percent annually but it said total 
unemployment levels were expected to remain high throughout the 
trading bloc at 113 percent in 1988 and 111 percent in 1989 
the commission also predicted a 1988 inflation level of just 
over 3 percent it forecast that only greece would have a high 
inflation rate of about 15 percent

west germanys central bank 
raised a key interest rate thursday in a move to shore up the weak 
mark and curb inflation 
the deutsche bundesbank increased its discount rate the 
interest it charges on loans to member banks by onehalf of a 
percentage point to 3 percent 
the central bank also said it would raise its rate on securities 
repurchase agreements to 375 percent from 35 percent friday 
however it left unchanged at 45 percent the lessimportant 
lombard rate which is the interest charged on loans to other banks 
when securities are used as collateral 
in a statement the bundesbank said its 17member governing 
council decided to hike the key rates largely to support the 
weakening west german mark west german officials fear that a soft 
mark will spur inflationary pressures and damage progress made in 
reversing trade imbalances between the united states and its major 
trading partners 
the boost in west german rates had been widely expected by the 
financial markets mostly because of the recent surge in the 
dollar foreign exchange dealers said the announcement had little 
impact on the dollar since it already had been discounted by the 
market 
following west germanys move thursday was the austrian national 
bank austrias central bank which raised its discount rate to 35 
percent from 3 percent and also left its lombard rate unchanged

congress is so regularly behind schedule 
members find it cause for celebration when the house does something 
on time and speaker jim wright held a news conference today to 
boast about it 
we think it is probably the most productive congress in recent 
history said wright dtexas he was joined by two dozen senior 
lawmakers in an event staged to make sure reporters noted house 
passage wednesday of the last two of its 13 annual appropriations 
bills 
the last time all those measures cleared the chamber before the 
end of june was in president eisenhowers last year in office 
following passage of the transportation and interior department 
money bills on wednesday lawmakers applauded and wright 
interrupted further deliberations to mark what he called a 
historically significant occasion 
rep silvio conte senior republican on the house appropriations 
committee was more emphatic hell has indeed frozen over he 
said 
the house action was so swift that the only thing quicker was 
the tysonspinks bout conte said 
the last time the house approved all of its spending bills 
before june 30 was in 1960 when the new fiscal year began july 1 
this years bills are for fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 
the speedy process this year was made possible by last falls 
deficitreduction agreement between president reagan and 
congressional leaders which decided in advance the overall 
spending levels for military foreign aid and domestic agency 
programs 
we have kept the total of appropriations bills below the 
presidents requests although we made rearrangements of priorities 
of the various bills to continue essential domestic programs 
said rep jamie l whitten dmiss the chairman of the 
appropriations committee 
because of the houses changes in spending plans some of which 
the white house contends are too costly veto threats hang over 
several of the bills 
but even if just one of the regular spending bills is eventually 
signed by the president the record will be better than in the last 
two years 
for last year and the current fiscal year all of the 
governments spending authority has been wrapped into huge 
catchall money bills the president has promised never again to 
sign one of those omnibus measures and many in congress vowed 
never to vote for one again 
the senate has approved its version of four spending bills the 
house and senate have reached a compromise on one of those which 
could be sent to the white house next week

corporate takeover artists have their pencils 
poised ready to tick off names of targets expansionoriented 
companies have their own acquisition plans and executives nervous 
about low stock prices are mulling restructurings 
but the looming question is just who is on these secret hit 
lists for the latter half of 1988 a period ripe for fastpaced 
buyouts 
a relatively cheap dollar is expected to keep luring foreign 
investors while a fear of tighter regulations in the postreagan 
era should keep domesticled takeovers rolling 
topping it off is a plethora of companies whose share prices 
remain depressed in the wake of octobers stock market bloodbath 
rendering them relative bargains 
most wall streeters covet such opportunities and are more than 
reluctant to point fingers at potential takeover or restructuring 
targets 
people pay us for our opinions said one analyst at bear 
stearns amp co so i dont want to give them to you for nothing 
but the grapevine is abuzz with names like texaco whirlpool 
american brands mcgrawhill and plenty more 
using a purely numerical approach to identify targets linda 
zimbalist smith said she searches for stocks that would jump in a 
takeover restructuring or leveraged buyout and while a company 
may appear on her list today a few ticks upward in its stock price 
could render it undesirable in an instant according to her complex 
formula 
in may smith head of the greenwich connbased research firm 
zimbalist smith named 28 target companies including american 
brands monsanto whirlpool goodyear and zayre but many of these 
companies no longer pass her test 
still experts remain keen on american brands a company with 
farflung interests from tobacco to biscuits 
it is one of the ultimate consumer conglomerates with dozens 
of separate companies pasted together without any synergy noted 
michael metz an analyst at oppenheimer amp co 
that means the companys separate parts could be spun off or 
sold to finance a takeover or pay shareholders a handsome dividend 
for the investor a takeover is not the only way to cash out any 
kind of restructuring or leveraged buyout is designed to boost 
shareholder value and put profits in the pockets of investors 
smith conceded that american brands breakup value is great and 
that its stock price is hampered by the cloud hanging over the 
tobacco industry 
a depressed stock price alone is not the only red flag on a 
potential target internal forces such as low debt levels coupled 
with higher projected earnings also can highlight target companies 
you have to look at the financials of a company the cash 
flow the balance sheet and you have to look outside directors 
whether they are friends of management said metz 
antitakeover provisions are likely to be only a slight 
deterrent to takeover offers 
there are even more subtle issues to consider we look for 
values as well as a catalyst said mario gabelli who heads the 
investment firm gabelli amp co 
among his socalled catalysts are things like divorce death 
big blocks of stock in the hands of octogenarians 
for example gabelli said he is buying lots of stock in thomas 
industries inc a kentuckybased lighting manufacturer the 
companys founder lee b thomas died in march and a spokesman 
said he does not know what became of thomass stake in the company 
newell co an illinois home hardware concern apparently also 
likes thomas newell has picked up a 65 percent stake in the 
company and could serve as an important ally to a potential suitor 
if it does not make a bid of its own 
divorce is taking its toll on rp scherer corp karla scherer 
fink who has filed suit to divorce the companys president has 
said she wants to sell the pharmaceuticals company in which she 
holds a 33 percent stake one investor group that controls more 
than 13 percent of the company has already held talks with her and 
may be jockeying for an acquisition 
if internal strife is a major criteria nowhere is such a force 
more evident that at texaco inc despite defeating raider carl c 
icahn in a critical proxy battle the oil giant remains vulnerable 
icahns 149 percent stake may be for sale giving any purchaser 
a solid springboard for an offer in addition the aggressive new 
york investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which sided 
with management in the proxy battle conceivably could push for a 
leveraged buyout and retain texaco management with whom they 
likely have established a working rapport oppenheimers metz said 
one deal often turns the spotlight on an entire industry it 
starts a conflagration and investors and speculators look to 
mirror images and clones to see if other potential vehicles could 
go the same way metz said 
turmoil at texaco has turned up the heat on other oil companies 
in particular unocal corp and phillips petroleum co both are 
selling at large discounts considering their breakup value as 
well as in terms of cash flow and the value of underlying gas and 
oil reserves metz said 
in the publishing industry macmillan incs announced 
recapitalization as a defensive measure against offers from the 
robert bass group sparked rumors that time inc and mcgrawhill 
inc might also be targets 
indeed mcgrawhill reorganized into three new operating 
companies in late june in what some analysts described as a 
protective move the companys stock jumped 362 a share the day 
the restructuring was announced 
and general electric cos acquisition of roper corp turned 
fresh attention to the home appliance market since then there has 
been plenty of talk about whirlpool corp and fellow appliance 
maker maytag corp including rumors that whirlpool might make a 
bid for maytag 
not all undervalued companies are targets most drug companies 
for example are trading at a discount but are not choice 
candidates metz noted that these companies are undervalued in part 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the future of government 
health insurance plans and because the revived dollar will not 
benefit their overseas sales as it did in the previous year 
but smithkline beckman corp is one pharmaceutical company whose 
stock is so downright depressed it just might be attractive 
smithklines stock recently plummeted from about 54 a share to the 
45 range after the company revised its earnings projections 
downward 
because of eastman kodak cos megapurchase of sterling drug 
inc earlier this year zimbalist smith has the company on her 
watch list 
its in line to do something to boost its stock price and 
theres a lot it can do now that it has more pieces to sell off 
she said

americas foreign debt soared to 3682 
billion in 1987 as the country lengthened its lead as the worlds 
largest debtor nation the government said today 
the commerce department said the new debt burden was 368 
percent higher than a revised 2692 billion debt to foreigners 
that the united states was carrying at the end of 1986 
the deterioration means that the country now has a debt load 
greater than the total debt being carried by brazil mexico and 
argentina combined the third world countries with the largest debt 
burdens 
simply put the us debt means that foreigners now own more in 
us assets than americans own abroad 
for 1987 the government reported that foreign holdings in the 
united states increased 146 percent to 154 trillion this 
compared to a 9 percent rise in american investments overseas 
which totaled 117 trillion at the end of 1987 
the difference between foreign investments in this country and 
american holdings overseas represents the 3682 billion debt 
burden the country is carrying 
as recently as 1982 the united states was the worlds largest 
creditor nation with an investment surplus of 1369 billion but 
americas investment surplus evaporated as the country ran up huge 
merchandise trade deficits during the 1980s transferring billions 
of dollars into the hands of foreigners to pay for color 
televisions stereo equipment and automobiles 
these dollars now in foreign hands have been reinvested in the 
united states in everything from us government bonds to los 
angeles real estate the country became a net debtor for the first 
time in 71 years in 1985 with an investment deficit of 1107 
billion 
the new figures showing the countrys debt burden widening had 
been widely anticipated but they were certain to heighten the 
debate in this presidential election year over what democratic 
critics charge is one of the greatest failures of the reagan 
presidency 
critics contend that the countrys position as the largest 
debtor nation is eroding americas political and economic standing 
in the world 
in a report wednesday the congressional office of technology 
assessment warned that the united states faced a time of 
reckoning when foreigners would no longer be willing to lend more 
money 
as the united states sinks further into debt foreign 
investors and creditors central banks individuals and firms 
will be less inclined to commit everincreasing amounts of capital 
to a 4 trillion economy on a spending spree the ota report said 
the rise in foreign investment in this country has sounded alarm 
bells and prompted calls in congress for curbs on foreign purchases 
of us companies and american real estate 
but president reagan has maintained that the countrys debtor 
status is a sign of strength showing the eagerness with which 
foreigners want to invest in america 
the administration notes that the united states was a net debtor 
for most of the 19th century with no bad effects as european 
capital helped to build railroads and factories 
but many private economists contend that the countrys status as 
the biggest debtor had jeopardized us prestige they said the 
decline was evident at last weeks toronto economic summit at 
which the united states wielded less influence and japan now the 
worlds largest creditor country took more of a lead in the 
discussions 
private economists say there is a marked difference between the 
19th century net debtor period and the present in the last 
century america was a developing country and needed foreign 
capital to become an industrial power 
but during the 1980s much of the foreign money has gone to 
finance a borrowing binge on the part of the federal government and 
consumers rather than being put into investments that would boost 
american productivity 
because of this these analysts contend that americans will face 
a declining standard of living in the future as the foreign debt is 
repaid some economists believe that interest on the us debt will 
be running between 30 billion and 50 billion in the 1990s as the 
total foreign debt approaches 1 trillion 
the administration argues that the cost of servicing the foreign 
debt is still a small percentage of the countrys total economy but 
private economists contend that the rate of growth is alarming 
we are losing control over our own economy and our capital 
markets said lawrence chimerine president of the wefa group an 
economic consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa this money doesnt 
come free the debt servicing needs will suck income out of the 
country 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said americans 
standard of living already has suffered because of the foreign debt 
burden with the declines showing up in such things as higher 
mortgage rates because us interest rates have to be higher to 
attract needed foreign capital 
the us debtor position along with a huge federal government 
debt are already eating away at our standard of living he said

the steel industrys perennial offensive 
against aluminum for a bigger share of the food and beverage 
container market is moving full tilt 
whether the latest effort to regain lost glory will fare any 
better than wayward sorties of the past depends on whom you talk 
to if nothing else the maneuvering has a decidedly serious tone 
in 1988 
weve had in the last six to eight months as much conversation 
around the threat of steelmakers as weve had at any time its 
because of the runup in aluminum prices said ronald r hoffman 
group vice president for packaging systems at pittsburghbased 
aluminum co of america 
price is the big weapon in the battle for the can and aluminum 
makers are going to fight tooth nail and claw to retain their 
dominance in beverage cans and break into food cans said david 
moisen container industry analyst for resource strategies inc 
alcoa the nations largest aluminum producer recently 
announced that instead of boosting can sheet prices as expected 
july 1 it would hold the price at 115 per pound through the 
summer beverage sales season 
can sheet prices have climbed about 20 cents per pound over the 
last year while the price of the raw material aluminling helped clear 
the nations roadsides portrayed 
aluminum makers as concerned citizens provided a source of income 
to boy scouts volunteer firefighters and others and saved the 
companies great sums on raw material 
aluminum prices however have outstripped the savings from 
recycling making steel cheaper as a raw material and as the 
finished can said frank m walker general manager of tin mill 
products for uss 
nonetheless steelmakers realize they need their own can 
recycling program 
clearly without a successful recycling campaign of our own 
the steel industry will be hardpressed to cash in on its 
comparative production cost advantage graham said last september 
at a recycling symposium 
at that gathering representatives of 19 steel mills agreed to 
accept used cans as is without being detinned for remelting 
that may not sound like much but that was a significant 
step said robert paxson manager of tin mill sales and marketing 
for bethlehem steel corp 
the american iron and steel institute also is organizing a 30 
million sixyear effort to promote and operate a recycling system 
in an attempt to do for the nations municipal landfills what the 
aluminum industry did for the nations roadsides paxson said 
steel has a long row to hoe in the beverage container market 
aluminum cans accounted for 96 percent of the nearly 74 billion 
beverage cans shipped in the united states in 1987 while steel 
accounted for 95 percent of the 28 billion food cans shipped last 
year 
analysts are dubious about steels chances for changing that 
situation significantly 
there will be some beverage can lines that go to steel but 
in reality steel is barely holding on by its fingernails said 
cornelius thornton a container industry analyst for first boston 
corp 
with plastics paper and composite materials making inroads in 
food containers the steel companies might very well be fighting 
the last war said analyst charles bradford of merrill lynch

for 3000 a man can get just about any 
shoe he wants no matter if its to be made from turkey baby 
shark elephant or plain old cow 
shoemakers domenick dimeola and raymond robinson will handcraft 
mens footwear from the bizarre to the banal 
dimeola and robinson among only a few shoemakers still 
producing shoes from scratch work for the johnston amp murphy shoe 
company in nashville the 138yearold firm is the oldest 
manufacturer of mens dress shoes in the country company officials 
say 
johnston amp murphy sells machinemade shoes for 130 to 290 but 
the handmade versions will cost 1000 to 3000 depending on the 
materials and variations in the foot 
dimeola 62 is the senior craftsman and learned his trade in 
italy where his father and grandfather were shoemakers he was born 
in newark nj moved as a toddler with his family to italy and 
returned to new jersey at age 6 
when dimeola began plying his trade scores of shoemakers could 
be found now they are a rarity and dimeola considers himself part 
of a passing profession 
in his melodious accented english dimeola said he plans to 
retire in a few years which means a replacement has to be found 
robinson 47 of woodbury who has trained under dimeola for 17 
years will choose dimeolas successor 
as they sit in a workroom filled with shoes and the aroma of 
leather robinson grimaces at the idea of finding a replacement 
clearly the two men get along 
on one side of the cavernous plant the men work in a shop 
surrounded by multitiered racks cradling a variety of wingtips 
loafers and golf shoes in various stages of production dimeola 
jumps up from one of the two rectangular workbenches cluttered with 
oddlyshaped tools to show off a pair of spiked golf shoes made for 
and worn by arnold palmer 
they say their work requires much skill patience and attention 
to detail dimeola has made shoes for such luminaries as presidents 
eisenhower kennedy johnson nixon ford and carter and talk show 
host david letterman 
dimeola says his most unusual customer was the late pianist 
liberace the flamboyant pianist eschewed the standard leather 
shoes the men produce and instead sent dimeola a piece of cloth 
embossed with a piano keyboard dimeola used the cloth to create a 
pair with the keys running across the toes 
robinson says his strangest order was from a man who sent in 
turkey skins to be made into a pair of boots he wanted them by 
thanksgiving robinson said 
it was the worst leather we ever worked with dimeola chimes 
in adding that the skins were very thin 
the men no longer produce boots but they still make 3000 
alligator shoes and the more bizarre special orders from baby 
shark awful delicate to work with to elephant tough but a 
good leather 
but no matter the materials or the customer the men say 
everyone gets the same treatment 
i still put the same effort the same material and the same 
workmanship for people like you and me dimeola says proudly 
in the recession years of the early 1970s dimeola said the 
inflated cost of importing leather cut demand for handmade shoes 
but in the last two to three years the demand has increased and 
dimeola and robinson are overwhelmed with orders 
normally we stay behind 20 to 30 pair dimeola said right 
now we are behind 200 pair we can only make one pair a day it 
takes 19 hours to make a pair 
they customers have to wait 12 to 16 weeks normally to get a 
pair but now we are seven months behind he said 
special orders particularly for men who suffer orthopedic 
problems are booming out of nearly 300 pairs of shoes the men 
made last year 150 were special orders 
the special orders can be made to the exact specifications of 
the customers foot and make room for corns raised bones and other 
problems with proper care including a rest after every two to 
three days of wear the shoes will last longer and look better than 
machinemade footwear dimeola says 
only one pair of shoes was returned last year dimeola says and 
about 1 percent of all shoes theyve made have been sent back 
we stand behind our product he says

greece assumes the presidency of the 
european economic community on friday midway in a year that has 
produced some of the biggest successes in the trade blocs 31year 
history but still faces friction with the united states over farm 
trade 
the socialist government of prime minister andreas papandreou 
which often is out of step with the priorities of its 11 partners 
in the eec also known as the common market takes over the 
rotating presidency from west germany 
papandreou is expected to put a heavy accent on efforts to 
improve the economic prospects of europes poorer and less 
industrialized regions most of which are in greece spain and 
portugal 
but because of its relatively light diplomatic clout and its 
sometimes troublesome relations with other eec members greece is 
not expected to win much progress on farm policy reform and other 
key issues 
indeed conflict between the common market and the united states 
over liberalizing farm trade is likely to intensify this fall as 
both sides prepare for a special trade negotiating session in 
december 
in its six months at the helm the west german government 
managed to take the eec further toward economic and financial union 
than nearly anyone had thought possible at the start of the year 
although many problems remain the eec under west german 
leadership gained a new impulse toward its most basic goal 
creating a true common market where people goods and money can 
move as freely across national borders as they do across state 
lines in the united states 
this goal known in eec parlance as completing the internal 
market has emerged during the first half of 1988 as a lightning 
rod for the hopes not only of european governments but businesses 
as well the target date for completing the true common market is 
dec 31 1992 
greece is expected to press for more progress toward that goal 
but it will have a hard time matching the west german successes 
which were more substantial than in any sixmonth period since the 
eec heads of government first endorsed the project in june 1985 
among the major decisions produced by the german presidency were 
phased removal of all barriers to the free movement of money 
across national borders to be completed by the eight most advanced 
eec members by 1990 this will allow consumers to open bank 
accounts and obtain other financial services such as loans in any 
member country 
mutual recognition of university diplomas within two years 
allowing all professionals to practice freely anywhere in the 
common market 
liberalization of road transport by the end of 1992 this will 
mean the end of existing bilateral quotas on truck journeys a 
system that produced such absurdities as requiring a greek truck 
carrying wine to get permits to cross west germany or italy but not 
to enter holland while the wine itself is subject to no border 
restrictions 
agreement by eec leaders this week to set up a blueribbon 
panel to study ways of achieving greater european monetary union 
despite these advances independent analysts say the eec still 
will be hardpressed to meet its 1992 deadline for ending all trade 
barriers 
a lot more has to be done said hugh corbet director of the 
londonbased trade policy research center he said it is widely 
believed in western europe that little progress will be made during 
greeces term 
in the international arena the major west german success was 
completing years of negotiations with the sovietled economic 
alliance known as the council for mutual economic assistance or 
comecon on a joint protocol the socialist bloc has agreed for the 
first time to formally recognize the eec although no trade pact 
has been made 
one of the key failures of the west german presidency was the 
setback of efforts to normalize relations with turkey which 
applied last year for eec membership greece which nearly went to 
war with turkey in april 1987 over mineral rights in the aegean 
sea is firmly opposed to allowing its ancient enemy to become the 
eecs 13th member 
the last greek presidency of the governing eec council of 
ministers was marked by bitter disappointment at the failure to 
resolve a longrunning dispute over britains contribution to the 
eec budget 
this time the athens government is likely to be spared an acute 
budget problem 
against seemingly long odds west german chancellor helmut kohl 
at a special eec summit in february forged agreement on a 
fiveyear plan for injecting new funds into the organization and 
setting strict limits for the first time on increases in farm 
spending

the supreme court on thursday apparently 
removed the last legal obstacle to a 180 million settlement 
between vietnam veterans and manufacturers of the herbicide agent 
orange 
the court also agreed to consider lawyer advertisements and 
alleged race discrimination in alaskan canneries let stand a 
damages ruling against a major defense contractor and rejected a 
product liability case against an automaker 
without commenting on the agent orange case the justices let 
stand rulings that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who 
challenged the settlement in which some 120000 others are 
expected to participate 
the lawsuit filed by the 300 was dismissed when a federal judge 
ruled that the agent orange manufacturers were immune from being 
sued over the alleged health effects of the herbicide 
the chemical companies sued over making agent orange were 
monsanto dow uniroyal hercules th agriculture and nutrition 
diamond shamrock and thompson 
the ensuing appeals from that ruling had been pending before the 
nations highest court for months held until a key decision about 
government contractors legal liability 
three days ago the court ruled that government contractors 
cannot be sued over governmentapproved design defects unless the 
contractors failed to notify the government about hazards they knew 
about 
the 300 veterans involved in the cases opted out of a class 
action lawsuit that in 1984 ended in a 180 million settlement 
james sparrow director of vietnam veterans agent orange victims 
inc of stamford conn said its a major victory for us this 
means that a 10year battle has ended today and money will be going 
out immediately to families of deceased veterans and veterans who 
are 100 percent disabled 
agent orange was sprayed over southeast asia during the 1960s by 
the us military which hoped to deprive communist troops of crops 
and cover 
the herbicide contains the highly toxic dioxin and veterans 
contend that exposure to the defoliant causes cancer miscarriages 
by their wives and birth defects in their children 
in other action the court 
let stand a ruling that forced defense contractor grumman 
aerospace corp to pay damages for an onduty accident involving a 
navy pilot in 1979 
allowed california officials to bar airlines from monitoring 
phone calls between their ticket reservation agents and customers 
rejected the appeal of a minnesota woman severely injured in a

a former continental illinois national bank amp 
trust co officer and an exbanker from oklahoma accused of 
contributing to continentals nearcollapse pleaded guilty thursday 
to criminal charges 
john r lytle pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds and 
william g patterson pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting lytle 
during an appearance before us district judge milton i shadur 
shadur had been scheduled to preside over a retrial of the men 
in september on charges of wire fraud and misapplication of bank 
funds after the defendants initial trial ended with a deadlocked 
jury two months ago 
lytle 53 a former vice president who once headed continentals 
oil and gas lending operation in oklahoma was accused of taking on 
millions of dollars in poorquality loans from customers of penn 
square bank of oklahoma city in return for alleged kickbacks 
patterson 38 former head of energy lending at penn square was 
accused of arranging the kickbacks in the form of 585000 worth of 
unsecured personal loans to lytle between 1980 and 1982 
each faces a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and a 
5000 fine shadur said 
the plea agreement reached by prosecutors and defense attorneys 
will avert another long trial like the 6week proceeding that 
ended may 3 when a jury announced it was hopelessly deadlocked 
after deliberating five days 
however the panel did clear a third defendant in the case 
oklahoma drilling contractor jere sturgis who was charged with 
wire fraud for allegedly participating in a purported scheme to 
defraud continental 
as far as were concerned this is it this puts to rest the 
continental bank chapter book encyclopedia whatever you want to 
call it assistant us attorney joesph duffy said after shadur 
accepted the plea agreement 
the object was justice and we think theres justice in the 
guilty plea he said adding that prosecutors felt it would not 
be in the publics interest to go through another long trial 
shadur last month approved a retrial of lytle and patterson at 
the request of prosecutors who cited that fact that 11 jurors had 
voted to convict the pair and only one had held out for acquittal 
we are looking forward to geting all this behind mr lytle 
after a long long road said james streicker lytles attorney 
i feel weve come to an agreement thats fair to everyone 
lytle said 
penn square failed in 1982 and continental came close to 
collapse two years later after the largest run on deposits in 
banking history the government kept continentals doors open with 
a 45 billion bailout 
prosecutors charged that patterson manipulated lytle and sturgis 
in schemes to save his own failing bank 
the government accused lytle caught in spiraling personal debt 
to finance a luxurious lifestyle of accepting kickbacks from 
patterson in exchange for buying risky energy loans from penn 
square for continental 
the indictment cited lytles involvement in 44 million in loans 
made by continental to 12 penn square customers many without 
documentation it did not say how much was recovered by the chicago 
bank 
attorneys for lytle and patterson contended continental was 
saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive 
lending policy not because of a fraud scheme 
sentencing was set for aug 30

computer associates international inc the 
giant software company still wants to buy atlantabased management 
science america inc its president said thursday 
we generally like to complete what we start said anthony 
wang president of computer associates the garden city nybased 
company that has grown into the worlds biggest independent 
software company 
at its annual shareholders meeting monday management science 
america said its directors rejected an offer of 1150 a share or 
191 million from computer associates 
wang said computer associates was weighing its options but 
said i think if you look at our track record of acquisitions 
were not fooling around in the game 
acquisitions are responsible for a large part of the growth that 
has made computer associates bigger than such betterknown 
companies as microsoft corp and lotus development corp 
management science adjourned its annual meeting until july 12 to 
give shareholders more time to think about some items on its agenda 
in light of the offer from computer associates 
among the items up for a vote is a proposal that would give 
directors more latitude in deciding that a potential acquirer was 
unsuitable 
management science specializes in financial software packages 
for mainframe computers computer associates sells programs for 
computers of all sizes and wang said management science products 
would fit well with its product line 
management science reshuffled its top management earlier this 
year leading to the resignation of 12 officers and reduced 
worldwide employment by 350 people or about 12 percent of its work 
force 
the company earned 24 million in the first quarter on 629 
million in operating revenue in 1987 it had a narrow loss of 
221000 on revenue of 258 million

monsanto co plans to reduce air emissions from 
its worldwide hazardous chemicals operations by 90 percent over the 
next five years the company announced thursday 
monsanto chairman and chief executive officer richard j mahoney 
said at a news conference that the company was making the move even 
though its current emission levels are well within safety 
guidelines 
the best scientific and medical data available indicate that 
the emissions we are reporting to the environmental protection 
agency do not pose a health risk in our plant communities 
mahoney said however the public expects no less than a maximum 
effort to reduce emissions nor should we 
monsanto has nearly 50 plants worldwide with 30 of them in the 
united states 
hal corbett monsantos senior vice president for safety and 
health said the programs target date for completion is dec 31 
1992 
at present corbett said we have the technology in hand 
to achieve a portion of the 1992 target the rest must come from as 
yet undeveloped technologies which we intend to find and put into 
practice 
because the technology does not yet exist corbett said there 
was no way to put a price tag on the program 
but right now we are spending 200 million each year on 
pollution control he said 
the company also estimated its three chemical plants in the st 
louis area combined to produce 44 million pounds of air emissions 
in 1987 the epa requires companies to report their emissions 
annually by july 1 
the emissions numbers may sound large since theyre being 
reported in annual totals said dr barry friedlander monsantos 
director of medical and health sciences but even in the areas 
closest to our plants emissions are well within the limits 
considered safe

union pacific railroad said thursday it will 
close its aging omaha repair shops and shift the operations to its 
fouryearold shops in north little rock ark 
railroad officials said most of the 770 workers in the 
locomotive and car shops in omaha would be offered transfers to 
arkansas or elsewhere starting at the end of september 
jerry davis the railroads executive vice president for 
operations said most workers will be offered transfers to north 
little rock or elsewhere in the railroad system which spans the 
western half of the united states 
davis announced the decision to reporters at the railroads 
headquarters while employees were being informed railroad chairman 
michael walsh briefed union leaders on the change at a meeting in 
kansas city 
davis said the move to north little rock was for reasons of 
economic efficiency to keep the railroad competitive in the 
transportation industry closing the omaha shops will bring a 7 
million onetime savings and will save 2 million a year 
thereafter the railroad said 
the omaha shops operate at 25 percent of capacity while the 
north little rock shops started by missouri pacific railroad 
before it merged with union pacific are using 35 percent of 
capacity 
when a shop thats 75 years old that is in about nine 
different buildings tries to compete with a shop built four years 
ago with the latest technology available in our industry its 
quite evident why productivity is better in north little rock than 
it is in omaha davis said when you read these numbers youll 
see that we had absolutely no choice but to make this decision 
when operations are consolidated in north little rock the shops 
will be operating at 60 percent of capacity he said 
union pacific does major repairs on locomotives and rail cars at 
the omaha and north little rock shops similar repairs are done at 
union pacific shops in salt lake city and fort worth texas and 
davis said the railroad has no plans to close either of them 
when asked if the railroad was considering closing them he 
said i would consider anything to save money 
reporters asked davis if the decision to close the omaha shops 
foretold a longrumored move of the railroads headquarters from 
the city 
at the present we have no plans to do that davis said 
davis stressed that the move from omaha was not related to the 
nebraska business climate 
the closure of the shop has nothing to do with that 
environment it has to do with the age of the shop and the 
overcapacity of the railroad he said 
nebraska gov kay orr said the state was disappointed by the 
railroads decision but she said she understood the reasons for it 
omaha mayor walt calinger said he was disappointed too but he 
said the loss of jobs would be somewhat offset by a new dispatching 
center the railroad plans for an old freight warehouse near 
downtown 
davis said he did not know how many employees at the omaha shops 
would accept transfers 
the decision to do this is a key decision he said it 
greatly affects our employees we want to make sure we do the right 
thing 
the railroad said about 90 percent of the 469 people in the 
omaha locomotive repair shop will be offered transfers to north 
little rock while the rest will be offered jobs in north platte 
neb and salt lake city 
of the 307 workers in the car shop in omaha about 100 will be 
offered transfers to pocatello idaho about 140 will get offers to 
go to desoto mo and about 15 will be offered transfers to 
palestine texas 
the 34 positions in the omaha shops purchasing and materials 
operation will be eliminated about 40 workers will remain in omaha 
for about a year and a half to complete a specialized repair job 
davis said railroad officials did not know what would happen to 
the omaha shops after operations are closed the buildings are on 
235 acres near downtown eppley airfield and the missouri river 
the railroad said the omaha shops represent 10 percent of its 
235 million annual payroll in nebraska

west germany switzerland austria belgium and the netherlands

a new age in environmental monitoring begins 
friday 
its the deadline under a 1986 law for 30000 industrial 
installations to file with federal and state authorities an 
estimated 15 million pages reporting all their releases of 328 
hazardous chemicals to the environment in 1987 
the environmental protection agency is supposed to put the 
information into a data base that anyone with a personal computer 
and a telephone modem can query that system wont be up and 
running until sometime next year 
environmental groups are hoping it will build pressure for 
tighter restrictions on future emissions of dangerous chemicals 
there is less concern about releases to waterways or the ground 
already closely monitored under other laws 
backers saw the community right to know provisions as a 
response to the bhopal india disaster in 1984 in which about 
3000 people were killed by an escaping cloud of methyl isocyanate 
a pesticide raw material 
but industry government and environmental groups are all 
worried that many small businesses dont realize they are covered 
by the law which provides fines of up to 25000 a day for failure 
to comply 
i think theres a lot of misunderstanding out there 
especially among companies that think they are exempt because they 
are not chemical manufacturers said mary bernhard manager of 
environmental policy for the us chamber of commerce 
i got a tremendous number of calls from food processing 
companies said theresa pugh of the national association of 
manufacturers they didnt realize they were covered but they do 
a lot of cleaing of vats with really strong solvents to keep down 
bacteria 
paintusing industries also seem unaware she said 
the reporting requirements apply to companies in the commerce 
departments standard industrial classiciations 20 through 39 
manufacturers of all kinds that have 10 or more employees and meet 
quantity thresholds initially 75000 pounds a year manufactured or 
processed of any of the 328 chemicals perhaps as a raw 
material or 10000 pounds a year used perhaps as a cleaning 
material 
what impressed me was the large size of the numbers said ed 
hopkins of the ohio public interest campaign who inspected the 
first 70 forms arriving at the ohio environmental protection agency 
in columbus two weeks ago 
one hundred thousand pounds of hydrochloric acid from one 
small facility in northeastern ohio i think thats a lot 
even larger numbers are going to be heard an estimated 22 
billion pounds a year of toluene a common petrochemical are 
released to the air nationwide each year 
i dont know what the public reaction is going to be i would 
hope people are going to be so shocked they will call for further 
controls said bill klinefelter a lobbyist with the national 
wildlife federation 
the chemical industry has been visiting newspaper offices for 
months to place its side of the story before editors 
many companies have been releasing the forms to local media 
outlets and environmentalists say they are eager to put their 
own spin on the numbers according to debbie sheiman of the clean 
air coalition a group of environmental and other organizations 
chris cathcart of the chemical manufacturers association said he 
would give this advice to to any citizen coming across news of 
releases in the community if the way the information is reported 
gives him concern he should ask questions of someone he has 
confidence in 
its too early to conclude that new laws are needed he said 
epas sam sassnet part of the team dealing with the incoming 
reports said 10000 pieces of mail had been received 
for people interested in looking up a plant from their 
neighborhood their first recourse is to go to the state he 
said 
in september epa hopes to be able to mail copies of any 
particular form to people requesting it later this month it hopes 
to open a reading room which will gradually fill with reports as 
documents are logged in

difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures

m2 and m3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent which is slightly 
lower than the 1987 target of 55 percent to 85 percent the fed

ending a twoday decline as rain tapered off in the farm belt and 
drought fears regained the upper hand on the chicago board of trade 
on other markets livestock and meat traders were startled by a 
government report of big grain stocks energy futures fell 
precious metals were mixed and stockindex futures advanced 
the national weather services latest 30day outlook issued 
late wednesday gave a big boost to grain and soybean futures

theyre calling for almost no rainfall from illinois east to 
ohio and higherthannormal temperatures in iowa illinois and 
missouri the three biggest soybean states said joel karlin 
research analyst with research department inc in chicago thats 
one area that really needs rain 
wheat futures turned in the strongest performance with most 
contracts advancing the expanded 30 centsabushel daily limit 
the rally was driven by concern about further drought damage to 
the spring wheat crop in the northern great plains and worries that 
wednesdays heavy rains in the central and southern plains would 
hamper progress on the winter wheat harvest karlin said 
rich feltes director of commodity research with refco inc in 
chicago said the recent sharp rise in corn and soybean meal prices 
has made wheat more attractive as a livestock feed and sparked 
fears of a physical shortage of wheat 
there is not enough wheat in 198889 for both animals and 
humans feltes said weve got to do something quickly to 
provide an economic disincentive for wheat feeding in other 
words wheat prices must rise he said 
some oat and soybean contracts also posted limit gains and 
prices for july deliveries of all grains and soybeans soared 
freely the exchange removed limits on the july contracts wednesday 
in a routine action linked to their upcoming expiration 
after the close the agriculture department issued its monthly 
grain stocks report which showed largerthanexpected us stocks 
of corn wheat and soybeans as of june 1

bushel oats were 7 cents to 18 cents higher with july at 353 a

986 a bushel 
the usda also issued its monthly hogs and pigs report which 
surprised observers with its largerthanexpected estimate of the 
nations hog herd as of june 1 the report also showed a sharply 
higher tally of pigs born from march through may than most analysts 
had expected and it indicated hog producers intended to breed a 
relatively large number of sows through november 
the report was called bearish for futures prices but analysts 
noted that it reflected breeding intentions prior to this months 
sharp rise in feedgrain prices producers likely will reduce their 
breeding plans in light of the higher hogproduction costs 
analysts said 
its kind of hard to look at the corn and soybean prices weve 
got right now and believe producers are going to breed at these 
levels over the next six months said tom ohare an analyst with 
smith barney harris upham amp co in new york that would be like 
the stock market rallying to new highs with the prime rate just 
having increased 10 points 
in trading ahead of the report live cattle settled 30 cent

payless cashways incs board of 
directors on thursday approved a 909 million offer from senior 
management to take the building supplies company private in a 
leveraged buyout 
management will pay 27 a share in cash for the companys 3366 
million outstanding shares higher than the 26ashare offer the 
group unveiled last week 
payless spokeswoman maureen burgess said the higher offer 
resulted from negotiations between the special board commitee and 
the management group and included the settlement of certain 
litigation 
the buyout was an apparent effort to discourage unwanted 
attention from new york investor asher b edelman who had built a 
stake in the company and indicated he might be interested in making 
a formal takeover offer 
edelman partner corey horowitz said his group is monitoring the 
situation carefully and awaiting details of the management offer 
before deciding what the best course of action is he did not 
rule out making a takeover bid 
in trading thursday on the new york stock exchange payless rose 
1 a share to close at 2650 
a special committee of independent directors and the payless 
board approved the offer at a meeting at the companys headquarters 
in kansas city 
we believe our proposal to acquire payless cashways serves the 
best interest of all the companys constituents said payless 
chairman david stanley in a statement 
the companys shareholders will receive full and fair value 
for their investment and for employees and customers payless will 
continue as a strong independent leader in the building materials 
retail industry he added 
the acquisition will be made through a tender offer that will 
begin as soon as practicable the company said in a statement 
in a leveraged buyout investors borrow heavily to buy a company 
and then pay off the debt with the target companys cash flow or 
the sale of its assets 
payless said the transaction will involve a substantial number 
of employees including all store managers as equity 
participants over the next three years more than 300 employees 
will receive stock options representing up to 15 percent of the 
companys common equity 
the key people to payless performance will now have a large 
equity stake in the companys future stanley said 
he added that payless does not plan to sell off parts of the 
company he noted that a handful of the companys 200 retail 
outlets that does not meet minimum profitability levels might be 
closed but that is exclusive of the buyout plan 
payless is a building materials specialty retailer that services 
the home improvement maintenance and repair market the companys 
stores are located in 26 states in the midwest southwest pacific 
coast and new england areas 
edelman and his partners who once held a 99 percent stake in 
payless now control about 81 percent of the companys shares the 
group complained earlier this week that it was denied access to 
important financial information about payless that could have been 
used to formulate an offer 
in addition to edelman the investor group also includes payless 
competitor sutherland lumber southwest inc a privately owned 
company that operates about 86 building materials stores in midwest 
and southern states 
payless has been the subject of takeover talk for about three 
months 
the management group takeover is led by stanley larry kunz 
president of payless cashways melvin and harold cohen cochairmen 
of somerville lumber a payless subsidiary and payless cashways 
five senior vice presidents 
at the time of the companys last proxy statement on feb 25 
the group headed by stanley owned less than 2 percent of the 
companys stock 
earlier this week two payless shareholders filed suit against 
the company and its directors challenging the initial 26ashare 
offer which the shareholders called a fraudulently low and 
unfair price as part of the final deal the suit has been 
settled 
morgan guaranty trust co and canadian imperial bank of commerce 
are leading the financing effort providing a 600 million loan a 
number of other financial institutions are participating

bond prices finished higher thursday in thin 
trading supported by favorable sentiment surrounding the dollar 
the treasurys key 30year issue was up nearly 6 per 1000 in 
face amount its yield which moves inversely to price and is a 
possible signal of other interest rate trends declined to 885 
percent from 892 percent late wednesday 
bond prices opened higher and held their ground throughout the 
trading session analysts noted however that few investors were 
active in the credit markets 
many already had squared their positions ahead of the end of the 
quarter while others had already left to get a jump on the long 
independence day weekend 
bond traders initially were encouraged that the dollars value 
did not decline significantly after the west german central bank 
hiked a key interest rate which theoretically makes the west 
german mark worth more 
belgium and the netherlands also raised key interest rates 
following the west german move 
the dollars value is closely watched in the credit markets 
because it directly affects bond values a stronger dollar attracts 
foreign capital and boosts bond prices while a weaker dollar 
discourages foreigners from investing in the united states incites 
higher inflation and erodes bond prices 
although the dollar declined later in new york trading bond 
prices failed to retreat in what one analyst called a strange 
phenomenon 
i dont see bonds reacting to anything understandable said 
robert brusca chief economist and senior vice president at nikko 
securities co international inc 
he said that despite the dollars weaker finish in new york 
there seems to be better underlying sentiment toward the us 
currency that helped to support bond prices 
elizabeth reiners a vice president at dean witter reynolds 
inc also noted that traders are beginning to realize that the 
treasury may not sell 30year bonds at the regular quarterly 
refunding in august 
that can raise prices because of a lack of supply she said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues rose 116 point to 316 point intermediate 
maturities rose 316 point to 1532 point and longterm issues 
gained 1532 point according to figures provided by telerate inc 
a financial information service 
the movement of a point equals a 10 change in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the merrill lynch daily treasury index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer rose 018 to 11021 the shearson lehman daily 
treasury bond index which makes a similar measurement rose 315 
to 115316 
municipal issues rose in corporate trading industrials and 
utilities also rose moodys investment grade corporate bond index 
which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer rose 053 to 28503 
yields on threemonth treasury bills were off 2 basis points at 
655 percent a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point 
sixmonth bills fell 1 basis point to 670 percent and year bills 
fell 4 basis points to 697 percent 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted late in the day at 8 percent up from 7 percent

developer edward debartolo says that over the 
next decade he and his new partner robert campeau could be 
spending more than 1 billion annually opening as many as 10 
shopping centers a year in the united states 
the partnership which has turned the us retailing and real 
estate industries on their ears foresees the construction of five 
to 10 centers a year beginning in about two years debartolo told 
campeau corps annual meeting thursday 
i think hes a pretty exciting guy and hes got a lot of 
guts debartolo said of campeau after the jampacked meeting 
debartolo a new campeau director helped the torontobased 
company complete the biggest takeover in us history outside the 
oil industry with the purchase in may of federated department 
stores inc for 66 billion 
he loaned campeau about 480 million for the federated purchase 
in return for more than 50 percent of his us holding company 
campeau corp us 
campeau who spent part of the meeting fending off concerns 
about the companys debt said later that he and debartolo would 
share financing for any future shopping center projects in the 
united states 
although campeau built his fortune in canada he is focusing his 
attention on improving profit prospects for federated and allied 
stores bought in 1986 for 36 billion 
in return for a commitment to anchor new shopping malls with 
prestige allied and federated department stores such as 
bloomingdales campeau can bargain with developers for substantial 
equity interests in their malls 
that gives campeau and debartolo enormous clout in mapping 
shopping center development in the united states 
lets say theyre uncomfortable debartolo told reporters 
when asked how competitors feel about his new partner 
meanwhile the feisty campeau sporting a bandage on his left

fbi agents eavesdropped as a navy procurement 
official read to a private defense consultant the sealed bids from 
10 companies competing for a 120 million air control contract 
court documents disclosed thursday 
in a 27page affidavit for a search warrant for the 
officeathome of consultant mark c saunders in suburban virginia 
fbi agent joanne t burns said courtordered wiretaps and office 
bugging devices captured the relay of confidential inside 
information on nine defense contracts worth a total of more than 
522 million 
another affidavit by fbi agent james b lamb spelled out the 
grounds for searching the offices of varian continental electronics 
of dallas one of the firms saunders dealt with the saunders 
affidavit was attached to the varian affidavit 
the affidavits laid out the governments burgeoning 
investigation of defense contract fraud and bribery in greater 
detail than ever since the probe was revealed by coordinated 
searches around the nation june 14 
if you can get anything we can make some money the 
documents quoted one consultant as telling saunders in a 
conversation monitored by the fbi the documents contained the 
first publicly disclosed quotes from the governments eavesdropping 
the fbi said there is probable cause to believe that all of 
saunders business records dated june 1982 to present 
constitute evidence of the criminal activities of mark c 
saunders 
saunders is a former navy procurement officer convicted of and 
fired for stock trading on insider navy information in 1982 the 
fbi said saunders was receiving inside contract data from his navy 
successor george stone and it believes that saunders is paying 
stone for this information 
stone is one of six pentagon officials transferred to other 
duties after their offices were searched 
a phone call to a number the fbi listed as the one at which 
saunders reached stone was not answered thursday night 
in all the documents list the dates and location of wiretapping 
and electronic bugging in the homes and offices of nine defense 
consultants including one not previously named they describe the 
initial tip that triggered the investigation in september 1986 
the documents also give a taste of the sums of money involved 
for the consultants revealing that saunders and another 
consultant thomas muldoon were paid 8000 a month by litton a 
major defense contractor which was just one of at least three 
companies they worked for jointly 
the documents detailed not only the flow of inside contract 
information but also alleged that saunders under government 
subcontract to devise a plan for the navy to buy radios conspired 
with joe bradley vice president for marketing of varian 
continental to rig the purchase requirements so varian continental 
could beat other companies in the bidding 
the affidavits were ordered unsealed thursday by us magistrate 
john b tolle in dallas federal agents requested the documents be 
sealed june 10 saying they did not want to reveal the existence of 
courtapproved wiretaps that were still being used in the 
investigation 
the fbi said the searches were needed to investigate possible 
bribery of public officials conflict of interest theft of 
government property false statements mail and wire fraud and 
conspiracy to defraud the united states 
varian continentals parent company varian associates inc 
headquartered in palo alto calif was the 155th largest defense 
contractor for 1986 according to the affidavit the parent company 
received more than 8176 million in defense awards that year 
gary simpson spokesman for varian associates said company 
officials have not had an opportunity to review the unsealed 
affidavit and would not immediately comment on its specific 
allegations 
our own internal investigation is continuing and at this point 
we do not believe the company was involved in any criminal 
misconduct simpson said we have been advised that continental 
electronics is not a target of the investigation mr bradley has 
been placed on administrative leave until our investigation is 
complete 
simpson said bradleys leave was effective thursday 
a justice department spokesman john russell said federal 
prosecutors in charge of the investigation were surprised and 
shocked that the affadavits had been released in dallas 
we didnt know it was being made public said russell 
adding that the department would have no further comment 
the magistrate unsealed the documents because the government had 
asked that they remain sealed only until june 30 
the fbi said saunders regularly acquired information from stone 
and relayed it to muldoon to give to defense contractors the fbi 
said it got a court order to tap saunders telephones in virginia 
in september 1987 
saunders speaks with muldoon almost daily and provides him 
with information and documents relating to various government 
contracts the fbi said in return muldoon pays saunders 
onehalf of the money which muldoon receives from the contractors 
who pay muldoon for the information provided by saunders 
the fbi said saunders told muldoon that he saunders is 
paying a lot in expenses to get information on specific programs 
it is believed these payments are to stone because the statements 
made by saunders to muldoon were in regard to programs about 
which stone passed information to saunders 
the marine corps and the navy space and naval warfare command 
where stone is director of information management services and 
information transfer purchase division are taking bids on an 
advanced tactical air command control system which the fbi said 
may be worth 120 million initial proposals were submitted in 
august 1987 
on sept 30 1987 the fbi intercepted a conversation at 
saunders home between stone and saunders the fbi said 
stone provided saunders with the following figures from each 
of the competitors proposals saic 534 esystems 888 ge 
908 ford 1321 comptek 1371 ltv 1389 grumman 1403 
unisys 1430 utc norden 1444 and litton 1987 it is 
believed these numbers refer to millions of dollars 
it is not known exactly what the figures represented but it 
is known that the figures were not supposed to be given out and 
that the lower its figure the better off a company was in the 
competition the fbi said 
saunders in turn told muldoon over the telephone the relative 
positions of the companies for which muldoon was working or 
considering working the fbi said

the fbi detailed continued meetings through april 1988 between 
saunders and stone usually over lunch but once when saunders 
helped stone move into his new home the fbi described how later 
each day saunders passed on information to muldoon 
the data saunders allegedly passed included word that all but 
two companies would be eliminated by the final bidding the later 
bids by ford and norden and that by february norden was considered 
among the top four bidders even though esystems and ford were 
lower in price the fbi said muldoon was working for norden 
at one point the fbi said saunders warned muldoon to be 
careful to whom he relayed some information because it was 
extraordinarily private 
when saunders told muldoon that norden had become a leading 
bidder muldoon replied that the 60000 is in the bag now 
neither saunders nor muldoon answered phone calls to their homes 
thursday night 
the fbi said it began tapping muldoons telephones in washington 
in july 1987 
the fbi also said 
saunders got advance word in december 1987 from stone about a 
32 million contract for secure navy radio equipment 
stone called saunders at home in january 1988 to give him the 
names of the finalists which he called the inside skinny on a 
10 million navy contract for a tactical environmental support 
system saunders told muldoon that this data was hard to get and 
now we cant even make any money on it 
in november 1987 saunders provided muldoon with a draft of the 
governments plan for acquiring a 50 million fiber optics cable 
system 
in august 1987 saunders told muldoon the company he was 
working for rated poorly on the technical aspects of its bid for a 
more than 100 million digital wideband transmission system 
contract 
in august 1987 saunders told muldoon about an internal navy 
split over how to handle a 10 million contract for a prototype of 
a sonar system 
in july 1987 saunders told muldoon that a 100 million 
antisubmarine warfare operation center contract might have to be 
restructured and rebid 
in november 1987 stone told saunders of a decision that day 
about a 100 million digital communications terminal contract 
the ninth contract described by the fbi was a 9000 government 
subcontract which had been awarded to saunders to develop a plan to 
buy radios the fbi said saunders worked with bradley so varian 
could win the radio contract 
the fbi said that in a series of conversations from september to 
december of 1987 bradley and saunders discussed how to write the 
acquisition plan to make it difficult for other companies to 
compete with varian 
in one conversation saunders allegedly confirmed receiving a 
1600 check from bradley bradley allegedly said if things worked 
out for varian he would try to get a bonus for saunders the fbi 
said 
bradley told saunders that bradley would like to wash the 
payment and suggested that perhaps he should make the payments to 
marilyn burgess instead of saunders the fbi said the fbi said 
ms burgess lives at saunders home and is vice president of his 
company 
but saunders told bradley that he had someone else in mind 
that being met associates a company owned by tom muldoon the 
fbi said 
the fbi said saunders also did work for varian continental on 
contracts with the us information agency and the voice of 
america fbi agents overheard saunders telling an associate in 
september 1987 about that work if i thought dod department of 
defense was corrupt it is absurd the way these people operate 
there was no explanation of who these people were 
the fbi said the investigation began september 1986 when the fbi 
and the naval investigative service were told that a consultant had 
approached an employee of a company which had bid on a marine corps 
contract offering to provide competitors costs and bid data and 
government bid evaluations 
with the employees consent agents recorded his conversations 
with the consultant who subsequently was confronted and agreed to 
cooperate in recording conversations with other individuals 
this group of recordings revealed the fbi said that defense 
consultant william parkin a retired navy missile buyer served 
as a middleman who paid government employees for inside information 
and sold it to contractors in january 1987 a court ordered 
tapping of parkins office and home telephones 
by april 1987 the fbi said those wiretaps led agents to tap 
the telephones and bug the offices of consultant william galvin 
by june 1987 taps and bugs were authorized for the office 
telephones and office of consultant melvyn paisley who had 
resigned three months earlier as assistant navy secretary for 
research engineering and systems 
the fbi later tapped or bugged consultant donald illeman in 
southern california illeman who has not been previously 
identified with the case did not immediately return a telephone 
message 
later taps or bugs were placed on consultants fred lackner 
charles gardner and jim rapinac 
the fbi filed a fivepage handwritten list of items seized in 
bradleys office including a rolodex file a letter dated may 19 
1988 from saunders to bradley regarding a contractual agreement a 
computer floppy disc a voa debriefing correspondence file 
containing bid correspondence and a memo from the deputy 
secretary of defense regarding controlling defense outlays
