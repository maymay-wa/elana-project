federal prosecutors are investigating a 
controversial transaction through which mayorelect david dinkins 
said he transferred stock to his son the daily news reported 
sunday 
the probe by us attorney andrew maloneys office is part of a 
larger inquiry into a cable television franchise related to inner 
city broadcasting corp the news quoted unidentified law 
enforcement sources as saying 
investigators are trying to determine whether dinkins 
transferred inner city stock to his son david dinkins jr through 
a genuine transaction in 1985 how much it was worth and whether 
taxes were fully paid the news said 
dinkins spokesman david fishlow said the mayorelect had 
hired a criminal attorney charles stillman 
im confident this inquiry will reveal that theres nothing 
with which i need to be concerned dinkins told reporters sunday 
those of us in public life are subject to criticism and scrutiny 
of all sorts over time 
dinkins said the federal investigation is a response to a 
suggestion by his opponent republican rudolph giuliani that the 
stock deal be looked into 
my marching order from mr dinkins is 1000 percent 
cooperation stillman told the news we want to put this thing 
to bed once and for all 
stillman however also described the investigation as rudy 
giulianis last hurrah 
dinkins a democrat defeated giuliani last month following a 
campaign highlighted by questions about dinkins finances giuliani 
is a former us attorney for manhattan maloney is us attorney 
for brooklyn 
inner city owns a number of radio stations and one of its 
subsidiaries has a substantial interest in the queens innerunity 
cable systems franchise its chairman former manhattan borough 
president president percy sutton is a longtime friend of dinkins 
dinkins first acquired stock in the privately held company in 
1972 his holdings grew to 588 shares largely he has said 
through stock splits 
dinkins said he transferred the stock to his son after his 
election as manhattan borough president in 1985 to avoid a conflict 
between his position on the board of estimate and the boards role 
in regulating cable television 
it was assumed at the time that he gave the shares to his son as 
a gift 
during the mayoral campaign it was revealed that dinkins had 
not paid a gift tax dinkins released a handwritten note dated oct 
30 1985 in which his son agreed to buy the stock promising to 
pay 58000 in 1991 plus 8 percent interest a year 
dinkins his son and sutton then declined to release financial 
or corporate records that might further document the transaction as 
described 
the news said the investigation includes testing the paper and 
the ink in the note to determine whether it was written in 1985 or 
during the campaign there also are plans to analyze the 
handwriting 
dinkins once placed the stocks worth at 1 million on a 
financial disclosure form but during the campaign he said he had 
done so in error based on an inflated appraisal by sutton 
the city department of investigation is conducting a separate 
previously disclosed investigation into whether dinkins filed 
misleading financial disclosure forms regarding the stock

after four days of hiding out in europe olympic 
gold medalist nadia comaneci spent her first full day of freedom in 
the united states on saturday doing the same thing 
the 28yearold romanian gymnast who burst into prominence with 
her run of perfect 10s in the 1976 olympics slipped out of sight 
friday following a brief news conference shortly after her arrival 
at john f kennedy international airport 
i wanted to have a free life said comaneci who was 
guaranteed political asylum here and on saturday that included 
staying out of the limelight generated by her defection 
comaneci reportedly spent friday night in new york but there 
were varying reports about her whereabouts saturday 
united states gymnastics federation spokeswoman patti auer said 
the state department told a federation official that comaneci was 
headed to miami on saturday afternoon on a pan am flight 
but the captain of the flight comaneci was scheduled to take 
said she had canceled her plans 
nadia was to be with us on our flight but she decided to 
stay in new york said pilot conrad gosheff at the last 
minute they said shes not coming 
pan am spokeswoman suzanne timper said the airline which 
carried comaneci into the united states from vienna had no 
reservations out of jfk under the gymnasts name reporters at jfk 
when the miamibound flight was due to board did not see her and 
port authority police who patrol the sprawling airport said they 
werent aware of her plans 
auer said comaneci has not contacted us and wed like to know 
what her plans are 
state department press officer sondra mccarty said her agency 
was not providing any information on comaneci 
in addition to the report that comaneci was heading to miami 
there were reports after her arrival here that she might go to 
indianapolis houston or orlando fla 
indianapolis is where the us gymnastics federation is based 
while comanecis former romanian coach bela karoly now is a us 
citizen and runs an elite gymnastics training camp north of houston 
another romanian exile john boularca of davie fla said that 
comaneci was coming to florida to stay with konstantin panit and 
his family panit accompanied comaneci at her news conference 
friday he lives with his wife and three children in a community of 
romanians in south florida 
comaneci was 14 years old when she gained worldwide fame by 
becoming the first gymnast ever to score a perfect 10 at the 
olympics an achievement she repeated seven times at the 1976 
games 
she won 21 gold medals altogether in olympic and other 
international meets during her career earning a life of privilege 
in her hardline communist homeland 
comaneci accompanied by six fellow romanians crossed the 
border into hungary on tuesday and went into hiding she told a 
border guard she was leaving romania for the sake of freedom 
romania unlike other eastern european countries has resisted the 
recent trend toward political and personal liberty for its 
residents 
comaneci would be eligible to apply for permanent resident 
status in the united states in one year us officials said 
karolyi who was in west germany last week said friday that he 
planned to return to the united states this weekend and hoped to 
meet up with comaneci perhaps in indianapolis 
mike jacki the gymnastics federations executive director said 
late saturday that he understood comaneci would initially stay in a 
romanian immigrant neighborhood in miami 
im anticipating that shell be there as long as she needs to 
be there jacki told the associated press in indianapolis 
jacki said comaneci has been granted refugee status and now 
needs to select a us citizen as a sponsor 
regardless of where she ends up at least in the immediate 
future we are hopeful to have dialogue with her and give her some 
advice and guidance he said 
id hate to have her make a decision that would be without 
that guidance this is america and we want her to like it here and 
a have a positive and honest experience in everything she does 
he said among her options would be working for the us 
federation or public relations or be a candidate for the 
international federation as a coach she could touch many 
athletes 
jackis wife terry told the indianapolis star that comaneci is 
welcome to stay with her and her husband adding i think she 
kind of wants to stay here awhile

former federal housing secretary samuel pierce 
awarded a 350000 grant to a longtime friend although other 
housing officials had rejected the project the new york times 
reported 
the 1985 grant was awarded to samuel p singletary a republican 
who helped direct pierces unsuccessful campaigns for election as a 
manhattan judge in 1959 and 1960 the times reported in its sunday 
editions 
dubois l gilliam a former pierce aide told the times that 
pierce ordered him to give the grant to singletary even though 
others at the department of housing and urban development opposed 
it on the ground that singletarys firm had too little experience 
i think it was a case where there was a longterm friendship 
between pierce and singletary said gilliam who is serving an 
18month prison sentence after pleading guilty to conspiracy 
charges involving other hud grants 
gilliam said singletary repeatedly called pierce about 
singletarys washingtonbased consulting firm the center for 
resource development 
pierce told me he wanted us to help singletary get some money 
he said singletary is a good guy gilliam told the times 
pierce said through a lawyer robert e plotkin that he did not 
remember the grant to singletary even if he had ordered it there 
would not have been anything improper about it the lawyer said 
this was a discretionary fund this was his absolute right and 
authority plotkin told the times 
singletary told the times that he met with pierce several times 
but said he never discussed the grant 
are you asking me if sam pierce did me a favor absolutely 
not singletary said 
the times said hud records indicate that singletarys group was 
supposed to use the grant to assist the cities of camden and east 
orange in programs to attract private development money to new 
jersey 
in recent months pierce citing his fifth amendment right 
against self incrimination has refused to cooperate with 
congressional inquiries into political favoritism and fraud at hud 
during the reagan administration

the philippine government asked for us 
warplanes to attack rebel targets to help put down the latest 
military coup attempt against president corazon aquinos 
government two newspapers reported in their sunday editions 
the urgent requests which the bush administration refused 
late thursday were made by defense secretary fidel ramos through 
military and intelligence channels the washington post reported 
citing a variety of unnamed administration sources 
the los angeles times also citing an anonymous source reported 
that the philippine government asked that american planes bomb 
rebelheld air bases fuel dumps and a seaborne freighter 
the us embassy in manilla received telephone calls from mrs 
aquino ramos and another senior defense official the times said 
the requests were numerous and confused making it difficult for 
gen colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to 
sort them out according to the post 
the request for us planes to bomb some positions was turned 
down because americans may have been on bases commandeered by the 
rebels and out of concern for the political impact of direct us 
intervention the post said 
us f4 fighterbombers flew cover for government troops on 
friday and early saturday morning but were idle on sunday and never 
fired a shot at ground targets us officials said 
according to earlier administration accounts the jets were not 
deployed until mrs aquino made a formal request through us 
ambassador nicholas platt 
the times said aquino wanted the fuel dumps and an armoured 
column to come under us attack ramos called for attacks on the 
air bases to disable rebelcontrolled aircraft on the ground the 
philippine military official who was not identified wanted the 
us to attack the freighter believed to be carrying munitions or 
reinforcements for the rebels

a leader of the philippine coup attempt said 
us military intervention was all that had kept president corazon 
aquinos government from toppling and vowed to continue the 
insurrection in an interview published sunday 
it aint over until its over brig gen edgardo m abenina 
told the the los angeles times we shall fight and we shall 
continue fighting for what we believe in for the honor of our 
nation and the dignity of our people even if it means going into 
a stage of civil war 
rebel soldiers battled loyalist troops in manilas financial 
district and at armed forces headquarters sunday the third day of 
an attempt to overthrow aquino 
abenina a former officer of the philippine constabulary said 
the insurgents are mostly present or former members of the 
philippine armed forces and none are politicians he described them 
as reformminded nationalists 
abenina said rebels were fighting aquino to free the filipinos 
from the shackles of poverty and subservience that have been forced 
upon us by the rich and powerful by elitist governments like that 
of cory aquino 
he added our whole point is that for centuries the 
philippines have been under the mercy and control of a very few 
politicians and moneyed people the coup according to abenina 
has been planned for more than a year 
abenina who aquino has identified as a rebel ringleader said 
our goal is to purge the armed forces and the political 
leadership of the government of the rampant corruption and 
patronage that has set in from the highest to the lowest levels 
lt col gregorio gringo honasan is part of the coups 
leadership abenina said honasan led an august 1987 coup attempt 
that left 53 dead he was imprisoned but escaped in april 1988 
abenina also took part in the coup attempt and was jailed and later 
escaped 
abenina said if the coup succeeds he will establish a 
militarycivilian governing council with himself in charge the 
council would have five to seven members exercise unchallenged 
executive power and include dozens of filipino experts technocrats 
and professors abenina said 
he said the coup attempt which began friday would have been 
successful if the us mililtary had not intervened 
when president bush announced that he was extending air support 
to the philippines military we were about to take over the 
government abenina said then the us warplanes appeared we 
simply cannot hope to win against the stronger power of the united 
states air force 
according to american officials us f4 fighterbombers flew 
cover for loyalist troops on friday and early saturday morning but 
never fired a shot at ground targets

president bush and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev ended two days of stormtossed summitry sunday 
and said they were satisfied they had made progress toward a better 
eastwest relationship in a time of tumultuous change in europe 
but neither man pointed to a specific agreement on a key range 
of arms control or other issues and at an unprecedented joint news 
conference cited specific disagreements over weapons shipments to 
leftist rebels in el salvador and proposed naval arms reductions 
the two men seemed at ease as they fielded questions aboard the 
soviet luxury liner maxim gorky shaking hands and leaving the news 
conference together at its conclusion 
gorbachev said he was encouraged and inspired by the changes 
in eastern europe where hardline regimes have been swept away in 
recent weeks 
bush said the soviet leader had laid to rest the soviet 
doctrine under which the kremlin had invaded hungary in 1956 and 
czechoslovakia in 1968 
gorbachev said that in his two days of talks with bush there 
were elements of optimism and pessimism here and i wouldnt dwell 
into the details 
it was a no agenda meeting it accomplished everything i hoped 
it would bush said 
gorbachev said there was no specific timetable for a new arms 
agreement to cut long range nuclear forces by 50 percent but he 
hoped one could be agreed on before a summit set for next june in 
the united states 
the two men directed secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze to meet again soon 
on arms control issues 
gorbachev also said bush had made a new proposal to reduce 
chemical weapons that was positive and that topranking officials 
on both sides would be meeting to continue negotiating a treaty 
both bush and gorbachev stressed the importance of their 
personal relationship despite their repeated references to the 
differences they found over the two days 
we stated both of us that the world leaves the one epoch of 
cold war and enters another epoch he said this is just the 
beginning we are just at the very beginning of our long road to a 
longlasting peaceful period 
near the end of their news conference gorbachev suggested 
thanking reporters for their cooperation but he added although 
of course we dont know what theyve written yet or what they will 
be writing 
said bush reserve the right to thank them afterwards you 
mean after weve seen what theyve written 
replied gorbachev no right now and they will write better 
bush said the two men had begun to develop a future that can 
realize a lasting peace and transform the eastwest relationship 
but when asked about gorbachevs desire for naval arms 
reductions he said he was disinclined to think that is an area 
where we will make immediate progress 
asked about central america where the united states has 
complained about continued flow of soviet arms to el salvador 
rebels bush said we had an indepth discussion on these 
questions as president gorbachev has said 
he added i cant say there are no differences between us but 
we had a chance to talk about them 
the two men fielded questions after ending nearly eight hours of 
talks over two days that focused on arms control trade regional 
conflicts in central america and elsewhere as well as europe 
bush was flying to brussels after the summit to brief nato 
leaders on the summit talks gorbachev was going to moscow to hold 
a similar meeting with warsaw pact leaders many of them newly 
installed as a result of eastern european changes 
howling winds and heavy seas have plagued the summit throughout 
curtailing saturdays sessions and forcing the leaders to meet 
aboard a soviet luxury liner rather than us and soviet warships 
but the rains that flooded this mediterranean island abated sunday 
and skies were gray but clearing 
long time no see gorbachev told bush at the opening of 
sundays meeting 
back again bush said smiling 
you did a little sea travel gorbachev said 
secretary of state james a baker iii was wearing a medicinal 
patch behind his ear to ward off seasickness but white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said bush was feeling terrific and 
enjoying the rough weather 
gorbachev he added doesnt share our love of the sea 
as he was departing the uss belknap the president was asked if 
the weather had made the summit a failure hell no hell no he 
replied this summits going just fine thank you 
said bush we dont care where were meeting the big thing is 
were getting something done and its good 
fitzwater said bush attended a worship service aboard the uss 
belknap before leaving for the soviet cruise ship 
during a stormshortened opening summit session saturday bush 
invited gorbachev to the united states in the last two weeks of 
june 1990 setting a target date for a meeting that was agreed on 
last september 
they worked to fix target dates for signing treaties that would 
slash strategic nuclear arms conventional forces in central europe 
and chemical weapons on both sides 
bush suggested signing a treaty providing a 30 percent to 50 
percent cut in longrange nuclear arms by the june summit and 
signing an accord on reducing us and soviet ground forces in 
europe at a natowarsaw pact meeting in vienna late next year 
on saturday bush took note of the dramatic changes under way in 
eastern europe where the berlin wall has crumbled and several 
hardline communist regimes have been swept aside recently by 
urging gorbachev to join him in recommending that berlin be the 
site of the 2004 olympic games 
bush also expressed willingness to help the soviet economy as a 
means of bolstering the gorbachevs domestic reforms a white house 
official who spoke only on condition he not be identified said 
that if the soviets pass a liberal emigration law that is being 
pushed by gorbachev bush will grant moscow a range of trade favors 
the assistance could include steps to grant the soviet union

communist leader egon krenz and his ruling 
party politburo resigned sunday along with the central committee 
hounded from office by increasing demands from east germanys 
emboldened prodemocracy movement 
former hardline party leader erich honecker was expelled from 
the party he had led for 18 years until he was ousted and replaced 
by krenz on oct 18 
three recently fired politburo members were arrested on 
corruption charges and a senior trade official fled east germany 
politburo member guenter schabowski who was generally 
considered a reformer announced the resignations of the 10man 
politburo and the 163member central committee on state radio 
they came as the communist partys policymaking central 
committee met in an emergency session following demands from the 
burgeoning prodemocracy movement that krenz 52 resign he was 
jeered by party members saturday 
the resignations were the latest development in a historic 
series of political changes that have transformed east germany from 
a hardline communist nation to one that is at the forefront of 
eastern europes reform movement 
under pressure from mass demonstrations and the exodus of 
thousands east germany has thrown open its borders and the berlin 
wall and lawmakers eliminated the communists constitutionally 
guaranteed leading role in society 
in a deperate attempt to retain power and put a lid on the 
prodemocracy movement krenz had promised the people that he would 
investigate disclosures of corruption and high living among top 
party officials 
the communist party on sunday expelled a large number of its 
former leadership including honecker former premier willi stoph 
and former parliament speaker horst sindermann the staterun news 
agency adn said 
the move came after growing calls for the resignations of krenz 
and the entire leadership amid charges of massive corruption in the 
top party ranks 
one of those arrested was the senior economic adviser to 
honecker 
alexander schalckgolodkowski a state secretary in the foreign 
trade ministry fled east germany after authorities opened an 
investigation against him for suspected illegal weapons sales adn 
said sunday 
schalckgolodkowski was east germanys chief trade negotiator 
and had headed a department responsible for making hardcurrency 
sales 
government spokesman wolfgang meyer said schalckgolodkowski was 
stripped of his functions following his escape adn said he went to 
west germany on saturday for trade talks and returned to east 
germany later the same day 
wolfgang vogel the countrys most prominent lawyer told 
authorities early sunday that schalckgolodkowski was at an 
unknown location outside east germany and that he had asked vogel 
to represent him according to adn 
the investigation was opened after officials saturday discovered 
a secret operation to ship weapons to the middle east africa and 
south america adn said hardcurrency earnings from the sales went 
to the countrys foreign trade bank addressed to 
schalckgolodkowski it said 
on saturday 3000 communist party members jeered krenz and 
whistled when he promised the party would investigate disclosures 
of corruption and high living among top party officials too 
late they shouted 
ousted politburo members guenter mittag and harry tisch were 
taken into investigative custody suspected of heavily damaging 
socialist property and the peoples economy through abuse of 
power adn said sunday 
also arrested was gerhard mueller a former party leader in the 
city of erfurt and former candidate member of the politburo 
prosecutors issued the arrest warrants saturday and they were 
apprehended later the news agency said it did not specify which 
day 
mittag had been the senior economic adviser to honecker the 
communist party has blamed the two for east germanys economic 
crisis and has begun a disciplinary investigation of them mittag 
was ousted from the party last month 
tisch had been the chief of the communistrun trade unions 
federation until the organization expelled him on nov 27 he also 
was removed from the ruling politburo last month for allegedly 
abusing his powers 
two other former highranking communist officials were arrested 
on saturday hans albrecht the former party chief in the suhl 
region and walter wolf director of a large home construction 
company in suhl were arrested under suspicion of fraudulently 
damaging socialist property adn said without elaboaration 
on friday lawmakers heard complaints at a parliamentary session 
that top officials had taken bribes indulged themselves with 
luxuries at state expense and stashed away more than 54 billion in 
foreign bank accounts 
since taking over from honecker on oct 18 krenz has begun a 
program of sweeping reforms that includes promises of free 
elections and abolition of the communists 40year monopoly of 
power 
krenz was jeered in a speech saturday night outside the central 
committee building it was his latest attempt to distance himself 
from the old hardline leadership of which he was a prominent 
member he has denied living opulently as other leaders did under 
honecker 
the lavish lifestyles of top party officials have been a major 
source of discontent in a country where the average citizen has to 
wait 10 years or more for a car

embattled communist leaders on 
sunday named five noncommunists to a new coalition government but 
an angered opposition called the appointments an outrage and 
vowed to resume demonstrations 
the communists held on to 16 of the 21 cabinet seats including 
the premiership and the powerful defense ministry the staterun 
media said thirteen members were holdovers from the previous 
communist cabinet 
the appointments were made by communist premier ladislav adamec 
and president gustav husak a hardliner who took control of the 
communist party after warsaw pact tanks crushed the democratic 
prague spring reforms in 1968 it is the first time 
noncommunists have held top government positions since 1968 
jiri dienstbier a spokesman for civic forum the nations 
largest opposition group rejected the new government saying it 
is more complicated than that 
he said civic forum would call another mass rally monday at 
wenceslas square the focal point of two weeks of prodemocracy 
protests that ended the communists 41year monopoly on power 
one civic forum leader speaking on condition of anonymity 
called the new government an outrage and said the monday rally 
would get czechoslovakians back on the street 
striking students whose protest of police brutality at a nov 17 
demonstration spurred the nations peaceful revolt laughed 
derisively as they listened to a radio announcement of the new 
cabinet 
it is a disappointment said a strike leader michael cech 
we will now have to decide what to do 
adamec who opened negotiations with the opposition 12 days ago 
retained his post the staterun news agency ctk reported 
among the new communist appointees was miroslav vacek who took 
over the post of defense minister vacek an army general was 
named despite an opposition demand that the ministry be headed by a 
civilian 
vacek had served as deputy minister under former defense 
minister milan vaclavik also an army general 
the new interior minister frantisek pinc is a civilian as the 
opposition had demanded but he is a member of the communist party 
civic forum had demanded a noncommunist 
asked why civic forums demands had not been fully met deputy 
premier bohumil urban told reporters this is what life is like 
you cant take into account everybodys demands immediately 
but in a move obviously calculated to appease demands for more 
religious freedom josef hromadka a highranking leader of 
czechoslovakias protestant church was named one of seven deputy 
premiers 
of the five noncommunists named to the government three had no 
official party affiliation the new cabinet appointees were for the 
most part political unknowns 
adamec agreed tuesday in talks with civic forum to appoint a new 
government that would include noncommunists he said last week 
that many of the old cabinet members had wanted to implement 
reforms but were unable to because of the hardline policies of 
the ruling politburo 
dienstbier told the associated press on saturday that the 
opposition did not propose specific candidates for the new cabinet 
but concentrated on outlining what characteristics office holders 
should have 
communists members of previously docile allied parties and 
nonparty people are acceptable to civic forum if they have no 
obvious blemish in their past and are willing to implement reforms 
now that will lead to free elections and genuine democracy 
dienstbier said 
civic forum established only two weeks ago is an umbrella 
movement of opposition groups its leaders say they are not putting 
themselves forward for cabinet posts but have left open the 
possibility of accepting nominations

american furriers are feeling the heat and its 
not from their mink coats 
increased pressure from animal rights advocates picketing fur 
stores holding annual furfree fridays and chanting slogans 
like buy a fur and slip into something dead have taken a toll 
now the fur industry is fighting back 
fur manufacturers some facing financial losses recently hired 
one of the worlds largest public relations agencies to represent 
them and have paid for dramatic newspaper ads claiming activists 
will soon tell people not to eat meat 
if those people really want to be socially conscious they 
shouldnt wear gold jewelry or diamonds from south africa or 
leather shoes said gary lennad owner of jay lennad furs one of 
the largest fur stores in the boston area 
last month the new york firm of bursonmarsteller sent out kits 
to fur retailers that included guidelines for handling the media 
and dealing with antifur demonstrations the kit also included a 
hotline number for furriers faced with questions about the fur 
trade and provided form letters for use in writing letters to the 
editor 
the fur industry also took out ads twice last month in the new 
york times sunday editions that read in part today fur 
tomorrow leather then wool then meat 
fur farmers have also joined the effort marsha kelly associate 
executive director of the fur farm animal welfare coalition in st 
paul minn said the coalition is redoubling efforts to 
reeducate the public about the industry 
fur farmers are being briefed on issues educational materials 
about the fur industry are being sent to schools and a 
communications network has been established linking fur farmers 
around the country kelly said 
the public relations effort faces an uphill battle magazine and 
billboard advertisements paid for by animal rights groups have 
become increasingly more common and graphic 
a fullpage ad in this months spy magazine contains photographs 
of a trapper approaching a fox whose leg is caught in a trap then 
standing on the animal and suffocating him 
ads at bus stops in new york city depict a leghold trap with a 
raccoons foot caught in it another print ad shows a simple 
leghold trap accompanied by the words get a feel for fur slam 
your fingers in a car door 
other antifur tactics are on the rise as well 
the fourth annual furfree friday last month drew 2500 
animal rights activists in a march in new york city protesters 
also targeted a dozen other cities 
more than 140 celebrities including paul and linda mccartney 
kim basinger carol burnett art linkletter and christie brinkley 
have signed antifur statements circulated by the animal rights 
group beauty without cruelty 
animal rights activists claim fur farming is inhumane and caters 
to vanity the furriers maintain that the protesters are infringing 
on freedom of choice they also claim that the fur industry is 
strictly regulated and that animals receive excellent care 
a rat is a pig is a dog is a boy said robert meltzer 
president of evans inc of chicago the nations largest retailer 
of fur repeating a phrase used often by furriers and their 
representatives this is just the beginning for them this is all 
about freedom of choice theyre trying to take away first 
amendment rights 
despite the hiring of bursonmarsteller last summer and the 
newspaper ads last month the fur industry denies animal rights 
protesters have had an impact on business most say the public 
relations effort is an attempt to forestall any future harm 
though the fur industry tripled sales from 1979 to 1986 jumping 
from 850 million yearly to 18 billion the boom has since 
leveled out the fur vault the countrys secondlargest american 
fur chain reported losses of over 7 million in the last two 
years its retail operation is for sale the two other publicly 
held fur companies in the united states also reported recent 
considerable quarterly earnings losses 
but industry spokesmen insist business is basically good and 
blame any losses on recent warm winters and a soft economy not 
protesters 
theres been no impact on business said richard parsons 
executive director of the fur information council of america the 
impetus for the newspaper ads was a feeling among the furriers 
that the public was ready to hear from the fur industry our 
customers were asking whats the story

a powerful state senator goes on trial 
monday amid strong indications that the federal corruption 
investigation that led to his indictment could result in charges 
against two other lawmakers 
state sen joe montoya who chairs the senate business and 
professions committee has pleaded innocent to 12 felony counts 
that accuse him of racketeering extortion bribery and money 
laundering among the alleged victims of his shakedown efforts 
actor ed asner 
if convicted montoya faces a maximum of 220 years in prison and 
more than 3 million in fines 
the democrat from the los angeles suburb of el monte whos been 
in the legislature for 17 years is the first person to be tried as 
a result of an investigation that began in 1985 
the investigation included agents who posed as alabama 
businessmen seeking a bill to aid a shrimpimporting company they 
hoped to establish and a senate aide who cooperated with the 
agents by wearing a hidden recording device the bill was 
eventually passed but gov george deukmejian who had been tipped 
off by the fbi vetoed it 
the probe became public in dramatic fashion in august 1988 when 
30 federal agents raided the capitol offices of montoya three 
other lawmakers and their aides there were reports that during the 
raid aides in some offices shredded documents and erased sensitive 
computer information 
besides montoya one of his former aides an assembly aide a 
former yolo county sheriff and a former undersheriff have also been 
charged and while prosecutors are saying little about the 
investigation a plea bargain reached last week could mean at least 
two other lawmakers will face charges 
karin watson a key aide to assembly republicans pleaded guilty 
tuesday to one extortion count and agreed to help prosecutors that 
development could spell trouble for the two republican assembly 
members whose offices were searched 15 months ago pat nolan of 
glendale and frank hill of whittier 
according to papers filed in the case watson played a key role 
in setting up two meetings in june 1988 at which 12500 was paid 
to an undercover agent news articles have linked nolan and hill to 
those meetings both have denied wrongdoing 
montoyas attorney michael sands refused to discuss the case 
last week but sands said in an earlier interview that he was 
convinced that montoyas position can be sustained 
according to senate aides defense attorneys have subpoenaed 
about half the 40 members of the senate to testify at the trial 
apparently in an attempt to show that montoyas actions were not 
out of the ordinary 
among other things montoya is accused of accepting a 3000 
honorarium from an undercover agent in exchange for help in 
getting the bill to help the fictional shrimp business through the 
senate 
the charge alleging an extortion attempt against asner stems 
from a 1985 meeting at the time the popular actor known for his 
roles in the mary tyler moore show lou grant and 
roots was president of the screen actors guild 
according to a memorandum filed by prosecutors last month asner 
and a lobbyist for the guild went to see montoya in may 1985 to 
seek his vote against a bill their union opposed 
montoya took the two into his office and closed the door 
the memorandum said he then stated in no uncertain terms that he 
did not see why he should support the guild since the guild had not 
made financial contributions to him 
the memo said asner and the lobbyist were infuriated and 
disgusted and the meeting ended abruptly montoya voted against 
the guilds side that afternoon the memo added 
in another incident prosecutors alleged montoya wrote letters 
to all california high school principals urging them not to insure 
their athletes with a particular insurance company the letters 
were written after the companys owner refused to pay montoya 
10000 for support of legislation backed by the company the 
memorandum said 
a key figure in the investigation the memorandum said was john 
shahabian a senate staffer who tried to extort an undercover agent 
and then agreed to cooperate with the fbi in exchange for lenient 
treatment 
in june 1988 shahabian asked an unidentified legislator what it 
would take to get the shrimp legislation out of the senate banking 
and commerce committee the memorandum said 
well you need to make some arrangements with joe the 
lawmaker reportedly told shahabian what itll take with joe is a 
little envelope 
later that month shahabian wearing a hidden recording device 
went to see montoya montoya asked if the organizers of shrimp deal 
were doing well and learning that they were replied ok so 
they can be helpful 
later in the conversation after montoya was assured that the 
bill would attract little attention shahabian asked how can we 
be helpful to you 
either way campaign contributions andor honorariums 
montoya reportedly said a luncheon meeting was set up with the 
undercover agent at which time the 3000 check was passed to 
montoya the memo said

a rare algae toxin in a suburban lake 
killed two cats said health officials who want people to stay away 
from the deadly water the soupy bluegreen masses of algae in 
american lake are so toxic that a few glassfuls of contaminated 
water could kill a human being said tacomapierce county health 
department officials 
so far officials have found the toxin only in a northern cove 
of the lake its presence was confirmed friday 
signs and leaflets were being distributed and further tests in 
the lake and others were planned monday said kim coble head of 
the agencys water resource section 
the toxic algae normally live two weeks to a month but health 
officials plan to kill it with copper sulphate monday the chemical 
itself is toxic but it must be used in this case because of the 
danger of the algae coble said 
its pretty rough environmentally but were worried that the 
wind might shift and it the algae could spread she said 
the toxin affects the nervous system and most mammals killed by 
it die of respiratory failure there have been no recorded 
toxinrelated human deaths in the state 
health officials confirmed the toxin was in the lake after 
testing at pacific lutheran university showed that mice injected 
with it died within minutes emergency rooms and veterinarians were 
alerted to watch for signs of the algae toxin in patients 
it suddenly turned into an emergency coble said 
the tests followed an autopsy on two cats taken to the health 
department a week ago green matter was found in their stomachs and 
on their fur indicating they probably ingested the toxin by 
cleaning their coats 
wt edmondson a retired university of washington professor who 
specializes in lake ecology said no one knows exactly what 
triggers the usually harmless algae to produce the toxin but 
sewage appears to play a key role 
the toxin is common in the midwest and has killed cattle and 
other large mammals he said

hundreds of small businesses across the 
country are ditching their employee pension plans saying federal 
rules make the benefit programs too costly and complex to maintain 
employers claim congressional tinkering with a 1974 pension law 
has dramatically increased the paperwork accountants and 
administrative personnel needed to comply with the law 
its impossible said ronald turner a third generation 
lumber company owner in clarksburg wva were going to drop the 
plan 
alvin d lurie a former assistant commissioner for the internal 
revenue service says turner is typical of small business owners 
who tried but failed to keep current with the everchanging 
provisions of the 1974 employee retirement income security act 
it has become much much too complicated said lurie now 
chairman of the new york bar associations special committee on 
pension simplification its frightful people cant afford it 
dont understand it 
a san antonio texas attorney who handles the pension plans for 
several hundred small businesses said he is advising his clients to 
drop them a santa ana calif plan administrator said about 30 
percent of the small businesses she works with are terminating 
their programs 
but some say the business owners are simply using regulations as 
an excuse 
i dont think its that clear cut that the congressional 
revisions have led small businesses to drop their plans a senate 
labor committee aide said asking that she not be further 
identified im skeptical because they can go into simplified 
plans 
many of the employers bailing out of the federally insured 
pension plans are setting up profitsharing or other programs seen 
as less beneficial to employees because they usually require the 
workers to put up some of the money 
the pension law known as erisa was enacted by congress to 
protect the 76 million american workers with pension plans and 
their 2 trillion in pension assets always complex the law saw a 
series of amendments over the years that proved in some cases 
expensive or frustrating for employers 
the labor departments inspector generals office cautioning 
that the pension system is open to fraud and embezzlement wants 
congress to enact additional laws to prevent possible abuses 
i think the people writing the laws are trying to be fair and 
equitable but they dont understand what the costs mean said 
paula calamafde a tax lawyer and head of the small business 
council of america 
turner who plans to give his employees the cash due to them 
from the pension fund said he always tried to keep up with the 
laws the required paperwork grew from 35 pages to 77 pages this 
year he said 
then the irs came in to check out his plan and disqualified it 
on a technicality his report lacked this phrase these are the 
rules we will follow if the plan becomes top heavy a measure 
designed to prevent employers from favoring top management 
we felt like the gestapo had been turned loose on us he 
said its not fair i have always told the internal revenue ill 
do what ever i have to do to stay qualified 
the social security administration says the number of fulltime 
workers with employerfinanced pension plans fell to 46 percent 
last year down from 50 percent in 1979 only 29 percent of the 
workers in companies employing between 25 and 49 workers have such 
plans while 67 percent of those in companies of 250 workers or 
more are covered 
the federal insurer of private pension plans the pension 
benefit guarantee corporation received 10790 notices of planned 
termination in fiscal 1988 but the organization already 15 
billion in the red does not separate large from small businesses 
business owners are required to notify the irs the pbgc and all 
plan participants before they end pension plans 
chet salkind executive director of the new yorkbased american 
society of pension actuaries said there has been a constant 
decline in employerfinanced plans and an increase in programs in 
which employees contribute such as the 401 k savings plans 
from the employee angle theres a tremendous difference 
salkind explained usually its employee money and not a 
guaranteed amount 
donna hopson a plan administrator and president of the santa 
ana califbased national institute of pension administrators 
said her office used to see about four plan terminations a year but 
that this year there have been about 60 terminations among her 250 
clients 
employers who end the plans pay their workers the amount 
accrued but ms hopson said bailing out undermines the nations 
retirement program 
the feedback i get is they take the money and spend it she 
said 
ms hopson puts the blame on laws that add to the cost of 
compliance requiring detailed reports accountants actuaries and 
plan administrators 
we cant spend the amount of time necessary to keep the plan 
updated and comply with the provisions said a maryland employer 
who spoke on condition of anonymity because she is still in the 
process of terminating her plan it took two months of my time 
a virginia restaurant owner who asked not to be further 
identified because i dont trust the irs said he dropped his 
employerpaid plan and set up a profitsharing program 
with a profitsharing plan i can put into it whatever i 
want he said adding that the government required him to put 
113000 into his employerpaid pension plan last year

q did you assure president bush that the changes in eastern 
europe are irreversible that the soviet union has foresaken the 
right to intervene there militarily and president bush similarly 
as a result of this meeting are you now more trusting that the 
soviets have indeed renounced the brezhnev doctrine 
q a most important question from czechoslovakia for mr 
gorbachev will soviets renounce the brezhnev doctrine which 
enabled the soviets to invade czechoslovakia in 1968 
gorbachev i dont want to be understood as being authorized to 
speak on behalf of all eastern european countries this would not 
be in keeping with the facts we are part of eastern europe 
certainly we are part of europe as a whole too and we work 
together with our allies in all areas we have profound ties but 
each country is an independent power an independent factor in 
world politics and each people has the right to decide and does 
decide the fate of its own state 
all i can say is my view and i think that these changes in the 
soviet union and the eastern european countries as an objective 
fact have been caused by the actual historic process itself and 
no one can avoid that its a problem whose time has come we have 
to solve it by new means using our experience and the potential 
which these states have accumulated and also opening up 
opportunities for the use of everything thats been a positive 
accumulated in human experience and i think the orientation of 
these processes is something that we should welcome because its 
connected with the desire of these peoples to ennoble their 
societies to make them more democratic humanitarian to open up 
to the rest of the world so im encouraged and inspired by all 
these processes and im sure this is the way they are understood 
and appreciated by other peoples 
of course i also see that there are processes going on 
profound processes of change in western countries too including 
western european countries and this is very important too 
theres a kind of a movement bringing states countries and 
continents together but nevertheless there are processes where 
each individual country prefers its commitments its choices and 
its individualities thats very important and its important for 
all of us to understand that 
q im speaking on behalf of a group of czechoslovak 
bush and as president gorbachev talks about democratic change 
and peaceful that certainly lays to rest previous doctrines that 
may have had a different approach and so we are he knows and 
not just the president but all the people in the united states 
would like to see this peaceful democratic evolution continue and 
so i think thats the best way to answer the question because the 
change is so dramatic and so obvious to people but i will say we 
had a very good chance to discuss it in considerably more detail 
than i think would be appropriate to discuss it here 
q president bush you have accused the soviet union for sending 
arms to el salvador to central america and president gorbachev 
you have denied those charges now both of you are sitting here 
together who is right 
bush maybe i ought to take the first shot at that one i dont 
think we accused the soviet union of that what we did say is arms 
were going in there in an unsatisfactory way my view is that not 
only did the nicaraguans acquiesce in it but they encouraged in it 
encouraged that to happen and the evidence is demonstrable 
but im not challenging whether the word of the foreign 
minister he and jim baker talked about that and president 
gorbachev and i talked about it all i know is that and he said 
it earlier elections free elections is should be the mode and 
i also reported to him what mr oscar arias called me about 
blaming castro and the sandinistas for exporting revolution and for 
just tearing things up there in central america so we may have a 
difference on that one but i want to be careful when you say i 
accused them of sending these weapons i did not because mr 
shevardnadze made a direct representation to mr baker and 
everyone knows that theres a wide international arms flow out 
there but whatever it is however it comes it is unsatisfactory 
for countries in the region that want to see the evolution toward 
democracy continue 
gorbachev the president has quite rightly reported our 
discussion on this there was no accusation made against us and we 
didnt have to accept or reject such an accusation therefore we 
told the president that we have assurances firm assurances from 
nicaragua that no deliveries using certain aircraft actually were 
carried out president bush didnt agree with that and we heard 
that also nevertheless from the point of view of the principle i 
said and president bush confirmed this that were in favor of 
free elections we want to see this conflict ended by political 
means and we want to see a normalization of the situation there 
president bush thats what we agreed on i agreed i agree 
that thats where the 
q what about the accusations of oscar arias on cuba 
bush that thats the assessment i still feel that arms are 
going into el salvador weve seen clear evidence of it and but 
i cant argue with the factual presentation made here but we have 
a difference i dont believe that the sandinistas have told the 
truth to our soviet friends and why because we know for a fact 
certain that arms have gone in there im not saying theyre soviet 
arms theyve said they arent shipping arms and im accepting 
that but theyre going in there and i am saying that they have 
misled mr shevardnadze when they gave a specific representation 
that no arms were going from nicaragua into el salvador and thats 
so we have some differences in how we look at this key question 
and the best way to have those differences ameliorated is to have 
these certifiably free elections in nicaragua 
and castro i have no influence with him whatsoever and maybe 
somebody is yelling that question at president gorbachev but look 
weve got some differences in different places around the world 
q president gorbachev what about the accusations of president 
arias on about cuba oscar arias apparently called president bush 
and told him that cuba really created the situation in the region 
it was fomenting revolution in

gorbachev we discussed the situation in latin america 
expressed our views on the basis of our own analysis and our own 
assessment said to the president that the conditions are ripe for 
changing the situation for the better the different sides do have 
a wish to do this to normalize the situation not only in the 
region but also in the united states 
q how do you assess the german situation 
gorbachev do you want to begin on the german question 
bush id be glad somebody better tell me what the question 
was then if im going to answer was it the question of germany 
the united states part of nato has had a longstanding position 
helsinki spells out permanent borders we i made clear to 
president gorbachev that we for our part do not want to do 
anything that is unrealistic and causes any country to end up 
going backwards or end up having its own people in military 
conflict one with the other 
and so i think we have tried to act with the word that 
president gorbachev has used to and that is with caution 
not to go demonstrating on top of the berlin wall to show how happy 
we are about the change we are happy about the change and the 
german question is ive heard many leaders speak about the german 
question and i dont think it is the role of the united states to 
to dictate the rapidity of change in any country its a matter 
for the people to determine themselves so thats our position and 
the last word goes to the chairman on this one 
gorbachev yes on that as he ended the president wrote in 
english and i dont read english i answered him in russian and he 
doesnt read russian but we agreed laughter 
bush no matter what it said 
gorbachev i have several times expressed my views on this 
point and because we discussed it with the president we 
considered all these questions on the condition of the helsinki 
process we realize that the real situation in europe the current 
situation in europe is that in modern europe there are two german 
states federal republic of germany and german democratic republic 
well there are two german states in europe today the federal 
republic and the german democratic republic they are members of 
the united nations sovereign states this is the bidding of 
history this is what history has willed i always have recourse to 
this argument so as to remain realistic we must understand that 
history does dictate the fate and the processes on the continent 
and also determines the role and place of these two states 
and we think that there is an understanding today in the minds 
of all and any artificial attempt to do anything to that process 
well we mustnt do anything to belittle the great significance of 
the great changes which are happening in this continent its a 
central part of contemporary history it would not be we dont 
want to do anything to accelerate these changes artificially for 
the peoples of these two great german states 
can we thank the press for its cooperation of course we dont 
know what theyve written yet and what they will be writing 
laughter 
bush reserve the right to thank them afterward you mean after 
theyve written 
gorbachev no i think right now and they will write better 
id like to thank you for your cooperation 
bush we do have to leave at 120 should we each take one more 
question or not agreeable all right last one last one for me 
right here no rebuttal no back up question the last one 
q whats your personal relationship now between the two 
inaudible and would regular contacts that would perhaps no 
longer be called summits be helpful 
bush i had known president gorbachev before and ill let him 
speak for himself but i think we have a good personal relationship 
and i believe that helps each side be frank point out the 
differences as well as the areas we agree on and that is a very 
very important ingredient i think because of the standing of the 
two powers and because of the dramatic change that is taking place 
and i am not saying that if he likes me he is going to change 
longheld policies and im going to say if i like him were not 
going to change longheld policies 
but what weve been able to do here is to get together and talk 
about the differences without rancor and as frankly as possible 
and i think its been very constructive so i couldnt have asked 
for a better result out of this nonsummit summit laughter and 
the question is regular meetings im open for to see him as much 
as it requires to keep things moving forward weve already set a 
summit meeting that summit meeting will drive the arms control 
agenda and thats a good thing because i represented to him that 
we wanted to see a start agreement a cfe agreement and hopefully 
a chemical agreement thats a very ambitious agenda but i think 
if we hadnt sat here and talked we might not have understood how 
each other feels on these important questions 
gorbachev id like to confirm whats just been said by 
president bush that weve known each other for quite a long time 
now id just like to add that perhaps of course we didnt agree 
on this with the president and i dont think im disclosing a 
great secret that weve already had detailed discussions when we 
had our previous contacts and we informed each other of each 
others positions basically 
at governors island or in the automobiles weve had 
discussions and weve had correspondence subsequently and this 
meeting weve had here has made our personal contacts placed them 
on a different level and im very happy with the meeting weve 
had the talks weve had two talks oneonone 
like the president i do feel that personal contact is a very 
important factor in relations between political leaders 
particularly of such states as the soviet union and the united 
states and i am committed to the idea of personal contacts 
although as i said to the as the president said correctly this 
doesnt mean that for the sake of personal contacts we can back 
away from our positions or can forget our responsibilities no 
itss just that personal contacts makes it possible for us the 
better to carry out our responsibilities and work together more 
effectively and more effective cooperation in the interest of our 
two peoples and in interests of the whole world community 
on my own behalf id like to thank you for this meeting thank 
you mr president for your cooperation for sovietamerican 
endeavors 
bush thank you sir well i guess were going to fly away to 
brussels

its got the usual fastfood 
restaurants videorental stores three banks and a department 
store but theres something else that makes this town of 5000 
more than just a spot on the map 
its the home of aunt bee the devoted loveable matron who 
looked after sheriff andy taylor and his son opie on the andy 
griffith show 
born 86 years ago in new york actress frances bavier chose to 
retire to this town after a career that included broadway as well 
as television the town is in the same region as the fictional 
mayberry nc 
though shes avoided interviews and contacts with visiting fans 
over the years and has been ailing lately shes made friends 
among the folks here and everyone calls her aunt bee 
every year at some time or another people get it in their 
head to check up on aunt bee says velma sadler the police 
department records clerk and a 12year friend of ms bavier its 
just a shame this years influx coincides with aunt bee being in 
the hospital 
ms bavier was admitted to the coronary care unit of chatham 
hospital here the day before thanksgiving hospital officials say 
theyre not releasing any details at her request and that doesnt 
surprise most residents 
shes an extremely private individual and shes let that be 
known said wanda ingold town clerk 
sometimes admiring or curious outsiders have made life 
difficult 
well get people in here all the time asking what her address 
is or for directions to her house said police detective sgt 
alphonzo craven 
we get television crews and reporters down here all the time 
trying to get some information craven said they ask questions 
like is there an andy taylor sheriff here is there a deputy like 
barney fife its ridiculous all aunt bee wants is to be left 
alone thats why she came here to retire in peace 
before her role as beatrice taylor in the longrunning 1960s 
series starring griffith as a southern sheriff ms bavier appeared 
in such broadway productions as kiss and tell point of no 
return and the lady says no 
when she retired in the early 1970s she moved from los angeles 
to siler city one of a number of towns that had invited her to 
appear at celebrations over the years like mount airy the town on 
which griffith loosely based mayberry it is in the hilly piedmont 
region between the coast and the appalachians 
i guess when she came down here to do parades and other 
events she just liked the people ms sadler said it really 
is a nice area and the people are extremely nice 
sure there might have been a fuss when she first moved 
here said town tax collector dottie mendenhall now shes just 
another resident to the people who live here 
ms sadler describes ms bavier as extremely nice to me 
nothing but a good friend we talk about museums operas plays 
weve both seen why she moved here or her days on the show really 
never came up 
shes an elderly ailing sick woman 
siler city has a different aura from the fictional mayberry but 
its still a familyoriented community women walking into the 
glendale hosiery mills outlet store are greeted by name 
thats just the way things are around here ms sadler said 
i think thats why aunt bee probably moved here we have our 
problems like anyplace but it really is a nice place to live

<TEXT>
bush its hard for me to describe im not an articulate 
emotionalist but i just cant have asked for a better ambiance 
a better feel from the meetings even though the differences are 
acute in some areas 
gorbachev the atmosphere was friendly straightforward open

bush it was a no agenda meeting it accomplished everything i 
hoped it would we have not solved all of the problems that 
exist between the united states and the soviet union but we 
understand better where hes coming from and i think thats very 
very important and he understands our position better 
gorbachev i would say that in all directions of the political 
dialogue of our discussion including bilateral relations we not 
only confirmed the consistency of our political course the 
continuity of our political course 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bush it is not for the united states and the soviet union to 
design the future for europeans or for any other people i am 
convinced that a cooperative ussoviet relationship can indeed 
make the future safer and brighter 
gorbachev each country is an independent factor in world 
politics and each people has the right to decide and does decide 
the fate of its own state i think the orientation of these 
processes is something that we should welcome because its 
connected with the desire of these peoples to ennoble their 
societies to make them more democratic humanitarian to open up 
the rest of the world so im encouraged and inspired by all these 
processes

gorbachev we have reaffirmed once again to the president that 
we have ceased arms shipment to central america we also reaffirmed 
our position that we are sympathetic with the political process 
that is going on there we are in favor of free elections with 
the representatives of the united nations and other latin american 
countries to determine the fate of nicaragua 
bush we had an indepth discussion on these questions as 
president gorbachev has said i cant say there are no 
differences between us but we had a chance to talk about them

bush the summit meeting will drive the arms control process 
i told him that we wanted to see a strategic nuclear agreement 
a cfe conventional force in europe agreement and maybe a 
chemical agreement 
gorbachev as to strategic offensive arms the analysis of the 
situation and the instructions that have been given regarding the 
preparation of that treaty demonstrate that we may be able by the 
second half of june to agree on the basic provisions of this 
treaty which then later in the coming months would be ready for a 
signature in connection with the new interesting proposals by 
president bush regarding chemical weapons which have the goal of a 
global ban and provides for certain phases and movement towards 
this global ban then we have the possibility of a rapid movement 
towards it

president bush and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev moved closer together at their mediterranean 
summit to curb the nuclear and conventional arms races and drop the 
curtain on the cold war 
but they also discovered that the pace of events especially in 
eastern europe is rapidly outstripping the capacity of the two 
most powerful leaders in the world to shape the future 
even as bush and gorbachev were winding up their twoday 
nearsummit on sunday the entire politburo and communist party 
central committee resigned in east germany orthodox communism is 
on the run crumbling faster than anyone had predicted 
and while bush was jetting here thursday night from washington a 
friendly but troubled government in the philippines teetered on the 
edge of a military coup bushs preparations for the summit had to 
compete with evaluating the threat to president corazon aquino and 
the extent of us military intervention deemed necessary to 
protect her 
even mother nature gave the two superpower leaders a 
stomachtossing display of how unpredictable the universe can be 
stormy seas forced them to rearrange their schedule and cancel both 
a saturday afternoon meeting and a dinner that night 
despite it all bush and gorbachev found common ground on the 
direction they would like the world to take and that the road 
ahead is a long one and while there were no armscontrol 
breakthroughs or specific timetables set for treatysignings the 
two mutually pledged to work to that end 
we stated both of us that the world leaves the one epoch of 
cold war and enters another epoch gorbachev said this is just 
the beginning we are just at the very beginning of our long road 
to a longlasting peaceful period 
the tentative nature of their joint venture is reflected in the 
absence of any concrete agreements and the evident failure of bush 
to halt the delivery of soviet arms to rebels in el salvador 
the pipeline which the administration claims runs through cuba 
and nicaragua was denounced by secretary of state james a baker 
ii on the eve of the summit as a relic of the cold war 
us officials said gorbachev in discussing the explosive issue 
with bush professed not to know how the antiaircraft launchers 
and other arms got to the leftist fmln forces 
perhaps mindful of fastpaced events in east germany and in all 
other warsaw pact countries except romania the soviet leader also 
spoke modestly of us and soviet powers to manage history 
in our position gorbachev said the most dangerous thing 
is to exaggerate we always should preserve elements of 
cautiousness i have used the favorite word of president bush 
the reference to bushs political style draw laughter from 
reporters assembled aboard the soviet cruise ship maxim gorky 
but bush was serious about the leaders limitations as well as 
the expectations for a meeting he refused to call a summit 
it is not for the united states and the soviet union to design 
the future for europeans he said or for any other people i 
am convinced that a cooperative ussoviet relationship can indeed 
make the future safer and brighter 
in that vein bush and gorbachev determined to speed the 
completion of three arms control accords to banish chemical 
weapons reduce longrange nuclear missiles by 30 to 50 percent 
and to reduce troops tanks artillery and other conventional 
forces in europe 
on the other hand the summit produced no specific accords to 
attain those goals nor did the leaders establish a schedule for 
completing the three treaties although they both said they hoped 
to place their signatures on a nuclear arms cut when they meet next 
summer in the united states 
it is one thing to urge negotiators on and another to make the 
sort of command decisions that breaks deadlocks 
gorbachev underscored how much remains to be done for instance 
he would like a ceiling placed on warships as part of the 
disarmament process bush disagrees the us navy will be reduced 
but only by domestic budget constraints and not at the negotiating 
table 
and no deal was struck to limit nucleartipped cruise missiles 
carried aboard submarines and surface ships that is the touchiest 
issue in the strategic weapons field 
on the conventional arms front meanwhile gorbachev registered 
the kremlins complaint with nato attempts to trim thousands of 
soviet airplanes that the kremlin claims have a defense mission 
repeatedly however bush stressed the common ground he found 
with gorbachev he also made us support for perestroika the 
restructuring of the soviet economy concrete with an offer of 
trading privileges 
it was a no agenda meeting it accomplished everything i hoped 
it would bush said

the defense ministry newspaper said sunday that 
the western arms policy including us refusal to reduce its naval 
forces still is based on confrontation and threatens efforts to 
ease tensions with eastern europe 
there is little optimism in the fact that military budgets and 
programs in the united states and other nato countries still regard 
military force as the major means of achieving designated foreign 
policy goals red star said in a commentary written by vasily 
pustov 
the newspaper printed the commentary as soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev and president bush completed talks in malta and 
expressed optimism at plans for arms reductions 
however the leaders also cited their disagreement over proposed 
naval arms reductions 
red star said both east and west must change their outlook to 
improve international relations 
in the current stage of transition in international 
development it is all the more obvious that the path to a stable 
world and mutual security lies through serious changes not only in 
the east but in the west the newspaper said in a commentary 
it praised signs of change in some north atlantic treat 
organization countries specifically consideration of military cuts 
in west germany and the united states 
but it added some actions by nato and its leading members 
appear to be a glaring anachronism against the background of 
improving international climate 
pustov said the unwillingness of nato and the united states to 
include its superior naval forces in negotiations with the soviet 
union were alarming this puts in doubt and even threatens much 
of what has been achieved in the area of limiting weapons as a 
result of long and difficult negotiations 
top soviet military officials previously have expressed concern 
about us naval superiority even as the two sides try to work out 
an agreement to reduce their coventional forces in europe 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev the former military chief of staff 
and a gorbachev adviser said in the communist party daily pravda 
in october that the united states has 2 times more largesurface 
ships 15 attack aircraft carriers to none for the soviets 2 
times more maritime aircraft and 19 times more marines 
the usa most likely intends to continue using these 
forces to put pressure on us and threaten the soviet union he 
said 
red star cited nato doctrine that regards nuclear deterrence as 
a condition for constructive talks with the warsaw pact and the 
western view that the presence of us conventional and nuclear 
forces is vitally important for european security 
bush flew to brussels belgium after the summit sunday to 
discuss the talks with nato allies gorbachev flew to moscow where 
he will meet with the soviet unions warsaw pact allies this week

a secret inspection of a federal nuclear 
weapons laboratory in california found serious security lapses last 
spring including poor protection of large amounts of plutonium 
according to a congressional report released sunday 
the report also said the energy department from 1982 through 
1988 misled the president in its annual reports to the white 
house about the adequacy of measures to protect weaponsgrade 
nuclear materials from potential theft or sabotage 
the report included a declassified transcript of a closed 
hearing last july in which several senior energy department 
officials testified on security and safeguards weaknesses in the 
nuclear weapons production and design complex 
the hearing was held by the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations portions of the 
hearing transcript and department documents were deleted by the 
department 
the subcommittee is continuing to investigate the departments 
nuclear weapons facilities which in recent months have been 
wracked by allegations of health safety and environmental 
violations some key plants have been closed temporarily 
in the hearing transcript portions of a previously secret 
report by edward j mccallum director of the departments weapons 
security evaluations office were published these included a 
passage highly critical of nuclear materials protection at lawrence 
livermore national laboratory near livermore calif 
the livermore lab has come under fire in recent years for 
illegal drug use by some employees alleged ethics and 
conflictofinterest violations by senior lab officials and charges 
of theft of government property from the facility 
the lab is run for the government by the university of 
california 
one passage from the mccallum report said security systems at a 
livermore building in which weaponsgrade plutonium is handled do 
not provide assurance that the highly radioactive material is 
adequately protected from theft or sabotage 
also it said the security system was unreliable in detecting 
contraband at entry gates and intruders at specially protected 
areas with access to nuclear materials 
under questioning from rep gerry sikorski dminn mccallum 
said these security lapses involved category one quantities of 
plutonium or amounts greater than 4 pounds which is enough to 
build a nuclear bomb 
mccallums report was based on an inspection last april and may 
of livermore and the departments regional office in san francisco 
which oversees the labs operations 
another published portion of mccallums report said the lab 
sometimes allowed category one quantities of plutonium to be 
left unattended in rooms without security alarms mccallum told 
sikorski this was a serious breach of security 
among other disclosures in the subcommittee report 
among all the 26 weapons facilities and regional offices 
inspected for security and weapons materials protection safeguards 
by mccallums office over the past year livermore ranked the 
lowest 
the oak ridge tenn and las vegas nev regional offices 
used private contractors in some cases to screen and interview 
weapons plant employees seeking security clearances these 
contractors did not actually grant any clearances but their role 
nonetheless was contrary to department policy officials said 
the department acknowledged that it lacks the resources to 
complete investigations of suspected security violations by some 
weapons employees who currently have access to classified material 
this violates the departments own policy mccallum wrote in his 
report and does not provide assurance that only eligible 
individuals are granted continued access to security interests 
the hearing also disclosed that the san francisco regional 
office had chosen not to include the plutoniumhandling building in 
its own most recent inspections of livermore donald w pearman 
jr acting manager of the san francisco office told the panel 
that because of this omission he was not aware of the plutonium 
safeguards problems at the time of the mccallum inspection 
in a later written response to energy and commerce committee 
chairman john dingell dmich energy secretary james d watkins 
called the omission a serious oversight watkins also said the 
san francisco office had changed its inspection methods to include 
an intensive annual survey of all lab facilities 
in the subcommittee report released sunday dingell said annual 
reports to the president from the energy secretary had offered a 
misleading account of the level of protection being afforded 
special nuclear materials and nuclear facilities 
the most recent reports to the president are more on the order 
of what one would expect from your local chamber of commerce 
dingell said he added later the subcommittee was told that a 
senior weapons security official at washington headquarters edward 
v badolato told those preparing an annual report to the president 
that it should be general in nature and contain pictures

president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev remained at odds sunday over the issue of arms 
shipments to marxist rebels in el salvador 
but they agreed democratic elections are the best hope for 
longterm stability in central america and bush said the weekend 
summit helped narrow ussoviet differences over conflicts in the 
region 
bush at a joint news conference with gorbachev after their 
twoday shipboard summit said he restated us concerns that 
nicaragua and cuba are shipping sovietmade arms to leftist 
guerrillas in el salvador 
gorbachev reiterated that the soviets are not involved and he 
said he had been assured by the sandinista government in nicaragua 
that it was not shipping arms to the salvadoran rebels 
we have a difference bush said i dont believe that the 
sandinistas have told the truth to our soviet friends and why 
because we know for a fact certain that arms have gone in there 
as evidence of a continuation of such shipments the united 
states has cited surfacetoair weapons and other arms recently 
found in the wreckage of a plane that crashed in el salvador 
the bush administration says the weapons were destined for 
salvadoran guerrillas fighting the usbacked government 
secretary of state james a baker iii appearing on cbstvs 
face the nation said its not a case of our thinking that 
the soviet union is sending weapons to nicaragua because theyve 
told us theyre not and we believe them 
but he added we do believe the soviets when they say theyre 
trying to convince their clients cuba and nicaragua not to do 
this to go for a political solution in el salvador we think 
theyre trying we would like to encourage them to try a little 
harder 
in their joint appearance bush and gorbachev agreed that a free 
and fair election in nicaragua is the key to resolving tensions in 
the region 
were in favor of free elections gorbachev said we want 
to see this conflict ended by political means and we want to see a 
normalization of the situation there 
thats what we agreed on bush interjected 
the nicaraguan government has pledged free elections next year 
but the bush administration is skeptical about whether the 
sandinista government led by president daniel ortego will really 
allow a free and fair vote that could knock it out of power 
later speaking to a small group of us reporters bush said 
that soviet assistance to cuba and their lip service for the 
sandinistas give us a considerable amount of difference with them 
he added that until we see a free cuba selfdetermination and 
the people deciding what they want cuba will stick out as a 
small country swimming against gorbachevs own tide

riot police stood behind steel barricades erected in front of the 
main gate of the pesticide plant which was closed after the gas 
leak on dec 3 1984 
vc david a senior police officer said about 600 men and 200 
women were arrested and taken in buses to a city sports stadium 
that was turned into a temporary jail david said the people would 
not be held long 
such detentions are legal under indian law and are commonly used 
to break up protests

they got in 
we just wanted to show our protest and anger against the 
government and the company said balkrishna gupta the city 
secretary of the communist party of india which organized the

the murder of a powerful banker killed 
by a bomb on his way to work has unleashed accusations that police 
overlooked clear signs terrorists were about to strike 
police have identified one of the probable suspects a fugitive 
member of the notorious red army faction leftist terrorist gang 
but have made no arrests 
thursdays killing of alfred herrhausen head of the deutsche 
bank stunned west germany which for weeks has been preoccupied 
with events in neighboring east germany 
authorities say herrhausens murder resembles at least four 
previous red army faction attacks but there are increasing 
allegations that security officials failed to notice indications 
that herrhausen was targeted 
one newspaper on saturday asked how terrorists could set up a 
sophisticated bombtrigger mechanism on herrhausens route without 
being noticed by a special unit assigned to watch out for 
suspicious activities 
discovery more than a month ago of a wire that apparently was 
intended for use with the bomb also posed some uncomfortable 
questions about security precautions 
besides the two security cars that normally escorted 
herrhausens mercedes a special hesse state police unit had been 
recently assigned daily to observe his route to work in frankfurt 
the cologne rundschau newspaper said 
police officials overlooked clear signs of the attack the 
newspaper charged 
willi fundermann spokesman for the federal police told the 
newspaper that officials were examining whether there were lapses 
in the observation deployment 
herrhausen 59 was killed near his home in bad homburg as his 
car passed by a lightbeam device triggering the powerful bomb 
that destroyed his mercedes the bomb was strapped to a bicycle on 
the side of the road 
authorities say they believe preparations for the attack began 
at least four weeks earlier 
these preparations included included chiseling out a long gap in 
a sidewalk laying wires in the crack covering them up with 
asphalt and recoloring the spot to make it appear it had not been 
touched they said 
federal officials said that late last month a person noticed a 
wire had been placed across the sidewalk without knowing its 
significance the wire was removed by the person chief federal 
prosecutor kurt rebmann said on friday 
police have found the bombers getaway car they also discovered 
that the cars forged license plates bear identical characteristics 
to plates recovered from cars used by leftist terrorists in at 
least four previous attacks 
erwin huber of the archconservative christian social union 
sister party of chancellor helmut kohls christian democrats 
charged there has been neglect in the search for terrorists 
the bonnbased newspaper die welt reported that police in other 
states were not immediately made aware of essentials of the attack 
speculating that could have hindered any attempts to catch the 
bombers 
authorities have tentatively identified one of the two suspected 
bombers as christoph seidler 31 one of the countrys mostwanted 
leftist terrorists he has been involved with the red army faction 
for at least a decade they said 
the red army faction has a long history of attacks on west 
german business and political figures as well as us military 
targets the group had been relatively inactive in the past three 
years

soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev said sunday he agreed with president bush that the 
superpowers should do our very best to help bring peace to 
lebanon 
theres a real chance of taking a decisive step to open a 
process of a settlement gorbachev told a news conference after 
two days of talks with bush and what its important to do is not 
to miss the opportunity to do that because the situation changes 
very swiftly 
bush said we have found that the soviet union is playing a 
constructive role in the lebanon and trying throughout the middle 
east to support a settlement 
he apparently was referring to moscows influence with syria 
which has 40000 troops in lebanon that have fought with moslem 
militia forces against the mostly christian army of gen michel 
aoun 
we do not want to see any more killing in lebanon bush 
said adding that gorbachev agrees with us and has very 
actively supported an arab leaguemediated plan that calls for 
political reforms to increase the role of the moslem majority in 
lebanon 
lebanon was discussed in detail at the summit and we would 
like to see a return to a peaceful democratic lebanon bush 
said we are trying any way we can to help 
gorbachev didnt go into detail about what can be done to find a 
lebanon settlement but he said both superpowers could contribute 
president bush thought that we had more possibilities and i 
thought that we had equal possibilities in order to resolve 
positively this conflict he said 
it seems to me we do have an understanding between us that we 
must do our very best independently and together to promote a 
solution to this problem gorbachev said 
he said he and bush agreed that the peace plan had opened an 
opportunity for a settlement 
we think that we will make our contribution to that 
gorbachev said 
theres common ground between the superpowers on the middle 
east bush said that may not always have been the case in 
history and that may not always have been the way the united 
states looked at it as to how constructive the role the soviets 
might play

after all was said and done the 
summit at sea was conducted beside a pier soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev never put to sea and president bush had trouble 
reaching shore 
i dont think anyone can say that the saltwater gettogether 
was anything other than adventure at least out in the harbor 
here bush said at the close of the summit 
bush and gorbachev conducted all their business on the soviet 
liner maxim gorky docked at marsaxlokk bay instead of the 
galebuffeted soviet missile cruiser slava and uss belknap two 
warships anchored not far from harbor 
i want to thank the captain and crew of belknap for the great 
support that theyve given us i think they were wondering if i 
was about to become a permanent guest said bush who was 
stranded aboard the ship saturday night by the storm 
switching sites for the shipboard summit raised questions about 
whether it was a good idea in the first place 
no it was a very good idea insisted bush when a reporter 
asked the question as the president arrived onboard the luxury 
liner 
but one reporter asked didnt he think it was just as well 
that the soviets happened to have a big cruise boat handy at the 
dock 
we could have floated the holiday inn out here bush 
replied referring to the hotel prepared by white house staff as a 
backup meeting venue 
this shows we can adjust to changing circumstances very 
well gorbachev interjected 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said sundays meetings 
could have taken place onboard the uss belknap as planned but 
gorbachev didnt want to come out to the ship about 500 yards 
offshore 
he doesnt share our love for the sea fitzwater said

bush watched the building gale from the belknaps rolling 
bridge sallied out into the bays heaving waters on a small 
admirals barge and wore a tiny precaution for seasickness sunday 
during the dockside summit 
pool reporters aboard the maxim gorky reported that bush a 
former naval officer wore a medicated patch used to prevent motion 
sickness after spending what crewmen aboard the belknap described 
as a rough night 
belknap crewmen said the ship was swinging on its forward anchor 
throughout the second straight night of the fierce december gale 
but bush apparently suffered no ill effects from the motion 
he was fine but i think some of his secret service guys were 
a little green said one officer 
both bush and secretary of state james baker who told reporters 
no one was seasick were seen sunday morning using scopalamine a 
pennysize patch worn behind the ear that releases medication to 
stabilize the liquid in the labyrinth of the inner ear which 
controls balance 
the patch which lasts 72 hours is a used as a precaution 
against seasickness and not as a treatment 
white house strategist sig rogich told reporters earlier that 
bush enjoys rough weather but other travelers from washington 
indicated they had a hard time of it 
were not used to this in kansas said fitzwater a native 
of that midwestern state

at the close of the summit the leaders of the united states 
and the soviet union held an unprecedented joint news conference in 
an atmosphere so free of superpower tension that it would have 
seemed impossible to believe just a few years ago 
gorbachev got the biggest laugh with a small wellaimed barb at 
bushs muchpublicized intention to approach the summit carefully 
in our position the most dangerous thing is to exaggerate we 
always should preserve elements of cautiousness said gorbachev 
pausing before he added i have used the favorite word of 
president bush 
at another point while the two leaders were discussing their 
positions on the possible reunification of germany gorbachev said 
that he and bush had exchanged messages on the question 
the president wrote in english and i dont read english i 
answered him in russian and he doesnt read russian but we 
agreed said gorbachev 
no matter what it said added bush 
near the end of their news conference gorbachev suggested 
thanking reporters for their cooperation but he added although 
of course we dont know what theyve written yet or what they will 
be writing 
but bush again showing caution asked reserve the right to 
thank them afterwards you mean after weve seen what theyve 
written 
replied gorbachev no right now and they will write 
better

prime minister edward fenech adami forecast no problems for 
malta because of the stormy weather that drove the shipboard summit 
to the side of the dock 
for malta itself the summit has been very positive it has 
shown malta can cope even with the necessary organization for a 
summit like this some people were skeptical that malta could do 
it i think we proved ourselves he said in a postsummit 
interview 
as for the weather well i dont mind the weather at all if 
anything it has proved i was correct when i suggested that the 
meetings should not be held in marsaxlokk but in some other bay 
such as grand harbor which is much more protected than marsaxlokk 
bay he said 
richard cachia caruana an aide to the prime minister who was in 
charge of the maltese organization for the summit acknowledged the 
television images of giant waves crashing against the rocks below 
the 16th century fortifications at valletta probably would hurt the 
islands tourism objectives 
but he said the countrys primary public relations objective 
especially in the united states was to improve maltas name 
identification 
just being at the center of the world stage for two days in a 
way helped give us that anyway he said 
rather than riding tourism we are pushing business 
opportunity that is where name identification is essential he 
said if you can cope with a summit it suggests your 
infastructure is not that weak

the shooting started before dawn after a police 
officer tripped accidentally firing his weapon when it was over 
20 years ago monday two black panther leaders were dead and a new 
black movement was born 
the chaotic police raid marked the beginning of the end for the 
radical blackliberation group whose national membership numbered 
about 4000 then but the assault also helped usher in a new era of 
black political strength in chicago several community leaders said 
illinois panther leaders fred hampton and mark clark both in 
their early 20s were gunned down in the raid dec 4 1969 by 14 
police officers who had been looking for weapons and claimed that 
they had begun firing in selfdefense after they were fired upon 
after the officer tripped and set off his firearm police fired 
98 rounds into hamptons apartment in 15 minutes in addition to 
the two who were killed four other panthers were wounded two 
policemen also were injured 
one shot was fired from inside it was later determined but it 
did not strike anyone 
community leaders say the raid and the outrage it engendered 
helped unify black voters 
we all knew cook county states attorney edward hanrahan had 
ordered the raid said nancy jefferson who heads the midwest 
community center serving the citys west side 
when hanrahan a democrat sought reelection black voters 
helped republican opponent bernard carey defeat him 
that began independent politics for chicago blacks ms 
jefferson said 
the community had been splintered or totally in the camp of 
the democratic party said real estate agent dempsey travis who 
has written books on black community life in chicago where the 
population is about 40 percent black with the murder of hampton 
and clark blacks did a 180degree turn 
ms jefferson says the black support that ensured the late 
harold washingtons 1983 election as the citys first black mayor 
was a direct result of changes sparked by the raid 
today violence still stalks the panthers in august huey 
newton a former leader whose story includes a doctorate in 
philosophy and a manslaughter charge was gunned down in oakland 
calif where the movement began police believe a man killed 
newton to win favor with a drugdealing street gang 
few reminders are left of the angry determined young blacks who 
burst on the scene in the late 1960s in the shadow of the 
nonviolent civilrights movement hamptons apartment building is 
an abandoned hulk 
but 20 years ago the panthers rhetoric and radical politics 
were fiery uncompromising and scary 
the panthers were widely viewed as criminals with their 
defiantly displayed firearms touted as defenses against police 
oppression and rallying cries of off the pigs and power to 
the people 
fbi director j edgar hoover called them the most dangerous 
and violenceprone of all extremist groups but the image always 
has been disputed 
they were a selfdefense group but the media portrayed them 
as if they were a gang says william hampton fred hamptons 
brother 
in chicago they challenged a corrupt political machine mayor 
richard j daley was undisputed boss of the city on the largely 
black west side white ward committeemen answered to the mayor 
there was a slave mentality in blacks when it came to 
politics ms jefferson recalled and the panthers attempted to 
address the political climate at the time 
the panthers launched community programs providing breakfasts 
for hungry children blood drives and a liberation school 
but the weapons and rhetoric made the headlines and drew police 
attention 
on dec 3 1969 illinois panther leaders met at hamptons 
apartment to discuss political and other concerns said alderman 
bobby rush a former panther defense minister 
all of us were going to spend the night but it was too 
crowded and some of us decided to break up and go home rush 
recalled 
the shooting started before the sun came up 
there were several investigations including one by former us 
attorney general ramsey clark no one was convicted of any crime 
though the families of the dead and wounded panthers shared a 
modest settlement from the city 14 years later

here are excerpts from an informal 
questionandanswer session that president bush held sunday with 
reporters after his joint press conference with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev at the conclusion of their twoday summit 
q this goal you set for yourself at least toward moving 
towards an end to the cold war he gorbachev said an epoch has 
ended how do you feel about that 
a i think this is a major step towards understanding and 
towards any in trying to tear down any remaining barriers that 
shot up because of the cold war theres no question that the 
conditions today are far different than at the depths of the cold 
war no question about it i havent even heard anybody argue to 
the contrary 
q mr president what do you think of nato and warsaw pact 
evolving to political organizations and really moving out of a 
military mode 
a well if we make the progress that i hope well make on 
various arms control items and if tensions continue to go down as 
they have inside the soviet union and in terms of relations with 
the united states and eastern europe who knows where the change 
will take us but obviously i have a certain responsibility for 
keeping nato strong and nothing here has altered that desire but 
as you see the historical changes taking place i think its fine 
to envision a group of countries that spend a lot more time 
worrying about the economic side and less on the defense side we 
are not there yet we are not there 
q what will you tell the nato leaders 
a well ill wait until i get there to decide that ill give 
them a pretty good report on what went on in considerable detail 
not all necessarily because some relates to the ussoviet 
equation but well have a good frank discussion and i think they 
will be pleased at what the results of the meeting are 
q mr president other than the weather were there any 
disappointments you seem to still be at odds very much so on 
central america and was there anything mr gorbachev told you that 
especially surprised or pleased you 
a no no surprises and i but as i say we cannot in you 
know 10 hours of discussion or whatever it is solve all the 
problems that exist between the united states and the soviet union 
and the way we look at different areas but its it would be 
euphorically optimistic to think that a meeting like this would 
solve all those problems but its better we understand more ive 
got some areas where i can now go back to him various areas but 
there were no surprises it was a wide discussion im not sure we 
left out any subjects in a geopolitical sense but we covered a lot 
of them 
q disappointments no specific disappointments something you 
wish he was more forthcoming on 
a no particular disappointments no because i think the 
i think the goal now is to go forward as we have wanted to anyway 
and demonstrate everybodys commitment to cfe talks everybodys 
commitment to chemical weapons reductions eventual elimination 
and of course the start agenda 
q now now having a better understanding of mr gorbachev after 
this meeting could you tell us what you know about him today or 
understand about him today 
a well i know that hes perfectly willing to have very frank 
discussions even if im on the opposite side of a question from 
him there was no anger there was no vitriol it was a very 
constructive set of meetings in that regard and so i saw a man 
who is confident i saw a man who was calm in our in his 
presentations and responded as factually as he could in some of 
the questions i raised and so i am convinced that the concept of 
getting together for a no agenda meeting was very very sound 
q do you think that the united states and the soviet union now 
are dealing with each other more as allies than adversaries 
a i wouldnt say allies but with far less misunderstanding 
and with far more common goals 
q what do you think of the adversarial relationship of the 
nature of the relationship now 
a well i say as i say i think its vastly improved tensions 
reduced not eliminated but reduced we still have different ways 
of looking at certain questions and but i think the answer is 
improved 
q mr president relatives of pan am flight 103 bombing were 
going to have a ceremony in the harbor today drop flowers into the 
harbor as part of their attempt to have both you and mr gorbachev 
work together in fighting international terrorism did this come up 
specifically this weekend did you talk a little bit about it 
a not 103 per se but youre talking about antiinternational 
terror yes it did and also in the antinarcotics efforts so 
theres more we can do we didnt discuss it specifically but im 
thinking about certain kinds of intelligence interchange that can 
prove to be beneficial 
q secretary baker before he came out here a couple weeks ago 
said that the soviet role in cuba and central america was the 
primary obstacle to a more beneficial fullscale relationship 
between the two countries you agree now you disagreed here but 
did you advance the issue at all 
more

president sheik zayed bin 
sultan al nahyan on sunday denounced the united states as the 
arabs no 2 enemy saying it supports israel at the expense of 
the palestinians 
israel is our no 1 enemy and america is our no 2 enemy 
he told a news conference at the culmination of nationwide 
celebrations marking the 18th anniversary of the united arab 
emirates 
america supports israel in its intransigence against the 
rightful cause of the palestinians sheik zayed said 
the united states stands to lose the friendship of 21 arab 
powers by exaggerating its support for israel he said 
otherwise he said the united arab emirates has warm and 
friendly relations with america 
answering a wide range of questions by arab and foreign 
reporters the sheik lauded soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
for introducing appreciable changes for his people 
but he cautioned the arabs against hinging any hopes on the 
ussoviet summit talks contending that the two superpowers 
care more about their own interests and less about everything 
else 
the 71yearold president rejected the concept of arab unity as 
a meaningless hallucination he stressed that ideas of 
integration or cooperation are far more meaningful 
i have been hearing the term unity for 40 years now but have 
seen nothing real nothing tangible of it he said we have 
opted for cooperation as opposed to unity in the common sense of 
the term in our parlance 
he was referring to the creation of the gulf cooperation 
council a sixnation economic integration and collective defense 
pact grouping saudi arabia kuwait bahrain oman qatar and the 
united arab emirates 
the united arab emirates was created in 1971 by merging the 
seven sheikdoms of abu dhabi dubai sharjah umm alquwain 
fujairah ajman and ras alkhaimah

its a feud fit for the old west 
sen max baucus dmont thought it would be a good idea to 
celebrate the 100th birthdays of six northwest states with a 
commemorative coin 
montana north dakota south dakota and washington turned 100 
years old this year and idaho and wyoming will hit the century 
mark in 1990 
but baucus insistence that some of the coins be made of 
palladium a metal mined only in his home state led to a standoff 
with the house and the us mint that has all but doomed his plan 
the mint opposed minting any coins for the six states arguing 
at a house hearing in october that there already were too many 
commemorative issues the mint particularly opposed using 
palladium contending the silverwhite metal used in automobile 
catalytic converters is too hard to mint 
representatives of coin collectors agreed with the mint and the 
house last week approved a silveronly issue of a million coins 
but the senate which has approved baucus palladium plan at 
least four times accepted baucus demand that at least 175000 
coins be made of palladium earlier he had proposed 350000 
the senate passed baucus plan nov 22 shortly before congress 
adjourned this years session the house however refused to back 
down and sent the bill back to the banking committee that rejected 
baucus idea in the first place it is not expected to be the 
committees top priority 
it may be a dead issue frankly baucus spokesman bob 
harrison said

president bush and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev wrapped up two days of superpower summitry on 
sunday claiming strides toward a new era of eastwest peace but 
underscoring differences that linger at the end of a 45year cold 
war 
both men said they would meet again next year in the united 
states and expressed the hope but not the certainty they would 
be able to sign historic agreements in 1990 to cut long range 
nuclear weapons and conventional forces in europe and make progress 
toward a chemical weapons ban 
we stated both of us that the world leaves one epoch of cold 
war and enters another epoch gorbachev said at an unprecedented 
joint news conference that marked the end of two days of 
stormtossed talks held aboard a soviet luxury liner we are just 
at the very beginning of our long road to a longlasting peaceful 
period 
said bush after his first summit as president i am optimistic 
that as the west works patiently together and increasingly 
cooperates with the soviet union we can realize a lasting peace 
and transform the eastwest relationship into one of enduring 
cooperation 
even so neither man sought to gloss over differences on two 
topics the soviets call for cuts in naval forces and american 
anger at the continued flow of soviet weapons to leftist rebels in 
el salvador 
gorbachev departed malta for moscow where he was convening a 
meeting of virtually an entirely new lineup of warsaw pact leaders 
to discuss the summit 
bush went immediately to belgium to meet with nato leaders on 
monday arriving in brussels he noted the thunderous events 
taking place in the eastern bloc and said tonight we stand at 
the crossroads of history on a way to europe whole and freeand 
that simple truth brought mikhail gorbachev and me together in a 
windswept harbor off malta 
windswept it was bush and secretary of state james baker who 
spent the night aboard ship in the harbor sported pennysize 
patches behind their ears to guard against seasickness 
the joint news conference in malta was held aboard the soviet 
luxury liner maxim gorky which was pressed into service as the 
site for the two days of talks after bad weather forced 
cancellation of plans to use us and soviet warships anchored 
offshore an afternoon session and a dinner on saturday were 
cancelled because of the rough weather 
the two superpower leaders met for eight hours over two days at 
a time of extraordinary change in eastern europe the upheaval was 
dramatized in the summits final hours by the resignation of the 
east german leadership and the formation of a new government in 
czechoslovakia that opposition leaders immediately denounced as too 
much like the old one 
gorbachev said he was encouraged and inspired by the changes 
in eastern europe 
bush said gorbachevs acceptance of the changes there lays to 
rest previous doctrines under which the soviet union had 
asserted a right to intervene militarily in eastern europe 
still gorbachev at one point said that he opposed 
artificially speeding up the process a reference to proposals 
for the reunification of germany a plan strongly opposed by the 
soviet union 
there were no surprises bush told reporters shortly before 
leaving this mediterranean island nation he said he thought the 
session had helped him and the soviet leader better size each other 
up as individuals 
asked about gorbachevs desire for naval arms reductions bush 
said he was disinclined to think that is an area where we will 
make immediate progress and that we still have differences with 
the soviet union he knows it and i know it as it relates to naval 
forces 
on the issue of central america where the united states has 
complained about the continued flow of sovietbloc arms to marxist 
rebels in el salvador bush said the united states will stand by 
its assertion that these weapons are still reaching the rebels 
most likely being supplied by moscows allies in the region cuba 
and nicaragua 
i will not be satisfied until total selfdetermination takes 
places through verifiably free elections in nicaragua bush said 
gorbachev said the soviets also supported free elections in 
nicaragua but he said we have reaffirmed once again to the 
president that we have ceased arms shipments to central america

buoyed by a cordial summit 
atmosphere president bush and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
said they planned to rendezvous again in june and said their 
foreign ministers would speed work on three armscontrol treaties 
if a meeting can improve relations i think this one has 
bush told the news conference aboard the soviet passenger ship 
maxim gorky 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze are to meet next month in the 
soviet union to accelerate work on the strategic arms reduction 
treaty start a treaty on conventional forces in europe cfe 
and chemical weapons bush and gorbachev said at an unprecedented 
joint news conference 
another bakershevardnadze meeting is scheduled at a 
multinational conference in ottawa next february and a third was 
possible before june perhaps in shevardnadzes native georgia in 
the southern soviet union said soviet officials 
the next summit said bush will drive the arms control 
agenda and thats a good thing because i represented to him that 
we wanted to see a start agreement a cfe agreement and hopefully 
a chemical agreement thats a very ambitious agenda 
the most important result of the malta summit may not be the 
accelerated timetable on arms deals but the sense that the two 
leaders were working together to improve ussoviet relations and 
solve conflicts around the world 
i could not have asked for a better result out of this 
nonsummit summit said bush 
a better ussoviet relationship is to be valued in and of 
itself but it also should be an instrument of positive change in 
the world he said 
gorbachev describing the news conference as the first ever 
organized for us and soviet leaders to hold jointly said we 
made good contact the atmosphere was friendly straightforward 
open and this enabled us to make good work 
we stated both of us that the world leaves the one epoch of 
cold war and enters another epoch he added we are just at the 
very beginning of our long road to a longlasting peaceful period 
despite the visionary words many hard issues remain if the two 
sides are to complete the three proposed treaties 
on start which would cut longrange superpower nuclear arsenals 
by 30 to 50 percent to 6000 warheads apiece they disagree over 
how to count airlaunched cruise missiles how to handle undeployed 
missiles and over us allegations that the soviets have encoded 
data transmissions from ballistic missile tests in violation of 
previous arms accords 
gorbachev was optimistic however 
as to strategic offensive arms the analysis of the situation 
and the instructions that have been given regarding the preparation 
of that treaty demonstrate that we may be able by the second half 
of june and we agreed on the formal meeting at that time to do 
the necessary work to agree on the basic provisions of this 
treaty which then later in the coming months would be ready for a 
signature he said 
in connection with the new interesting proposals by president 
bush regarding chemical weapons which have the goal of a global ban 
and provides for certain phases and movement towards this global 
ban then we have the possibility of a rapid movement towards it 
said gorbachev 
on saturday bush change a chemical weapons proposal he made at 
the united nations last september offering to stop production of a 
new generation of us chemicals in the first year of a proposed 
40nation convention to ban such substances previously bush had 
planned to continue such production 
in the conventional arms talks which would remove 30000 us 
and 325000 soviet troops from central europe and control tanks 
and other weapons the two sides remain divided over how to count 
warplanes 
gorbachev has proposed that such an agreement be signed by the 
end of 1990 at a summit of the 35nations of europe and north 
america 
the leaders took the next steps toward a conventional arms deals 
immediately their summit as the american president flew to 
brussels to consult with his allies in the north atlantic treaty 
organization and gorbachev headed to moscow to brief leaders of the 
warsaw pact 
bush said that if the soviet legislature passes a liberalized 
emigration law as advocated by gorbachev he will recommend trade 
favors designed to ease the pressure on the soviet economy and 
bolster kremlin political reforms 
there is enormous support in our country for what chairman 
gorbachev is doing inside the soviet union there is enormous 
support for the way he has advocated peaceful change in europe 
said bush 
for example the soviet union now seeks greater engagement in 
the international market economy a step that certainly im 
prepared to encourage in any way i can bush said 
bush told gorbachev that he would recommend congress grant the 
soviet union mostfavored nation status easing tariffs on soviet 
exports to america and ending a sanction imposed 15 years ago to 
encourage the kremlin to ease jewish emigration 
the liberalized emigration law is expected to clear the soviet 
parliament in january or february and the national conference on 
soviet jewery announced sunday that jewish emigration from the 
soviet union reached an alltime high in november 11169 
suprassing the previous high of 9450 set in october 
the us president also promised to work to obtain a longtime 
soviet goal of obtaining observer status in the general agreement 
on trade and tariffs a decision that must be made by the 97nation 
group but which the united states can influence heavily

communist leader egon krenz and his entire 
government resigned on sunday and a 25member panel of reformers 
took over temporary leadership in a desperate effort to rescue the 
communist party 
the historic action announced by megaphone to a wildly cheering 
crowd stripped power from krenz less than six weeks after he 
replaced hardliner erich honecker krenz was left off the new 
panel which will control east germanys ruling party until a party 
congress later this month 
it was the shortest reign of any leader in the countrys 
history however krenz retains the largely ceremonial position of 
president 
the communists also expelled honecker from the party he had led 
for 18 years and announced that three ousted politburo members had 
been arrested on corruption charges a top state trade official 
fled the country 
hundreds of thousands of east germans linked hands across the 
country to form a human chain intended to increase pressure for 
quicker democratic reforms and to protest corruption in communist 
party ranks 
in neighboring czechoslovakia leaders included noncommunists 
in the government for the first time in 21 years but angered 
opposition leaders said there were too many communist holdovers on 
the new cabinet they vowed to resume prodemocracy protests 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev praised the changes under 
way in eastern europe as he ended his twoday summit with president 
bush 
i think it is something we should welcome because its 
connected with the desire of these peoples to ennoble their 
societies to make them more democratic humanitarian to open up 
the rest of the world he said 
under pressure from mass demonstrations and the exodus of 
thousands krenz took over on oct 18 and opened the berlin wall on 
nov 9 he promised democratic reforms including free elections 
but there were increased calls for his ouster even within the party 
because of his past links to honeckers rule he was jeered 
saturday by party members who demanded his resignation 
the new committee will run party affairs until a special party 
congress dec 1517 and prepare for that congress its role in 
governing the country was not immediately clear 
guenter schabowski announced the resignations of the 10man 
politburo and the 163member policymaking central committee by 
megaphone to 10000 cheering people who stood outside the central 
committee building 
the politburo accepts the criticism raised by a large number 
of party members that the current leadership is not capable of 
uncovering the entire scope of serious mistakes of the members of 
the former politburo and to draw the necessary consequences he 
said 
schabowski who was one of those who resigned from the 
politburo was considered a reformer but like all of the ousted 
officials he was not named to the new committee 
officials made it clear the central committee actions were meant 
to convince the populace the party is truly intent on jettisoning 
its tainted image and fulfilling demands for political and economic 
reforms 
we want to form a modern socialist party guided by the rank 
and file we want to save this country we want to save 
socialism said gregor gysi a prominent east berlin lawyer and 
spokesman for the new 25member committee 
gysi said the panels first act was to set up a commission to 
examine violations of the partys statutes and laws by former and 
current functionaries of the party 
the new panel includes reformers such as former spymaster markus 
wolf dresden mayor wolfgang berghofer and the panels chairman 
erfurt party chief herbert kroker 
kroker said the leadership was forced to resign because of its 
inability to develop a constructive policy for the renewal of 
socialism 
gysi said premier hans modrow also a reformer declined an 
offer to join the committee because his current work already takes 
up most of his time 
schabowski also announced the ouster from the party of honecker 
and 11 other disgraced officials following disclosures of 
corruption among top party ranks 
others thrown out of the party included former premier willi 
stoph exsecurity chief erich mielke and former parliament speaker 
horst sindermann 
the 12 are suspected of serious violations of party 
statutes schabowski said 
the widening investigations of corruption led to the arrests of 
three former politburo members 
guenter mittag and harry tisch who had been key politburo 
members under honecker were arrested and accused of heavily 
damaging socialist property and the peoples economy through abuse 
of power the staterun news service adn said 
gerhard mueller former party leader in the city of erfurt and 
former candidate or nonvoting member of the politburo was 
arrested under similar suspicions adn said 
alexander schalckgolodkowski a state secretary in the foreign 
trade ministry fled the country after authorities opened an 
investigation into suspected corruption by him adn reported 
mittag was expelled from the party last month while tisch 
mueller and schalckgolodkowski were kicked out sunday 
adn said that 30 other criminal probes into allegations of 
corruption had been opened but it did not give any names 
schalckgolodkowski was east germanys chief trade negotiator 
and headed the commercial coordination department which has been 
responsible for acquiring hard currency 
the investigation was opened after saturdays discovery of a 
secret operation to ship weapons to the middle east africa and 
south america 
hardcurrency earnings from the sales went to the countrys 
foreign trade bank addressed to schalckgolodkowski adn said 
without mentioning how much money was involved

a bulletin board announcement of open season 
on blacks and other racial incidents have led the a state college 
here to start a bias busters campaign to combat campus bigotry 
the campaign starting sunday at the state university of new york 
college at oswego is an effort to confront what college leaders say 
is a nationwide trend 
do i think this will help yes do i think this will solve the 
problem no but weve got to do what we can said oswego state 
president stephen weber 
the first step in stopping bigotry and prejudice is to 
acknowledge it exists weber said officials of the 7600student 
college 35 miles north of syracuse said the bias busters 
campaign is aimed at getting students to take a public stance when 
they witness incidents of racism or bigotry 
the whole point of what were trying to do is to get to the 
silent majority which by its silence condones these acts weber 
said 
just before thanksgiving an announcement pinned to a bulletin 
board in a campus dormitory said it was open season on porch 
monkeys and contained other racial slurs 
if theyre going to tell you that theyre going to hunt you 
down and kill you thats scary the syracuse herald american 
quoted a senior from the dominican republic as saying she said she 
found the notice posted outside her dorm room 
black students are not the only targets two weeks ago a gay 
student was threatened and the tires on his car slashed another 
student said he was considering moving out of his dorm because of 
harassment he receives for being openly gay 
bias busters can wear a lapel pin bearing the word bias 
surrounded by a circle with a slash through the center 
in addition bias reduction workshops will be offered throughout 
the year to help participants identify their own prejudices and 
work on getting rid of them said catherine martin a workshop 
coordinator 
its not a case where youre going to change the world but if 
you change people around you will see that and react to it she 
said if you make it known that you dont want to hear racist and 
sexist jokes then people wont tell them around you 
some students felt that prejudice was too widespread and 
entrenched to be much affected by slogans and buttons others feel 
the campaign would raise public consciousness about the issue 
i think most people dont think theres racial problems on 
this campus and thats not the truth said emilio dorcely vice 
president of the campus student association its no better or no 
worse than anyplace else but it could be better and this 
campaign is a positive approach to the problem 
frank pogue the state university of new yorks vice chancellor 
for student affairs and special programs said antibias programs 
have been instituted and more are planned for sunys 64 campuses 
the nations largest state university system 
our approach is to prevent rather than react pogue said 
any one occurrence of biasrelated activity on a college campus 
is too many

a man named ritzer would naturally be 
nicknamed ritz and would be likely to give his nickname to 
something he invented so argues tom ritzer who invented a potty 
training toilet seat and called it the ritz 
but the people who guard the reputation of the famed ritz hotel 
in paris think ritzer is trying to use their name without 
permission 
the hotel people asked the trademark trial and appeal board of 
the us patent and trademark office to order ritzer to stop using 
their name 
its been one nightmare after another said ritzer 48 of 
arnolds park in northwestern iowa i think whats really 
happening here is that the big ritz hotel in france is trying to 
put a hurtin on the little iowa toilet seat company 
but ritz president frank klein who flew to new york to testify 
in the case in october said ritzer represents a genuine threat 
the ritz hotel in paris stands for privacy for perfection 
for discretion he testified the ritz had such a reputation 
for over the last 80 years that whatever we do whatever is 
matched with our name has to be in a perfect way 
thus he said nabisco foods paid the ritz for use of its name 
on ritz crackers 
klein said ritzer deliberately cloned his hotels name for the 
toilet seat 
why does the man put the name ritz on it because he needs us 
as a signature thats what he has done the man is not stupid 
what else could work better than the name ritz klein testified 
the trouble began two years ago when ritzer applied for a patent 
and trademark on his invention the patent was granted but the ritz 
hotel filed formal opposition to the name ritz after one of its 
attorneys noticed the request in a routine review of trademark 
applications 
lawyers on both sides said they dont expect a decision for 
several months 
ritzer said the name came naturally and has nothing to do with 
the hotel 
ritz he said is the nickname everybody in the ritzer family 
has had for generations and i put it on the toilet seat because 
its short and easy to remember and because its kind of an 
attentiongetter 
we never even gave a thought to the idea that someone might 
confuse our name and toilet seat with the ritz hotel 
ritzer gave his reply testimony last week in the office of his 
des moines lawyer edmund sease 
ritzer who operated a plumbing business in arnolds park for 25 
years explained that his family had trouble toilet training a 
daughter in the 1960s 
she was afraid of the big toilet seat because she was afraid 
shed fall in or somebody would flush it while she was up there 
he said i got to thinking there just has to be a better way to 
combine the ideas of toilet seats and toilets and potty chairs to 
make it easier for the little kids 
so he made a toilet seat with an extra ring that could be pulled 
down to accommodate infants smaller bottoms other people wanted 
one so four years ago he said he sold the plumbing business to 
his son and started the threeemployee toilet seat business 
the doublering seat has been marketed to hardware stores and 
childrens furniture stores the ritzers say they have sold between 
3000 and 4000 in the last 18 months

president bush said sunday the 
superpower summit helped erase mikhail s gorbachevs doubts about 
the intentions of a new american president toward the soviet union 
and its political and economic reforms 
i dont think he has me down as a total negativist at all and 
i certainly dont have him down that way said bush who has 
weathered criticism at home and in the kremlin for his guarded 
approach toward changes in the soviet union and eastern europe 
bush said the two days of talks gave him and gorbachev a chance 
to get to know one another he added that as a result of their 
earlier meetings when he was vice president the summit was 
probably less formidable than if id never met him ever 
bush was in high spirits as he spoke to halfadozen reporters 
aboard the soviet luxury liner maxim gorky shortly before departing 
malta 
he said he wrote humorous notes to 25 friends saturday night 
when bad weather forced cancellation of a dinner with the soviets 
and left him stranded on an american warship anchored in the harbor 
and funny youll die he said describing the 
correspondence its a whole new emotional humorous side to this 
president 
he said it was difficult to describe his personal feelings 
because im not the most articulate emotionalist 
turning his attention to gorbachev he said he knows that im 
cautious 
you heard him use the word prudent to describe bush im 
sure that was deliberate the president said 
but i cant have asked for a better ambiance a better feel 
from the meetings even though the differences are acute in some 
areas 
commenting on dynamics of his talks bush said id like to 
think he thought i knew what i was talking about so we could have 
a good exchange without having to go to the experts or go to the 
notebooks and it worked 
bush originally had conceived their meeting as a relaxed 
feetup get acquainted session but the talks took on a new 
dimension in the wake of the collapse of hardline communist 
regimes in eastern europe 
even so bush said at one moment i actually did put my foot 
up 
bush said that in gorbachev i saw a man who was confident 
who was calm in his presentations 
contrary to some expectations bush said there were no surprises 
from gorbachev in their meetings 
bush talked about the summit just minutes after holding a joint 
news conference with gorbachev and saying farewell to him on the 
soviet cruise ship maxim gorky where they held eight hours of talks 
over two days 
talking with reporters in a small cabin on the ship bush called 
the talks productive and constructive and said it worked exactly 
as i expected 
he said that six months ago there was probably a 
misunderstanding about the intentions of this new president and i 
think one of the good things is that i dont think he has any 
feeling that im going to be unforthcoming in situations where i 
should be 
bush said the climate of the talks was radically different from 
when he first met gorbachev shortly before the soviet leader came 
to power in 1985 
i remember a time when i first met mr gorbachev and we talked 
about human rights and he became visibly agitated with me for 
raising it bush said 
i think theres been an evolution of his thinking and 
certainly in his relations with the united states just as theres 
been an evolution in my thinking 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said gorbachev had 
responded positively on saturday when bush spelled out a package of 
proposals for dealing with the soviet unions attempts to overhaul 
its ailing economy and the upheaval in eastern europe 
fitzwater quoted gorbachev as telling bush what youre 
telling me is that the us is not just satisfied to let this 
happen but is going to take an active role with the soviet union in 
terms of economic and political reforms 
quoting gorbachev further the spokesman reported he said i 
am taking a prudent and cautious approach and im glad to hear you 
are too

germanys communists includes the countrys former spymaster a 
lawyer for the new forum opposition group and several wellknown 
reformers

embattled party 
the 25member working committee was announced sunday after

committee resigned 
the bestknown member of the committee is markus wolf the 
retired and respected legendary spy chief who stepped down in 1987

criticized by opposition leaders who say he has too many 
skeletons in the closet 
the head of the committee is erfurt party chief herbert kroker 
who was once stripped of various duties by guenter mittag the 
economics czar under nowousted leader erich honecker 
another member of the working committee is gregor gysi well 
known as the attorney for the 200000strong new forum opposition 
group gysi drafted the official petition seeking legal status for 
new forum 
no prominent new forum members were appointed to the committee 
dresden mayor wolfgang berghofer one of the first politicians 
to meet with new forum is also a member of the panel 
earlier this month berghofer was quoted widely in west german 
news media as giving an extremely gloomy forecast of the partys 
future saying the people have taken power away from us 
berghofer was also quoted by stern magazine as saying he was 
considering a challenge to krenz for the post of party chief 
although he later backed away from that position 
the popular reformist premier hans modrow is not a member of 
the committee but will effectively be in charge of the government 
until a new politburo and central committee are selected at a 
threeday congress starting dec 15 modrow was asked to serve on 
the committee but said his job as premier kept him too busy 
like kroker the head of the committee modrow himself was the 
target of a honeckerera inquisition and virtually exiled for years 
to his power base in dresden

about 100 people many in confederate 
costumes and carrying civil warera weapons gathered under grey 
skies to mark the centennial of the death of confederate president 
jefferson davis 
although the 5foot pedestal was once defaced with graffiti 
denouncing the statue as racist no pickets or hecklers were around 
as a marine band tuned up for the ceremonies saturday 
one of the main things ive tried to bring to the publics 
attention is that jefferson davis is always thought of as president 
of the confederate states of america but that people have no 
realization that that was four years out of his 80year life 
said davis greatgreatgrandson bertram hayesdavis of dallas 
he was a great american patriot a tremendous scholar and 
certainly one of the ablest leaders of that time 
jefferson davis died dec 6 1889 during his life he was a 
us representative and senator a hero in the mexican war and a 
member of president franklin pierces cabinet said hayesdavis 
head of the davis family foundation 
it wasnt the family who restored the monument but a committee 
led by pierre mcgraw who lives in a small building next to the 
mansion where jefferson davis died 
it bothered him that davis funerary centennial seemed destined 
to pass unnoticed and that the 78yearold statue and other 
confederate numents on jefferson davis parkway were in disrepair 
a committee organized by mcgraw fixed up the monument and held a 
twoday commemoration including a reception at gallier hall where 
his body lay in state for three days before burial in metairie 
cemetery the burial turned out to be temporary in 1892 davis 
remains were moved to richmond va 
mcgraw said it cost about 20000 in services and donations to 
erase graffiti shore up the monument cut back brush and landscape 
the area around the statues base

a process that sets tiny bacteria to work 
gobbling up the sticky black creosote found on scrap wood has 
become the focus of scientists and politicians concerned about the 
environmental hazards of offshore woodburning 
rep james saxton rnj announced last week that the 
environmental protection agency agreed to put the hungry 
microorganisms to the test 
everything in nature apparently goes back to its original 
state at some point there are little helpers that help it get 
there he explained im encouraged because the process is 
going to move forward 
with a ban on offshore woodburning going into effect jan 1 
1991 saxton and others have been looking for alternatives to 
disposing of telephone poles railroad ties and driftwood by 
incineration or landfill 
thousands of tons of the wood about 97 percent of it treated 
with the unpleasantsmelling wood preservative are collected each 
year the army corps of engineers tears down old piers along new 
york harbor to make way for redevelopment and the coast guard 
gathers driftwood from the harbor 
the wood has been burned for two decades on barges about 20 
miles off point pleasant nj fueling concerns about air 
pollution 
saxton arranged a meeting in new york with regional epa 
officials the army corps environmental officials from new york 
and new jersey and rep frank pallone jr dnj to discuss the 
feasibility of socalled bioremediation the process ideally would 
turn the wood into harmless sawdust that could be used as mulch 
hopefully when the lab work is completed well know whether 
it can be used on a largescale basis whether the endproduct can 
be easily disposed of and whether it is costeffective saxton 
said 
the bacterial process allows the microorganisms to feed on 
creosote until it is neutralized he said 
saxton requested the epa meeting after a session at his 
washington office with representatives of alpha environmental inc 
of austin texas 
dan kuykendall alpha executive vice president said the firm 
often employs oileating bacteria in environmental cleanups 
saxton a member of the house merchant marine and fisheries 
committee asked alpha about applying their cleanup techniques to 
creosote 
using tiny quantities in an eightday trial earlier this month 
researchers in austin were able to reduce phenol the main element 
in creosote by 80 percent in one batch of wood saxton shipped from 
new jersey they used organisms that occur naturally said 
kuykendall a former congressman from memphis 
we got enough results that we felt we could go to congressman 
saxton kuykendall said i think the odds are better than 5050 
we could do something 
should the epa test phase prove promising research would 
proceed to a fullscale demonstration with about 100 tons of wood 
kuykendall said

mikhail s gorbachevs first 
postsummit business monday will be to brief leaders of a radically 
reshaped warsaw pact and for the first time a noncommunist will 
sit at the table 
the appearance at the moscow meeting of polish prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki a solidarity figure will be a startling 
development but tumultuous events in east germany on sunday lent 
an even greater aura of suspense to the meeting gorbachev will host 
east german communist party leader egon krenz and his entire 
politburo resigned and a 25member panel of reformers took over 
temporary leadership in a desperate effort to rescue the communist 
party krenz relinquished a post hed held less than six weeks 
although he retained the largely ceremonial title of president it 
was unclear whether he would make the moscow meeting and there was 
no early indication who would represent east germany 
what was known was that several eastern european leaders will be 
attending their first warsaw pact leadership meeting these include 
petar mladenov of bulgaria and karel urbanek of czechoslovakia 
in another first for the alliance the head of the outofpower 
polish communist party apparently will not be invited at all 
hardline leader nicolae ceausescu of romania is the only east 
bloc leader to reject the epic transformations with the recent 
fall of orthodox communist leaders like erich honecker in east 
germany and milos jakes in czechoslovakia he is likely to find 
himself at this session to be more isolated than ever before 
the meeting takes place in an atmosphere of ongoing crisis in 
the communist world 
the entire east german communist party politburo quit sunday 
along with krenz and a new government unveiled sunday in 
czechoslovakia failed to satisfy opponents who pledged more mass 
demonstrations 
it has been five months since top leaders of the warsaw pact 
last met june 78 in bucharest and said that each member country 
had the right to make its own political lines strategy and 
tactics without any outside interference 
since then the solidarity movement assumed the helm of polands 
government the hungarian communist party dissolved itself east 
germany was forced to open the berlin wall czechoslovakian 
communists have conceded past errors and promised free elections 
and the blocs longestreigning hardliner todor zhivkov abruptly 
resigned after 35 years in power in bulgaria and was replaced by a 
reformer 
the sweeping changes in eastern europe were a centerpiece theme 
of the weekend discussions between gorbachev and bush on the soviet 
passenger liner maxim gorky docked in maltas marsaxlokk bay 
rather than expressing any anxiety about the changes in the 
region gorbachev said at his joint news conference with bush after 
the summit that he welcomed them 
im encouraged and inspired by all these processes 
gorbachev said they are connected with the desire of these 
peoples to ennoble their societies to make them more democratic 
and humanitarian and to open up to the rest of the world 
gorbachev said he and bush agreed that the world leaves one 
epoch of cold war and enters another epoch this is just the 
beginning we are just at the very beginning of our road a long 
road to a longlasting peaceful period 
the warsaw pact founded in the polish capital in 1955 in 
response to the formation of the north atlantic treaty alliance is 
itself an outgrowth of the cold war 
now gorbachev said both the warsaw pact and nato will have to 
change 
they should not remain military alliances but rather 
militarypolitical alliances and later on just political 
alliances he said 
for his part bush said he and gorbachev discussed the situation 
in eastern europe in considerably more detail than he could 
disclose and expressed broad approval 
there is enormous support in our country for what chairman 
gorbachev is doing inside the soviet union bush said there is 
enormous respect and support for the way he has advocated peaceful 
change in europe 
but he indicated that the united states did not press for any 
sort of acceleration in the process i dont think it is a role 
for the united states to dictate the rapidity of change in any 
country its a matter for the people to determine themselves

inmates at several east german prisons are 
staging work stoppages and hunger strikes to demand a general 
amnesty in keeping with the spirit of reform sweeping the country 
the state news agency said sunday 
the adn news agency quoted spokesmen for an inmates committees 
as saying prisoners should get a chance to start anew while the 
country is in the midst of its political changes 
it was the second day that adn reported prison unrest in east 
germany where the communist party politburo and central committee 
resigned sunday in the continuing political upheaval 
adn gave no figure on the number of prisoners involved in 
amnesty demands but said the inmates of the east berlin prison 
have demanded better living conditions and more pay for their 
work 
in earlier reports it said inmates at prisons in bautzen and 
near potsdam had stopped working or gone on hunger strikes 
demanding amnesty better living conditions and higher pay for work 
adn quoted one prisoner as saying the real criminals who 
have cheated the people out of millions are free and have the 
possibility to avoid punishment 
he was referring to disclosures by the ruling communist party 
that three expolitburo members have been arrested and charged with 
corruption and other former party officials are under investigation 
interior ministry officials have acknowledged that inmates in 
prisons in leipzig and dresden and at a youth reformatory in 
frankfurt an der oder have made similar demands recently 
adn said striking prisoners have met with prison officials and 
representatives of protestant churches and opposition groups to 
discuss their grievances 
in some cases prison officials offered more liberal visiting 
rights and freer exchange of letters adn said 
overcrowding at the prison near potsdam can be reduced by 
transferring 400 inmates to other facilities it reported 
officials have rejected a general amnesty because of the 
seriousness of the offenses committed by some prisoners according 
to adn it said many of the inmates at the east berlin prison were 
repeat offenders who had previously been set free under a general 
amnesty 
the news agency did not say if any of the striking inmates were 
political prisoners

the government sunday rejected a truce 
declared by drug traffickers in their bombing campaign and said 
accepting it would leave the country in the hands of the 
traffickers 
we will continue battling them because if we dont we will 
cease to govern interior minister carlos lemos simmonds said 
the medellin cocaine cartel has announced that beginning monday 
it will observe a ceasefire in its terrorist campaign with the 
aim of persuading congress to approve a national vote on the 
governments extradition policy

barco departed sunday for a fourday visit to japan and after a 
farewell ceremony at the airport lemos simmonds reiterated the 
administrations opposition to a national vote on its extradition 
policy

april m19 movement the only one of colombias five main guerrilla 
groups that has accepted an official peace plan

gunmen opened fire on the information 
ministers convoy sunday in southeast beirut police said it was 
the second attack in two days on the official who is a foe of 
christian leader gen michel aoun 
police said no one was hurt in the shooting which targeted 
information minister edmond rizk and his threecar convoy 
on saturday a bomb was tossed at rizks house in jezzine no 
one was hurt 
rizk a maronite christian blamed the first attack on general 
aoun and agents recruited to undermine the whole of lebanon 
he had no immediate comment after the second attack carried out 
by several men with rifles no one claimed responsibility for it 
also sunday prime minister salim hoss said aoun is leading 
lebanon to national suicide but appeared to rule out a military 
attack to evict him from the presidential palace 
in a statement to the associated press hoss said that general 
aoun has become an outlaw leading a mutiny that will result only 
in partitioning lebanon 
if he replaces the taif accord that will mean national 
suicide 
the taif accord is an arabbrokered peace plan approved in 
october by lebanese legislators who met in taif saudi arabia aoun 
opposes the accord because it does not include a timetable for 
withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon 
the accord cleared the way for election of a president and 
parliament chose rene mouawad he was killed by a bomb after 17 
days and was replaced by elias hrawi 
aoun rejected the presidential election and has refused to leave 
the presidential palace which he took over last year after being 
named head of an interim military cabinet pending a presidential 
election 
he now is holding out with 20000 troops in the christian 
heartland north and northeast of beirut 
syria last week added to its military strength in lebanon with 
massive reinforcements around the main gateways to the christian 
region sparking fears of a military move to evict aoun 
at the superpower summit sunday off the mediterranean island of 
malta soviet president mikhail gorbachev said sunday he agreed 
with president bush that the superpowers should do our very 
best to help bring peace to lebanon 
theres a real chance of taking a decisive step to open a 
process of a settlement gorbachev told a news conference 
bush said we have found that the soviet union is playing a 
constructive role in the lebanon and trying throughout the middle 
east to support a settlement he apparently was referring to 
moscows influence with syria 
however the two leaders made no specific proposals 
we are determined to confront the aoun phenomenon because 
it is partitioning lebanon hoss said we shall use all 
peaceful political means available to end this mutiny 
he said the ceasefire sept 22 that halted six months of 
fighting between aouns forces and syrian troops must be backed up 
politically 
we do not want to go back to war but we should not forget the 
cruel lessons we have learned that a truce cannot be translated 
into peace and stability unless it is coupled with political 
reconciliation to solve the crisis hoss said 
syrias troops were deployed in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
mandate to quell civil war fighting aoun contends they betrayed 
their mission by siding with the moslems against the christians in 
the 14yearold civil war

abandoned buildings in the citys ampere section 
and as far as i understand they were pretty well set with the 
project as far as plans were concerned hatcher said but the 
proposal never went beyond the discussions he said 
hatcher said most discussions with singletary and his firm would 
have been by city planners and that he didnt get involved in 
technical details or get into a big dissertation with them 
camden mayor melvin randy primas also said he didnt 
remember the details but added i think i remember the man but 
nothing ever happened were always getting developers in 
dubois l gilliam a former pierce aide who managed the 
discretionary fund programs told the times that pierce ordered him 
to give the grant to singletary even though other hud officials 
opposed the grant arguing that singletarys group lacked 
experience 
gilliam said singletary had repeatedly contacted pierce who 
told me he wanted us to help singletary get some money he said 
singletary was a good guy 
gilliam pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges involving 
other hud grants and is scheduled to begin serving an 18month 
sentence the times said 
even if the grant had been made there was nothing improper 
about it plotkin said since pierce had the right to use the money 
under huds technical assistance program at his discretion 
the times said singletarys group originally approached hud in 
1985 for nearly 1 million for the new jersey projects a hud 
official who talked to the times on condition he not be identified 
said the proposal was rejected because of concern over its cost and 
the relative inexperience of singletarys group 
the group scaled back the proposal and the 350000 grant was 
approved through huds regional office in new york

tamil rebels ambushed an army truck 
and killed 17 sinhalese soldiers sunday in a northern district a 
military official reported he said the killers first attacked with 
grenades and then sprayed the truck with rifle fire killing all 
the soldiers who were returning to base from a trip to market in 
vavunia district vavunia is about 110 miles north of colombo 
the official who was not identified in line with army 
regulations blamed the attack on ethnic tamil insurgents 
in another development a government official reported that 115 
antigovernment sinhalese had surrendered to army units since 
friday 
he said air force helicopters had dropped 350000 leaflets in 
southern central and northern parts of sri lanka appealing to 
sinhalese militants to give themselves up 
sinhalese militants launched their own uprising after the 
government signed an indiansponsored peace accord in 1987 aimed at 
ending the tamil insurgency the accord offered tamils limited 
autonomy if they would give up their weapons but sinhalese 
militants took up arms saying the pact gave to many concessions to 
the tamils who have been fighting to establish their own country 
in northeastern sri lanka since 1983 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas population of 16 million 
and the sinhalese make up 75 percent 
the tamils who are generally hindus claim discrimination by 
the mostly buddhist sinhalese 
sinhalese militants also object to the presence of indian 
peacekeeping forces in this island nation off indias southern 
coast the indian troops came here as part of the 1987 agreement to 
help disarm the tamil rebels but many of the insurgents rejected 
the pact and battled the indians 
about 28000 indian soldiers remain in sri lanka but india has 
said all will be withdrawn by dec 31 
more than 11000 people including 1000 indian troopers have 
been killed since 1983 in the tamil revolt about 5000 were killed 
in the sinhalese uprising

no black soldiers fought at the battle of 
franklin but 125 years later black civil war reenactors are 
reminding their fellow history buffs of the contributions 
africanamericans made in the war 
a reenactment of the 1864 battle sunday capped a weekend of 
events to mark the 125th anniversary of the fight in it 
confederate gen john bell hood lost more than 6000 soldiers 
crippling the souths secondbiggest force the army of tennessee 
the recreation attracted an estimated 4000 reenactors from 
around the country similar battles will lead up to the 125th 
anniversary of the surrender at appomattox on april 9 
the recreations feature lines of soldiers firing replica 
weapons booming cannon and cavalry charges casualties fall to 
the ground though there are rules dont fall with a loaded weapon 
or with a bayonet 
in one of the few deviations allowed from the historical record 
the union forces at a field about 20 miles south of nashville this 
weekend included about two dozen black reenactors representing the 
54th massachusetts volunteer infantry 
gregory urwin a history professor at the university of central 
arkansas in conway and leader of the 54th said about 180000 black 
soldiers fought in the civil war 
they were allowed to join in 1863 after the emancipation 
proclamation and eventually made up 10 percent of the union army 
there was an initial reluctance a fear of a backlash that 
white northerners would fight to preserve the union but not to end 
slavery said urwin and there was a fear that southerners 
would fight twice as hard if blacks were armed against them 
black soldiers served with distinction in the battle of 
nashville where they helped lead one of the attacks that allowed 
union troops to turn the confederates back they were also active 
in the siege of petersburg va and several divisions were among 
the union units that helped stop gen robert e lees retreat at 
appomattox 
the first black units that were raised performed well in 
combat and by that point in the war heavy losses and frequent 
defeats made more northerners willing to accept any kind of extra 
manpower urwin said 
black participation in the war was used to justify the passage 
of the 14th amendment making them citizens and the 15th which 
gave them the right to vote 
without those constitutional weapons there would have been no 
civil rights movement in our own time said urwin so in a 
sense the black troops of the civil war were the pioneers in the 
revolution in race relations that weve lived through the past 25 
or 30 years 
urwin said the franklin recreation is a good chance for his 
group to remind history buffs of the contribution of black soldiers 
its a chance finally 125 years after for black and white 
americans to get together and celebrate their common heritage of 
valor 
the reenactors have a passion for accuracy in their portrayals 
wearing authentic wool uniforms and camping out without sleeping 
bags as did soldiers of the period 
urwin 34 had no ancestors in the war but has an interest that 
goes beyond the scholarship of his military history interest 
i get the chill like everybody else he said there are 
certain moments like when twilight is falling over the camp and 
the spectators have departed 
you look and all you see is the 19th century sentinels are 
marching their beats people are beginning to light their 
campfires thats one moment when you can almost fool yourself into 
thinking that youre back in time

patrick mclynn has the perfect christmas 
gift suggestion for the person who has everything including a car 
that works a batmobile that doesnt 
it wont be cheap the college student who won the batman 
movie car and 25000 in an mtv contest is hoping to get 125000 
to 330000 for the sleek black car and is seeking sealed bids 
from around the world the deadline dec 20 
my accountant thinks its going to be more lucrative if we try 
for somebody in california he said somebody whos going to 
want to sit on this thing for an investment or just for laughs and 
has that kind of money 
the batmobile a prototype that was one of three cars built for 
batman has another drawback it doesnt have a working engine 
mclynn already has received two bids from hollywood productions 
inc which built the batmobiles 
the company initially offered 4000 then upped that to 25000 
or a brandnew corvette with an engine mclynns main form of 
transportation is a motorcyle 
estimates of what it cost hollywood productions to build the 
vehicle range from 16000 to 60000 
mclynns uncle andy grimes has been handling most of the 
inquiries about the batmobile 
were now in the process of weeding out the people who bid 
just to get a hand in it so they can tell people they had a shot at 
the batmobile grimes said

things seemed amiss at the eastern 
cemetery for years there were complaints about poor upkeep a 
stray human bone was found in 1986 there was a lawsuit when a 
newly purchased grave was found to be occupied 
but only when a gravedigger tipped jim caldwell an investigator 
for the state attorney general last spring did the astounding 
details begin to emerge 
authorities say as many as 48000 people were buried in already 
occupied graves in eastern cemetery and greenwood cemetery both 
cemeteries on louisvilles east side are owned by the louisville 
crematory amp cemeteries co 
caldwell reported finding dozens of infants buried too shallow 
some as little as 10 inches below the surface at eastern cemetery 
and remains of more than 200 cremated bodies many unidentified 
shelved in the cellar of the crematory 
for an undetermined number of people their final resting 
place was neither final nor restful 
a 60count indictment issued in july alleges that some remains 
were unearthed so that the graves could be reused the remains were 
then scattered throughout the grounds mixed into other graves or 
put in a storage building 
the attorney general obtained the indictment and filed a lawsuit 
against the 145yearold company and three former officers 
charles alexander jr who was its executive director clifford b 
amos who was company president and robert copley who was vice 
president 
all three men have resigned and pleaded innocent 
the cemetery companys spokesman bill kinman did not 
immediately return a message sunday in the past the companys 
lawyers have said they dont want to comment on pending litigation 
criminal charges included corpse abuse grave desecration 
theft improper handling of burial payments and failure to keep 
adequate funds in perpetualcare and maintenance trust accounts 
the theft charge referred to the money received for care of the 
plots the company allegedly failed to provide 
the civil suit alleged numerous violations of the kentucky 
consumer protection act including reuse of previously sold or 
occupied graves sales of services never provided failure to 
maintain graves and failure to dispose of cremated remains 
trial on the criminal charges is scheduled in february no date 
has been set for a trial on the lawsuit 
alexander was hired in 1986 and copley began work in 1987 amos 
was acting executive director from 1980 to 1986 then became 
president the alleged wrongdoings at eastern and greenwood began 
long before they joined the company 
graves were reused on such a scale that it would almost have 
to be a matter of policy by the company said phillip diblasi a 
university of louisville archaeologist who supervised excavations 
at the cemeteries under a court order 
it seemed to become a relatively common practice around the 
early part of the century diblasi said why it continued until 
the whistle was blown i dont know 
records indicate eastern cemetery probably was full shortly 
after the turn of the century it had enough room for about 18000 
bodies under current industry standards but 51000 may have been 
buried there according to diblasi and caldwell 
caldwells report also estimated that 15000 bodies too many 
were buried at greenwood 
the cemetery company came under scrutiny in may when bob allen 
a gravedigger and maintenance worker for eight years called the 
attorney generals office to report the alleged burial practices 
caldwell said 
during the investigation caldwell found bones stored throughout 
eastern cemetery in a trucks glove compartment in a tool box 
in a storage shed in dirt piles and even in a fast food hamburger 
bag his report said 
diblasi said he had uncovered a number of old headstones or 
headstone fragments in eastern some of which appeared to have been 
deliberately buried 
graves that were dug up for reuse typically were very old 
unlikely to be missed by anyone today diblasi said 
also these were real poor people he said theyre also 
in wooden containers which is real easy to dig through

weatherweary network crews packed their gear 
and left malta on sunday after storms there caused hasty changes 
and technical problems in their coverage of the summit meeting 
cbs and nbc coverage saturday of the meeting between president 
bush and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev wasnt much affected 
despite heavy wind and stormy seas that ended plans for afternoon 
and dinner meetings that day 
but the days 60 mph wind destroyed a studio set cnn had built 
near marsaxlokk bay overlooking the harbor site of the shipboard 
summit and also blew down and damaged a cnn satellite dish 
that knocked out cnns tv signal for eight hours starting at 9 
pm est although a network spokesman in malta said most of the tv 
blackout occurred when little was going on and no transmissions 
were planned 
saturdays storm also affected abc but only briefly rain 
shorted out an electrical connection right at the start of abc 
anchorman peter jennings live summit report from malta during the 
first of two world news tonight broadcasts that abc sends its 
affiliates each night 
the broadcast was hurriedly reshaped in washington while still 
on the air anchorwoman carole simpson reported other news while 
the malta connection was restored and jennings came back on with 
his report eight minutes later 
the four networks anchormen all were in malta but only 
jennings was heading to brussels on sunday to report monday night 
on bushs postsummit briefing to nato leaders cbs dan rather and 
nbcs tom brokaw were reported returning to new york and cnns 
bernard shaw was en route to washington 
before saturdays storm the networks had planned to transmit 
live tv pictures by microwave from the planned sites of the summit 
two guided missile cruisers the us navys belknap and the 
soviet navys slava 
but when the storm forced the summit site changed to the safely 
docked soviet luxury ship maxim gorky cbs running the tv pool for 
the us networks had to scramble to install a microwave linkup to 
the gorky 
they the soviets invited the pool to put a microwave aboard 
we had to rip things apart to do that don decesare cbs 
news director of news coverage said saturday night from malta 
it took all day to do it 
but just as technicans had things working he said saturdays 
planned second meeting between bush and gorbachev was called off 
the leaders sunday news conference on the gorky was televised 
live with the soviets providing both the tv pool feed for 
broadcasters and an audio channel offering a simultaneous english 
translations of gorbachevs remarks

hour an electronic glitch knocked out the englishlanguage audio 
channel 
cbs and abc continued with their own backup russianspeaking 
translators nbc hastily brought in a soviet official on malta to 
help but missed eight minutes of translation 
cnn went the long way for help to atlanta after 13 minutes in 
which shaw recapped summit news while gorbachev was speaking an

leaders of the nato military gathered 
sunday in anticipation of a firsthand report from president bush 
on his mediterranean summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
bush arrived at brussels airport at the dinner hour where he 
was met by prime minister wilfried martens 
during airport remarks bush said its an exciting time for 
the alliance for europe and for america tonight we stand at 
the crossroads of history on a way to europe whole and free 
that simple truth is manifested in the thunderous events taking 
place as few hundred kilometers to the east and that simple truth 
brought mikhail gorbachev and me together in a windswept harbor off 
malta 
bush had dinner here with west german chancellor helmut kohl at 
chateau stuyvenberg the 18th century guest house where the 
president is staying asked by reporters if he and gorbachev saw 
eyetoeye on the issue of german reunification bush declined to 
answer citing his policy of refusing to accept questions at photo 
opportunities 
kohl said the summit had continued the progress toward better 
eastwest relations i think we came forward a great deal on 
questions that are elementary to us he said 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher nursing a bad cold 
arrived sunday evening 
british officials said she would not comment on the 
bushgorbachev summit until after the american president had given 
his briefing 
everything that weve heard does suggests that this was 
entirely in line with all of the discussions before the summit 
between the prime minister and president bush said one official 
speaking on condition of anonymity bush had met with mrs thatcher 
on nov 24 at camp david md 
the official said that bush and gorbachev clearly got on very 
well together thats of very considerable satisfaction to mrs 
thatcher weve very pleased about it 
the leaders of the 16nation north atlantic treaty organization 
anxiously awaiteded mondays minisummit to learn and leaders were 
arriving throughout the day here the nato leaders talks at 
alliance headquarters were expected to last until late afternoon 
monday when bush was due to fly back to the united states 
the officials last met in may at a summit marking the alliances 
40th anniversary 
the atmosphere among the allies was dramatically different from 
last spring when the united states and britain were quarreling with 
germany over plans for upgrading shortrange nuclear missiles in 
europe 
the allies attention will be focused this time on the momentous 
political and economic changes unfolding in eastern europe 
the recent upheavals in the hardline regimes of east germany 
bulgaria and czechoslavakia combined with the earlier changes in 
poland and hungary have reduced the military threat to the west 
nato is increasingly under pressure to reassess its role in an 
era of dramatically reduced tensions the leaders talks could well 
touch on the alliances future strategy 
in addition to bushs briefing the officials were to hear from 
italian prime minister giulio andreotti about gorbachevs trip to 
his country shortly before the malta summit and west german 
chancellor helmut kohl was likely to give his assessment of events 
in neighboring east germany 
gorbachev said sunday that change in eastern europe is a 
problem whose time has come and that new approaches were needed 
but in a joint news conference with bush at the conclusion of 
the malta talks the soviet leader said history has willed 
that there are two germanys 
gorbachev warned against anyone trying to make artificial 
changes apparently referring to calls for unification of east and 
west germany 
bush said he made clear to gorbachev that the united states 
doesnt want to do anything unrealistic about east and west 
germany that causes any country to end up going backwards or end 
up having its own people in military conflict one with the other 
he said this was why he was acting cautiously not to go 
demonstrating on top of the berlin wall to show how happy we are 
about the change 
bush said it wasnt up to the united states to dictate the 
rapidity of change in any country its a matter for the people to 
determine themselves 
we think that there is an understanding today in the minds of 
all gorbachev said we dont want to do anything to accelerate 
these changes artificially for the peoples of these two great 
german states

president mikhail s gorbachev told his countrymen 
in a broadcast monday he was impressed by president bushs realism 
at the superpower summit and that the meetings had given a boost to 
work on major arms control accords 
soviet television broadcast a 25minute interview with gorbachev 
early monday after showing the full onehour news conference that 
gorbachev and bush gave in malta after finishing their two days of 
talks 
i must say im glad i found a lot of realism in bushs 
attitude and i felt his desire his effort to understand the 
processes under way exchange opinions to work out approaches 
gorbachev said the dialogue actually surpassed my expectations 
gorbachev left the mediterranean island of malta after the news 
conference and television interview to return to moscow where he 
will brief members of the warsaw pact military alliance on the 
summit talks bush flew to brussels belgium to inform other 
leaders of the north atlantic treaty organization about the summit 
gorbachev speaking to the television interviewer in malta said 
there were no firm results from the summit but he and bush formed 
a basis for wideranging agreements on strategic nuclear weapons 
chemical arms and conventional forces in europe as well as 
economic cooperation 
ussoviet relations will become more dynamic in all areas 
gorbachev said he added the meeting gave a serious impulse to 
talks on strategic nuclear weapons and expressed the hope that the 
two sides could work out remaining differences so the two 
presidents can sign an agreement when gorbachev visits the united 
states in june 
gorbachev said an agreement to cut strategic nuclear weapons 
which the superpowers have been negotiating for years would be an 
epochal treaty far outstripping in importance the 1987 
agreement to scrap mediumrange weapons 
he said a conventional arms agreement in the vienna negotiations 
is possible next year and the soviet union found new very 
important elements in bushs approach to a ban on chemical 
weapons he did not elaborate 
this meeting created good preconditions for reaching concrete 
results the soviet leader said 
gorbachev told the interviewer bush had shown for the first time 
interest in economic cooperation with the soviet union 
he said soviet officials watched carefully while bush and his 
advisers formed their policies toward the soviet union after last 
years election 
bush has now made a choice for broad cooperation with the soviet 
union gorbachev said i am under the impression that it is not 
just a tactical move i welcome it 
i am satisfied with the personal ties we established he

a team of israeli doctors on sunday unveiled a 
laser scanner that they said can detect certain types of cancer by 
examining a blood sample eliminating the need for surgical tests 
doctors at tel avivs ichilov hospital who began testing the 
device about two weeks ago said the cytoscan machine is still in 
an experimental stage and has an error rate of almost 5 percent 
but they said the device which needs only a syringe of blood 
for analysis could become part of routine testing for the 
detection of early signs of cancer 
its a great breakthrough that shows promise dr dan 
michaeli director of the tel aviv medical center that includes 
ichilov told reporters 
dr samarrio chaitchik head of ichilovs oncology department 
said the cytoscan could become as common as a microscope in 
several years 
he added the machine still needs to be made more accurate and 
quicker 
chaitchik said the cytoscan is too hazardous to use for 
general screening because of its error rate and he only uses the 
machine to test recovering cancer patients who are under 
observation for recurrences of the disease 
maybe in the future when we feel more confident we will use it 
for screening but this is still farfetched michaeli said i 
dont want the public going crazy lining up outside waiting to have 
their blood tested 
he said researchers estimate that improved cytoscan models would 
be able to test up to 120 blood samples in one hour but the 
machine now used at ichilov takes four to six hours to scan six 
samples 
doctors at ichilov have tested 700 postsurgery cancer patients 
with the cytoscan which has shown a 95percent success rate 
according to michaeli 
an additional 300 student volunteers were tested at tel avivs 
bar ilan university where the machine was developed and one error 
was reported 
researchers at jerusalems hadassah hospital said results of the 
cytoscans preliminary tests were not published in medical 
journals but the tests were based on wellknown technologies and 
showed a significant advancement in cancer research 
doctors using normal procedures to test for cancer take a tissue 
sample called a biopsy which is then tested by pathologists 
arye weinreb director of the reseach team that developed the 
cytoscan said testing with the device is far simpler and involves 
no surgery 
he said a small blood sample is taken from a patient and the 
lymphocytes a type of white blood cell that helps fight disease 
are separated and placed in the cytoscan 
the cells are dyed and bombarded with polarized light from a 
laser 
the cytoscans computers track and measure the individual 
reactions of thousands of different lymphocites that reveal if the 
cells have been affected by cancer 
weinreb said the device has successfully detected cancer of the 
breast colon and lung cancer but was not able to detect leukemia 
zvi rechavi the director of tamam a division of israel 
aircraft industries which produces the 175000 cytoscans said 
two machines are currently in operation at ichilov and bar ilan he 
said there are plans to produce an improved model by january 1992 
the new machines will be fully automatic and sterile 
rechavi said from the introduction of the sample into the 
machine to the end of the test the sample will not have had to be 
handled 
israel aircraft industries director mordechai hod said the 
company is looking for a partner in the united states for joint 
production 
he said the cytoscan was a spinoff from military research in 
laser technology and reflected an effort by the company to get 
involved in civilian production

israel and the soviet union have signed a 30 
million agriculture accord that may eventually lead to a major new 
market for israeli farmers the government said sunday 
agriculture minister avraham katzoz announced the deal when he 
returned from a sixday visit to moscow the first such trip by an 
israeli minister in at least 22 years he was invited by the soviet 
academy of sciences 
i have got my shoes in the door and now it is going to remain 
open he told reporters at the bengurion airport near tel aviv 
katzoz of the centerleft labor party said he met with 
members of the supreme soviet legislature and officials from the 
academy of sciences and academy of agricultural sciences 
the soviet union is not concealing this visit it wants that 
to be clear but i dont want to call it a diplomatic breakthrough 
im not working at the foreign ministry katzoz said 
the two sides signed a 30 million agreement allowing export of 
90000 tons of fresh fruits and vegetables starting with potatoes 
and ending with strawberries to the moscow region katzoz said 
he said the agreement was a barter deal in which a third party 
would sell soviet goods for hard currency and transfer it to israel 
whats happening is that they have a whole list of products 
they want to export but we dont need many of these products he 
said 
the israeli agricultural products would be transferred by soviet 
cargo planes from the bengurion airport or by soviet ships from 
the southern port of ashdod to the port of odessa on the black sea 
and then by railroad to moscow katzoz said 
asked by israels army radio when the arrangement would begin 
he said that if the soviets fulfill their promise and the first 
soviet plane would land here on dec 23 then on dec 25 the 
products will be there 
he said the agreement with the soviet union did not change much 
for israeli agriculture at present however it may eventually be 
expanded to millions tons a year and then we will have to 
plan to make another program for the israeli agriculture 
katzoz said he also signed an agreement on youth exchanges that 
would encompass about 1000 youths ages 15 to 17 from both 
countries 
the first to come would be a group of 50 soviet children who 
have suffered radiation effects during the worlds worst nuclear 
accident at the chernobyl nuclear reactor in april 1986 they will 
undergo medical tests and spend two weeks in israels kibbutzim or 
collective settlements

communist leaders named a new 
government sunday that includes noncommunists for the first time 
in 21 years but it was immediately denounced because of the large 
number of holdovers from the last cabinet 
premier ladislav adamec said the government is open to radical 
changes but opposition leaders called for a renewal of mass 
street protests and threatened a general strike if the ministers 
are not replaced in a week 
hundreds of people gathered on pragues wenceslas square in the 
night and urged people to rally monday chanting everybody here 
tomorrow 
the new government includes five noncommunists but the other 
16 members are communists and 13 served on the previous cabinet 
it failed to meet opposition demands for a noncommunist interior 
minister who is in charge of police and a civilian defense 
minister 
as he swore in the cabinet president gustav husak indicated he 
may be ready to stop down as the opposition has demanded husak 
was installed here after the crushing of reforms in 1968 and he is 
the last of those leaders still in power 
one of the governments first acts was to propose talks with 
moscow on the future of the 80000 soviet troops in czechoslovakia 
since the warsaw pact invasion that crushed the reforms 21 years 
ago 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the architect of the 
reforms sweeping eastern europe recently criticized the invasion 
the cabinet holdovers include foreign minister jaromir johanes 
criticized for defending past harsh stands on human rights and 
antonin krumnikl whose energy policies have been blamed for 
serious pollution problems 
the civic forum opposition group demanded their ouster 
first deputy premier bohumil urban announcing the appointments 
at a news conference said it was not possible to meet every demand 
but this is what life is like you cant take into account 
everybodys demands immediately he said 
striking students whose protests of police brutality at a nov 
17 demonstration sparked czechoslovakias peaceful revolt laughed 
in derision at their headquarters as they listened to the news on 
the radio 
the staterun news agency ctk reported that students decided 
they would not return to class monday as previously planned 
the new government seemed a clear attempt by the communists to 
buy time to get reform going at a pace they dictate rather than at 
the rushed tempo forced by the protests of the past two weeks 
the biggest protest occurred one week ago when millions of 
people observed calls for a twohour general strike after the 
strike adamec agreed to civic forum demands for a new government 
that would include noncommunists 
strike committees have been on alert since last weeks protest 
and workers said sunday they were ready to leave their jobs again 
its the only way for citizens to show what they want said 
peter miller a worker at pragues ckd heavy equipment 
manufacturing complex he threatened a strike dec 11 if a new 
government is not in place in a week miller also demanded free 
elections by july 
urban said sunday the government and local administrations would 
continue to be reshuffled and said new officials could be appointed 
regardless of political affiliation 
you must understand this as the start of a process he 
stressed 
jiri dienstbier spokesman for the civic forum movement said 
his group was calling another mass rally monday at wenceslas 
square the focal point of the protests that toppled longtime 
leader milos jakes and ended the communists 41year monopoly on 
power 
the opposition also seeks new laws that would anchor the 
democratic rights of assembly and free press and pave the way for 
free elections 
at its first meeting the new government condemned the 
sovietled warsaw pact invasion of 1968 which crushed a reform 
movement it appointed foreign minister johanes to negotiate with 
moscow on the future of the estimated 80000 soviet troops 
stationed in czechoslovakia ever since 
the move was clearly intended to try to win sympathy for the 
government from a population that was horrified by the invasion and 
despised the leaders installed by moscow afterward 
all except husak have since been toppled 
i dont have any ambitions to remain in my function ctk 
quoted husak as saying as he installed the new leaders he said his 
future would have to be discussed by all political parties and 
opposition groups before he made any decision 
the five noncommunist ministers in the new cabinet include 
three people without party affiliation and one man each from the 
socialist and peoples parties those parties have traditionally 
been docile allies of the communists but have become more 
independent in recent months as reforms sweep other east bloc 
countries 
the most interesting new appointment was that of nonparty man 
josef hromadka a highranking leader of czechoslovakias 
protestant church known as czech brethren who became one of seven 
deputy premiers 
deputy defense minister colgen miroslav vacek moved up to 
take over defense and frantisek pinc a politically unknown 
communist who last served as director of a nuclear power station 
got the interior ministry 
on sunday the heads of ctk and state radio lost their jobs 
according to ctk as part of the wholesale reshuffling of posts now 
going on 
premier adamec foreign minister johanes communist party chief 
karel urbanek and politburo member ondrej saling left later sunday 
for moscow where warsaw pact leaders were meeting following the 
superpower summit in malta

czechoslovaks on monday 
celebrated their first unrestricted travel in decades with 
carloads crossing into the west minutes after the borders were 
opened 
this is an indescribable feeling said jan spurny 25 as he 
and his brother dusan drove their yellow wartburg sedan onto 
austrian territory they were greeted by television lights and a 
small crowd of wellwishers with a sign reading welcome to 
austria 
minutes before austrian and czechoslovak border guards shook 
hands on the dividing line in a manifestation of friendship 
the new openborder policy went into effect at midnight sunday 
more than 100 cars had lined up at the bratislavaberg crossing 
when the barrier was lifted four minutes past midnight 
however relatively light traffic was reported at some of about 
20 road and rail crossings linking czechoslovakia with austria or 
west germany 
the communist government announced thursday that all obstacles 
to travel to the west would be removed it was among the 
concessions granted after weeks of prodemocracy demonstrations by 
hundreds of thousands of people 
the move came after the east german government spurred by 
similar mass protests announced last month it was opening its 
western borders including the berlin wall 
in this country travel regulations introduced in 1987 had made 
visits to the west easier for czechoslovaks than for most citizens 
of other sovietbloc countries but there were still formidable 
bureaucratic obstacles 
before the borders opened monday those seeking to go west 
needed a passport they also needed authorization from the police 
from their workplace or school and in some cases from local 
communist party officials to get an exit visa they also had to 
have invitations from relatives or friends in the west 
now they need only to show their passports and fill out a brief 
questionnaire giving their names addresses the country they will 
visit and the duration of their stay 
only one czechoslovak soldier was on duty at the bratislavaberg 
crossing of a twolane road when the first austriabound cars 
arrived about 10 pm 
dusan spurney 22 said im just going to drive across and 
then drive right back i just want to see if it works 
jan spurny looked at the border guard clapping his arms across 
his chest to ward off the winter chill and said hes still 
packing a submachine gun but now hes not likely to have to use 
it 
stanislav balaz his wife and their 14yearold daughter were 
heading for vienna 42 miles away balaz said it was their first 
trip to the west since they went to greece eight years ago 
maybe this is truly freedom he said

with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on monday bush is to 
inform other leaders of the north atlantic treaty organization

kohl said prospects for a closer relationship between the two 
germanys was a major topic at his meeting with bush 
he told reporters he and bush discussed in detail west germanys 
10point proposal for the eventual reunification of germany 
he said he emphasized that west germany seeks progressive 
improvements in relations with east germany and the point when two 
states might merge is completely not the issue 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said of the 
latest upheaval in the east german communist party in the 
resignation of the whole leadership there has been confirmation of 
what people have been saying in the street for months that they 
have no faith in them

the devil is alive and well hustling suckers in 
a cheap bar on nashvilles music row but he meets his match in 
billy markham something of a hustler himself willing to risk 
everything on the throw of the dice 
their contest for billys body and soul is recounted with 
ripsnorting raunchy delight in the devil and billy markham 
one half of a hilarious double bill entitled oh hell which 
opened sunday at the mitzi newhouse theater in lincoln center 
shel silverstein wrote the billy markham saga and david mamet 
contributed the second part of the evening called bobby gould in 
hell which also features a highly unusual and comic lucifer 
silversteins play is a monologue a tall tale told in verse by 
actor dennis locorriere a onetime member of the rock group dr 
hook looking like a refugee from the california gold rush 
locorriere all shaggy hair and wild beard acts sings and 
dances his way through billys various bouts with the devil and god 
himself its a pheonomenal performance not to mention a feat of 
prodigious memorization 
silverstein poet cartoonist and author of the country hit a 
boy named sue tweaks just about everybody in his short play its 
highlight is a song about the marriage of the devil to billys one 
true love the celebrity list runs from gertrude stein to grandma 
moses from caligula to eva braun for silverstein the devil 
appears to be a part of just about everybody 
in mamets equally brief oneacter the devil called the 
interrogator harasses a new arrivee named bobby gould in an 
anteroom to hell that looks like a wellappointed study its 
complete with a spiffy leather couch and walls of books only when 
he opens a backdoor can you hear the screams and see the smoke of 
hades 
bobby played with credible anxiety by treat williams keeps 
insisting he was a good man not so says the devil you were 
cruel without being interesting says satan portrayed here by an 
exasperated almost frenzied wh macy the actor is dressed like a 
walking advertising for the ll bean catalog you see lucifer has 
been called back from a fishing trip to deal with bobby and is 
mighty upset about the interruption 
bobbys spurned girlfriend felicity huffman also shows up to 
condemn him and the devil has a drudge assistant played with a 
wonderful prissy rectitude by steven goldstein to further browbeat 
the man 
the pingpong banter is sharp often quite biting and the 
production is tauntly directed by gregory mosher who uses several 
startling theatrical effects 
the devil and billy markham and bobby gould in hell 
dont exactly celebrate beelzebub but they recognize his effect on 
what people say and do and what they say and do according to 
silverstein and mamet is very very funny

an american woman arrested and 
accused of hiding weapons for leftist rebels wants to stay in el 
salvador even if it means a prison term former us attorney 
general ramsey clark said sunday 
every heart has to be somewhere and her heart chose el 
salvador clark said 
he said jennifer jean casolo a 28yearold native of thomaston 
ct is deeply committed to her work in el salvador where she 
represented an ecumenical group called christian educational 
seminars 
ms casolo was arrested and jailed on nov 26 after rebels 
launched a major offensive in san salvador authorities said an 
arms cache including more than 20000 rounds of rifle ammunition 
213 blocks of tnt detonators 106 mortar shells and other 
munitions were found buried in the yard of her rented home 
clark said he had hoped ms casolo would accept deportation 
rather than stand trial but that was not the case 
she came here from choice she stayed here from choice she 
really loves the people he said she doesnt want to go home 
clark said ms casolo is to be arraigned monday probably before 
a military tribunal 
clark was retained by ms casolos family he is not licensed to 
practice law in el salvador and said a problem will be finding a 
god lawyer willing to risk defending her 
he said it would be extremely difficult if not impossible 
for her to get a fair trial given the pressure of war and the 
governments belief that many foreigners aid the rebels 
more than a dozen foreign religious workers were detained by 
security forces in a crackdown ordered by the rightwing government 
last month during the rebel offensive most were freed with the 
condition they leave the country 
but is is believed ms casolo faces serious charges and will be 
tried by a military tribunal because of the nature of the 
accusations clark said 
he said he did not know exactly what charges would be filed 
clark said ms casolo didnt know about the munitions buried in 
the yard 
he said ms casolo moved into the house in may but was absent 
for long periods of time including the entire month of september

these are high explosives said fire chief dick meisinger 
and they are unstable now when youre talking about an unstable 
explosive who knows what could set it off dropping it kicking 
it driving over it operating a ham radio near it 
the shaped charges are considered a class c explosive the same 
designation given to fireworks such as cherry bombs meisinger said 
the explosives come in two shapes a small round metal ball about 
the size of a cherry bomb and a larger coneshaped explosive about 
the size of a standard grenade 
about 1100 of the explosives which are used in oil exploration 
and recovery were scattered over a onesquaremile area when an 
explosion followed a natural gas fire oct 30 at wire tech inc an 
oil field service company 
only 600 have been accounted for meisinger said it is not 
known how many explosives detonated in the fire 
city fire investigators attributed the blast to leaking natural 
gas that seeped from a broken gas pipe inside the building and 
ignited the explosion injured two workers destroyed the building 
forced the evacuation of about 200 people and caused more than 
600000 damage 
meisinger thinks the explosives could maim or even kill someone 
but kansas fire marshal john earhart said that although the 
shaped charges are dangerous there is no reason to panic he said 
they probably would not explode unless someone tried to detonate 
them and they are not powerful enough to kill 
i dont want to minimize the danger because if not handled 
properly they can injure people but these may not be as dangerous 
as people think he said i dont think they would detonate by 
simply stepping on one

two billionaire families more closely 
identified with the boardroom than the barnyard are facing off over 
construction of one of the most technologically advanced hog farms 
in the united states 
the bass brothers of fort worth texas are building a hog and 
cattle farm along the banks of the south platte river in 
northeastern colorados weld county that plans to raise 300000 
pigs and 10000 cattle a year 
this is something very unique says jack schneider effluent 
manager for the hog farm it has its own ecosystem utilizing as 
much nitrogen as possible to go back into grass production so we 
can raise cattle 
but downstream are the 32000acre eagles nest ranch with 700 
head of cattle owned by billionaire philip anschutz owner of 
southern pacific transportation co and the 760acre windbreak 
ranch owned by beer magnate peter h coors of adolph coors co 
they claim that national hog farms which is building the new 
farm is trying experimental farm techniques and if the experiment 
fails it could pollute their land 
the farm plans to use no antibiotics or other drugs on the 
animals which are commonly used elsewhere it also plans to spray 
waste water on the land to fertilize native grasses which in turn 
would feed cattle 
coors and anschutz are financially backing environmentalists who 
oppose the operation and have filed lawsuits in a yetunsuccessful 
attempt to block it 
weld county commissioner gene brantner calls it a duel between 
billionaires that the county wants no part of 
let them go down to the courts to decide who is right or 
wrong said brantner whose family helped settle the county and 
is featured in james micheners novel centennial 
the issues involved land and water are as old as colorado 
and important in a region that receives only 15 inches of 
precipitation annually 
also at stake are 200 jobs provided by the new hog farm a 
crucial factor in an economy that has been hit hard the past few 
years by declines in the oil industry and land values 
the farm scheduled for completion in 1992 would have its own 
weather station and sewage treatment plant trucks entering the 
farm will be disinfected and workers will be required to shower and 
change into sterile clothes before entering grown hogs will be 
transported to neighboring states for slaughter 
theyre on the leading edge doing things that havent been 
done in other places said schneider i cant say 100 percent 
sure something wont go wrong but if it does it will be minimal 
financial backers include investor robert bass whose wealth has 
been estimated by forbes magazine at 144 billion sid richardson 
bass and lee marshall bass who are valued at an estimated 125 
billion and edward perry bass at 1 billion they made their 
money in oil gas and farming 
anschutz has a net worth of 12 billion and coors owns or 
controls properties worth further millions both have refused to 
comment publicly on the battle preferring to work through 
environmental groups and the courts 
theyre worried about the 22 million gallons of waste water the 
farm will generate each day and the 24hour holding capacity in the 
sewage tanks the concern is that if those tanks fail or break 
down the wastes could wind up in the wells from which the anschutz 
and coors ranches pump their drinking water 
theyre also afraid the hog farm will harm the pheasants and 
geese they like to hunt on their property the fish they catch in 
their private ponds and the nearby riverside reservoir a refuge 
for geese and pelicans 
they point to the national hog farms operation in atkinson 
neb which has been sued five times for air pollution water 
pollution and allegedly causing pseudorabies resulting in a 
quarantine of that farms hogs 
coors and anschutz are financially backing an organization 
called protect our water which has started a petition drive to 
regulate what they say was an unforeseen development in american 
farming 
schneider admits some of the farming techniques are 
experimental but says the theories are sound 
the farm has built 16 monitoring wells to check for ground water 
contamination the weather station will have solar panels to 
monitor irrigation to match water usage the hog units will be air 
conditioned and hermetically sealed to keep out disease while 
refrigerated trucks will dispose of dead animals 
robert stovell who manages the eagle nest ranch for anschutz 
said national hog farms also tried experimental techniques in 
nebraska and some of those failed 
schneider acknowledged there have been problems in nebraska 
most stemming from the use of lagoon drainage for wastes he said 
the company learned a lot from those mistakes and corrected the 
problems in the new operation 
stovell acknowledged that the south platte river a main focus 
of the current battle already is polluted partly from cattle 
operations farther upstream 
were not totally opposed to the company in this case if they 
set up adequate handling facilities thats fine stovell said 
stovell said he will continue his petition drive and lawsuits 
against the operation although he hasnt had much luck because the 
facility meets county regulations 
stovell said stricter regulations dont exist because no one 
foresaw scientific corporate farms like this he wants county 
regulations changed to control the amount of wastes that can be 
released

ej brach amp sons inc caterer to americas 
sweet tooth for 85 years wants to make its candy with foreign 
sugar which is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of competitors 
who must use more costly domestic supplies 
brachs bid carries a heavy threat if the commerce department 
doesnt allow it to buy foreign sugar the illinois company says it 
may close its aging factory in a poor chicago neighborhood taking 
3500 jobs elsewhere 
but if brach wins candy makers claim it will have a remarkable 
advantage over the rest of the industry because sugar from abroad 
sells for about a dime less per pound than domestic versions 
resulting in an annual savings to brach of about 20 million 
a public comment period on brachs proposal was to expire nov 
21 but the issue has left other candy makers so sour the commerce 
department extended the period to the end of the year 
the essential issue here is one of fairness nestle foods 
corp of purchase ny said in a letter to the commerce 
departments foreigntrade zones board 
if brachs application is granted applications from other 
similarly situated manufacturers should receive equal treatment 
nestle said 
other competitors of brach which is owned by jacobs suchard 
ltd of switzerland let their emotions spill 
we find this request for special status by a foreignowned 
company to be insulting said joel inc of elizabethtown pa 
parent of pennsylvanias simon candy co they already own the 
lionshare of the market and now they seek the aid of the 
department of commerce in running the rest of us out of business 
lousy management of brach wrote powells fine candies inc 
of hopkins minn should not be subsidized by actions of our 
government or its agencies 
brach president ron habijanac countered its not a sugar 
issue its a social issue this is 3500 jobs weve got a cost 
problem 
the government is very protective of the domestic sugar 
industry it will allow only 249 million tons of raw sugar into 
the united states between jan 1 1989 and sept 30 1990 
by comparison the agriculture department predicts us planters 
will produce 7 million tons during the fiscal year that began oct 
1 
acting on brachs behalf the illinois international port 
district filed an application with the foreigntrade zones board on 
sept 26 requesting that brachs factory be designated a 
foreigntrade subzone which would exempt the company from 
quota restriction on foreign sugar 
the request will be decided by the foreigntrade zones board 
which is comprised of commerce secretary robert a mosbacher 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady and army secretary richard l 
armitage 
a special committee is investigating the issues in the case and 
a decision by the board is not expected for several months 
the lobbying however has begun 
mosbacher has received letters of support from illinois gov 
james r thompson chicago mayor richard m daley illinois sens 
alan dixon and paul simon and rep dan rostenkowski the powerful 
chicago democrat who is the chief taxwriter in the house 
i am enough of a realist to know how tall an order this is for 
the foreigntrade zones board the history of proposals for sugar 
operations is familiar to both of us rostenkowski told 
mosbacher 
you might be advised to reject the idea out of hand i hope 
you will resist that advice he wrote 
the teamsters union which represents brach workers also 
supports the companys position 
the brach tradition in chicago is as rich as its chocolate 
in 1904 german immigrant emil brach invested his life savings 
in a small store and called it brachs palace of sweets that store 
grew into the huge factory on chicagos west side where tons of 
chocolate starlight mints jelly candies and licorice items are 
produced each week 
three years ago brach was sold to jacobs suchard an 
international food conglomerate flush with cash 
brachs critics say jacobs suchard knew the risks of acquiring 
an antiquated factory with a large work force when it paid hundreds 
of millions of dollars for the company 
look what we bought was an excellent brand name in the united 
states habijanac said in an interview from chicago you always 
have surprises when you buy a company you understand there are 
challenges

the french company that bought pennwalt 
corp in october plans to make philadelphia the headquarters for 
its north american chemical operations but pennwalt will lose its 
name in the process 
atochem sa the international chemical arm of societe 
nationale elf aquitaine said that next month it would combine its 
three us chemical businesses including philadelphiabased 
pennwalt and call the new subsidiary atochem north america 
the subsidiary will generate annual sales of 15 billion a year 
and employ about 5000 company officials said friday 
i believe this is a very positive and exciting step for 
atochem jacques puechal who oversees atochems global 
operations told employees 
it is good news for philadelphia to become the home base of a 
larger entity pennwalt has played an important role in the 
business civic and cultural life of the city 
before the meeting puechal said atochem was consolidating 
operations to ease internal communication among three businesses 
and to better serve customers 
philadelphia was chosen as the headquarters site because 
pennwalt represented the largest of the companys three north 
american operations and would involve displacing the least amount 
of workers he said 
as part of the aquisition agreement pennwalt was supposed to 
keep its name which the 139yearold company traces to its 
original name of pennsylvania salt co 
seymour s preston iii who has been pennwalts president and 
chief operating officer and who will head the reorganized business 
in the same capacity told employees that he and other members of 
the planning committee had spent substantial time and effort and 
emotion wrestling with the name change 
the committee chose atochem north america because the name 
offers the greatest recognition worldwide for the business he said 
absent from the new lineup of executives was edwin e tuttle 
who has led pennwalt as chairman and chief executive officer for 11 
years he said he would be vice chairman of the new firm until it 
got in its feet and would then retire 
in all about 75 positions will be eliminated from the 
companies preston said but the consolidation will bring to 
philadelphia area at least 150 new jobs officials said most of 
the jobs will be located at pennwalts headquarters about 450 
employees work there now 
preston said the company would look for ways for the new company 
to become more efficient he did not rule out further reductions in 
employment but said that might be achieved through attrition

local businessman don tomaso is milking a 
combination of nostalgia and convenience by offering suburbanites a 
taste of what life was like when dairy products were homedelivered 
in glass bottles 
thousands of suburban families are returning to days of old when 
milk was left on the front porch 
tomaso his wife shirley and their two sons started a home 
milk delivery business last spring using direct mail advertising 
to pitch their product 
weve been wildly successful far beyond our wildest 
expectations the wisconsin businessman said 
tomasos wife estimated the family has close to 1000 customers 
in chicagos northern suburbs who have milk in glass bottles 
other dairy products and even freshsqueezed orange juice placed in 
blue boxes on their porches 
tomaso buys his products from oberweis dairy in aurora which 
has four other vendors delivering milk in suburban cook and dupage 
counties 
home milk delivery kind of died out for a long period of time 
but its coming back particularly to the doubleincome families 
that like the convenience of having milk delivered said elaine 
oberweis president of oberweis dairy 
oberweis hung in while other small dairies and home deliverers 
succumbed to competition from supermarkets government price 
controls and the growth of the softdrink industry mrs oberweis 
said 
the company plans to expand home delivery after years of 
dropping sales she said 
the milkdelivery companies say they can operate at a healthy 
profit each vendor seems to have his own system some sell the 
products at store prices but add a service charge of 1 for each 
delivery while others charge 10 cents to 75 cents more per product 
tomaso said nostalgia might be a factor in the milkmans return 
but other factors come into play as well 
part of the nostalia trip would be to be out there with a 
horse but nostalgia only goes so far he said it has to taste 
good too 
convenience appears to be a top reason for most customers 
frank and patricia turkot moved to wheaton from new yorks long 
island about six years ago and said their four children who 
consume about five gallons of milk each week made milk buying a 
continuous chore 
this is a lot more convenient mrs turkot said of the milk 
delivery service she added that she thinks the milk tastes better 
too 
i dont know what it is she said i guess its that the 
cardboard has a funny taste and with the glass bottles you dont 
get that

chinas communist party has issued a resounding 
rejection of private ownership saying public ownership has become 
an irreversible trend 
in a ringing endorsement of orthodox marxist ideology the party 
newspaper peoples daily lambasted the most cherished of capitalist 
principles 
can paradise be found in capitalist countries absolutely 
not the paper said in a lengthy commentary saturday 
political regimes that are based on privatized economies breed 
all forms of corruption the peoples daily said the innate 
character of the bourgeois dictatorship of capitalist private 
ownership is a dictatorship of the rich minority over a poor 
majority 
in 1848 karl marx summarized the theory of communism in a single 
phrase eradicating private ownership the peoples daily said 
for half a century many countries under the leadership of 
communist parties have established the great struggle of public 
ownership to wipe out privatization and this has become an 
irreversible historical trend it said 
chinas communist party stepped up its calls to adhere to strict 
marxist doctrine and reject bourgeois liberalism or western 
ideas following the shortlived prodemocracy movement this spring 
the studentled movement sought political reforms but widened to 
call for increased freedoms including better education a less 
controlled economy and higher wages 
after the movement was violently crushed by the chinese army 
leaving hundreds dead top leaders orchestrated a return to 
doctrinaire slogans ordering the mass media to follow the 
communist party line and selectively report positive news 
government leaders have also rejected political pluralism and have 
continued to crackdown on political dissent 
the paper said those who support private ownership claim that 
chinese yearn to leave the country for overseas even agreeing to 
be thirdrate citizens of other nations 
this is pure rumor peoples daily said most chinese 
people studying or working abroad love their homeland 
thousands of chinese overseas however do seek ways to remain 
abroad rather than return to china where they face lowpaying jobs 
which they may not be able to choose and drab living conditions 
us diplomats in beijing say that more than 90 percent of 
chinese who go to study in the united states do not come back
