electric stun gun three years ago 
in addition a former officer was convicted of beating of the 
man at his home and a suspended lieutenant was found guilty of 
abetting the beating 
the defendants were among several police officers from the same 
queens precinct implicated in 1985 in the alleged torture of drug 
suspects with the stun gun which delivers a powerful temporarily 
disabling jolt of up to 40000 volts 
everton evelyn had testified that four officers beat him in his 
home in 1985 and that two of them had later used a stun gun on him 
at the station holding him down and giving him shocks from the 
handheld device 
the 34yearold taxi driver testified that the stun gun was used 
on his abdomen seven to 10 times for five seconds at a time he has 
also filed a 50 million lawsuit against the city and the police 
department 
former sgt richard pike and suspended officer loren maccary 
were convicted of assault official misconduct and coercion and 
could receive up to seven years in prison 
jeffrey gilbert a former officer was convicted of the same 
charges in the beating suspended lt steven cheswick who

attack maccary was convicted in the stun gun attack and gilbert 
was found guilty in the beating 
cheswick prosecutors said had blocked evelyns wife from 
aiding her husband during the beating and had not tried to stop the 
beating 
the four defendants will be sentenced march 29 
the trial was the second of four scheduled for officers of the 
106th precinct who allegedly tortured suspects with stun guns in 
1985 pike and gilbert already are serving two to six years for 
their convictions in the first trial in 1986

the senate launched a fullfledged 
filibuster tuesday as majority leader robert byrd ordered 24hour 
sessions to subdue republican opposition to a democratic campaign 
financing bill 
the talking broken by occasional roll calls began about 2 pm 
and continued into the night appointments were canceled schedules 
revised senators began catching up on paperwork and cots were set 
up in rooms near the chamber 
shortly after 11 pm the democrats used their numbers to 
approve a rarelyused motion ordering the sergeantatarms to take 
to the streets to arrest senators who had been absent from a series 
of quorum calls 
democrats said the move was made because republicans were taking 
turns holding the floor forcing democrats to stay close by the 
chamber to prevent the loss of a quorum which would immediately 
end the session 
byrd lacking the votes to prevent republicans from stalling 
action on the legislation threatened to keep the senate in session 
indefinitely 
weve decided well just go aroundtheclock the west 
virginia democrat said at midafternoon after republican and 
democratic negotiators reported making no progress on the central 
question of spending limits 
were going to talk or were going to vote said byrd 
warning that foes of the campaign finance legislation would have to 
keep control of the floor to prevent a vote 
democrats and republicans have been at loggerheads for nearly a 
year over a democratic bill with 52 cosponsors that would set up a 
system of voluntary spending limits for senate general election 
campaigns 
the limit would be from 950000 to 55 million depending on a 
states population the bills supporters say limits are needed to 
put a brake on the increasing cost of getting elected up from an 
average of 600000 in 1976 to 3 million in 1986 
in larger states growing numbers of candidates are spending 
more than 10 million to win a senate seat with increasing amounts 
of campaign funds being supplied by specialinterest political 
action committees 
a candidate observing the voluntary limit would get campaign 
funds from the treasury if the opponent exceeded the limit or an 
independent group spent large amounts of money against the 
candidate 
republicans who have made opposition to limits a party issue 
succeeded last year in preventing the senate from voting on the 
legislation winning a record seven cloture votes during 22 days of 
floor time 
byrd even with the support of three of the senates 46 
republicans is believed to be five votes short of the 60 needed to 
cut off debate and force a vote on the bill 
the senate is in a fullfledged filibuster said byrd 
adding that he would no longer confine debate to daylight hours 
theres no point in continuing the casual gentlemanly 
goodguy filibuster because it will just turn out like it did last 
year he said lets have it on the floor where the american 
people can see it 
four democrats and four republicans have been negotiating since 
last week they reported progress on some facets of the bill but 
not on spending limits which republicans say will discriminate 
against them in states with a heavy democratic edge in registered 
votes 
the chief negotiators said their positions on the key issue were 
solid 
a limit on spending is something this side is not going to 
agree to said mitch mcconnell rky that is not one of the 
negotiable items 
his counterpart david boren dokla was just as adamant 
any bill that does not limit campaign spending would not be real 
reform 
boren said however that democrats are willing to discuss 
higher spending limits in states where their party enjoys a big 
advantage in registration or historically has dominated 
congressional elections 
there was no public response from mcconnell who said 
republicans were willing to discuss compromise on another 
democratic demand putting a ceiling on how much money a candidate 
can get from political action committees 
boren and mcconnell said negotiators had neared informal 
agreement on other issues including controling how much personal 
money a millionare can put into his or her campaign requiring 
broadcasters to charge rockbottom rates for political ads better 
disclosure of money going to political parties and getting 
controls on socalled soft money which includes groups like 
labor unions supplying people to help candidates with canvassing 
and phone banks

india is taking the bullockcart into 
the 21st century 
at least 500 researchers in about a dozen governmentaided 
institutes are at work modernizing the ancient creaking plodding 
carts and even the world bank has donated funds carts of various 
shapes and designs made of plastic and aluminum are being tested 
or have been developed 
there is nothing funny about our project said mittar pal 
dhir director of the road research institute in new delhi for 
us animaldrawn carts are of great importance 
india has an estimated 13 million bullock carts drawn by about 
26 million of the neutered bulls along with 2 million carts pulled 
by water buffaloes camels horses mules and donkeys 
the carts are seen most often in villages where about 640 
million of the indias 800 million people live 
but they also are seen on major highways and an estimated 3 
million plod along city streets often slowing enginepowered 
traffic and infuriating motorists 
bullock carts have even been used to pull mig fighter jets to 
parades and earth satellites to launching pads 
dhir said it would be 50 years before india could eliminate 
animaldrawn carts given their crucial role in indian life 
capital investment in animaldrawn carts is put at 76 billion 
more than 20 million indians earn their living by driving 
renting and repairing the carts 
the figure is striking given the fact that indian railways 
the fourth largest in the world employ only 163 million people 
said rupinder gupta a mechanical engineer for the road research 
institute gupta has designed six types of bullock cart for field 
trials 
each year animaldrawn carts move 144 million tonmiles of 
freight 
dhir estimates that indias animaldrawn carts provide about 40 
million horsepower equal to about 320000 mediumduty trucks used 
in the united states as city delivery vehicles 
without bullock carts india also would have had to import an 
additional 6 million tons of fuel each year it now imports 17 
million tons of crude oil annually 
one of the innovations is the replacement of the carts 
woodenspoke wheels with pneumatic tires 
engineer gupta said carts with pneumatic tires can pull 25 tons 
of weight against the maximum capacity of 15 tons for conventional 
carts 
researchers in the southern state of karnataka also have come up 
with plastic bullock carts and in neighboring andhra pradesh state 
a tire company has produced carts of lightweight aluminum 
another idea behind nonwooden carts is to reduce demand for 
lumber an estimated 165000 mediumsized trees are felled each 
year to make conventional carts 
so you see there is a solid logic behind metal carts said 
gupta 
he listed other reasons for updating the carts 
we want to increase tillage and output reduce damage to roads 
and injury to animals so that the poor animals can have a longer 
lifespan he said 
to protect the animals curved and padded yokes are being 
introduced studies have shown that some draft animals lives are 
cut short by cancerous infections on the neck from unpadded and 
uncurved yokes 
reflectors are being added as another safety feature 
other new fittings are bush bearings castiron springs shock 
absorbers draw bars that adjust for animals of different height 
and mud scrappers 
a fodder box can be put on carts that go long distances 
as for road damage director dhir said the biggest culprit is 
wooden wheels 
in monetary terms the annual damage is to the tune of 7000 
million rupees 538 million to the roads he said 
farmers seem to like the idea of improving bullock carts 
it is an excellent idea said jhandu singh 64 of jharsa a 
village 30 miles south of new delhi 
but this should have had been done 25 years ago we have 
suffered for long and so did the animals 
officials too say the new carts are catching on but this 
itself is creating problems 
we do not have enough new types of carts for all said kalle 
khan project economist of the district rural development agency in 
jharsa whose office received only 16 new carts 
there are more than 200 claimants even some gypsies saw the 
carts and were attracted they wanted at least one i told them no 
these are for farmers 
another reason for high demand is that the government is 
subsidizing the price by about 35 percent 
it is estimated that the largest of the old wooden carts costs 
the equivalent of about 300 newer wooden carts without the 
government subsidy cost 270 to 460 the plastic and aluminum 
carts are 25 percent more expensive

the town that was mao tsetungs civil war 
haven in remote northwest china is struggling to catch up with a 
revolution that left it behind when the communist party leadership 
marched out 40 years ago to triumph 
the caves mao called home in yenans arid mountains are 
preserved much as he left them the spartan desks and bedstands 
still in place 
since then yenans population has grown from 10000 to 80000 
and a smattering of eight and 10story concrete apartment blocks 
give the town an urban air but the lives of most of its residents 
have changed little compared with the rest of china 
twothirds of yenans people still live in caves in the steep 
brown cliffs overlooking two narrow rivers that meet at yenan 
the cavedwellers fetch water from nearby wells and grind their 
grain using oldstyle millstones turned by donkey or by hand they 
cook on coal stoves that also heat the family sleeping platform 
the kang 
the caves have electricity but few people have major electrical 
appliances 
the average annual per capita income of yenans peasants is 59 
less than half the national average and barely above the official 
poverty level of 54 nonpeasants average 108 a year compared 
with a national figure of 248 
the communist revolution was intended to free the peasants from 
the whims of nature and those in power but in yenan nature has 
been stingy and those in power are far away 
we rely on heaven for food said lei zhifu a former 
guerrilla leader and retired communist party official quoting an 
ancient saying about chinas dependence on nature 
mao who arrived here in 1937 at the end of the long march a 
6000mile retreat from chiang kaisheks nationalist troops left 
yenan in 1947 as the countrys civil war raged he never returned 
premier chou enlai returned briefly in 1973 to attend the 
opening of a revolutionary museum he ordered that small factories 
be set up with central government help to supplement the 
perennially droughtstricken areas meager agricultural income 
the factories were built fertilizer steel cement and textiles 
among others but nothing was done to ensure that their products 
reached markets 
only one narrow twisting road and three weekly flights link 
yenan to the outside world the nearest big city xian is more 
than 185 miles to the south an eighthour trip by car 
since 1985 beijing has moved to end yenans isolation by 
providing more than 54 million toward construction of a railroad 
tracks have been laid nearly halfway from xian to yenan and plans 
are to finish by 1990 
theres a snag 43 million more is needed to build the final 
stretch li guanhua deputy director of yenans planning 
commission said he expected beijing to provide at least part 
even with a railroad lis plans for yenans future are modest 
he envisioned gradual growth fueled by wider sales for the towns 
factories especially its leading industry cigarettes 
lu derong the cigarette factorys deputy director said theyll 
double production to 64 million packs a year once the railroad is 
finished 
the workers earn an average of 405 a year making them the best 
paid in town 
but the railroad is unlikely to help the 200employee match 
factory next door already hard hit by competition from larger 
mechanized factories elsewhere 
it shut down for 10 months last year because it had no money to 
buy wood for matches yenan officials finally loaned it 27000 
enough to reopen but not to buy modern machinery that would make it 
competitive 
elsewhere in china stateowned factories that lose money are 
being closed or leased to entrepreneurs under top leader deng 
xiaopings decadeold program to stimulate the economy and reduce 
central controls 
but li said no one in yenan has enough money to lease the 
match factory and it cant be shut officials said because the 
workers need the jobs 
yenans agriculture also needs massive investment in the form 
of irrigation canals to significantly raise production with less 
than 16 inches of rain annually yields are less than half those in 
chinas lush southeast 
no efforts are made to encourage the one industry for which 
yenan is historically equipped tourism more than 50 hotels are 
under construction in xian alone as part of a nationwide tourism 
boom but yenan offers only five small guest houses 
xian site of the ancient city of changan is known for its 
temples and tombs its biggest attraction is the thousands of 
lifesize terra cotta warriors built more than 2000 years ago to 
guard the tomb of emperor qin shi huangdi who united china 
of the 80000 visitors to maos old headquarters every year 
only about 500 are foreigners who bring far more money than 
chinese 
yenans dustcovered streets are uninviting and things are 
sleepy 
even a confirmed marxist like lei zhifu said he attends 
ceremonies at the local buddhist temple for excitement

a judge in oregon makes some convicts buy newspaper ads to 
apologize slumlords in california and new york are sentenced to 
live in their own buildings in new jersey executives convicted of 
securities violations are ordered to read up on ethics and write 
reports 
such innovations are sometimes motivated by overflowing jails 
but in other cases are intended to tailor the punishment to the 
crime 
on tuesday for instance circuit judge stuart nudelman in 
chicago sentenced a white man convicted of threatening blacks to do 
200 hours of community service with the national assocaition for 
the advancement of colored people 
hes going to learn how to be a responsible human being 
nudelman said in sentencing james kalafut 22 who was part of a 
group of whites and hispanics who menaced two blacks with baseball 
bats and bottles last year 
last month anne arundel county in maryland joined a growing 
number of jurisdictions that are using electronic gadgets to 
enforce nonjail sentences the countys program for repeat drunken 
driving offenders calls for them to continue working but turn over 
onefourth of their pay to the county and spend their free time 
exclusively at home 
to make sure they do television cameras are installed in the 
homes and a jailer calls at random times to make sure the subject 
is at home 
there simply isnt enough room in the detention center to lock 
everyone up explains district judge thomas j curley who 
envisions expanding the program to include those convicted of drug 
abuse petty thievery or battery 
the obvious selling point is the cost said richard grinter 
president of program monitor inc the dallasbased firm contracts 
with government agencies to operate monitoring systems and charges 
7 per case per day 
program monitor has only 45 cases in texas now and isnt making 
money grinter said tuesday but he said a state commission 
estimated in 1986 that as many as 6000 prisoners might be suitable 
for electronic monitoring 
program monitor provided the hardware to monitor a new york 
landlord morris gross who was convicted of multiple building 
violations and sentenced to live in one of his buildings in 
brooklyn he was released last week after spending eight days in 
his newly plastered and painted apartment in the rundown building 
a similar sentence was imposed last year on dr milton avol a 
beverly hills neurosurgeon convicted of numerous violations in 
buildings he owned 
in other recent cases 
multimillionaire industrialist victor posner who pleaded no 
contest to evading more than 12 million in federal taxes was 
sentenced on feb 12 to work 5000 hours of community service over 
the next five years 
us district judge eugene spellman also ordered the 69yearold 
financier to pay 4 million in back taxes and penalties and 
contribute 3 million to programs for the homeless the maximum 
sentence for the conviction was in excess of 40 years in prison 
at your age i doubt youd be in jail more than six to nine 
months regardless of the sentence spellman said 
a city judge in charleston wva ordered a man convicted of 
destroying a newspaper vending box to spend the next month guarding 
its replacement christopher a jones 25 was sentenced to stand 
watch from 7 pm to 3 am for 30 days 
last september us district judge dickinson r debevoise in 
newark nj sentenced four former executives of a collapsed 
securities brokerage to read six books about suffering and 
afflicted people and submit reports after serving prison terms of 
up to 2 years 
the executives had pleaded guilty to charges in connection with 
the collapse of bevill bresler amp schulman inc they testified 
against a fifth executive who was convicted and sentenced to eight 
years in prison 
among the assigned books were john steinbecks the grapes of 
wrath biographies of george washington and martin luther king 
and working your way to the botton the feminization of 
poverty 
in lincoln county ore district attorney ulys stapleton 
began a program two years ago requiring convicts to apologize for 
their crimes in community newspapers one of the first ads was 
placed by a former sheriffs detective convicted of possessing a 
controlled substance 
sometimes the experiments dont pan out 
district judge dorothy baker in portland ore gained national 
attention when she sentenced child molester richard j bateman to 
post signs on his house and car warning dangerous sex offender 
no children allowed 
bateman 47 later dropped out of sight for three weeks was 
rearrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison 
georgia won an innovation in government award from the ford 
foundation last year in recognition of its comprehensive program to 
provide alternatives to jail time 
the state has about 18500 prison inmates but 109000 other 
convicts have been placed in programs ranging from basic probation 
to boot campstyle life in a diversion center to 90day shock 
incarceration for offenders aged 17 to 25 
shock incarceration is intended convince violators who havent 
been in prison before that they dont want to come back a study in 
1986 found that 23 percent of those who went through shock 
incarceration committed further crimes compared to 22 percent for 
the general prison population said larry anderson coordinator of 
the states diversion programs 
at first blush you are prone to say there is no appreciable 
difference anderson said tuesday but the other way of looking 
at it is that we can give someone a 90day prison experience as 
opposed to an experience that may last for years and do no worse 
in other words the state gets the same results for less money 
in the diversion centers where the state can accommodate up to 
750 people prisoners work during the day and pay 650 a day for 
board and room thus the states cost is 2750 a day compared to 
37 day for each prison inamte anderson said 
the state also has an intenive probation program in which 
probationers have to meet four times a week with an officer that 
program is selfsupporting because judges may impose fees up to 
50 a month as part of the sentence anderson said 
in 1982 anderson said 63 percent of criminal convicts in 
georgia received a probated sentence in 1985 that had increased 
to 73 percent 
if you look at 1981 the state of georgia had the highest 
percapita incarceration rate in the united states it exceeded the 
incarceration rate of the soviet union and the union of south 
africa he said 
we began putting our emphasis on alternative programs in 1982 
and by 1985 we had dropped down to no 11 in percapita 
incarceration rates 
the real issue now he emphasized is that we cannot 
afford to build any more prisons

two men were dead valuable manuscripts had 
changed hands false names were involved 
the mystery was solved tuesday as columbia university announced 
that it had been given the papers of ellery queen the dashing 
uppercrust detective whose adventures helped elevate american 
detective fiction to an art form 
ellery queen was created by brooklynborn cousins frederic 
dannay and manfred b lee who entered a 1928 mystery contest that 
required a pseudonym 
they invented queen and made him both author and protagonist 
thinking an author would be better remembered if his name appeared 
throughout the book 
more than 40 ellery queen novels were written before lee died in 
1971 his partner dannay died in 1982 and dannays sons richard 
and douglas gave the ellery queen papers to columbia 
the manuscripts show that lee and dannay often were at odds over 
their work with intense disagreements and personality clashes 
there are extensive revisions in one case 50 pages were deleted 
from a novel 
were not so much collaborators as competitors it has 
produced a sharper edge dannay once said 
the 25000item collection includes the only surviving 
manuscript of the first ellery queen novel the roman hat 
mystery and the notes outlines and corrected manuscripts of the 
last a fine and private place 
also included are letters and manuscripts of dashiell hammett 
cornell woolrich john dickson carr agatha christie and others 
whose work already can be found in columbias archive of mystery 
and detective writing 
the ellery queen novels led to a series of movies radio and 
television shows and to ellery queens mystery magazine which 
first appeared in 1941 and is still published monthly 
the ellery queen archives include the first issue of the 
magazine along with manuscripts from such contributors as william 
faulkner 
selections from the archives will be on exhibit at columbias 
butler library from march 3 to july 6

repeat drunken drivers convicted in a new 
program are being allowed to keep their jobs but as soon as the 
whistle blows they must go home stay home and stay sober big 
brother will be watching and calling 
anne arundel county has invested 15000 in 30 video monitoring 
systems which are installed in offenders homes and linked by 
telephone lines to a master control in the county jail 
under the program launched jan 26 offenders are not watched 
all the time but they never know when a jail officer will call and 
ask them to step before the camera 
a lot of people say i got off easy but youre stopped in your 
tracks at the front door said one of the first four men 
sentenced under the program a threetime offender who agreed to be 
interviewed on condition his name not be used its not exactly a 
slap on the wrist but its better than sitting in jail 
for this offender the hardest part of the program is turning 
over 336 a month onefourth of his salary to the county during 
his 90day sentence its a big dent in our pocket said his 
wife 
an operator at the the jail dials each offender once and often 
twice a night and instructs him to turn on the video equipment and 
stand in front of the camera 
the county also has purchased handheld breath analyzers to make 
sure the offender is complying with a judges nodrinking 
stipulation the equipment displays alcohol levels in bright red 
numerals that can be read over the tv monitor 
house detainees also are required to turn over onequarter of 
their takehome pay to the county if an offenders home doesnt 
have an adequate telephone jack he has to pay for one 
violation of any condition brings a jail sentence 
john sellers government marketing coordinator for mitsubishi 
electric said the visitel system has been used in several states 
to monitor probationers but he said anne arundel county is 
apparently the first to use the system as an alternative to prison 
sentences 
at least 11 manufacturers are marketing systems according to 
the national institute of justice 
the program has been endorsed by the local chapter of mothers 
against drunk driving jean heald president of the group said 
that when the program is combined with an alcohol counseling 
program it may help make highways safer 
were hopeful sending them to jail we know doesnt work 
said ms heald who said the program is in keeping with a 
philosophy of punishment for the crime treatment for the disease 
and monitoring for the citizen 
county officials plan to review the program in the next few 
weeks and decide whether to buy 90 additional monitors this smmer 
district judge thomas j curley drug users petty thieves and 
those convicted of minor battery charges are also likely candidates 
for house detention 
asked if he expects public opposition curley was frank are 
you kidding nothing is ever tough enough for them but i have to 
live in the real world 
house detention is an alternative to paying up to 40 a day to 
keep a prisoner in the county jail as well as putting off the cost 
of constructing new prisons 
there simply isnt enough room in the detention center to lock 
everyone up said curley 
electronically enforced homedetention programs have expanded 
rapidly since the first reported test in albuquerque nm in 1983 
as of last february according to the national institute of 
justice an arm of the us justice department 53 housedetention 
programs in 21 states electronically monitored more than 800 
offenders most programs rely on electronic bracelets that signal 
when an offender has strayed from home 
the institute reported that offenders in such programs tended to 
be males under the age of 30 about onethird were convicted of 
serious traffic violations particularly drunken driving another 
large category included parolees and probationers

foreign minister shimon peres 
on tuesday denounced as complete nonsense a memo that described 
plans to funnel millions of dollars to his labor party for 
assurances that israel would not bomb a proposed iraqi pipeline 
the 1985 memo made public monday was addressed to us 
attorney general edwin meese iii and written by e robert wallach 
a longtime meese friend and lawyer for swiss oilman bruce 
rappaport a partner in the pipeline project 
the 1 billion pipeline was to have carried oil from iraq 
through jordan to the gulf of aqaba but was never built 
israeli officials all agreed that we favored the laying of the 
pipeline so why would anyone need to use bribes peres told 
reporters during a tour of the occupied west banks largest city 
i dont understand this 
however peres through a spokesman in jerusalem acknowledged 
tuesday that the israeli government had been offered a discount on 
oil purchases amounting to 65 million to 70 million a year in 
return for approving the pipeline the washington post reported in 
wednesdays editions 
but the aide said that peres did not take the offer seriously 
and failed to pass it on to colleagues the newspaper said he said 
the offer was made by rappaport but there was no proposal for 
paying part of the discount to peres party the post reported 
an israeli military analyst on tuesday told the associated press 
it would not have been in israels interest to destroy the pipeline 
because israel has sought a dialogue with iraq to counter growing 
hostility from iran 
the memo said rappaport confirmed the arrangement with peres 
to the effect that israel will receive somewhere between 65 
million and 70 million a year for 10 years out of the conclusion 
of the project 
what also was indicated to me wallach wrote to meese and 
which would be denied everywhere is that a portion of those funds 
will go directly to labor 
the memo is central to a criminal investigation of meese at 
issue is whether meese knew of a possibly improper payment plan 
involving the labor party and if so why he did nothing about it 
in a handwritten note from peres to meese also made public 
monday the israeli leader said of the pipeline project i would 
go a long way to help it out but then discretion is demanded on 
our part 
asked about the wallachmeese memo peres said no one said he 
gave the labor party anything or proposed anything to the labor 
party as far as im concerned its complete nonsense 
earlier a foreign ministry aide close to peres told the 
associated press mr peres did not see a penny out of this and 
neither did the labor party 
we repeatedly have denied the whole story he said speaking 
on condition of anonymity no money was offered to mr peres and 
if it had been he would have thrown the man out the window 
another ministry official told the ap that several cabinet 
ministers privately discussed the pipeline project but no decision 
about israels position was ever made 
dore gold a researcher at tel aviv universitys jaffee center 
for strategic studies said bombing the project would not have been 
in israels interest but iraq probably sought as many assurances 
as possible regarding a pipeline that would come so close to 
israeli borders 
gold said israel has sought to open a dialogue with iraq to 
counter growing hostility from iran following that countrys 1979 
islamic fundamentalist revolution 
for example israel several years ago made an offer to iraq to 
reactivate a pipeline built in the 1930s from the iraqi city kirkuk 
to the israeli port city of haifa gold said iraq never responded 
to the offer 
but zeev eytan another jaffee center researcher said israel 
had good reason to oppose the iraqi pipeline because it would have 
turned the jordanian city of aqaba into an oil port and destroyed 
the economic base of the neighboring israeli resort elat 
said eytan we need this like we need stones in the occupied 
territories

saturdays have the right to cast absentee ballots in elections held 
on saturdays a federal judge ruled 
in a case arising from west virginias march 5 constitutional 
amendment election us district judge william m kidd issued a 
preliminary injunction tuesday in favor of two seventhday 
adventists who had been told they could not submit absentee ballots 
for the saturday voting 
the ruling also affects jews seventhday baptists and members 
of other religious groups who believe that they should not 
participate in any civic business governmental or nonessential 
work on saturdays 
karen and howard conner school bus drivers in barbour county 
contended that because of their religious beliefs they were being 
deprived of their right to vote on a proposed amendment that would 
establish a statewide property tax for education 
west virginia usually holds elections on tuesdays but moved 
this one to saturday in hopes of boosting turnout the election was 
set after a state court ruled that the state must equalize spending 
among school systems 
the conners were told by the secretary of states office that 
they did not qualify for absentee voting under state law they then 
filed suit in state court against secretary of state ken hechler 
and barbour county circuit clerk jean green 
the state supreme court earlier this month refused to hear the 
case so the conners took it to the federal court 
kidd ordered hechler to submit by friday a plan outlining 
measures to be taken to ensure that plaintiffs and members of this 
class are permitted to vote in the forthcoming election

fbi agents illegally interrogated a suspected 
lebanese terrorist about a 1985 airplane hijacking when they kept 
him aboard a navy ship four days after his arrest in the 
mediterranean a federal judge says 
sharply critical of the fbis arrest and interrogation of fawaz 
younis us district judge barrington d parker on tuesday ruled 
that oral and written confessions were obtained illegally from the 
defendant 
the judge suppressed the statements as evidence against younis 
who is charged with leading five armed men who hijacked a royal 
jordanian airliner on june 11 1985 at beirut international 
airport the trial is scheduled to begin march 22 before parker 
the operation occurred after former fbi director william h 
webster had moved on to head the cia and before william sessions 
the bureaus current head took office last fall 
defense lawyer francis d carter said he was pleased with the 
decision but conceded it wont necessarily help younis case 
prosecutors have a variety of other evidence including a videotape 
of younis delivering a statement to reporters before the plane was 
blown up in the background 
oliver revell the bureaus executive assistant director 
participated in the arrest of younis last sept 13 in waters off 
cyprus 
parker concluded that fractures younis suffered on both wrists 
were sustained when he was grabbed by two agents and slammed onto 
the deck of an fbichartered yacht to which he had been lured by 
the prospect of a drug deal 
throbbing pain from the fractured wrists sea sickness and the 
lack of proper medical treatment placed him at a distinct 
disadvantage where he could scarcely understand intelligently his 
rights as explained and translated to him much less be able to 
voluntarily waive them 
the fbi agents gave younis the only warning of his 
constitutional right to remain silent shortly after he arrived 
seasick on the uss butte a munitions boat that steamed four days 
before meeting with the aircraft carrier uss saratoga parker noted 
they saw and knew that he was in a weakened state and 
susceptible to persuasion parker said 
younis was kept in a windowless overheated room during the 
voyage which parker called a clear abuse of the obligation to 
bring the defendant before a judicial officer immediately following 
his arrest 
the ships slow voyage across the mediterranean appeared to 
serve only the governments purposes ample time to educe a 
confession parker said in his 47page opinion 
only after his arrival in washington were younis fractured 
wrists correctly diagnosed and appropriately treated the judge 
said 
we are reviewing the decision carefully timothy j reardon 
iii principal assistant us attorney said in a statement fbi 
officials declined to comment on the decision said spokeswoman 
susan schnitzer 
the judge said he was also extremely troubled by the fbis 
failure to provide younis with a lawyer during the interrogation 
particularly since the operation to arrest him had been carefully 
planned 
the government was not just bringing another defendant into 
the station house for questioning he said also criticizing the 
fbi for not using a video camera to record the interrogations 
in addition to the videotape of younis at the scene the 
government also plans to present testimony from two americans who 
were among the passengers and crew taken off the plane before its 
destruction 
the fbi also can rely on the testimony of jamal hamdan a 
onetime friend of younis who lured him onto the yacht hamdan who 
lived in cyprus secretly taped conversations he had with younis 
about the hijacking

now that a sculpture of three battleweary 
infantrymen stands near the vietnam veterans memorial some 
senators want to place a bronze statue of an army nurse nearby to 
honor the 10000 women who served in the southeast asia conflict 
several leading veterans organizations applaud the proposal by 
sens david durenberger rminn and alan cranston dcalif but 
maya lin the young woman architect who designed the memorial 
isnt happy 
i cannot see where it will all end she said at a senate 
hearing tuesday what is to stop someone from trying to add a 
female statue to the iwo jima memorial 
ms lin was supported by others who warned that unless officials 
stop caving in to pressure for more additions the vietnam memorial 
will turn into a sculpture garden of special interests ranging 
from native americans to scout dogs 
j carter brown chairman of the commission of fine arts which 
rejected the womens statue proposal last october said the 
original memorial now bearing the names of 58156 war dead 
including eight nurses on its black granite walls symbolically 
includes all vietnam veterans 
he said the addition of the sculpture of three infantrymen 
triggered envy among other groups who felt left out his commission 
believed that including a white army nurse would only continue 
and exacerbate that process of exclusion he said 
at a crowded hearing by a senate energy and natural resources 
subcommittee robert w doubek former executive director of the 
vietnam veterans memorial fund said a womans sculpture would 
destroy the symbolism and aesthetics of the memorial 
but john p wheeler iii chairman of the private fund which 
raised 11 million to build the memorial supported the nurses 
statue and discounted the threat of a sculpture garden cited by 
critics 
donnamarie boulay a minneapolis lawyer who served in vietnam 
as an army nurse testified that the statue should be erected 
because nurses shared the intensity the trauma the carnage of 
war with infantrymen 
she is chairman and cofounder of the vietnam womens memorial 
project a nonprofit organization founded in 1984 
durenbergers bill which has 56 senate cosponsors specifies 
that after a womans statue is placed at the 22acre site near the 
lincoln memorial the vietnam veterans memorial will be complete 
and no further additions to the site should be authorized or 
undertaken 
the bill if enacted would require the three agencies whose 
approval is required the interior department the fine arts 
commission and the national capital planning commission to 
reconsider the proposal within 90 days the statue has been 
approved by the interior department but rejected by the other two 
agencies 
the memorial which is administered by the national park 
service has become the most popular tourist attraction among all 
the federal monuments in the capital an estimated 20 million 
people have visited the memorial since it was dedicated in 1982

americas commitment to necessities such as 
transportation water supply and waste disposal is barely adequate 
and will fall far short of future needs without sharply increased 
spending on public works a federal council warned today 
the report to the president and congress calls for twice as much 
annual capital spending for public works projects over the next 
dozen years and suggests a broad range of possible money sources 
from higher federal fuel taxes to local impact fees on 
developers 
in most cases we cannot rely simply on wiser spending we also 
must generate additional sources of funding declared the report 
by the national council on public works improvement 
the council was established by congress four years ago to take a 
close look at the nations problems with its infrastructure a 
bureaucratic term covering a variety of public projects from 
highway and airport construction to water management and disposal 
of toxic wastes 
the quality of americas infrastructure today is barely 
adequate to meet current requirements and insufficient to meet the 
demands of future economic growth the report concludes 
the group acknowledged that major increases in spending for 
public works may be difficult amid growing federal budget 
pressures and perhaps even impossible until the federal budget 
deficit is reduced but it said such spending must rank high 
among our priorities 
in a report card on each major type of public works the council 
gave no failing grades but suggested that a far better job needs to 
be done in all areas the countrys battle to deal with toxic 
wastes was given a d and a c or cminus was awarded for coping 
with mass transit solid waste disposal and waste water treatment 
needs 
managing water resources was given a b the best grade followed 
by bminuses for aviation and water supply management 
in general the aviation system has handled rapid increases in 
demand safely and effectively congestion is the systems 
primary problem said the council 
discussing hazardous wastes the council said that while 
spending to clean up contaminated sites has increased fivefold in 
the last two years only a small fraction of the 2 tons of waste 
per capita produced in america each year is being treated safely 
on water quality the council suggested that governments at all 
levels have been fighting a losing battle 
despite a 44 billion federal investment in sewage treatment 
since 1972 water quality has not improved significantly due 
in part to uncontrolled sources of pollution such as runoff from 
farmland and roadways said the report 
overall capital spending for public works projects totaled 45 
billion in 1985 the latest year for which figures were available 
the council said the amount of spending by all levels of government 
and the private sector will have to double by the end of this 
century if future needs are to be met 
the report said overall spending on public works has declined 
from 36 percent of gross national product in 1960 to 26 percent 
in 1985 while spending on operations and maintenance has kept pace 
with economic growth capital spending has fallen from 23 percent 
of gnp to 11 percent 
government spending for public works at all levels has declined 
from 20 percent of total government spending in 1950 to 7 percent 
in 1984 the report continued 
in effect were drawing down past investments without making 
commensurate investments of our own said the report failure 
to reverse this decline will exact a high price for the nation in 
the future both in the cost of deferred investment and in reduced 
economic competitiveness 
the council endorsed the general principle that users and 
beneficiaries of public works projects including developers be 
required to pay a greater share of the cost of such projects 
it also criticized the hoarding of money in various federal 
public works trust funds so that the federal budget deficit will 
appear smaller in 1987 the unspent balances in the federal 
highway transit aviation and waterway trust funds totaled nearly 
24 billion the council said 
federal user fees paid in good faith by beneficiaries to 
preserve and protect public works systems should be spent for 
that purpose the report said

us officials say they are receiving signs 
that panamanian president eric arturo delvalle may be ready to 
disassociate himself from military strongman manuel antonio noriega 
any such move would further weaken noriega and possibly hasten 
his demise as the dominant force in panamanian politics the 
officials said 
the reagan administration looks upon noriega as the principal 
obstacle blocking its goal of an eventual transition to elected 
civilianled rule in panama 
the officials who asked not to be identified said delvalle has 
privately expressed his intention for many weeks to distance 
himself from noriega but they recognize that such a step would 
require considerable courage 
we get information from all sorts of sources including 
friends and relatives that he is about to do something along these 
lines one official said congressional sources also insisting 
on anonymity said they have heard the same reports 
since last summer the administration has been publicly 
encouraging panamas military officers to withdraw from politics as 
a means of promoting a return to rule by civilians in the 
meantime much of the us aid program to panama has been suspended 
and panama has expelled all us aid personnel 
two federal indictments against noriega on drug trafficking 
charges added a new dimension to the already strained relationship 
the indictments handed down in florida earlier this month 
portrayed noriega as a key member of an international drug 
smuggling conspiracy in the congress opposition to noriega spans 
the political spectrum 
delvalle assumed the presidency in 1985 under circumstances 
which strongly suggested that noriega had forced his predecessor 
nicolas ardito barletta from office 
it was a constitutional succession but delvalle has been widely 
perceived as no more than panamas titular head 
noriega has maintained that executive authority rests with 
delvalle and that panama has achieved a full transition to 
democracy noriega says his us critics are campaigning against 
him for the purpose of annulling the panama canal treaties under 
which the waterway reverts to panamanian control at the end of 1999 
attempts to obtain comment from the panamanian embassy on 
delvalles purported intentions were not successful 
for the united states the stakes in panama are extraordinarily 
high the administration believes that a democratic politically 
stable panama offers the best assurance for the continued efficient 
operation of the canal 
the us officials noted that challenging noriega would not be 
an easy step for delvalle they said delvalles extensive business 
interests and his family could be threatened if he breaks with 
noriega in addition delvalles health is said to be tenuous 
because of a heart operation 
however the officials said delvalle has become increasingly 
disturbed by his ties to noriega and that some of his friends have 
rebuffed him because of that association 
delvalle also may be tempted to act because of panamas growing 
financial crisis the country is falling apart all around him 
said one source 
lawrence chewning fabrega a panamanian diplomat who resigned 
recently in protest over noriegas rule said in an interview this 
week that the countrys financial problems are so severe the 
government may not be able to meet its payroll next month

stung by complaints that it revived 
vietnamera spying on political protesters the fbi has initiated 
toplevel reviews of terrorism investigations that could interfere 
with legitimate activity 
fbi officials said tuesday that the policy results from problems 
with an increasingly controversial investigation of a group 
opposing president reagans central america policies 
in that probe some fbi field offices came very close to 
conducting an improper political investigation of the committee in 
solidarity with the people of el salvador despite warnings from 
headquarters said fbi executive assistant director oliver b 
revell 
while vigorously defending the legitimacy of the march 1983june 
1985 investigation revell told the senate intelligence committee 
that neither he nor former fbi director william webster now head 
of the cia closely supervised the probe 
the investigation ended without filing of any charges but 
before it was completed fbi agents had collected information not 
only on cispes members but also more than a hundred other groups 
and individuals opposed to reagan policies targets of the 
surveillance included roman catholic nuns college professors and 
labor union officials 
fbi spokeswoman sue schnitzer acknowledged to a reporter that 
the new reviews were related to the first amendment concerns 
arising from the cispes investigation 
in addition fbi director william sessions has ordered an 
internal investigation of the bureaus conduct specifically in the 
cispes case 
cispes has accused the fbi of investigating its members solely 
because of its political stance recalling fbi surveillance of 
opponents of the vietnam war 
the vietnamera surveillance came under intense congressional 
criticism in the 1970s and led to attorney generals guidelines 
intended to govern the bureaus investigative conduct 
tuesday several members of the senate intelligence committee 
told revell they believe the bureau acted on flimsy evidence to 
keep the cispes investigation alive 
sen william cohen rmaine complained that cispes was targeted 
for a nationwide dragnettype operation while investigations of 
reagans central america supporters were much more limited more 
surgical 
revell said we have taken interim steps to increase the level 
of review of sensitive investigations conducted under the largely 
classified guidelines for international terrorism probes 
under the new policy ms schnitzer said the conduct of 
international terrorism investigations will be reviewed by a deputy 
assistant director who reports to revell who has responsibility 
for all criminal investigations 
revell told the senators that webster was aware of several 
cables sent to him for informational purposes in the cispes 
probe but he did not authorize nor did i authorize any 
supervisory activity that occurred at the sectional level three 
steps below revell 
ms schnitzer said webster and revell had a limited amount of 
knowledge of the cispes investigation 
international terrorism investigations such as the cispes 
probe are conducted under guidelines which do not require the fbi 
to have evidence of a specific crime 
in the cispes investigation the fbi said it had information 
that some cispes members were planning violent activities in the 
united states possibly in conjunction with the fmln the 
coalition fighting the usbacked government of el salvador the 
bureau characterizes the fmln as a terrorist organization 
the bureau also said cispes members were investigated after 
bombings at the us capitol and the army national war college at 
fort mcnair in washington in 1983 although no evidence against 
them was found 
revell said much of the information that started and fueled the 
investigation came from frank varelli a former informant in dallas 
whose information proved to be a mixed bag some blatantly 
false some concocted in his own mind 
that did result in the investigation being misled in certain 
material facts said revell adding the bureau only discovered 
the problem after the fact 
varelli is now suing the fbi saying it still owes him money for 
his informant work 
revell also said the fbi made a mistake when it disseminated 
under a secret classification derogatory information received 
about cispes from a conservative group the information from the 
young americas foundation was sent to 33 field offices 
i did not approve it or sign it revell said i would not 
have it was inappropriate to indicate that the views of 
another organization should be considered by our investigators

this west african nation votes for 
president and national assembly on sunday in a multiparty election 
a rarity on a continent dominated by oneparty and military 
governments 
with only five days left until national elections the war of 
words escalated tuesday as four presidential candidates and six 
political parties wound up campaigning 
opposition politicians accused the socialist party which has 
ruled since independence from france in 1960 of rigging sundays 
elections in advance and sending armed militias to break up 
opposition party gatherings 
the president and socialist leader abdou diouf 52 a tall 
angular technocrat is widely expected to retain his seat and 
legislative majority 
but young voters in some urban areas may back abdoulaye wade a 
61yearold lawyer who leads the senegalese democratic party the 
countrys largest opposition group wade has called for change in 
the governments generally conservative prowestern policies 
tensions were high in the cities where there have been sporadic 
student strikes and stonethrowing incidents between young 
supporters of the different parties 
wades party has formed its own peoples resistance 
committees to safeguard its meetings 
we will mobilize our supporters to go to the polling 
stations said ousmane ngom a party spokesman if we see 
fraud we will occupy the interior and communications ministries to 
prevent them from announcing their fraudulent results if we think 
we have the majority we will declare victory and declare a new 
government 
diouf said monday the government was prepared to deal with all 
excesses and there will be no liberty for the enemies of 
liberty he has insisted the elections will be free fair and 
democratic 
diouf has governed the country since 1981 when he took over 
from retiring leader leopold sedar senghor 
other candidates in the presidential race are babacar niang 59 
of the peoples liberation party and landing savane 43 of the 
revolutionary movement for a new democracy 
niang and savane a maoist have both said they have little 
chance of winning and are participating to show there is an 
alternative to the socialists 
serigne diop former wade supporter and leader of the senegalese 
democratic party for renovation backed dioufs candidacy but hoped 
to win legislative seats for his own party 
the marxistoriented democratic leaguelabor movement led by 
abdoulaye bathily 43 also offered only legislative candidates 
in 1983 diouf retained the presidency and his party took 111 of 
the 120 seats in the national assembly in the countrys first 
multiparty elections wade and other opposition politicians claimed 
that election was marred by fraud 
wade has again accused the government of distributing voter 
registration cards through dioufs party rather than through 
independent registration committees he also said the government 
radio television and semiofficial le soleil newspaper have given 
preferential coverage to socialist candidates 
opposition politicians have criticized the countrys austerity 
program which is backed by the international monetary fund and 
world bank but which has brought a reduction on civil service 
openings for university graduates and other belttightening 
measures 
earlier this month four senegalese gendarmes two 
noncommissioned officers and three police sergeants were arrested 
on charges of plotting the secession of the casamance senegals 
southernmost province 
violent separatist demonstrations led by ethnic diola agitators 
in the casamance capital ziguinchor in december 1983 caused more 
than 100 deaths scores of ringleaders were later sentenced to long 
prison terms and the main secessionist association was outlawed 
senegal has a population of 7 million the largely agricultural 
nation has suffered from recurring droughts and the southern 
advance of the sahara desert its chief export is groundnuts

the oil chemical and atomic workers on tuesday 
rejected a proposed merger with the united mine workers just hours 
before the two unions were poised to announce the deal officials 
said 
theres a decision from ocaw not to go forward that unions 
spokesman rod rogers said late tuesday i dont know that that 
sets everything in concrete but thats where it stands for now 
a news conference had been tentatively set for wednesday to 
announce the merger but the ocaw backed out after meeting with umw 
leaders most of tuesday afternoon 
the merger was intended to bolster the strength of the two 
energy workers unions whose memberships have been shrinking 
throughout the last decade 
the ocaws rejection sent umw president richard trumka and his 
executive board members into a latenight meeting at a denver hotel 
umw spokesman joe corcoran said only that a snag had come 
from the ocaw side not the umw 
the umw board had voted sunday in denver to approve the merger 
a union source said it was not clear tuesday night whether umw 
officials would make any further offers to the ocaw 
rogers said earlier tuesday that a merger between the unions 
which each claim about 100000 active members would be logical for 
several reasons including consolidation of resources 
nowadays we the two unions are kind of in the posture of 
negotiating with the same companies and thats because the major 
oil companies own the lions share of the energy and coal reserves 
in the united states he said 
a cooperative negotiating effort between the two unions was 
announced in 1986 at a special umw constitutional convention 
attended by ocaw president joseph misbrener 
at that convention the miners union also gave trumka and the 
unions 24member governing board the power to approve affiliations 
or mergers with other unions 
before a merger could take effect however it would have to be 
approved by ocaws rankandfile at a constitutional convention 
the unions next regularly scheduled convention is in august 
at the umws 1986 convention trumka told delegates that the two 
unions would work to compile information on their common employers 
leading to their coincidental contract expiration date jan 31 
1988 
the two titans of the energy union movement the mine workers 
and the ocaw have agreed to link themselves with computer and to 
share information about the multinationals where we both represent 
our members trumka said 
the umw and the bituminous coal operators association have 
ratified a new national wage agreement but the umw is continuing 
negotiations with the pittston coal group inc a major producer 
that dropped out of the association 
ocaw has reached contract agreements with all the major oil 
companies however strikes are in progress at four refineries 
owned by mobil oil or british petroleum which also owns standard 
oil of ohio 
about onethird of the ocaw membership is covered by new 
contracts with negotations for the rest continuing at the district 
level rogers said

an appeals court has struck down a 1 
million judgment won by a man who claimed that his sexual identity 
changed when his bicycle was struck by a softdrink delivery truck 
in a decision released tuesday the threejudge panel of the 
michigan court of appeals agreed unanimously that errors made in 
jury instructions by wayne county circuit judge louis simmons 
required reversal of the award 
the appeals court ruling came in a case involving joseph 
pickens who was injured sept 18 1978 in inkster when his bike 
collided with a pepsicola truck 
pickens 16 at the time of the accident charged negligence and 
said that after the accident he was a transsexual inclined to 
identify with the opposite sex the court said 
his theory was that prior to the accident he was 
predisposed to transsexualism and that the accident triggered the 
condition the appeals court said 
the jury found pepsicola negligent and awarded pickens 107 
million in damages 
but pepsi contested some jury instructions including one saying 
pickens had a right to cross the street at the intersection the 
company said he had that right only if the light was in his favor 
and he could do so safely 
the appeals court agreed saying that there was a dispute over 
who had the green light and that simmons instruction implied that 
pickens had the green light 
terrence haggerty attorney for pepsicola said the company 
feels the court decided the matter correctly 
sanford roth attorney for pickens said he was quite 
disappointed but added he had not seen a copy of the ruling he 
said he did not know if he would appeal to the state supreme court

up to 20 million americans are in line for 
some temporary tax relief when they file their returns this year 
and many apparently are totally unaware 
president reagan considers the relief so important that he has 
asked congress to make it permanent at a cost to the treasury of 
400 million a year 
the benefits are limited to owners of shares in publicly offered 
mutual funds that have at least 500 shareholders the provision is 
one of those specialinterest amendments that seem to find their 
way into every tax bill especially when those bills are written 
behind closed doors 
this one has its roots in the 1986 tax overhaul as part of that 
big change the itemized deduction for miscellaneous expenses was 
limited to those that exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income 
thus a taxpayers deduction of union dues subscriptions to 
jobrelated publications work uniforms and the like would be 
restricted to the portion exceeding that income threshold for 
example if adjusted gross income was 30000 and miscellaneous 
deductions totaled 2000 only 1400 could be deducted 
in writing the 1986 tax law the senate at the last minute 
included a section aimed at preventing tax evasion that prohibits 
a passthrough entity such as a mutual fund from deducting 
an expense that an individual could not deduct 
as a result managers of mutual funds are dividing up their 
operating costs among shareholders who are treated as if they had 
received those costs as income they must list this income on their 
tax return 
this phantom income argued the investment company 
institute which represents managers and underwriters of mutual 
funds cannot be banked cannot be invested and cannot be used to 
buy groceries the only thing it is good for is to pay taxes on 
but could not the recipient simply write off the phantom 
income as an investment expense sure if the recipient itemized 
deductions maybe 
unless a shareholders total miscellaneous expenses exceeded 2 
percent of his or her adjusted gross income the mutualfund 
writeoff would be lost but the shareholder would still have to 
list the money as taxable income 
in the closing days of the 1987 congressional session 
taxwriters meeting behind closed doors agreed there was some 
inequity and gave shareholders relief for another year 
that means mutualfund expenses that are reported to a 
shareholder as income for 1987 may be deducted as a miscellaneous 
expense without regard to the 2percent threshold other 
miscellaneous expenses will of course still be subject to the 
threshold 
this relief became law in late december but word is slow 
getting out money magazine in asking 50 professional tax 
preparers to calculate the liability of a hypothetical family 
found that 20 of the 50 were not aware of the change 
internal revenue service offices in several cities say they have 
never heard of the change the only mention of the provision in irs 
publications is a caution to taxpayers that congress was 
considering some relief when the literature went to press 
but the last chapter has yet to be written in the 1989 budget 
that he sent to congress last week reagan asked to make permanent 
the relief for mutualfund holders an idea that already has wide 
support among congressional taxwriters

after four months without a news conference 
president reagan faces questions tonight on hostagetaking in 
lebanon israels crackdown in the occupied territories and the 
bitter fight by republicans wanting to succeed him 
reagan also may be asked about his embattled attorney general 
edwin meese iii the target of an investigation by an independent 
counsel and the separate felony convictions of former white house 
aides and presidential confidants lyn nofziger and michael k 
deaver 
also still awaited is reagans reaction to a plan by house 
democrats for 25 million in humanitarian aid for nicaraguas 
contras a package that was put together after rejection of the 
presidents proposal to give the rebels new weapons 
on the political front reagan has doggedly steered clear of 
involvement in the gop presidential race however he may be 
tempted to comment on the increasingly sharp words between 
republicans given that he is the author of the socalled 11th 
commandment forbidding republicans to speak ill of each other 
the 8 pm est session in the east room will be reagans first 
news conference since last oct 22 which was dominated by 
questions about the 508point collapse of the stock market 
a lot has happened since then and reagan has had little to say 
except in prepared speeches he has been largely isolated from the 
press commenting only occasionally in response to a shouted 
question as he boards a helicopter or to a query during a 
picturetaking ceremony in the oval office 
tonights session comes amid intense diplomatic activity by 
secretary of state george shultz in moscow and the middle east 
shultz who arrived back in washington on tuesday evening was 
reporting to reagan today on his talks in moscow about arms 
control the timing of a superpower summit and the likelihood of a 
red army pullout from afghanistan 
all of those issues pose possible questions for reagan 
with barely a day back in the capital shultz leaves again 
tonight this time to the middle east where he will meet with arab 
and israeli leaders about efforts to revive peace negotiations 
white house officials say there is an urgency to shultz efforts 
in the middle east because of the violence in the occupied west 
bank and gaza the united nations says 63 palestinians have been 
killed by israeli gunfire since violence began dec 8 
shultz said tuesday he has encountered intense skepticism 
about the chances of a breakthrough on middle east negotiations 
but the united states has a few ideas that could help end the 
deadlock 
reagan likely will be asked about the kidnapping in lebanon of 
marine lt col william r higgins and the eight other americans 
seized there 
higgins onetime aide to former defense secretary caspar 
weinberger was serving with un forces when he was taken in 
southern lebanon last wednesday reagan raised some questions by 
saying he wanted to rescue higgins but aides later clarified

sen joseph r biden jr wore a blue baseball 
cap to hide his scar as he left walter reed army medical center 12 
days after undergoing brain surgery that will have to be repeated 
in a few months 
doctors said they were delighted with bidens recovery from 
surgery feb 12 to repair an aneurysm in an artery supplying blood 
to the senators brain 
but a hospital statement said that a second aneurysm has been 
found and will have to be corrected later 
biden 45 left the hospital tuesday by car with his wife jill 
and his brother jim biden of washington 
a family spokesman larry rasky said the democrat from delaware 
was under orders to rest at home and was to have no visitors nor be 
given office work 
biden said rasky is in great shape and great spirits hes 
full of vigor i think if the doctors hadnt told him to rest he 
could have gone to the office 
rasky said the family purposely avoided announcing the senators 
plan to leave the hospital in order to avoid the stress of any 
media interest 
but biden and his wife paused briefly beside their car to pose 
for a photographer bidens blue cap covered the scar on his left 
temple where the surgical incision was made he smiled broadly as 
the camera shutter clicked 
the hospital statement said neurosurgeons earlier had found the 
additional aneurysm on the opposite side of the brain from the 
aneurysm that was repaired 
the second aneurysm is smaller and could not be approached 
during the earlier surgery the statement said there were no 
signs of leakage but the second aneurysm will require surgical 
repair 
no date has been set for the new operation the statement said 
it added procedures of this type are usually done after the 
patient has fully recovered from any earlier surgery usually 
within two to three months 
rasky said doctors told biden the second surgery could come in 
less than three months if his recovery went well and that 
recovery from the new operation would take less time but the 
spokesman said the senator will not return to his washington office 
until he has recovered from the second surgery 
a doctor associated with the case who asked not to be 
identified said that about 15 percent of all patients with one 
cerebral aneurysm will develop another if the aneurysm is small 
stable and not bleeding he said it can be left and repaired later 
bidens release just 12 days after surgery said the doctor 
shows he is doing very well 
an aneurysm is a weakened area in an artery the pressure of 
blood flow causes the area to balloon forming a blisterlike flaw 
on the artery side 
aneurysms are dangerous because they can rupture suddenly and 
hemorrhage or they can leak such bleeding from a cerebral 
aneurysm can quickly cause brain damage or death 
biden was admitted to walter reed on feb 12 after a 
middleofthenight emergency transfer from a delaware hospital 
he had been taken to the delaware hospital the day before after 
experiencing severe neck pain and nausea 
an xray test located the aneursym within his skull and he 
underwent surgery within hours 
the doctor associated with the case said then that about 
onethird of all patients with cerebral aneurysms die 
typically the doctor said surgery for a brain aneurysm 
requires an incision in the temple area surgeons then cut a small 
window in the skull to enable them to lift the brain slightly and 
locate the flawed artery 
the aneurysm is corrected by permanently attaching a clip a 
small metal device with locking jaws at the base of the 
blisterlike flaw and parallel to the blood flow eventually the 
artery will heal itself 
biden had been treated for a neck pain that started two weeks 
before his surgery a doctor diagnosed the ailment as a pinched 
nerve and possibly a viral infection of neck muscles the senator 
wore a neck brace as treatment 
when the pain left after several days biden abandoned the brace 
and went on a speaking tour but the pain along with nausea 
recurred the senator was admitted to a hospital near his 
wilmington del home and then transferred by ambulance to walter 
reed 
a doctor said an aneurysm leaking into the brain cavity can 
cause neck pain

the quid pro quo in a memo to attorney 
general edwin meese iii may be a planned payoff to the israeli 
labor party say government sources familiar with a criminal 
investigation of meese 
the sept 25 1985 memo from longtime meese friend e robert 
wallach discusses an israeli commitment not to bomb a proposed 1 
billion iraqi oil pipeline 
we all recognize that there would be no progress to this 
point had israeliborn swiss oilman bruce rappaport not been 
able to obtain the security package which involves the 
nevertobestated but fully understood quid pro quo which helped 
to produce that commitment said wallachs memo the memo doesnt 
elaborate 
meeses attorneys say the quid pro quo is a reference to an 
agreement that rappaport a partner in the proposed pipeline would 
make available to israel substantial amounts of oil generated from 
the project wallach was rappaports lawyer 
however investigators for independent counsel james mckay 
question the explanation of meeses lawyers and are seeking to 
determine whether the language may be a reference to planned 
payments to the labor party said the government sources who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
wallach gave meese the quid pro quo memo along with a 
handwritten letter from thenisraeli prime minister shimon peres in 
which peres said he would go a long way to help the pipeline 
one of meeses lawyers james rocap said the attorney general 
doesnt recall any discussion of the memo with wallach who 
handdelivered the documents to the attorney general rocap said 
meese did not read the memo closely 
wallachs memo urged meese to enlist support for the pipeline 
project from top us officials hinting that he might talk to 
secretary of state george shultz about it and then proposing a 
discussion with president reagan 
meeses lawyers say he took none of the initiatives suggested by 
wallach but only referred peres to the office of thennational 
security adviser robert mcfarlane 
a separate wallachtomeese memo also dated sept 25 1985 
spells out rappaports close ties to peres saying the businessman 
described an arrangement in which israel will receive up to 700 
million over 10 years from the pipeline 
what was also indicated to me and which would be denied 
everywhere is that a portion of those funds will go directly to 
labor says the second memo the focal point of mckays criminal 
investigation meese says he doesnt recall reading the portion of 
the document relating to labor party payments 
the independent counsel is investigating whether meese knew of a 
possibly improper payment plan involving the israeli political 
party and if so why he did not do something about it 
the foreign corrupt practices act makes it illegal for us 
citizens companies or their agents to offer foreign officials 
anything of value to influence them to provide help in business 
matters 
the law states that the attorney general may file a civil suit 
if it appears the person or company is about to engage in an act 
that would violate the law 
both memos were publicly released monday along with an exchange 
of notes between peres and meese 
peres now israels foreign minister on tuesday defended his 
communications with meese saying we all agree that we favor the 
laying of the pipeline so why would anyone need to use bribes 
nobody said he meese gave the labor party anything or proposed 
anything to the labor party 
however peres acknowledged tuesday through a spokesman in 
jerusalem that the israeli government had been offered a discount 
on oil purchases amounting to 65 million to 70 million a year in 
return for approving the pipeline the washington post reported in 
todays editions 
but the aide said that peres did not take the offer seriously 
and failed to pass it on to colleagues the newspaper said 
in another development arthur l liman the chief counsel for 
the senate committee that investigated the irancontra affair says 
the justice department should have turned over wallachs memos when 
the committee subpoenaed material 
one of the memos refers to israeli help in efforts to free 
american hostages held in lebanon and quotes rappaport as saying 
there is a feeling the united states owes and that the 
accomplishment of this pipeline project is appropriate 
i would like to have questioned meese about this liman was 
quoted as saying in todays editions of the new york times

senate majority leader robert c byrd 
dwva said today it would be unwise to threaten to pull us 
troops out of europe to counter pressures inside west germany for 
the removal of all nuclear weapons from german soil 
the appearance of the use of threats by the united states does 
the germans a disservice byrd said in testimony prepared for 
delivery before the senate foreign relations committee 
threatening europe with a diminished american commitment if 
europe does not undertake certain specific actions would be 
counterproductive the senate leader said 
byrd said that the senate delegation he led to europe earlier 
this month concluded that no responsible german official 
contemplates denuclearizing germany 
some west germans do advocate eliminating all us nuclear 
systems in the aftermath of the successful negotiation of the 
ussoviet treaty eliminating mediumrange nuclear weapons from 
the continent 
but byrd said most west german leaders reject that as a step 
leading to domination by moscows superior weight in nonnuclear 
arms such as tanks artillery and aircraft 
byrd said the top priority for nato now must be the forging of a 
detailed and comprehensive proposal on conventional arms reduction 
to present to the soviet union this year 
on tuesday former secretary of state henry a kissinger said 
president reagans vision of a world free of nuclear weapons is 
neither obtainable nor desirable 
i do not believe this is possible and i do not believe our 
leaders should create the impression that it is possible let alone 
desirable he said 
kissinger said he was concerned about the west being exposed to 
soviet superiority in conventional weapons should nuclear weapons 
be abolished 
kissinger told the committee he believes the senate should 
ratify the new treaty eliminating mediumrange nuclear weapons in 
europe if only to avoid a bruising and divisive political upheaval 
inside the nato alliance 
but kissinger said he believes the treaty is flawed and leaves 
us in a weaker position both politically and militarily 
he said he was especially troubled by the treatys reduction of 
us and soviet missiles to zero on each side because of the 
expectations that may create in the negotiation of a treaty 
reducing longrange strategic nuclear arms 
it implies that zero in all categories is obtainable and it 
is not obtainable kissinger said 
he said the treaty should be ratified if for no other reason 
because keeping a force of us pershing and groundlaunched cruise 
missiles in western europe is now politically impossible 
the treaty is the result of natos 1979 dualtrack decision 
to deploy us weapons to counter soviet ss20 mediumrange 
missiles while at the same time negotiating their removal 
it calls for the destruction of all missiles with a range from 
300 miles to 3400 miles 
kissinger said he believes the treaty is flawed because it will 
not reduce in any significant way the ability of the soviet union 
to devastate europe with other nuclear weapons and because it 
substantially reduces the ability of the united states to retaliate 
with nuclear weapons based in europe 
nuclear deterrence in europe will now rely primarily on weapons 
based in the united states and kissinger said that creates a 
psychological and political imbalance especially when weighed 
against soviet superiority in conventional forces

president reagan wants congress to bar federal 
agencies from releasing information that he says could harm the 
economic competitiveness of the united states in the new field of 
superconductivity 
the proposed change in the freedom of information act was one of 
three proposals reagan submitted to congress on tuesday in a 
message in which he said the united states sometimes falls short in 
making commercial use of laboratory breakthroughs 
the other proposals would broaden the present protection for 
patents on manufacturing processes and require courts to consider 
the effects of joint commercial ventures on international 
competitiveness before deciding they violate antitrust laws 
reagan said he was proposing the information law change because 
commercially valuable scientific and technological information 
generated in federal facilities loses potential commercial value 
when it is released wholesale under the act 
mandatory disclosure of such information under foia could 
encourage us competitors to exploit the us science and 
technology base rather than making investments in their own 
research and development infrastucture the president said 
under his proposal reagan said federal agencies will be 
required to withhold information of this nature requested under the 
freedom of information act where disclosure could reasonably be 
expected to harm the economic competitiveness of the united 
states 
reagan said his proposal would apply to federal 
governmentgenerated governmentowned scientific and technical 
information in addition he said the administration is 
developing a uniform policy to permit federal contractors to own 
the rights to technical information that they develop for the 
government 
although the three legislative proposals were lumped together 
under the title superconductivity competitiveness act of 1988 
the presidents message did not indicate that their application 
would be limited to the field of superconductivity 
the federal government spent about 55 million on 
superconductivity research in fiscal year 1987 and will spend more 
than 100 million in the current fiscal year reagan said 
there is no time to waste in this effort he said there 
is a growing realization that although the united states has long 
been a leader in breakthroughs in the laboratory it has 
occasionally failed to convert these breakthroughs into commercial 
applications 
reagan proposed amending patent laws to give us companies the 
right to sue and collect monetary damages in us courts when 
someone else uses their processes abroad to manufacture products 
that are then shipped to and sold in the united states 
they can already file such suits to prevent the use of their 
processes by domestic manufacturers but must sue foreign 
manufacturers in foreign courts in order to collect damages the 
white house said the proposed change is consistent with the 
treatment of process patents in many foreign countries

the 1988 presidential campaign is making a 
quick side trip to the nations northeast corner this week for 
lobster maple syrup and votes with michael dukakis and george 
bush nervously hoping for neighborly victories in maine and vermont 
with their strong regional ties dukakis and bush need to win 
their parties caucuses in maine this weekend and the vermont 
primaries tuesday to build momentum for super tuesday 
but former television evangelist pat robertson and senate gop 
leader bob dole would like to embarrass bush in his home territory 
especially in the wake of bushs weak showings in tuesdays south 
dakota primary and minnesota caucuses 
in both maine and vermont strong bush and dukakis organizations 
will carry the burden for all the candidates will be spending most 
of the next seven days campaigning in the south focus of the super 
tuesdays primaries on march 8 
the republican vice president will touch down for airport news 
conferences today in portland me and burlington vt his last 
scheduled visits for the week dukakis may be back in maine by the 
weekend 
bush has a home in maine and is widely expected to be the winner 
in the town caucuses in the state scattered over the weekend 
but his campaign is worried about robertson in maine 
with a usual turnout of only about 5000 republicans the 
caucuses are a good opportunity for success using robertsons 
tactics from other states flooding caucuses with new participants 
and winning surprising victories 
the dukakis campaign which has a strong organization on the 
ground as it did in new hampshire faces less opposition among 
democrats who have mostly left the states to the governor from 
neighboring massachusetts 
it doesnt appear that the other campaigns are taking these 
states seriously said dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
the one possible exception to the rest of the democratic fields 
bypassing of the states is jesse jackson in vermont the rainbow 
coalition formed during jacksons 1984 presidential bid 
actually has remained active in the state and burlingtons 
socialist mayor bernie sanders has endorsed him 
the rainbow coalition has been working hard said vermont 
democratic chief violet coffin 
but dukakis in contrast has had 1215 paid staffers working the 
state she said 
neither of the states events has drawn a great deal of 
candidates attention for several reason 
first maine and vermont together will send 41 delegates to the 
democratic national convention and 39 delegates to the republican 
meeting this summer the super tuesday events decide which 
candidates have the allegiance of 1307 democratic delegates and 
712 gop delegates 
only the maine caucuses actually begin the delegate selection 
processes the vermont primary on tuesday is simply a beauty 
contest expression of preference vermonts delegates will be 
picked in the late spring in a separate caucus process 
but the close ties that bush has with maine make it an excellent 
chance for robertson to stun the frontrunner in his home turf 
it will be a battle said ron kaufman bushs northeastern 
coordinator dole has had a lot of people on the ground in maine 
but my concern is the rev robertson 
it is the potential of robertsons invisible army of 
supporters to take over the gop caucuses that worries the bush 
staff 
maine gop state chairwoman karen stram of dresden sees the 
caucuses this way 
the bush campaign has the broadest organization robertson has 
organized a lot of new voters the dole people have an 
organization that has been working here 
on the democratic side in maine state party chief rick barton 
acknowledges that dukakis has a homefield advantage but he says 
another candidate could have an impact the question is whether 
anybody is making an effort here besides dukakis barton said 
and he pointed out that there is a seventh candidate contending 
in the maine caucuses uncommitted led by maine house leader john 
diamond party activists have been pushing for uncommitted 
delegates to be elected at the city and town meetings 
in vermont dole has the potential for a good showing although 
the vice president is credited with a broader organization dole 
has the backing of several gop leaders including former gov 
richard snelling 
vermont republican party chief ralph howe said dole from the 
farm state of kansas has also won points with the states dairy 
farmers by supporting changes in the milk price support program 
that bush has not endorsed 
in dukakis home state of massachusetts which votes on super 
tuesday the governor enjoys a prohibitive lead among democratic 
presidential candidates while bush leads the gop field a new poll 
indicates 
the survey commissioned by wcvbtv in boston weei radio and 
the boston globe was conducted by the gallup organization among 
massachusetts voters last weekend it said dukakis led with 61 
percent support with gephardt trailing with 13 percent the other 
democrats finished in single digits 
in the republican race bush a massachusetts native led with 
49 percent compared to 29 percent saying they support dole those 
others were in single digits with 8 percent undecided 
the telephone survey of presidential preference involved 639 
registered democrats with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 
percent the poll also reached 331 republicans with a margin of 
error of plus or minus 6 percent

a dinosaur egg discovered in a 
central utah quarry may contain the oldest embryo ever found and 
change perceptions about how some of the creatures became extinct 
a scientist says 
a scan of a partially collapsed egg the size of a human fist has 
revealed a 2centimeterlong gray area that appears to be the crude 
outline of an embryo said wade miller a brigham young university 
paleontologist 
in the scan the egg shell appears white most of the eggs 
interior is dark gray except for a tiny area that has the shape of 
a head and other features miller said 
the egg was discovered last september in the cleveland lloyd 
quarry where scientists have uncovered thousands of allosaurus 
bones a meateater that stood up to 20 feet high 
miller said skeletal remains of the dinosaurs that lived during 
the jurassic period which began around 210 million bc and ended 
145 million bc have ranged from 100pound juveniles to 3ton 
adults 
william lloyd stokes professor emeritus at the university of 
utah and one of the scientists who excavated most of the bones 
said dinosaur eggs usually cannot be associated with a particular 
species but because this egg was found among a great deposit of 
allosaurus bones it likely was from an allosaurus 
it is among the oldest eggs or egg fragments ever discovered 
and if it in fact contains an embryo would be the oldest dinosaur 
embryo found stokes said 
miller said the egg could lead to a new theory of how dinosaurs 
in the area became extinct 
miller said geologists previously believed the dinosaurs in the 
quarry were trapped in a bog 
a dinosaur is not going to lay an egg in a bog while its 
sinking he said 
but stokes disputed that 
the egg has to be formed within a body and while it is in a 
body that body may sink he said tuesday night 
stokes said the fact that other eggs and egg fragments were not 
found in the quarry indicates this egg was not in a nest 
miller said the egg will be taken to maryland where columbia 
scientific inc will take threedimensional xrays of it

some elections are more equal than others fortunately for 
george bush he was trounced twice in republican presidential 
contests but hed left the scene of the landslides 
sen bob dole who won a runaway in south dakota and a 
comfortable victory in minnesota said he had gained major headway 
as the gop race moved toward the south 
it pays to come to south dakota he said tuesday night in 
sioux falls 
but the pay wasnt very high 
dole apparently swept the delegates at stake in south dakota 
all 18 of them pat robertson was second just below the 20 percent 
it took to share in the delegation bush lagged narrowly behind him 
but compare that delegate payoff to texas republicans there 
will choose 111 nominating delegates on march 8 and bush ranks as 
the favorite his role and doles are reversed in texas the vice 
president leads and the senator from kansas has virtually written 
off the state 
in democratic competition tuesday rep richard gephardt 
captured south dakota massachusetts gov michael dukakis won in 
minnesota and nobody got any nominating delegates the results 
were purely advisory the real prizes come later 
those results especially the defeats bush absorbed by running 
third in south dakota and fourth in minnesota were muted for lack 
of the attention concentrated on the leadoff presidential contests 
in iowa and new hampshire 
dole and gephardt won in iowa bush and dukakis in new 
hampshire in contests played to national television audiences 
with anchormen on location the states were comparable the stakes 
were comparable but tuesdays contests were not magnified by being 
first 
so bush campaigning in london ky absorbed the twin defeats 
without a word of comment its time for targeting and the next 
one on his list comes this weekend in maine where he maintains a 
home and where he expects to win in gop caucuses 
thats also a robertson target and the bush camp says the 
former television evangelist could pose a significant challenge in 
caucuses the kind of competition that best fits his organization 
robertson said bush should pay in the national public opinion 
polls for the defeats on tuesday i dont see how hes going to 
continue to ride so high robertson said the vice president is 
definitely wounded 
but it is nothing maine and the justforshow vermont primary 
on march 1 cant heal 
those contests and the south carolina primary on march 5 with 
robertson formidable and claiming he can win all preface super 
tuesday march 8 thats a 20state primary and caucus day with 
1307 democratic delegates and 712 republicans at stake 
that competition is concentrated in the south but it includes a 
halfdozen contests in other regions massachusetts to washington 
with candidates picking their spots and with delegates to be won 
through proportional representation among the democrats super 
tuesday isnt likely to be any more conclusive than what has gone 
before 
republican rules make it more likely that one candidate can pile 
up a significant delegate lead on march 8 
ironically for all the efforts at calendar rigging and 
earlyseason decisions the pivotal primaries may still be weeks 
away in populous industrial states like pennsylvania new york 
ohio and finally california

house lawmakers are hoping to melt some of the 
ice around their sweeping trade bill with proposals to drop 
senatesponsored curbs on lamb imports and 400 million in payments 
to sugar refiners 
i think there is a need for trade legislation house ways 
and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill said tuesday 
after the plan was sent to senators on a conference committee 
drafting the trade bill if we dont get it this year it could 
very well mean that we wont get it for some time in the future 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
promised early consideration of the offer proposed by ways and 
means committee members who are also part of the conference 
committee 
bentsen said there could be a reply as early as the weekend from 
finance committee members on the conference committee the 
socalled subconference of ways and means and finance members 
is one of 17 such bodies that have been formed to draw up portions 
of the 1000page bill 
the lamb provision would limit imports of fresh chilled or 
frozen lamb meat it was attached to the senate version of the 
trade bill at the urging of sen max baucus dmont 
the sugar provision would let some refining companies that claim 
tney are being hurt by high tariffs recover some 400 million in 
duties they paid a number of years ago on imported sugar that was 
refined and reexported 
the reagan administration was fiercely opposed to it saying 
insufficient documents existed to administer the plan properly 
at a news conference rostenkowski again expressed hope the 
house would pass an overall compromise before the easter recess 
but said that might not be possible 
one issue remaining is democratic presidential aspirant richard 
gephardts amendment to require 10 percent annual rollbacks in 
japanese trade surpluses with the united states 
the measure approved by the house does not appear in the 
senate version and it seems likely to be changed in the final 
product 
gephardt a member of the ways and means committee has been 
basing part of his campaign on his trade proposal and other 
democrats on the panel have been reluctant to do anything that 
might be interpreted as undercutting him 
rostenkowski indicated that no reshaping of provisions dealing 
with unfair foreign trade barriers is likely before the super 
tuesday primaries in the south on march 8 the chairman was an 
opponent of gephardts plan when it was debated in the house last 
year 
he indicated however that he would present the case for 
gephardts plan 
ive been commissioned by the house of representatives to do 
as much as i can to keep as much of it in as i can and im going 
to do that he said 
after a report on monday that lawmakers would dump the 
gephardt provision following the super tuesday voting rostenkowski 
issued a statement saying that mr gephardts amendment has not 
been scuttled or jettisoned

republicans across the ideological spectrum 
helped bob dole win the south dakota primary with the exception of 
strong conservatives whose support could prove important in later 
contests exit polls said 
those republicans one fifth of the total favored pat 
robertson helping the former television minister challenge vice 
president george bush for second place in the state primary 
tuesday an nbc news exit poll found 
among democrats many voters chose a candidate in the final days 
of the south dakota campaign and they went strongly for rep 
richard gephardt who employed aggressive television advertising in 
his winning effort polls said 
a third of the democratic voters told cbs news they made up 
their minds in the last three days of the race and 45 percent of 
them backed gephardt to 23 percent for massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis who finished second 
the television networks based their analyses of the voting on 
random surveys of south dakotans as they left polling places the 
networks did not conduct surveys in minnesota which held party 
caucuses tuesday 
dole the senate minority leader from kansas campaigned 
determinedly in south dakota bush sensing his disadvantage 
steered clear of the state the polls said dole prevailed in nearly 
all categories abc news for example said he won more than seven 
in 10 liberals and moderates and four in 10 conservatives 
nbc separated out another category very conservative 
voters and said 42 percent went for robertson to 32 percent for 
dole and 17 percent for bush dole did poorly among very 
conservative voters in new hampshire where bush won last weeks 
primary and nbc noted that more such voters may turn out in the 
super tuesday southern state primaries march 8 
when considering doles overall strong showing the caveat is 
that bush didnt contest it and that republican turnout was 
light said doug muzzio an abc poll analyst still he said 
bush lost almost every group he won in new hampshire including 
republicans who support president reagan and those who are 
concerned about foreign policy 
one important outcome was a narrowing of the margins muzzio 
said sen paul simon a liberal democrat fared poorly as did 
rep jack kemp of new york a conservative republican 
abc said kemp got just 8 percent of the conservative republican 
vote to robertsons 27 percent robertson also won more than half 
the evangelical or fundamentalist christians about a fifth of all 
gop voters abc and cbs said 
among the democrats gephardt and dukakis split the liberal 
vote but gephardt won moderate and conservative democrats won the 
male vote while splitting the female vote with dukakis and won 
among the less wealthy and the less educated again splitting the 
others with dukakis 
gephardt went upscale by doing better among the 
bettereducated and wealthier democrats than he had in the past 
muzzio said the good news for dukakis is that he did well in a 
downscale state he added 
surprisingly the nbc news poll found that a plurality of south 
dakota democrats 46 percent said they believed dukakis eventually 
will win the presidential nomination though not all voted for him 
even 28 percent of those who voted for gephardt said they 
expected dukakis to be the nominee 
cbs reported that 40 percent of the democrats chose farm policy 
as a key issue more than the number that selected any other 
subject 
gephardt was definitely strong among people who cared about 
farm policy with 55 percent support to 18 percent for dukakis 
said cbs surveys manager pam mitchell 
among the losing democrats nbc found that former sen gary hart 
of colorado was viewed unfavorably by twice as many south dakotans 
as viewed him favorably and 55 percent were not pleased that hart 
reentered the race after withdrawing last summer amid questions 
about his marital fidelity 
nbcs poll had a margin of sampling error of 3 percent the cbs 
polls margin of error was 4 percent and abcs was 5 percent

the 4000 nuclear weapons that would remain in 
western europe after elimination of intermediaterange nuclear 
weapons should stay there until its conventional forces are better 
balanced with the warsaw pact president reagan told a european 
television audience 
ensuring the peace requires that these nuclear weapons stay 
where they are until we can achieve a better balance of 
conventional forces on the continent reagan said tuesday 
because of them and the soviet knowledge that we have them we 
can maintain the balance that maintains the peace 
reagan spoke in a televised address broadcast by satellite to 
europe by the worldnet facilities of the us information 
agency the address came a week before leaders of the 16 nato 
countries gather at the alliances headquarters in brussels for 
their first fullscale summit in six years 
reagan said the recently signed ussoviet treaty to abolish 
intermediaterange nuclear forces missiles with a range of about 
300 miles to 3000 miles was a victory for nato 
nevertheless he said nato must continue to have battlefield 
nuclear weapons those with a range of under 300 miles 
the alliances adversaries must not believe that our only 
possible response to a limited attack is to begin an 
intercontinental nuclear exchange reagan said if they do 
they may doubt that we would risk such a response and be tempted to 
test us 
west germany has expressed opposition to upgrading shortrange 
missiles until nato develops an overall arms control strategy and 
the soviet union reduces it conventional force strength 
reagan said nato must insure that it maintains all the modern 
forces both conventional and nuclear to uphold a strategy of 
flexible response to soviet aggression 
after all our goal is not a nuclearfree or a tankfree or an 
armyfree europe but a warfree europe reagan said

kansas sen bob dole scored a solid 
victory in south dakotas republican presidential primary tuesday 
far outpacing vice president george bush who had written off the 
state and rep richard gephardt came out on top on the democratic 
side after a campaign blitz 
i took south dakota very seriously dole said let the 
message go out that it pays to come to south dakota 
bush had sidestepped the midwest contests and headed directly 
south after his new hampshire primary victory 
gephardts win over massachusetts gov michael dukakis delivered 
no nominating delegates but gave gephardt a victory to point to as 
the candidates campaign in the super tuesday states dukakis 
however scored a win of his own tuesday night in minnesotas 
caucuses 
dukakis was the resounding victor in the new hampshire primary a 
week ago gephardt won the iowa caucuses eight days before that 
the south dakota primary was moved from its traditional june 
date to the front of the nominating calendar this year 
gephardt dukakis and illinois sen paul simon campaigned 
heavily here sen albert gore jr of tennessee gary hart and 
jesse jackson also vied for support 
republican voters were choosing all 18 delegates the state will 
send to their national convention next summer while 15 of the 19 
democratic delegates were to be allocated on the basis of the 
primary 
the democratic primary is legally nonbinding because it falls 
prior to the date allowed by democratic national party rules but 
state party officials have said they expect the march 12 statewide 
caucus to apportion those 15 delegates according to the results of 
tuesdays primary 
the south dakota legislature moved the presidential primary from 
june to february in an attempt to draw candidates to a state that 
was largely ignored by presidential contenders in past elections 
backers of the move said it would force the candidates to pay 
attention to south dakota and the problems of rural america 
with 99 percent of the precincts reporting gephardt had 44 
percent dukakis 31 percent gore 8 percent simon 6 percent 
hart and jackson 5 percent 
for the republicans with 99 percent of precincts reporting 
dole had 55 percent robertson 20 percent bush 19 percent and kemp 
5 percent former delaware gov pete du pont who dropped out last 
week drew 1 percent

some teachers are blasting a decision by 
richland high school students to retain a nuclear mushroom cloud as 
their symbol but supporters said the emblem did not signify atomic 
destruction 
students in this atomic city voted overwhelmingly tuesday to 
formally adopt the mushroom cloud as the symbol of the bombers 
it stands for nuclear holocaust and the end of the world 
said jim deatherage a teacher who has long opposed the symbol 
its an inappropriate symbol for high school kids to be 
glorifying 
deatherage said students should not have made the decision since 
they were easily swayed by emotions and did not understand the 
objections of outsiders 
they were tied to the symbol because of school pride he 
said the whole process was a farce 
deatherage and teacher rick wigre said opponents had only a few 
chances to communicate with students or other teachers 
it never came up at a faculty meeting wigre said because 
the administration did not want to divide the staff 
but most students and administrators expressed satisfaction with 
the process 
clearly thats what the kids wanted said lisa koch 18 
im very pleased 
students have a very simple view of it said activities 
director steve potter who helped organize the election 
to them it was a symbol of richland high school he said 
no more and no less 
the issue is an emotional one in this city of 30000 adjacent to 
the hanford nuclear reservation where for more than 40 years the 
federal government has made plutonium for nuclear weapons 
richland was a sleepy village of a few hundred residents when 
hanford was carved out of the central washington desert as part of 
the manhattan project to produce atomic bombs in world war ii 
many of parents of the schools 1300 students are employed at 
the site where the government announced last week that plutonium 
production is being phased out at the cost of 2600 jobs during the 
next two years 
the symbol which is the letter r with a mushroom cloud 
rising above it has been used for some 17 years but was never 
formally adopted by the student body 
over the years there have been attempts to eliminate it and 
some student leaders decided it was time to formally adopt a symbol 
during a morning class tuesday students were given white 
ballots with four symbols portrayed in black 
there was no place to write in new ideas and no opportunity to 
reject all four options a factor criticized by some teachers and 
students 
the mushroom cloud received 1084 votes said principal gus 
nash a caricature of an atomic bomb got 45 a b17 bomber plane 40 
and the symbol of three atomic rings 36 votes 
i dont think the student body sees it as a symbol of 
destruction or weaponry said marcia cillan vice president of 
the associated student body i dont think it signifies anything 
other than richland high school 
were not going to change it just because a bunch of people 
are making fun of it said student glenn goldberg

democrat michael dukakis racked up a win 
outside his home turf of new england in the minnesota democratic 
presidential caucuses while republican bob dole beat out george 
bush as did former television evangelist pat robertson and rep 
jack kemp 
with 80 percent of the republican precincts reporting the last 
official tally provided early today dole had 43 percent 
robertson 28 percent kemp 15 percent and bush 11 percent the 
uncommitteds were 3 percent 
and with 74 percent of the democratic precincts reporting 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts scored 34 percent jesse 
jackson had 20 percent sen paul simon 18 percent and rep 
richard gephardt 8 percent gore and hart each had 1 percent and 
19 percent were uncommitted 
gephardt won the south dakota primary tuesday night setting the 
scene for more battles for the frontrunning spot as he and dukakis 
head into a new round of contests 
dukakis won last weeks new hampshire primary while gephardt 
was the victor in the iowa caucuses on feb 8 
both gore and jackson have been campaigning heavily in the 
south and gore who bypassed iowa and new hampshire is vowing to 
come on strong in his native region 
gore along with hart virtually ignored minnesota 
bush the republican frontrunner nationwide made no effort in 
minnesota in kentucky where he was campaigning he went to bed 
tuesday night without commenting to reporters on the returns 
for the first time in minnesota an attempt was being made to 
report results of the caucuses on the night they occurred meaning 
the preferences of all those who attended republican caucuses based 
on a straw poll and the preferences of delegates elected at the 
democratic caucuses 
the caucuses began the process of selecting 78 of the states 
87member delegation to the democratic national convention and the 
31 delegates to the republican national convention 
moving the caucus date from march to february resulted in a 
lengthy dispute between the state and national democratic parties 
because the new date is earlier than national party rules allow 
the state party agreed that a presidential preference poll taken 
at the democratic caucuses would be kept secret until 5 pm march 
8 and that the state party would not cooperate in reporting of 
caucusnight results

the attorney for a chainsmoking woman 
under court order not to smoke in her familys presence says he 
will appeal the decision as outrageously unconstitutional 
the order barring elizabeth roofeh 41 from smoking in front of 
her husband and their three children was issued tuesday by justice 
ralph diamond of the triallevel state supreme court 
mrs roofeh also was directed to confine her cigarette puffing 
to a small television room in the couples kings point mansion 
this is clearly a violation of her first amendment rights 
said her attorney joel brandes 
who is going to enforce this are the children going to 
become policemen and turn their mother in for smoking 
the ruling is outrageously unconstitutional he added 
mrs roofehs husband jahanshah 42 a nonsmoking surgeon 
went to court in an attempt to get his wife to stop lighting up in 
front of him and their children ages 6 7 and 9 
he claimed he tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to get his wife 
to curtail her twopackaday habit he described her smoking as 
offensive and detrimental to the health of the children 
the roofehs who were married in 1976 have been feuding since 
may when mrs roofeh filed for divorce which is pending before 
diamond 
the roofehs are still living together 
mrs roofeh who called her iranianborn husband an 
ayatollah said she smokes just to annoy him ill quit 
when i get him out of the house she said 
neal shayne the dean of the academy of law for the nassau 
county bar association said he believes the order was legal 
because its not mrs roofehs rights but the rights of her family 
that were violated by her smoking 
i think its been established that smoking is certainly 
hazardous to a persons health especially to a young child said 
shayne 
mrs roofeh said she has been limiting her smoking to the one 
small room in the couples sixbedroom home in recent months 
its nothing new said mrs roofeh in referring to the 
constraints the judge has placed on her ive always tried not to 
smoke in front of the children 
roofeh said when they were married his wife promised him she 
would not smoke in front of him 
she admits that she broke her promise in 1984 but it was because 
of stress from a stroke she suffered she also has admitted that 
she used to sneak outside when she got an uncontrollable nicotine 
craving before 1984 
in issuing his ruling the judge denied a request by roofeh for 
an order of protection against his wife 
roofeh had argued that smoking cigarettes may be as 
detrimental and reprehensible as would be hitting slapping 
punching or spitting 
the court found however that an order of protection is a tool 
designed to protect family members from domestic violence and not 
to protect against a spouse that smokes 
stephen schlissel attorney for roofeh commended the judge on 
the decision 
it is a natural extension of the law that if a child is being 
harmed by a parents conduct it should step in and safeguard the 
child said schlissel

the japan times of tokyo englishlanguage independent the 
strong belief remains that none of the democratic candidates will 
emerge as an unbeatable frontrunner after super tuesday or later 
in this case brokering will choose the candidate at the 
convention and waiting on the sidelines for just such a 
development is new york gov mario cuomo 
what may be understandable but nevertheless regrettable is 
that campaigning so far resembles a political olympics with a 
concentration on percentage points in preballotting polls and in 
the results this tends to obscure the issues particularly in the

in for a roughhouse 1988 election season 
it is going to be quite a spectacle and the campaigning 
shows every indication of deteriorating into a bareknuckle brawl 
especially among the republicans where the two leading candidates 
have already started slugging away at each other 
none of the other candidates is likely to shake the bushdole 
lead though there could be a rude surprise for both of the leaders 
in some parts of the south where former television evangelist pat

robertson who has sympathy for the south african government a

the independent of london independent it looked on 
occasion last year as if americas method of selecting 
presidential candidates was finally coming to pieces there was 
speculation that nobody of any ability or selfrespect would 
subject himself and his family to the intense strain and 
scrutinizing involved in the race for nomination 
such questions no longer dominate the political agenda 
suggestions that the system is unable to throw up a credible slate 
are rarely heard the political silly season is mercifully past 
 
the main problem for the united states has turned out not to 
be the caliber of the leading candidates it is increasingly the 
quality of government in the final months of a lameduck

he believed had cost him a significant number of votes at a crucial 
stage in the presidential race

disabled americans express greater interest in 
politics than other citizens but they register and vote at a rate 
considerably lower than the general public according to a recently 
released survey 
our findings suggest that barriers either external or 
internal or both prevent many disabled americans from converting 
their exceptionally high political interest into actual electoral 
activity said humphrey taylor president of louis harris and 
associates which conducted the poll 
the most common barrier cited for disabled people was lack of 
transportation and difficulty in getting to the polls problems 
noted by 29 percent of the respondents twentyone percent said it 
was difficult to stand or walk 
the telephone poll of 536 disabled people nationwide conducted 
in june and july 1987 found that 53 percent said they follow 
government and public affairs most of the time 
in comparison only 26 percent of all us adults pay attention 
to politics much of the time according to a 1984 national election 
study by the university of michigan 
the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent

a white man who admitted chasing two blacks with 
a baseball bat was ordered to perform 200 hours of community 
service for the naacp by a judge trying to help him overcome racial 
hatred 
he has been taught to hate black people for some reason 
said cook county circuit judge stuart nudelman im trying to put 
him in an environment where he can perhaps do some good and learn 
something about the people he thinks he hates and perhaps learn 
that his feelings are misguided 
james kalafut a 21yearold plumbing company laborer pleaded 
guilty to aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation and could have 
been sentenced to a year in prison the judge said after sentencing 
him tuesday 
kalafut was charged in august after he and a group of other 
whites brandishing baseball bats throwing bottles and shouting 
racial slurs chased two blacks from a transit stop in gage park 
a predominantly white neighborhood on the southwest side 
nudelman placed kalafut under his supervision for one year and 
ordered him to perform 200 hours of community service work for the 
national association for the advancement of colored people 
details of when kalafut will serve the sentence are to be worked 
out in the next few days by his attorney barry silver the naacp 
and the judge 
silver said before the sentencing that kalafut would accept the 
agreement to perform community service and no appeal would be 
attempted 
i think its a good sentence given the fact that hes 
basically pleaded guilty to hating a minority group silver said 
by being with black people he will have a chance to learn 
they are no different than he is except that the color of their 
skin is different 
i think that is an important lesson for anyone to learn 
especially someone who has been involved in this kind of 
activity silver said 
the attorney said kalafut who declined to be interviewed was 
concerned about his own personal safety when he is in the 
neighborhood of the naacp located on the south side 
silver said kalafut also was concerned about being rejected by 
naacp officials and being made the scapegoat in a sort of reverse 
discrimination 
but the civil rights organization plans to make sure that 
doesnt happen said edward mcclellan president of the south side 
branch 
certainly we dont presume there are only white racists or 
what have you said mcclellan who wasnt sure what type of work 
kalafut would perform racism can be engendered by anyone 
inclined to that sort of prejudice 
nudelman said that trying to help kalafut overcome his prejudice 
against blacks made more sense than sentencing him to jail where 
he wont learn anything except more hatred 
but the judge warned if he doesnt do what hes supposed 
to hell come back before me and ill sentence him to jail

its been a quarter century since betty friedan 
helped launch the womens movement with her book the feminine 
mystique but a recent survey indicates women still do most of 
the cooking and grocery shopping 
when most couldnt persuade the men they live with to help out 
women of all income levels devised their own methods of easing the 
burden mainly by cutting the time they spend in the kitchen the 
new york times reported today 
the times conducted telephone interviews with 1870 people 
nationwide between oct 29 and nov 5 and found that while more 
women are in the work force and have less time at home they remain 
the primary caregivers and the ones who pay attention to how 
when what and where their families eat 
among married couples surveyed only 18 percent of men said they 
do the familys main food shopping 6 percent more said they share 
the responsibility with someone else at home 
meanwhile 91 percent of married women said they do the 
shopping with 3 percent saying the chore is shared 
working full time outside the home didnt seem to make much 
difference the study found that 90 percent of married women who 
work full time said they do the principal family shopping 
as for preparing meals 90 percent of married women surveyed 
said they do most or all the cooking in their homes compared with 
just 15 percent of married men 
last month a magazine survey reported that 77 percent of 
working mothers queried said they prepare dinner by themselves 
and 64 percent said they do the afterdinner cleanup alone too 
in its february issue working mother magazine also reported 
that its survey found 92 percent of workingmother respondents do 
the laundry regularly in their households 
according to that study whereas husbands and children do the 
laundry regularly about 25 percent of the time 27 percent of 
husbands never so much as throw a dirty sock into the washing 
machine 
the magazine found that men in higherincome families were much 
more likely to pitch in than men in lowerincome families

the outlook for us wheat farmers has 
improved significantly aided in part by huge subsidized sales to 
the soviet union 
an additional sale of 700000 metric tons to the soviets was 
announced tuesday by the agriculture department overall exports 
are expected to rise more than 50 percent from last year reducing 
the us wheat stockpile to the lowest level in six years 
in a related analysis the departments economic research 
service said the rising demand and shrinking inventories have 
boosted wheat prices well above last years harvest lows of about 
228 per bushel 
over the entire wheat marketing year which began last june 1 
the national average farm price is expected to be in the range of 
255 to 265 per bushel up from 242 in 198687 the report 
said that will be the first yeartoyear increase since 198384 
looking briefly at 1988 harvest prospects the report noted that 
plantings of winter wheat last fall for this summers harvest were 
the smallest in 10 years spring wheat plantings may be up slightly 
if strong prices entice farmers away from the usdas 1988 acreage 
program 
however weather remains the leading determinate of 1988s 
wheat crop the report said 
the latest sale equal to about 257 million bushels was 
handled by continental grain co 150000 tons tradigrain inc 
50000 louis dreyfus corp 250000 cargill inc 100000 and 
peavey co 150000 
at recent prices averaging 276 per bushel the wheat would 
have a farm value of about 71 million that is a fiveday average 
price through feb 19 adjusted to reflect prices received by 
farmers 
more than 63 million tons of subsidized wheat have been sold to 
the soviet union under the departments export enhancement program 
or eep for delivery in the year that began last oct 1 
william l davis acting general sales manager for the 
departments foreign agricultural service said an additional 
500200 tons of wheat are still available to the soviet union under 
current eep authorization 
under eep private exporters are given surplus commodities owned 
by the departments commodity credit corp so they can sell a 
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive 
world prices 
the sales also are part of the grain the soviet union is 
committed to buy during the fifth and final year of a longterm 
agreement which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 
million tons of us grain the pact expires sept 30 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or soybeans or 394 bushels of corn 
in addition 167 million tons of us corn 800000 tons of 
soybeans and 13 million tons of soybean meal have been bought by 
the soviets for delivery this year

agriculture department economists say 
consumers soon will see lower prices for lettuce 
lettuce shipments and prices should return to normal this 
spring as harvesting moves north from californias imperial valley 
and spring brings improved weather according to a report by the 
departments economic research service both grower and retail 
lettuce prices likely will decline to more typical levels 
last fall prices soared because unusual heat and pest problems 
reduced yields the report said in november and december 
lettuce sold for 20 to 25 per carton at california shipping 
points compared with 4 to 7 a year earlier as of early 
february prices were ranging between 3 and 12 
prices remained higher than usual during the winter because 
cold weather and plant disease transmitted by the whitefly reduced 
midwinter shipments from the imperial valley the report said 
the valley usually supplies most of the domestic lettuce supply 
during midwinter

the state departments secondranking official 
caused a diplomatic and political dustup last week with his 
explanation later partially disavowed of why the administration 
wants to shut down its aid program for ireland 
the remarks by deputy secretary john whitehead generated a stir 
in dublin sent irish diplomats scurrying to find explanations and 
produced expressions of dismay from the shamrock caucus in 
congress 
in the end the state department took the unusual step of 
issuing a clarification that effectively repudiated part of what 
whitehead said 
at issue is us participation in the international fund for 
ireland american contributions have totaled 85 million over the 
past two years and 35 million is slated for the current year 
most of the money is aimed at promoting economic and social 
progress in northern ireland now approaching two decades of 
sectarian strife 
last thursday whitehead went before reporters to explain the 
administrations foreign aid proposals for 1989 and he was asked 
why no money was programmed for ireland 
he said ireland ranks down the list of foreign aid 
priorities adding that the united states does not get a real 
return on its investment despite the emotional and maybe 
political appeal of aid to ireland 
other needs appear to us to be more urgent whitehead said 
both the cutoff decision and the tone of whiteheads remarks 
were the talk of dublin late last week and there were expressions 
of concern from two of the best known irishamericans in congress 
sen edward m kennedy and his nephew rep joseph p kennedy ii 
both massachusetts democrats 
the chairman of the congressional friends of ireland rep brian 
donnelly dmass said he was outraged 
the state department came under pressure to clarify whiteheads 
remarks and did so over the weekend privately one official said 
that whitehead misspoke but the problem was how to set the record 
straight without upsetting him 
after a days contemplation the state department issued a 
statement expressing strong support for the international fund even 
though whitehead had said us contributions to it had yielded few 
benefits 
distancing itself still further from whitehead the statement 
said we have been very happy with the progress which the fund 
and its governing board have made 
beyond that it even implied that the administration would not 
be displeased if congress overrode the aid cutoff and earmarked 
more money for the program 
of course we will be ultimately guided by what congress 
authorizes and appropriates and what is signed into law by the 
president the statement said 
there is some dispute as to whether us participation in the 
program was to be phased out whitehead made no reference to any 
such limit but the state department clarification does allude to a 
threeyear time frame irish diplomatic sources meanwhile said 
funding for additional years had never been ruled out 
in any case the statement appears to have calmed dublin where 
there is a feeling that the congress wont cut the aid program 
adrift 
contributing to the more relaxed mood was the statement by rep 
kennedy the fund has done good work and continues to do so he 
said i for one will be encouraging my colleagues to consider the 
economic and symbolic importance of continued american support for 
the international fund

campaign in a region where vice president george bush is the 
frontrunner 
ive got a big hill to climb in the south dole said tuesday

two weeks ago he won the iowa caucuses and flew to new 
hampshire hoping to deliver a killing blow to bush but new england

hampshire primary and revived his status as gop frontrunner

upon getting strong backing from voters in south dakota and 
minnesota the senator said its a lot more fun winning

minnesota dole said i really believe when the vice president 
of the united states gets 10 percent or around that area the 
sitting vice president and only about 15 percent in south dakota

south korean flags stood at shattered windows on the second floor 
yelling yankee go home as riot police ringed the building 
us embassy officials said they had no reports of injuries but 
the attackers smashed windows and set a fire in a periodical 
storage room thick smoke filled part of the building located in 
the heart of seoul

suicide group claimed they had 18 bombs and screamed at 
surrounding police to stay away they tossed down a statement 
charging the united states was attempting to make south korea a 
colony 
yankees stay out of korea the students yelled 
a police officer said it was unclear how many of the explosive 
devices the attackers had the bombs were crude chemical devices 
possibly some kind of plastic explosive he said 
about 200 radical students hurling firebombs and rocks clashed 
with riot police about an hour later outside myungdong cathedral 
police fired volleys of tear gas at the students who yelled slogans 
denouncing presidentelect roh taewoo who is to be sworn in 
thursday 
hundreds of protesters had gathered at the cathedral less than a 
mile from the us information service office earlier in the 
afternoon for an antigovernment protest down with roh 
taewoo the students yelled 
some of the attackers were reading in the offices library when 
there was a large explosion in a nearby roon and they suddenly 
pulled out bombs and started screaming slogans eyewitnesses said 
at least one of the attackers pulled out a knife and brandished it 
they said 
he was kind of crazyeyed said paul wadden a visiting 
american teacher who was reading in the library at the time 
the attackers smashed three windows overlooking the main street 
outside and two of them stood shouting slogans out into the street 
and brandishing bombs and cigaretee lighters riot police stood on 
the sidewalk below with shields covering their heads and shattered 
glass covered the street 
the students tossed at least one bomb into the street where it 
exploded harmlessly eyewitnesses said a second bomb was tossed 
out but did not explode they said 
people caught in the library said the students did not attempt 
to detain them and they were able to leave after recovering from 
their initial shock wadden said he and other people were prevented 
from leaving downstairs for up to 10 minutes by building guards 
there were about 40 people in the library at the time most of 
them koreans eyewitnesses said 
police who entered the building by the rear entrance overpowered 
the protesters about 30 minutes after the attack began the 
students were taken out of the building in a bus with covered 
windows 
us embassy officials said south korean riot police entered the 
building at their request 
japanese prime minister noboru takeshita arrived at the lotte 
hotel across the street from the us information service office

communist north korea

materials on the united states and operates libraries and

attackers were able to bring weapons into the wellguarded 
building visitors must pass a metal detector present 
identification and have their bags searched and there are police 
guards inside and outside

been installed by the united states 
south korean radicals have repeatedly charged the united states

a retired lawyer who reads dictionaries for 
fun says too many people are put off by big words 
because so many people suffer from sesquipedalophobia a fear or 
hatred of big words 80yearold norman schur has written eight 
books on the subject 
this has gone from a hobby with me to a vocation and finally 
to a matter of sociological and political concern schur said 
tuesday 
schur has just published his latest book 1000 most 
challenging words in the next one 1000 most obscure words 
he plans brief essays on each words origins and meaning he 
believes if a person becomes familiar with a word he or she will 
use it 
schur who received his high school diploma at age 11 and 
graduated from harvard university at age 17 does not blame weak 
vocabularies on the educational system 
there are some welleducated people who do not like you to use 
big words he said if you use a word thats unfamiliar to them 
they resent it and this intimidates a lot of people 
for people who want to improve their vocabulary schur suggests 
they jot down every new word in a notebook master it and then use 
it 
i find reading dictionaries fascinating but thats not the 
menu for most people he said

matchingfunds category if he receives less than 10 percent in two 
successive primaries 
in south dakota gore had 8 percent and hart and jackson each 
had 5 percent all three also finished in the single digits in new 
hampshire last week in the first primary of the campaign season 
failing to get 10 percent in south dakota does not mean an 
immediate cutoff because the law stays such action for 30 days 
after the primary and candidates can qualify anew by getting 20 
percent of the vote in a future primary 
that means jackson and gore who are expected to do well in the 
super tuesday primaries on march 8 are likely to score the strong 
finishes they need before the 30day stay expires 
in 1984 jackson lost his eligiblity because he fell below the 
10 percent threshhold in nebraska and oregon but before the money 
was actually stopped he had regained certification by winning 236 
percent in new jersey 
regardless of whether candidates have been disqualified from 
receiving matching funds to continue their campaigns they can 
continue to receive matching payments to retire campaign debts that 
were incurred before the date of ineligibility said spokesman fred 
eiland of the federal election commission 
matching funds from the federal treasury have become the manna 
of presidential campaigns with the amount distributed to each 
candidate dependent on how much he raises privately 
the federal election commission so far this year has handed out 
close to 40 million to 14 candidates three of those candidates 
have already dropped out of the race democrat bruce babbitt and 
republicans alexander haig and pete du pont 
the fund matches each contribution of 250 or less that a 
candidate raises privately the fund is supported by the 1 
checkoff on individual income tax forms under the public financing 
system set up in the mid1970s by congress 
the sixmember federal election commission votes on candidate 
certification following a review of the campaigns finances by the 
fec audit and legal staff 
to be certified a candidate must raise 100000 across 20 
states in contributions of 250 or less 
vice president george bush and robertson have received the most 
matching funds for this years election each with more than 65 
million 
jackson has received 621828 gore nearly 2 million and hart 
11 million 
at a recent fec meeting commissioner joan aikens attacked what 
she described as an inequity in the law that allows an unopposed 
thirdparty candidate or a candidate who chooses not to compete in 
every state to continue receiving federal matching funds while 
others who place their names on every primary ballot face the risk 
of cutoff 
a candidate whose name is not on the ballot is not covered by 
the 10 percent rule

eric sevareid says news on television has 
become part of the daily entertainment of a rather bored society 
the former chief washington correspondent of cbs news at a 
seminar tuesday at the museum of broadcasting expressed misgivings 
about the rise of featuresoriented tv magazine shows 
underlying this whole development in the way news is presented 
now is the nature and psychology of american society at this 
moment in history after years of essential peace and essential 
prosperity for most people 
we have news about entertainment now youre going to have a 
news magazine on the business side of sports you have a game 
called trivial pursuit 
audiences dont get very excited about policy issues and dont 
want to follow what appears to be 30 years of the same pictures 
coming from the middle east he said 
if you had another great war or great depression that would 
change matters but that would be too high a price sevareid said 
sevareid also said he watched with some astonishment the 
onair battle between cbs anchorman dan rather and vice president 
george bush 
id never seen brother dan lose his cool before sevareid 
said im sorry it happened i dont think a cbs hard news show 
should become controverted neutrality should be preserved

the soviet union will start 
removing its shorterrange nuclear missiles from czechoslovakia in 
the next few days the communist party daily newspaper rude pravo 
said today 
also today east germany said the soviets will begin the early 
withdrawal of its shorterrange missiles from the communist german 
nation this week 
the missiles in both countries are included in an arms control 
agreement signed by the united states and the soviet union last 
december in washington under which all intermediaterange nuclear 
weapons in europe will be scrapped 
the rude pravo newspaper stressed that the missiles are being 
taken out of czechoslovakia before the treaty is ratified by the 
us congress 
word that soviet missiles will be removed from czechoslovakia 
coincided with national celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the 
communist takeover in prague the planned removal of the missiles 
was described by rude pravo as a significant gesture by the kremlin 
a further expression of good will similar to others made by 
the soviet union is that according to an agreement with 
czechoslovakia and east germany it will begin in the next few days 
to pull out from the territory of both states the missile units 
equipped with otr22 missiles rude pravo said otr22 is the 
warsaw pact name for the shorterrange missiles nato calls ss12 
czechoslovakia has never said how many soviet missiles were 
installed on its territory the only location ever given for the 
weapons was a military base near hranice 180 miles southeast of 
prague 
in 1983 nato began installing us cruise and pershing 2 
missiles in western europe to counteract soviet missiles pointed at 
the west the kremlin responded by moving some ss12 missiles from 
their bases in the soviet union to east germany and czechoslovakia 
to put them within striking range of the west 
meanwhile the east german mission in bonn said today in a brief 
statement withdrawal of the soviet shorterrange missiles from 
the german democratic republic will begin thursday the statement 
said missiles would be removed that day from two east german sites 
bischofswerda and waren 
east germany announced last week that ss12s had been 
dismantled put into crates and were ready for transport back to 
the soviet union but it did not announced until today when the 
missiles would be taken out of the country 
east german leader erich honecker in january indicated that 
soviet nuclear missiles in europe could be removed ahead of 
schedule 
according to figures released after the superpower arms treaty 
was signed there are 54 ss12s in east germany

the release later today of fourthquarter us trade figures 
isnt likely to have a major impact on the market either because 
the figures are already known dealers said

product growth could possibly have an effect on the dollar

approved a 25 billion plan for three offshore oil platforms in 
the santa barbara channel a plan first proposed by exxon in 1981 
on an 82 vote with one commissioner abstaining the commission 
approved exxons plans for the platforms a marine terminal and 
onshore facility in las flores canyon 
but the plan which would more than double the states oil 
production requires major changes in exxons production methods 
the company must dismantle an offshore treatment and storage ship 
now in use commission spokesman jack liebster said tuesday 
were talking about stateoftheart air pollution control to 
reduce the current levels he said even with the expansion

honduran death squads linked to the military have 
stepped up their campaign of terror targeting opposition leaders 
human rights activists students and peasants amnesty 
international said today 
serious human rights violations including arbitrary arrests 
torture and illtreatment are widespread in honduras and show no 
signs of diminishing the londonbased human rights organization 
said in a report 
the group said many of the abuses arose during strikes disputes 
over farm land or army operations against leftist guerrillas the 
group also said it remains concerned about the governments failure 
to investigate reports of more than 100 people who disappeared 
between 1980 and 1984 
in the report titled honduras civilian authority military 
power amnesty based its findings on interviews with senior 
government and military officials and nongovernment sources during 
two visits to honduras last year 
the group said recent abuses include bombings arbitrary 
detentions death threats and harassment of critics of the 
government of president jose azcona hoyo despite a civilian 
government the 17500man army wields great power 
victims include human rights figures opposition leaders 
members of labor organizations students and peasants amnesty 
said the victims described severe beatings electric shocks and 
sexual abuse 
the group said patterns of abuse changed since the early 1980s 
when it said abductions and executions were carried out 
systematically by order of the armed forces 
the alleged abuses fell off after 1984 but the death squads 
have apparently begun a new campaign of intimidation in the last 
two years the report said death squads were believed to have been 
involved in three killings last month it said 
two people shot to death in january were to have testified 
against the government in a human rights case before the 
interamerican court of human rights in costa rica 
amnesty blamed most of the recent alleged human rights abuses on 
the national investigations division which amnesty said is part of 
the police but actually is controlled by the military 
the report quoted a former member of battalion 316 which it 
said was a secret military intelligence unit as saying he and 
other members of the group were secretly trained by the us 
military in 1981 
the unidentified man was quoted as saying that the us 
officials discouraged torture but had trained the unit in methods 
of physical coercion 
since 1981 the reagan administration has made honduras a key 
ally for policy aimed at containing the leftist sandinista 
government in neighboring nicaragua 
a series of joint military exercises have been held almost 
continously for the past five years a permanent american military 
presence is maintained at palmerola air base near tegucigalpa and 
at other facilities totaling more than 1000 us troops 
the us military aid program grew from 89 million in 1981 to 
888 million for 1986

acting gov rose mofford may be able to 
run for governor in a may 17 recall election without giving up her 
position as secretary of state the states attorney general said 
attorney general bob corbin in a nonbinding opinion issued 
tuesday said that if mrs mofford is drafted instead of declaring 
herself a candidate she would not have to resign as secretary of 
state 
mrs mofford who became acting governor following the 
impeachment of gov evan mecham on feb 5 has not said whether she 
is interested in running and had no comment tuesday on the 
possibility of a draft 
as governor mecham would automatically be on the recall ballot 
but his status is clouded by his impeachment and impending trial 
before the senate and a criminal trial scheduled for march 
democrat carolyn warner who lost to mecham in a threeway race 
in 1968 and republican john rhodes have indicated they will be 
candidates in the recall election 
mecham a republican faces a senate trial monday on charges 
that he hid a 350000 campaign loan misused 80000 from the 
governors protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership and 
tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a 
state official 
a criminal trial is scheduled for march 22 on felony charges of 
concealing the 350000 loan 
arizonas resigntorun law requires officeholders who run for 
another position to resign unless they are in the last year of 
their current term 
rep cindy resnick a democrat had asked corbin whether a draft 
of an officeholder as a gubernatorial candidate would require that 
person to resign 
ms resnick said she expects a draftmofford movement to be 
started but said she did not plan to be involved 
meanwhile rhodes announced tuesday that former sen barry 
goldwater would be his honorary campaign chairman goldwater 
endorsed mecham in the 1986 campaign but now says that was a 
mistake 
in accepting the position goldwater said you look back over 
all the governors that weve had in this state weve had some darn 
good ones and weve had some mediocre ones but it took us a long 
time to get a really bad one

as the country adopts a new constitution that provides for greater 
political and individiual freedoms roh has promised the republic 
will be the great era of the common man

long tradition of authoritarian rule that strictly limited 
political activity and ruthlessly cracked down on opposition he

violent regional divisions and to redress social and economic 
inequality 
roh on monday called for a government that is loved by the 
people and run in accordance with democratic principles to suit a 
new era 
the new president faces the challenge of ending authoritarian 
rule in a nation that has never had a peaceful transfer of power 
the nation has been dominated by civilian and military strongmen 
since its creation in 1948 and its politics are turbulent and often 
violent 
police were on alert in seoul and other cities today after 
reports that radical students and dissidents may attempt to stage 
antiroh protests radical groups have refused to recognize rohs 
election and contend he is intent on continuing authoritarian rule 
radical groups called for antigovernment protests in seoul and 
other cities today and thursday detachments of riot police were 
seen guarding key points in some areas of seoul and police

stability and continued expansion were vital he warned against 
political unrest

attend the inauguration the united states was to be represented by 
treasury secretary james baker 
roh won the countrys first democratic presidential election in 
16 years on dec 16 with 366 percent of the vote he defeated 
rival opposition candidates kim youngsam and kim daejung who 
split the opposition vote 
roh a former general is identified with the militarybacked 
governments that have ruled the country since 1961 and many koreans 
are doubtful if he can achieve massive democratic change 
opposition parties contend rohs inauguration will simply signal 
a change of figurehead and the government will continue to be run 
by the armed forces and an entrenched elite of government officials 
and business leaders

marched on a military camp today and accused the government of 
betraying the revolution that swept president corazon aquino to 
power two years ago 
about 200 policemen blocked the road leading to camp crame as 
helicopters patrolled overhead but the crowd estimated at 20000 
people by police was peaceful 
the rally was held on a boulevard between camp crame and camp 
aguinaldo two years ago hundreds of thousands of filipinos 
flocked there and prevented troops loyal to thenpresident 
ferdinand marcos from attacking rebellious soldiers holed up in 
crame the fourday standoff ended with marcos depature from the

priests they chanted dismantle the usaquino regime and 
carried effigies of mrs aquino and uncle sam 
red banners said advance the peoples genuine revolution 
and one poster read cory closet dictator 
the protesters denounced what they said was mrs aquinos 
failure to put in place the sweeping economic and political reforms 
she had promised during the 1986 presidential election 
we had high hopes when cory aquino said she would be the exact 
opposite of marcos but after two years we have no more hope that 
she will fulfill her promises crispin beltran head of the 
militant may 1st movement labor organization told the rally 
some of the protesters distributed leaflets of the outlawed 
national democratic front an umbrella organization of 12 marxist 
groups including the communist party of the philippines and its 
armed wing the new peoples army 
the aquino government has betrayed the filipino peoples hope 
for fundamental changes in society after ousting marcos a 
leaflet said it accused the government of incompetence and 
subservience to the us 
the crowd dispersed without incident after about three hours 
us ambassador nicholas platt however congratulated the 
aquino government today on molding a democratic government 
what we have seen happen in this period is impressive platt

by an overwhelming margin a new congress has been freely elected 
and is vigorously functioning local elections have been held in 
every province city and town throughout the philippine archipelago 
in these and mnay other ways democracy has been restored in 
the philippines he said 
in other developments mrs aquino defended her embattled 
defense secretary gen fidel ramos and credited him with blocking 
attempts by renegade military officers to topple her government 
she said as far as im concerned general fidel ramos has 
proven himself not only now but in the past especially in his 
abiding by the constitution he has not been any part of any coup 
attempt 
mrs aquino made the remark to reporters one day after the wife 
of a navy captain linked to at least two coup attempts and the 
assassination of a leftist labor leader hinted that ramos was 
involved in a november 1986 conspiracy 
ramos said that he in fact exposed the coup attempt

an unusually wellpreserved fossil 
skull stumbled upon by a graduate student belongs to one of the 
smallest baleen whales ever known scientists said 
the skull and other parts of the 15foot whale believed to be 
12 million to 14 million years old and possibly related to modern 
toothless whales were found embedded in a sandstone bluff on ano 
nuevo island about 19 miles northwest of santa cruz 
the 35pound skull is a beautiful specimen said kenneth s 
norris a professor of natural history at the university of 
californiasanta cruz 
its one of the best i know of norris a world authority 
on whales said at a news conference tuesday 
brian fadley 26 a ucsanta cruz graduate student said he 
spotted the skull as an irregularity in a rock formation last may 
while visiting ano nuevo island with a group studying elephant 
seals a closer look revealed that it was a whale skull 
since i didnt have the usual tools of a paleontologist i 
modified a rusty pipe to excavate the fossil fadley said 
norris said it was unusual to find a cetacean skull with the 
delicate earbones intact those tiny bones could help researchers 
learn how whales and other marine mammals developed their 
exceptionally acute hearing he said 
the animal itself 15 feet long and weighing 1500 pounds 
apparently was an adult pygmy baleen whale with close linkage to 
the modern california gray whale norris said california grays 
can be as long as 40 feet long and weigh 40 tons 
baleen whales which include the 100foot blue whale have no 
teeth but eat by filtering plankton and tiny crustaceans from 
seawater with bristly baleen plates attached to their upper jaw

an 18yearold british soldier 
was charged today with unlawfully killing an unarmed roman catholic 
civilian in a case that has further strained tense angloirish 
relations 
the soldier david jonathan holden appeared at cookstown 
magistrates court 25 miles west of belfast as british and irish 
leaders met across the border in dublin to discuss the 
deterioration in relations 
in addition to the holden case tensions have increased because 
of the disclosure tuesday that another british soldier jailed for 
murdering an unarmed roman catholic civilian was freed on parole 
after serving three years 
magistrate robert porter ordered holden held in police custody 
until a court appearance in belfast on march 9 the defense said it 
would appeal to the high court for bail to be set 
holdens attorney said the soldier will plead innocent to the 
charge of unlawfully killing aidan mcanespie 23 an election 
worker for sinn fein the legal political arm of the outlawed irish 
republican army 
the british army said mcanespie was killed sunday by a 
ricocheting bullet after a machine gun was fired accidentally from 
an army observation post at a checkpoint near aughnacloy half a 
mile from the border in county tyrone 
prime minister margaret thatcher on tuesday rebuked irish prime 
minister charles haugheys government for ordering its own 
investigation into the shooting british officials said they 
already were investigating 
northern ireland secretary tom king paid a courtesy call on 
haughey in dublin before he joined irish foreign minister brian 
lenihan and justice minister gerry collins today for a meeting of 
the angloirish conference 
the main item on the agenda was proposed british legislation 
aimed at guaranteeing a fair division of employment between roman 
catholics and protestants in protestantdominated northern ireland 
before entering the meeting king said we will be talking 
about all matters of concern to us both and we shall be having very 
frank and valuable discussions this is the value of the 
angloirish agreement it means we can meet to discuss very 
difficult issues 
the angloirish agreement signed in november 1985 gives the 
irish government a consultative role in the running of northern 
ireland 
the conference was set up as a forum for irish and british 
ministers to discuss problems in the province where the ira is 
fighting to end british rule 
on tuesday security forces ringed aughnacloy for mcanespies 
funeral 
cardinal tomas o fiaich roman catholic primate of ireland who 
broke off a trip to san francisco to attend the funeral told the 
congregation mcanespie had been murdered mcanespie was buried 
across the border in the irish republic 
o fiaich said he has never hesitated to condemn ira killings as 
murder adding how can i now avoid using this term murder to 
describe the killing in broad daylight of one of the best known and 
most highly respected men in this parish 
angloirish relations have been severely strained recently by a 
series of disputes principally britains refusal after a long 
inquiry to prosecute northern ireland policemen who shot and killed 
six unarmed catholics in 1982 
news that a british soldier sentenced to life in prison for 
murdering an unarmed roman catholic civilian thomas reilly 22 in 
belfast in 1983 was freed on parole after serving only three years 
has added to that tension 
the british army in a statement tuesday confirmed irish news 
reports that pvt ian richard thain who was jailed for murdering 
reilly during rioting in belfast on aug 9 1983 had been freed on 
parole in february 1987 
thain 21 said at his trial he thought reilly road manager of 
the pop group bananarama was reaching for a gun but the judge 
dismissed his claim 
upon hearing of thains release reillys father james reilly 
said it is unbelievable people talk about british justice but 
where is it today our son was never involved in anything he was 
murdered

the meter has expired on penny parking 
in this western massachusetts town where selectmen voted to 
eliminate onecent meters on two downtown streets to raise more 
money 
selectmen voted tuesday to boost the parking rates on main and 
federal streets the two busiest streets in the downtown commercial 
district to five cents for 15 minutes 10 cents for 30 minutes and 
20 cents for an hour motorists will still be able to park on side 
streets for a penny and a nickel 
the new meter heads will also have quarter slots but 25 cents 
will still get you only an hours parking selectman joseph laurie 
said 
an advisory committee urged the town in january to boost the 
rates maintaining it was costing the town of 19100 people more to 
collect the pennies than it was getting in meter revenue 
the new meters which officials said should be installed in 
about two months are expected to generate an additional 36000 in 
revenue annually the town now gets about 70000 from its parking

programs aimed at helping californias 
preschool children resist sexual abuse are ineffective and should 
be phased out a federally funded study said 
the programs are beyond the understanding of such young 
children may frighten them away from normal affection and unjustly 
make them responsible for the behavior of others researchers said 
tuesday 
the central idea of training the children bears rethinking 
said neil gilbert professor of social welfare at the university of 
california at berkeley 
we should not make 4yearolds responsible for defending 
themselves said gilbert who conducted the twoyear study for 
ucberkeleys family welfare research group 
programs that try to train preschool children to recognize and 
resist sexual abuse reach 42000 younsters throughout the state 
the study of 118 preschoolers in seven counties found that 
attempts to teach very young children the difference between a 
good touch and a bad touch may confuse them 
defining a bad touch as anything that feels bad results 
in children resisting any contact they do not like at the moment 
such as grandmas yucky kiss uncle eds scratchy cheek and the 
tight hug from a wellmeaning relative gilbert said 
thus in the most inclusive view of bad touch children are 
taught that virtually a pat on the head could be cause for 
reporting to the authorities the report said 
the report also said responsibility for protecting children lies 
with adults and not with the youngsters themselves 
teaching 4yearolds they must take charge to control the 
outside world is an abdication of family and social 
responsibility and a sorry message of these times 
researchers said 
however teaching parents alone will not make children safe from 
sexual abuse said pnina tobin executive director of the san 
franciscobased childrens selfhelp project one of the programs 
studied 
it does no good just to educate the adults around the 
child she said what if that adult is the offender the child 
is not protected they must know there are others they can talk 
to

a sorority formed by lesbians has been 
officially recognized by ucla reportedly the first such 
recognition extended by any us university 
the decision allows the ninemember lambda delta lambda to meet 
on campus and apply for student funds but university rules forbid 
exclusion of heterosexual members 
it was very validating for us sorority president allison 
adler said of last weeks recognition by the office of fraternity 
and sorority relations at the university of california los angeles 
although other social and political organizations for homosexual 
students exist at ucla and other campuses gay activists said they 
knew of no other gayoriented sorority or fraternity that has 
formal approval from an american college or university to be part 
of a regulated greek letter system 
i think its fantastic said vernon strickland a leader of 
the washington dcbased gay fraternity delta lambda phi i 
think that means the gentlemen will have no problems getting 
recognition 
delta lambda phi is trying to organize chapters at ucla and four 
other universities its washington chapter isnt affiliated with 
any school 
i never felt any sentimental attachment to ucla before but i 
now feel proud to be a student here lambda delta lambda member 
julie leverence said this week lambda delta lambda gives me a 
supportive atmosphere and a connection to the school 
all nine women members said they are lesbians and said they feel 
excluded at existing sororities 
we are not starting this sorority so we can meet new people to 
sleep with marci kay said we are starting it because we feel 
excluded from the greek system now and that is a network system 
for friendship and professional careers 
lambda delta lambda is planning ways to raise money and attract 
new members and it is also considering applying for membership in 
the panhellenic council which coordinates many intersorority 
events 
we dont just want to be separate but equal adler said

the chief cuban delegate to the un human rights 
commission today accused the chief us delegate a former cuban 
political prisoner of lying about his 22 years in custody 
raul roa kouri cubas deputy foreign minister called a news 
conference to answer the allegations of armando valladares who 
said he was tortured and temporarily crippled while imprisoned in 
cuba 
he was never beaten he was never tortured roa said this 
doesnt happen in cuba he said he called the press conference 
because the credibility of the commission is at stake 
roa distributed copies of documents that included a purported 
confidential us state department memo on valladares and cuban 
arguments against points made in the memo 
valladares named late last year to head the us delegation to 
the 43nation human rights commission has been a us citizen 
since january 1987 in january 1961 valladares was sentenced to 30 
years in prison in cuba he was freed after 22 years following the 
intervention of president francois mitterrand of france 
valladares gained international attention during his 
incarceration by writing poetry that he managed to smuggle out of 
prison 
in a book he wrote about his prison years titled against all 
hope valladares says he was arrested and jailed because he 
voiced his opposition to communism under cuban leader fidel castro 
roa said the book is full of lies and it is boring 
roa repeated cuban allegations that valladares was jailed 
because he belonged to a group that was planning terrorist 
activities to overthrow the government 
he read from what he said was the record of valladares trial 
saying valladares was convicted of planning to take up arms with 
the purpose of overthrowing through violent means the powers of the 
state 
the state department says valladares was not charged with 
terrorism at his trial and that such allegations only arose later 
roa alleged that valladares had been a police officer under the 
government of dictator fulgencio batista who was ousted in 1959 by 
castro loyalists but he said valladares was never penalized for 
this he denied that the cubans had charged valladares belonged to 
batistas secret police 
however a reproduction of an article in the french newspaper le 
monde in 1983 included in the package of documents distributed by 
the cuban delegation quotes castro as saying valladares was a 
member of the gestapo of batista a us spokesman bill 
lawrence said roa was lying when he said valladares had been a 
policeman 
they keep altering their story every year trying to make it 
more acceptable he told the associated press he said cuba had 
also at one time accused valladares of being a torturer but that 
the country now denies having said that

with one lucky rifle shot a young man troubled 
by a compulsion to take fourhour showers and wash his hands up to 
50 times a day cured his affliction 
the man identified as george failed in a suicide attempt but 
the 22caliber bullet he fired into his mouth lodged in the lower 
part of his brains left frontal lobe a region believed related to 
socalled obsessivecompulsive disorder 
if it had gone to the center it would have killed him his 
psychiatrist leslie solyom said tuesday if it had gone to the 
right it would have had no effect 
victims of obsessivecompulsive disorder like george suffer 
from extreme hesitation and doubtfulness solyom said they 
hesitate so much that after closing the door they are not really 
certain they closed the door so they have to go back again and 
again 
george was nearly 18 when he fired the bullet into his brain 
he was found lying on his face blood oozing from his nostrils 
said solyom who practices at shaughnessy hospital in vancouver 
british columbia 
george recovered from the shooting in three weeks we started 
on behavior therapy solyom said but he was no longer 
obsessive 
it was the only change that solyom could find 
his iq did not change there was no change personalitywise 
he did not become an automaton his symptoms are gone solyom 
said 
before the suicide attempt george washed his hands as often as 
50 times a day he would take fourhour showers and would check 
and recheck to see whether doors and windows were locked and 
whether he had enough money in his wallet 
when he pulled the trigger george may have in effect given 
himself a lobotomy 
or more precisely a leukotomy a severing of the links 
between the frontal lobes and other parts of the brain rather than 
a removal of brain tissue as in a lobotomy 
in the 40s and 50s psychosurgeons would get these patients 
and have reasonably good results cutting the pathway between the 
front part of the brain and a part called the striatum said dr 
thomas insel a psychiatrist at the national institute of mental 
health in bethesda md such surgery has fallen out of favor as 
effective drugs have been found 
insel who has specialized in this disorder said sophisticated 
brain images called pet scans show that the frontal lobes are more 
active in obsessivecompulsive patients than in normal people that 
suggests that the source of the disorder lies at least partly in 
the frontal lobes he said 
solyom reported georges case in the december issue of the 
british journal of psychiatry a short report of that study appears 
this week in a newsletter for doctors called physicians weekly 
which describes the suicide attempt as successful radical 
surgery 
solyom said george was goaded into the suicide attempt several 
years ago by his mother she said so look george if your life 
is so wretched just go and shoot yourself solyom said 
dr judith rapoport also of the national institute of mental 
health said that georges accident is reminiscent of the incident 
early in this century that led to the discovery of the frontal 
lobotomy 
a massachusetts railroad worker named phineas gage suffered an 
accident in which a piece of a crowbar became lodged in his head 
she said the crowbar was removed amazingly he survived she 
said 
in those days the risk of infection was high what was 
remarkable was his personality change he became a happygolucky 
bum who sang for his supper and wandered and somebody studied 
this gage had had the first lobotomy

the chairman of president reagans aids 
commission called today for spending an additional 2 billion to 
fight the disease among drug abusers 
retired navy adm james d watkins proposed that half of the 
money should be in federal funds with the rest coming from state 
and local sources 
the additional 1 billion in federal spending called for in the 
chairmans recommendations to the full 13member commission would 
nearly double the total 13 billion reagan requested for all aids 
education and research in the budget he submitted last week 
but watkins told reporters only 15 percent of the nations 
estimated 13 million intravenous drug abusers are in treatment 
plans with long waiting lists in many cities for people seeking 
help in kicking drugs 
anyone crying for help should get help on demand watkins 
said 
moreover he said the sharply higher spending on drug treatment 
must be a sustained emphasis you cannot just throw in some money 
one year and drop it out next year 
although male homosexuals still make up the largest percentage 
of people with aids health officials have determined that the 
disease is spreading most rapidly now among intravenous drug 
abusers and their sexual partners 
watkins recommendations go to the full commission for action 
monday the panel expects to present an interim report to the 
president the following week 
the former chief of naval operations acknowledged that his 
recommendation for sharply higher spending on drug treatment 
programs might spark controversy by opening the way for criticism 
of the administration for not doing more in that area 
but he expessed confidence the full commission would adopt that 
and most of his other recommendations for an interim report and 
said it is not in our charter to worry about the political 
impact 
asked his reaction to the likelihood that presidential 
candidates particularly democrats would use his recommendations 
to zing the white house watkins replied 
how do you avoid politicizing something in an election year 
if they all adopt this and say lets get on with it thats the 
kind of politization i like 
watkins proposal on drug treatment calls specifically for 
adding 32000 drug abuse treatment specialists and said 3300 new 
treatment facilities may have to be added 
in other areas watkins called for more financial support for 
the food and drug administration to double the number of scientists 
reviewing aidsrelated products and a program of direct grants to 
communitybased drug testing programs 
he also made a number of recommendations in the health care 
area including more training for doctors 
many physicians are severely lacking in knowledge about aids 
and there are signs that medical schools have not yet built up a 
curriculum to educate doctors about aids treatment watkins said 
the interim report will not include any recommendations on the 
controversial areas of aids testing discrimination against people 
testing positive for the virus and other social and legal aspects 
to try to adopt recommendations in those areas would result in 
the commissions being at loggerheads with ourselves at this 
time 
but he said hearings on those topics are scheduled next month in 
nashville and promised the panel would not shy away from addressing 
them in its final report june 24

that day by caesarian section said police capt vic morris 
investigators said they did not know how long mrs rentz was 
pregnant when the abortion was performed on oct 27 for medical 
reasons details were sketchy but apparently doctors decided she 
couldnt bring the baby to term police said

rentz was aware his wifes pregnancy was terminated

science instructor at the air force academy was being questioned

a claim that fallout from the chernobyl nuclear 
accident may have caused deaths in the united states is highly 
unlikely and based on an erroneous statistical analysis scientists 
say 
a researcher jay gould said he found an unexplained jump in 
the nations deaths in the months following the chernobyl accident 
however the amount of radiation that reached the united states 
is so small that the notion is not credible harvard radiation 
expert edward webster said tuesday 
webster who serves on a united nations committee studying 
health effects of chernobyl called the hypothesis a mechanism 
which most knowledgeable radiobiologists would throw out because of 
the very low doses involved 
a federal health statistics official says no mysterious increase 
in deaths occurred 
gould said he will present his work thursday at a meeting on 
radiation and the immune system in west germany 
gould a fellow of the institute for policy studies in 
washington says federal statistics show an unexplained jump of 
maybe 20000 to 40000 deaths in the nation for may through august 
of 1986 following the soviet accident in april 
radioactive fallout from chernobyl is the only explanation 
weve been able to develop gould said in a recent interview 
the hypothesis which he stressed was not proven is that 
fallout reaching the united states encouraged formation of free 
radicals chemically reactive molecules that can damage cells 
these molecules the hypothesis continues may have weakened the 
immune systems of some people enough to make them vulnerable to 
fatal diseases 
gould said slightly more than 33 percent of all 1986 deaths 
occurred in may through august up from the average of about 32 
percent for the three prior years and the highest percentage since 
1900 
increases appeared among people older than 65 and those who 
suffered from infectious diseases including pneumonia he said 
the study also looked at peak concentrations of iodine131 a 
radioactive component of fallout reported in milk during the 
summer of 1986 gould said that among the nations nine census 
regions higher concentrations were associated with greater 
increases in mortality for the summer of 1986 compared to the 
previous summer 
the studys data on deaths came from the national center for 
health statistics but harry rosenberg chief of the centers 
mortality statistics branch said tuesday his analysis found no 
inexplicable jump in deaths 
we didnt see anything that departs from the historic 
pattern he said 
his numbers are not consistent with the numbers that are 
adjusted to represent the united states as a whole 
rosenberg also said 1986 had the lowest death rate ever recorded 
for the nation when the populations changing age composition is 
taken into account 
neal nelson a radiation biologist for the us environmental 
protection agency said he was skeptical of the chernobyl 
hypothesis after starting to study information gould sent him 
the maximum dose of chernobyl radiation in the united states was 
only about 1 percent of the normal background exposure he said 
people eat radioactive material constantly from natural and 
manmade sources so there is nothing unique about swallowing 
the tiny amounts of radioactive iodine from chernobyl fallout he 
said

the supreme court today expanded the power of 
communities to impose rent controls ruling that hardships to 
tenants may be considered when landlords seek rent increases 
by a 62 vote the justices upheld a san jose calif ordinance 
that has been attacked as a robin hood law that steals from the 
rich to pay the poor 
while some 200 cities nationwide have rent control laws the san 
jose hardship provision appears to be unique landlord groups have 
said other communities now may adopt similar laws 
chief justice william h rehnquist in his opinion for the 
court said landlords failed to prove that the ordinance deprived 
them of the value of their property without just compensation 
he rejected the landlords claim that the city unlawfully is 
seeking to alleviate hardships for tenants by imposing financial 
burdens on the property owners 
we have long recognized that a legitimate and rational goal of 
price or rate regulation is the protection of consumer welfare 
rehnquist said the ordinance represents a rational attempt to 
accommodate the conflicting interests of protecting tenants from 
burdensome rent increases while at the same time ensuring that 
landlords are guaranteed a fair return of their investment 
todays decision does not rule out all challenges to such 
oridinances but rehnquist said to win their case landlords at 
least must show actual losses suffered because communities lowered 
rents to lessen tenants hardships 
there was no such evidence in the san jose case rehnquist said 
rehnquist also noted that rent controls are based on the idea 
that without them housing shortages would permit landlords to gouge 
renters 
the impact of the san jose ordinance has been muted at least 
temporarily because vacancy rates have been around 8 percent with 
the downturn in the local hightechnology economy that has made it 
less likely that landlords concerned about losing tenants will 
increase rents sufficiently to prompt challenges based on hardship 
justices antonin scalia and sandra day oconnor dissented today 
scalia writing for both said the tenant hardship provision 
takes private property without just compensation in violation of 
the constitution 
scalia denounced the unfairness of making one citizen pay in 
some fashion other than taxes to remedy a social problem that is 
none of his creation 
the san jose law generally permits annual rent increases of 8 
percent on residential property but if the landlord seeks more 
than that it opens the way for challenge by hardship tenants 
who are defined as earning less than 80 percent of the median 
income for the area 
the landlords said that means individuals making 34000 a year 
can qualify as hardship cases 
the ordinance passed in 1979 provides a hearing before a city 
officer to determine if a challenged rent increase is too great 
the increase can be rolled back even below 8 percent for 
hardship tenants if the hearing officer decides a smaller increase 
is justified the landlord still would receive an increase of 5 
percent plus enough to cover capital improvements and increased 
rehabilitation maintenance and other costs 
no landlord in san jose alleged that the law actually has been 
implemented to deprive owners of their propertys full value 
landlords challenged the laws constitutionality shortly after 
it was adopted they said the ordinance in effect is a robin hood 
statute that requires them to assume the public burden of 
subsidizing lowincome tenants 
the california supreme court reversing rulings by lower courts 
upheld the ordinance by a 43 vote in 1986 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the us supreme court 
last thursday did not take part in todays decision 
the case is pennell vs san jose 86753

a civic panel recommending policy 
guidelines to the president called on the government to apologize 
for the militarys bloody suppression of a civil uprising in the 
city of kwangju members said today 
the committee for the promotion of democracy and national 
reconciliation also said the government should compensate victims 
of the 1980 revolt said panel members 
by official count at least 191 people were killed and more than 
800 were wounded in the nineday uprising in the southern city of 
kwangju dissident sources say the casualty figure was much higher 
presidentelect roh taewoo set up the 56member committee after 
winning the dec 16 presidential elections saying he needed 
policy guidelines reflecting the opinions of broad sections of 
the society 
the committee called on the roh government to be inaugurated 
thursday to make an open apology for the kwangju incident and 
compensate its victims 
the committee also urged roh to declare a human rights charter 
in a bid to show his determination to support civil rights 
the committee said a government apology is needed because harsh 
military suppression was partly blamed for the antigovernment 
uprising the worst in modern korean history 
the kwangju incident is a touchy political issue involving roh 
and his predecessor chun doohwan who seized power with military 
backing in 1980 they are known to have played a key part in the 
military suppression of the uprising 
the united states has also been criticized for its alleged part 
in the military suppression of the kwangju uprising government 
critics have alleged that the top us commander in seoul permitted 
some south korean army units under his operational control to help 
crush the kwangju revolt 
the united states has denied the allegations

office on tuesday 
according to morgenthau evans gave the transcript to an 
unidentified person on feb 18 that person notified the district 
attorneys office 
evans is charged with fourthdegree grand larceny which carries 
a maximum penalty of four years in prison upon conviction 
the material did not go beyond evans and the informant and no 
other document relating to the case was stolen abrams said

a triumphant bob dole headed for southern 
campaign territory today with two republican midwest victories in 
hand proclaiming its a lot more fun winning george bush 
dismissed his losses saying you cant win them all 
dole racked up solid victories in minnesotas presidential 
caucuses and south dakotas primary while bush finished third in 
south dakota and last in minnesota 
in portland maine bush said his poor showings were somewhat 
anticipated 
you cant go everywhere he told reporters you cant 
win them all 
jack kemp with dismal finishes in both states took solace in 
bushs equally poor showings 
i think last night proved the race is wide open thats all i 
really needed kemp said in beaufort sc i needed to break up 
the idea that this is a bushdole race 
dole was campaigning today in south carolina which holds its 
primary march 5 three days before the 20state super tuesday 
contest 
a week ago dole lost the new hampshire primary to bush a week 
before that bush lost the iowa caucuses to dole finishing behind 
former television evangelist pat robertson 
robertson who ran second to dole in minnesota and south dakota 
said he was simply delighted with his showing in south dakota 
but he conceded he had hoped for a victory in minnesota where he 
built a strong organization 
this helps me enormously as i go into the super tuesday 
states robertson said today in atlanta i am very pleased with 
what im seeing i believe that coming out of super tuesday i will 
be the acknowledged frontrunner of the republican party with 
delegates 
bush who had bypassed campaigning in the two states went to 
bed in kentucky without commenting to reporters on the returns 
dole for his part was anything but silent 
i hope we send a message that bob dole has a message the 
kansas senator told cheering backers at a victory celebration in 
minneapolis thats what the election is all about i havent 
changed my message im talking about the future ive talked about 
leadership ive talked about party responsibility ive talked 
about the leftouts the downandouts in america 
returns from all but one precinct in south dakota gave dole 55 
percent robertson 20 percent bush 19 percent and kemp 5 percent 
in minnesota with returns in from 80 percent of the precincts 
dole had 42 percent robertson 28 percent kemp 15 and bush 11 
kemp was in a doordie effort to make a competitive showing in 
one of the midwest states on the last weekend of the campaign 
kemp inundated south dakota with biographical television 
commercials that emphasized family values and he spent most of the 
weekend campaigning in minnesota but he spent the election night 
in south carolina unavailable to reporters 
in minnesota the first order of business in the gop caucuses 
was a nonbinding straw poll of presidential preference 
robertson startled party regulars in the iowa caucuses with a 
strong secondplace finish well ahead of bush the former 
evangelist saw minnesota as a similar situation and he hoped to 
repeat his iowa performance 
barb sykora chairman of the minnesota republican party had 
predicted a lot of people would attend caucuses for the first time 
i think there are going to be a lot of people coming for pat 
robertson and for bob dole she said 
where is george bush taunted dole during campaign 
appearances in south dakota and minnesota 
why vote for someone who doesnt come to the state the 
kansas senator asked an audience in minneapolis on the final full 
day of campaigning 
as usual party officials were unable to project the turnout for 
robertson because so many of his supporters were newcomers to 
republican politics 
kemps best showing so far in the race going into tuesdays 
contests was third place in the new hampshire primary well behind 
bush and dole the new york congressman hoped a strong showing in 
minnesota would give his campaign renewed energy 
kemp was staging a bus tour in south carolina today on tuesday 
he told students at the university of south carolina in columbia 
that he expects to do well in the state

a coroner has reclassified as homicide 
the death of an elderly woman whose head was surgically removed and 
frozen in hopes that she could some day be brought back to life 
with a new body 
were saying this was an 83yearold lady that was ill and 
pushed over the edge by the use of a drug supervising deputy 
coroner dan cupido said tuesday 
dora kents death last december at the alcor life extension 
foundation laboratory in riverside has been under investigation 
since january 
deputy district attorney curt hinman said he is fairly 
confident charges will be filed but he did not say who would be 
charged when or specify the charges 
the womans original death certificate indicated she died from 
pneumonia in the absence of a doctor which prompted the coroners 
office to investigate whether she was alive when the procedure to 
remove her head was started 
authorities seeking to force alcor to produce the frozen head 
have been blocked by an injunction 
the coroners office ruled after an autopsy was performed on the 
womans headless body basing its findings on the opinions of 
toxicologists and a pathologist contracted by riverside county 
cupido said 
the womans son saul kent and other advocates of cryonics 
believe in storing bodies or heads at freezing temperatures in 
hopes of someday bringing them back to life through advances in 
science 
kent said today that the allegations of homicide were smear 
tactics to discredit alcor he said the foundation has explained 
thoroughly the use of drugs in its notes regarding his mothers 
preservation 
now suddenly to come up and say that they think its homicide 
is kind of absurd he said 
kent who was at the laboratory when his mothers head was 
removed said barbiturates were administered after death to slow 
brain damage from lack of oxygen 
tests showed levels of pentobarbital and secobarbital throughout 
the womans system indicating she was alive when she was given the 
drugs 
the amendment to the death certificate filed tuesday says mrs 
kent died between dec 9 and dec 11 and lists the immediate cause 
of death as pneumonia and generalized severe arteriosclerosis 
the drugs expedited the death cupido said 
a patient with that the illnesses listed on the death 
certificate given barbiturates will go over the edge he said 
its like you have a gunshot victim who develops pneumonia in 
the hospital and dies he said it doesnt mean he wasnt 
shot 
michael federowicz who was president of alcor at the time and 
was present during the operation said finding barbiturates in mrs 
kents system does not prove she was alive when the drugs were 
administered

the supreme court today broadened protection 
for criminal defendants who claim they were enticed by law 
enforcement officials into committing a crime 
by a 62 vote the justices overturned a bribery conviction 
against frederick mathews of milwaukee wis a former small 
business administraton official 
the court said a criminal defendant should be allowed to 
introduce the defense of entrapment at the trial even if he 
inconsistently denies committing a criminal act 
mathews was sentenced to probation for three years for accepting 
a 2100 loan from james deshazer owner of midwest knitting mills 
mathews was in charge of a program that provides help to 
businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged 
firms 
deshazer acting as an fbi informant gave mathews the money at 
a hotel coffee shop on april 23 1985 and mathews was arrested as 
he left the restaurant 
mathews said he needed the money because he had just been told 
he was being fired by the sba and was financially strapped 
he said he regarded the money as a personal favor from deshazer 
and denied the loan was a bribe to get him to help deshazer receive 
advance payments from the government on a pentagon contract for 
midwest knitting mills 
a federal judge refused to allow mathews to present evidence to 
the jury to support his claim of entrapment unless he also admitted 
that he intended to commit a crime 
the supreme court today said mathews should be allowed to claim 
entrapment while denying he took the money with criminal intent 
chief justice william h rehnquist in his opinion for the 
court noted that an entrapment defense is based on a defendants 
claim that he was induced into comitting the crime and lacked a 
predisposition to engage in criminal conduct 
the government argued that a jury cannot logically conclude that 
a defendant both failed to commit the elements of the alleged 
offense and was entrapped 
but rehnquist said defendants are allowed to be inconsistent he 
rejected the governments claim that allowing inconsistent defenses 
will encourage perjury confuse jurors and subvert the 
truthfinding purpose of a trial 
we are simply not persuaded by the governments arguments that 
we should make the availability of an instruction on entrapment 
where the evidence justifies it subject to a requirement of 
consistency to which no other such defense is subject rehnquist 
said 
justice antonin scalia in a separate concurring opinion said 
he voted with the majority but only because he believes when 
genuine inconsistency exists its effect in destroying the 
defendants credibility will suffice to protect the interests of 
justice 
dissenting were justices byron r white and harry a blackmun 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court last thursday did 
not take part in the decision 
the case is mathews vs us 866109

treasurer a james manchin today backed 
down on his threat to halt all state government checks because of a 
state supreme court decision invalidating the budget 
its nothing more than hot air and a whimper of the wind 
manchin said of tuesdays 32 ruling by the court which said the 
legislature had appropriated 26 million more than gov arch moore 
said would be available the state constitution requires a balanced 
budget 
manchin released a number of checks for hospital workers today 
less than 24 hours after threatening to halt the processing of all 
state bills he said the decision allows for a 60day grace period 
and for a petition for a rehearing meaning the case wont be 
resolved until after the june 30 end of the fiscal year by the time 
the court issues a final ruling 
he called the court decision a token action to appease the 
west virginia education association and labeled it a charade 
legislative leaders say they will ask the court for a rehearing 
with the 60day grace period moore has already scheduled a special 
session of the legislature for april 12 to look at education 
matters and the budget question presumably could be considered at 
that time 
moore a republican had called the treasurers threat to stop 
payments ridiculous manchin a democrat had countered tuesday by 
calling the governors criticism rubbish 
the governor was in welch today and could not be reached 
immediately for comment on manchins decision to release paychecks 
however press secretary john price said moore had a possible 
safety valve a bill he received tuesday would allow him to borrow 
up to 50 million from the state consolidated investment fund of 
pension and workers compensation money 
moore is bickering with the legislature however over a 
provision that requires him to pay the money back by sept 30 
price said 
amid the bitter verbal battle all sides agreed that the state 
was lurching toward a crisis monday when a bimonthly payroll of 
15 million is due to go out to 40000 state employees 
as of this moment all of the checks are stopped manchin 
one of three state officials who must sign all checks had said 
tuesday 
the high courts ruling written by justice darrell mcgraw did 
not tell moore and the legislature what to do saying simply we 
presume the governor and legislature will do their duties 
senate president dan tonkovich a democrat said the legislature 
will petition the high court for a rehearing 
moore who was named as a defendant in the court case never 
contested that the budget was unconstitutionally out of balance 
the state is suffering from slumping tax collections with 
revenue 357 million behind projections as of the end of january 
the new yorkbased investment firm standard and poors corp on 
dec 15 issued a national warning covering 900 million of west 
virginias bonds saying that neither the legislature nor the 
executive branch was addressing the states deteriorating 
financial picture 
the financial officer at west virginia university which employs 
more than 8000 state workers criticized the courts overturning 
of the state budget 
i dont know how you can just shut down the whole world 
said john signorelli associate vice president for finances at the 
morgantown campus 
others supported the ruling including officials of the west 
virginia education association which last year filed the lawsuit 
leading to the decision the suit challenged 135 million in cuts 
for education funding 
i think its great the financing of education is among 
mandated public services the first constitutional priority said 
james caruth executive secretary of the 18500member association 
state house parliamentarian gregory gray said it was the first 
time he knew of that the states budget was thrown out as 
unconstitutional by the supreme court

house democrats scrambled today to assemble 
majority support for thursdays vote on a 30 million 
humanitarian aid package for nicaragua including roughly equal 
amounts for the contra rebels and for children who are victims of 
the countrys sevenyear civil war 
house speaker jim wright dtexas called it the most workable 
kind of program and one that will provide balanced incentives 
for the contras and the leftist sandinista government to pursue 
peace talks called for in a regional accord 
the package was unveiled late tuesday by rep david bonior 
dmich after two weeks of intensive negotiations among several 
factions of the chambers majority party it went before the rules 
committee today where republicans were expected to demand the 
right to offer their own alternative 
president reagan did not immediately react to the democrats 
package his own 362 million aid proposal for the rebels 
including weapons was narrowly rejected by the house three weeks 
ago 
among major elements in the democratic proposal 
about 36 million a month for the contras half to buy food 
clothing medicine and shelter and the other half to pay for 
delivery of the supplies to rebel troops inside nicaragua the aid 
would run from march 1 after current aid expires until june 30 
it could continue until the end of the year if a ceasefire is 
reached by june 30 
about 14 million for nicaraguas miskito indians an 
opposition group that has been carrying out its own battle against 
the sandinistas but has consistently refused invitations to join 
with the contras the indians already have worked out their own 
ceasefire with the managua regime 
a new 14 million childrens survival fund to provide 
medical help for children on all sides of the conflict the aid 
would be administered by nonpolitical private aid groups or 
international relief agencies already working in the region 
not included in the package was any longterm economic 
development aid for the region but a democratic fact sheet said 
congress will welcome proposals from reagan on that subject 
current aid to the rebels expires feb 29 and with it the legal 
authority for the cia to continue air drops of previously 
stockpiled weapons and ammunition the new package contains no such 
authority 
under the new proposal the contras humanitarian supplies 
would be delivered by private contractors supervised by the defense 
department until the contras and the sandinistas are able to agree 
on a ceasefire 
the deliveries would be monitored by the congressional 
intelligence committees and the general accounting office 
congress investigative arm to ensure that no weapons were 
included 
after fighting stops responsibility for delivery would shift to 
a private aid group or an international relief agency such as the 
red cross 
the package also would provide for an expedited procedure for a 
vote on new military aid for the rebels a high priority for the 
reagan administration if a ceasefire should fall apart and the 
sandinistas should fail to keep their promises to democratize 
the determination of whether expedited procedures should be 
initiated would be made by the house intelligence committees 
according to a fact sheet on the package but republicans were 
skeptical of the provision saying it was not a solid guarantee 
that military aid would come to a quick vote in both the house and 
senate 
wright said he was not necessarily confident of the votes to 
pass the package republicans have remained aloof from the drafting 
process holding out for more aid and for continued authority for 
the cia to deliver previously stockpiled weapons 
the key to this really will be how much support it gets on the 
republican side said solarz a longtime contra aid opponent who 
added that he planned to vote against the package 
other democrats said they expected at least 70 in their party to 
oppose the proposal 
the party is seeking a middle ground on an issue that is not 
compromisable said rep robert torricelli dnj it appears 
to me to be an exercise in attempting to cover ourselves and 
avoid political blame if the contras go out of business and the 
sandinistas renege on promises to increase civil liberties 
democrats have argued against new military aid saying that 
providing it would endanger peace efforts talks between the 
contras and sandinistas broke off over the weekend without 
progress and no date has been set for their resumption 
reagan and many congressional republicans have countered that it 
is only consistent military pressure from rebel attacks that has 
forced the sandinistas into peace talks

jimmy swaggart was followed to a 
crummy motel by men who let air out of his tires and 
photographed him as he tried to put a spare tire on backwards 
visited a reputed prostitute and was confronted by a rival 
evangelist a church leader said 
james hamill of memphis tenn a member of the general council 
of the assemblies of god the nations largest pentecostal 
denomination described the pictures in an interview with wbrztv 
here tuesday 
he also said he expects the council to strengthen the punishment 
swaggart receives from executives of his 2 millionmember 
denomination after admitting moral failures 
the louisiana district council has recommended a threemonth 
suspension and counseling for the tv evangelist whose ministry 
reaches more than 100 countries and reported 142 million in income 
last year 
the constitution and bylaws require at least a years 
cessation of active ministry hamill said 
the executive presbytery of the assemblies of god will make the 
final decision in the swaggart case rev everett stenhouse 
assemblies of god general secretary said the group was tentatively 
scheduled to meet thursday 
church spokeswoman juleen turnage said an extra telephone 
operator had to be hired at church headquarters in springfield 
mo to handle some of the hundreds of calls about the case she 
said swaggart had as many supporters as detractors among the 
callers 
hamill described the photographs that led swaggart to make a 
tearful confession of sin sunday and disclosed that the rev 
marvin gorman of new orleans was directly involved in the 
picturetaking 
last year gorman sued swaggart for 90 million charging him 
with unjustly accusing gorman of repeatedly committing adultery 
gorman admitted a single immoral act with a woman 
the pictures which abc news reported last week were given to 
denomination leaders by gorman showed a motel a crummy little 
thing built in an lshape they showed the number of this 
particular room and a woman accused of being a prostitute admitting 
several different men into the room and eventually jimmy swaggart 
going into the room and later coming out of the room hamill said 
and she came out a few moments behind him and swaggart had 
a flat tire on his car these men who made the pictures had the let 
air out of his tires 
when he went into the room they called rev gorman and he 
came down and jimmy swaggart was changing his tire and theres 
pictures of he and gorman talking to one another just pictures no 
sound hamill said 
swaggart struggled with the tire and he put the wheel on 
backwards hamill said 
swaggart couldnt be reached for comment church officials 
wouldnt say where he was 
gorman attorney hunter w lundy confirmed that he employed a 
private investigator reed scott bailey in connection with the 
lawsuit against swaggart 
bailey and another investigator visited a strip of cheap motels 
on airline highway between baton rouge and new orleans to ask 
questions about swaggart a motel resident said 
the woman who identified herself as peggy carrier 39 was 
quoted by the new orleans timespicayune as saying swaggart on 
several occasions visited two airline highway motels where he 
would park his lincoln town car in the rear 
syndicated columnist cal thomas who specializes in 
fundamentalist religions said reports that swaggart sought 
pornographic acts rather than sexual intercourse probably led the 
louisiana council to conclude that he had not technically committed 
adultery which would have resulted in a harsher punishment 
one of the state council members involved in recommending 
rehabilitation for swaggart said the presbyters regard his ministry 
as a gift from god 
we had to look beyond the man to the ministry god has given 
him said the rev jonathan ziegler of violet 
our objective was not only to rehabilitate a man but to save a 
unique ministry that feeds thousands of children a day supports a 
multitude of missionaries and helps improve countless lives with 
the gospel of jesus christ ziegler said 
meanwhile the christian broadcasting network announced 
wednesday that it will not carry any programs from the swaggart 
ministry in which he personally appears so long as swaggart is 
suspended by his denomination 
we have arrived at an arrangement whereby the swaggart 
ministries will provide alternative programming said benton 
miller spokesman for cbn

the supreme court today bolstered the right 
defaultjudgment losers have to challenge a judgment entered after 
they fail to respond to a lawsuit 
the justices unanimously ruled for houston businessman r 
roy peralta in his challenge of a default judgment awarded 
against him six years ago for a 5000 debt owed to a medical 
center 
texas courts had ruled that such challenges are impermissible 
unless the judgment loser had a meritorious defense to the 
lawsuit 
but writing for the high court justice byron r white said the 
texas rulings do not sufficiently protect the dueprocess rights of 
people who contend they were never notified about the lawsuits that 
resulted in the default judgments against them 
for example white said peralta could have worked out a 
settlement or paid the debt or himself sold the property that was 
seized to satisfy the debt 
peralta owned and operated a commercial diving business in 
houston when in 1981 he guaranteed a 5000 debt incurred by one 
of his employees to the heights medical center inc 
the employee failed to make good on the debt and the center 
sought to collect the debt by suing peralta in early 1982 peralta 
contends he was never notified about the lawsuit 
a default judgment against him was issued in july 1982 and 
property his lawyers say was valued at more than 180000 was 
auctioned off to satisfy the 5000 debt 
when peralta challenged the default judgment and subsequent 
sales of his property his appeal was dismissed because he could 
not prove a meritorious defense to the underlying debt lawsuit a 
requirement under texas law 
in ruling for peralta white said where a person has been 
deprived of property in a manner contrary to the most basic tenets 
of due process it is no answer to say that in his particular case 
due process of law would have led to the same result 
he added only wiping the slate clean would have restored 
peralta to the position he would have occupied had due process of 
law been accorded to him in the first place 
the courts vote was 80 justice anthony m kennedy who joined 
the court thursday did not participate in the decision 
the case is peralta vs heights medical center 861430

a federal judge today refused to 
permit testimony about nazi memorabilia reportedly seen in the home 
of carlos lehder rivas who is on trial for cocaine smuggling

federal witness to mention seeing a gold swastika and statue of 
adolf hitler in lehders home in medellin colombia 
lehder 38 a reputed leader of the violent colombian medellin 
cartel is on trial on charges that he conspired to smuggle 33 
tons of cocaine into the united states from colombia via an island 
he controlled in the bahamas

funneled money to prime minister lynden o pindling to protect 
lehders smuggling operation on the bahamian island of normans cay 
us attorney robert w merkle and melton got into an exchange 
after the judge ruled against the jury hearing testimony about 
swastikas and statues in the home of lehder a colombian of german 
descent 
i am absolutely befuddled at the courts ruling merkle said 
if you continue replied melton you will be in contempt 
of court 
bannister said his father the chairman of bahamas world 
airlines had agreed in 1981 to accept 100000 a month from lehder 
for the use of normans cay 
his father received only one months payment

the supreme court today ruled that federal 
judges lack authority to order the government to pay fees to 
lawyers who successfully obtain overdue federal welfare for poor 
people who are aged blind or disabled 
the 80 ruling in a case from arkansas held that federal 
officials are not required by law to withhold a portion of a 
recipients benefits to pay the attorney 
justice william j brennan writing for the court said congress 
made it clear that attorneys fees were not to be paid in such 
cases where pastdue benefits under the supplemental security 
income program ssi are awarded to recipients 
the decision a victory for the reagan administration reversed 
a ruling by the 8th us circuit court of appeals in a case 
involving benefits for mary alice galbreath 
ms galbreath applied for benefits on may 26 1982 but the 
department of health and human services denied her request 
she hired a lawyer anthony w bartels of jonesboro ark and 
he won a federal court suit on feb 15 1985 awarding her 7954 
in pastdue benefits 
bartels then asked the federal judge to award him 1988 or 25 
percent of the amount paid ms galbreath for representing her 
the judge ordered the government to pay the attorney and the 8th 
circuit court agreed the appeals court said requiring payment to 
lawyers in such cases assures recipients will have adequate legal 
representation 
health and human services officials said to comply with the 
ruling it would be necessary to recover the 1988 from ms 
galbreath the department also said it would create administrative 
headaches for the agency since in 1985 alone there were some 8000 
cases involving disputed claims for ssi benefits 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court last thursday 
did not take part in the decision 
the case is bowen vs galbreath 861146

republican presidential candidate pat robertson 
said today that his christian broadcasting network knew the 
whereabouts of the american hostages held in lebanon and he 
suggested that they could have been rescued 
we identified in our news department at cbn the location of 
those hostages in lebanon very shortly after they were taken and 
they were in a position where they could have been rescued the 
former television evangelist said during a campaign stop in georgia 
they were in beirut and they could have been freed he said 
robertson did not provide any more specifics and did not say 
which hostages were involved 
nine americans remain in captivity in lebanon including marine 
lt col william r higgins who was heading the 75man observer 
group attached to the united nations interim force when he was 
captured last week 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press is the longestheld captive anderson was 
kidnapped on march 16 1985 
robertson asked if he had informed reagan administration 
officials about the cbn information said i broadcast it on 
national television they monitor our programs virtually every day 
their speechwriters used to watch us to get some concepts for 
speeches 
in washington a state department terrorism expert said he was 
puzzled by robertsons statements 
the official who requested anonymity said he was unaware that 
cbn ever broadcast the precise locations of any hostages he also 
said it was unclear from robertsons statements which hostages he 
was referring to since americans have been taken captive at 
various times over the past several years 
knowledge of the hostages whereabouts in terms of a particular 
city or even a section of a city wouldnt be enough to mount a 
rescue mission the official said 
in his statements robertson urged the administration to take 
more effective action against terrorists 
the us reaction must be more like the israelis at entebbe 
it has to be quick and it has to be a surprise he said 
last july robertson said he ran into lt col oliver north a 
key figure in the irancontra affair on sept 13 1985 at 
washington national airport the thenwhite house aide said he was 
en route to tehran to negotiate the release of the hostages 
according to robertson 
six days later robertson said he interviewed president reagan 
for cbn saying to the president i understand that a member of 
your official family has gone to iran to negotiate the release of 
the hostages 
during a republican presidential debate on feb 14 robertsons 
allegation that the soviets have nuclear missiles in cuba touched 
off a controversy bringing administration denials 
robertson said during the debate some information came to me 
that the soviets in violation of the socalled khrushchevkennedy 
accords have put some ss4s and ss5s in cuba it seems like 
to me nukes pointing at the united states are more vital to our 
security than nukes pointing to europe 
robertson said he based his claim on testimony by adm william 
j crowe jr chairman of the joint chiefs of staff before the 
senate foreign relations committee 
the day after the debate white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said ss4 and ss5 missile sites established in cuba in 1962 were 
confirmed as having been destroyed in that year we also are 
confident that the missiles were removed from cuba at that time

defense secretary frank c carlucci said today 
james h webb never came to him to protest cuts in the navys 
budget before abruptly resigning as secretary of the navy with a 
blast at carluccis leadership 
carlucci told the house armed services committee that he had 
been forced to make tough choices in cutting the growth of the 
defense budget he warned the reductions mean increasing risks to 
our national security 
carlucci said webb never came to me with any protests on 
budget cuts nor was i aware of his intention to resign until his 
letter landed on my desk 
later carlucci said webb never elected to come and talk to 
me 
in resigning webb accused carlucci of scuttling plans to 
achieve the administrations longstanding goal of a 600ship navy 
he said that could have been achieved even within the budgetary 
limits imposed by congress and the white house 
republican presidential hopeful jack kemp said today that the 
administration and carlucci had made a terrible mistake 
accommodating itself to the mindless cuts in defense and added 
i think the wrong man resigned it shouldnt have been webb it 
should have been carlucci 
carlucci referring to his decision to retire 16 aging frigates 
said the creation of a 600ship navy was not abandoned only 
delayed until the in the 1990s 
tough choices had to be made to accommodate this reduction in 
the short time available said carlucci referring to an 
agreement between president eagan and congress to reduce defense 
spending by 33 billion in two months 
on tuesday reagan named william l ball iii a softspoken 
southerner with a reputation as a savvy behindthescenes 
negotiator to replace the pugnacious controversial webb 
at the same time the white house said reagan intends to stand 
by his 600ship goal even though he wont be in office to see it 
realized it also offered words of encouragement for carlucci and 
the new nominee 
we look to will ball to continue working aggressively for a 
strong us navy spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
budget constraints have delayed a 600vessel navy but it should 
still be realized in fiscal year 1992 or thereabouts fitzwater 
said 
the budget restructuring under way at the pentagon now is a 
difficult and painful process fitzwater said secretary 
carlucci is doing an admirable job hes quite capable and suitable 
to the task and hes carrying out the presidents policies in that 
regard 
of ball he said all of us who know him here at the white 
house know that the navy is getting a strong advocate and a strong 
fighter 
ball is expected to have little difficulty winning senate 
confirmation since the nomination will be reviewed by the senate 
armed services committee where he once was an aide 
the 39yearold has been the presidents chief congressional 
lobbyist since february 1986 before that he served as the state 
departments chief liaison with congress 
from 1981 to 1985 he was administrative assistant to then sen 
john tower rtexas serving also as chief clerk of the senate 
armed services committee in 1981 he also worked as administrative 
assistant to former sen herman talmadge dga in 1978 
the south carolina native is a graduate of the georgia institute 
of technology and was a regular officer in the navy from 1969 to 
1975 
as secretary of the navy ball will oversee approximately 
584000 navy personnel and 199000 marines 
several navy officials said tuesday that ball was an unknown who 
would confront a showme attitude within the navy 
weve had two very exceptional secretaries of the navy in the 
last seven years said one official who asked not to be named 
and you just dont find that caliber of individual on every 
street corner so there is anxiety 
another official said webbs sudden departure on monday had hurt 
morale within the navy but hopefully thats only temporary 
the thing is were used now to having an aggressive secretary 
who really fights for us inside and outside the building and 
thats what we want to see in ball he added

communist party officials today named an armenian 
as leader of a disputed region of the caucasus mountains after 
major protests in the armenian capital that one source said drew up 
to 200000 people 
the official tass news agency announced late today that genrikh 
pogosyan 56 was named by the regional party committee to replace 
boris kevorkov as head of nagornokarabakhskaya 
a later tass dispatch said armenian party leaders had agreed 
with the communist party central committee that the region should 
remain under jurisdiction of the region of azerbaidzhan rather 
than being annexed by armenia 
tass said armenian leaders had gathered to consider urgent 
measures to normalize the situation in the armenian capital 
yerevan but it gave no details of the unrest 
a former political prisoner said earlier that soldiers brought 
tanks into nagornokarabakhskaya to put down protests there and 
that rumors had reached yerevan that some demonstrators were killed 
paruyr ayrikyan the former prisoner said in a phone call from 
yerevan that 200000 demonstrators converged on the capitals 
central square today demanding an extraordinary meeting of the 
armenian parliament to resolve the dispute over control of 
nagornokarabakhskaya 
there are at least 200000 people in front of the opera house 
ive never seen anything like it ayrikyan said he said he was 
speaking from an apartment 100 yards from the protest 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov confirmed that 
the territory dispute had prompted a major street demonstration in 
yerevan 1100 miles south of moscow he said the gathering was 
peaceful and that he not know the number of protesters 
gerasimov confirmed that four senior officials of the national 
communist party central committee were sent to the disputed region 
to quell the protests 
it was not immediately clear whether transfer of power to an 
armenian would end the dispute but the naming of pogosyan appeared 
to be a concession by the party to the yerevan protesters concerns 
today was the second day of unrest in the armenian capital and 
included widespread strikes and school boycotts ayrikyan said 
nagornokarabakhskaya is 1760 square miles in area slightly 
smaller than delaware most of its 150000 people are armenians 
outbreaks of ethnic tensions have occurred with increasing 
frequency over the past year as soviets embrace party chief mikhail 
s gorbachevs call for glasnost or more openness in tackling 
the nations social problems 
in a speech to the central committee last week gorbachev 
expressed concern over nationalist tendencies among the more than 
100 peoples comprising the soviet union and called for a special 
meeting to look into the problem 
in a tass dispatch tuesday the government took the unusual step 
of acknowledging the unrest the report read on national 
television said the demands of the demonstrators contradict the 
interests of the working people 
the government newspaper izvestia on tuesday night acknowledged 
a mass meeting of protesters in yerevan student boycotts and 
the involvement of national party officials in trying to resolve 
the conflict 
todays edition of the communist party daily pravda carried the 
tass report but no commentary on the events 
ayrikyan said two members of the party central committees 
secretariat vladimir i dolgikh and anatoly i lukyanov arrived 
in yerevan on tuesday to calm the people 
today lukyanov and dolgikh persuaded the demonstrators to send 
a small delegation to party headquarters in yerevan to discuss the 
dispute ayrikyan said 
attempts to reach the offices of sovietskaya armenia the 
republics main newspaper for an official account of todays 
incident were unsuccessful and calls to other yerevan telephones 
also did not go through 
ayrikyan 38 spent 17 years in labor camps and exile for 
heading an underground armenian nationalist group in the 1960s 
moscow dissident tamara grigoryants said nagornokarabakhskaya 
in the caucasus mountains north of turkey was deeded to 
azerbaidzhan in the early 1920s 
earlier this month the local government council asked that the 
region become part of armenia citing the soviet constitutions 
guarantee of the right of selfdetermination ayrikyan said the 
party central committee rejected the request 
nagornokarabakhskaya was the scene of other mass demonstrations 
last fall when ethnic armenians marched to protest what they 
claimed was mistreatment by azeris the dominant population of 
azerbaidzhan 
today was also the 70th anniversary of independent estonia a 
small republic on the baltic coast that was incorporated into the 
soviet union in 1940 the official soviet news agency tass 
complained that western political figures were encouraging unrest 
there a sign demonstrations were expected

a new contraceptive which resembles a condom but 
is worn by women will be tested in the united states this spring a 
pharmaceutical company announced today 
the disposable device may be one of the most effective ways of 
reducing the risk of sexually transmitted disease said mary ann 
leeper a researcher at wisconsin pharmacal which hopes to market 
the device 
the company based in jackson wis said the device provides 
more protection than the male condom in part because the material 
is stronger than most condoms and covers a larger physical area 
reducing chances of infection or exposure to body fluids 
the company hopes to submit an application to the food and drug 
administration this summer to permit sales of the device ms 
leeper said at a news conference 
there was no estimate on the retail price 
the product has undergone clinical trials in denmark the united 
kingdom and several other european countries the company said 
the condom was developed by an international group of 
gynecologists and obstetricians headed by danish gynecologist dr 
erik gregerson and his wife bente 
the condom consists of a soft loosefitting polyurethane sheath 
and two diaphragmlike flexible polyurethane rings ms leeper 
said 
one of the rings lies inside the sheath and serves as insertion 
mechanism and internal anchor much like a diaphragm the other 
ring forms the outer edge of the sheath and remains outside the 
vagina

out there weve won in michigan and in nevada 
tuesday night dukakis said after splitting the two upper 
midwestern contests with gephardt this is a marathon its going 
to be a long one 
the massachusetts governor won in minnesota on tuesday and 
dealt simon a crushing defeat gephardt was the winner in south 
dakota with dukakis a respectable second 
dole won both states going away with bush far far behind in 
minnesota the vice president finished fourth behind robertson and 
rep jack kemp in south dakota with dole winning all 18 of the 
delegates at stake bush was narrowly edged for second place by 
robertson 
the former television evangelist said today in atlanta this 
helps me enormously as i go into the super tuesday states he 
added i believe that coming out of super tuesday i will be the 
acknowledged frontrunner of the republican party with delegates 
wasting no time before heading for the next battleground dole 
was flying to south carolina today for four quick campaign 
appearances 
i hope it can help me in the south dole said of his latest 
victories ive got a big hill to climb in the south 
bush was buried in the tuesday night returns running third in 
south dakota and fourth in minnesota after his embarrassing defeat 
two weeks ago in iowa bush chose to head south rather than take on 
dole again in the midwest 
it was up one week and down the next in the gop race after 
doles strong iowa showing bush bounced back to win the new 
hampshire primary a week ago this was doles week again but now 
the scene shifts to the south where bush is regarded as the 
frontrunner 
gephardt and dukakis were quick to hail their midwest victories 
thiswas a great victory that we have had in south dakota 
said the missouri congressman 
dukakis who finished second in south dakota said i think 
its very good news for us because weve finished strong in every 
one of these states 
also able to claim a measure of victory was democrat jesse 
jackson who was leading simon for second place in minnesota 
onetime democratic frontrunner gary hart also had a thumbs 
down for his lonely campaign to let the people decide hart got 
5 percent of the vote in south dakota and 1 percent in minnesota 
unable to get 10 percent of the vote in two consecutive primaries 
hart stands to lose his eligibility for federal matching funds 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee described his thirdplace 
finish in south dakota as a pleasant surprise though he worked 
hard in the state and got just 8 percent of the vote 
in returns from all but one of south dakotas 1151 precincts 
dole had 51529 or 55 percent of the vote compared to 18275 or 
just under 20 percent for robertson and 17416 or 19 percent for 
bush kemp trailed with 5 percent 
that meant dole led for all of the states 18 delegates to the 
republican national convention in new orleans next summer 
robertson was just short of qualifying for delegates with one 
precincts votes uncounted 
none of the other three contests was directly allocating 
delegates although each of the winners was getting an edge in the 
process 
with all but one of the democratic precincts reporting in south 
dakota gephardt had 31226 or 44 percent and dukakis 22367 or 31 
percent the also rans were gore at 8 percent simon at 6 percent 
and hart and jackson at 5 percent each 
in minnesota republican results from 80 percent of the 
precincts gave dole 43 percent to 28 percent for robertson kemp 
was third with 15 percent and bush was running fourth with 11 
percent 
the democratic caucus procedure in minnesota was complicated and 
returns were still trickling in well past midnight with 74 percent 
of the precincts reporting dukakis had 34 percent of the vote 
jackson had just under 20 percent with 19 percent uncommitted 
simon had 18 percent while gephardt had 7 percent hart and gore 
had 1 percent each

cia director william webster testified today 
that president reagan would reject legislation tying his hands on 
covert activities including any requirement that he tell congress 
of secret operations within 48 hours 
webster told a house panel he agreed with the lawmakers goal of 
preventing another irancontra affair by tightening control of 
covert operations but said a presidentially approved national 
security directive would do the job 
the reagan administration has already lost round one in its 
battle to maintain greater discretion on when to notify congress 
the senate intelligence committee voted 132 for legislation that 
includes the 48hour requirement and is similar in other respects 
to a house bill webster is now trying to derail 
a bill which fails to preserve the flexibility and authority 
the president needs to conduct intelligence activities effectively 
will not be acceptable to the president webster warned although 
he did not use the word veto 
members of both intelligence committees introduced the 
legislation after reagan failed for 10 months to notify congress of 
his february 1986 approval of us arms sales to iran and he did 
so only after a lebanese publication exposed the usiranian 
negotiations to free american hostages 
a number of lawmakers said quick notification would have given 
them a chance to presuade reagan that his policy was a mistake 
the law now requires an administration to give congress prior 
notification of significant intelligence activities but allows the 
president to delay that in extraordinary circumstances the 
notification must then take place in a timely fashion although 
the word timely is left vague 
in fact webster said there have been only three times when 
notification has taken more than two days the irancontra affair 
the rescue of americans from iran who were hidden by canadian 
diplomats and the failed military attempt to rescue american 
hostages in iran 
testifying before a house intelligence subcommittee webster 
said many problems in the irancontra affair resulted from 
officials failing to follow existing procedures and rules he 
said the secret operations to sell arms to iran and to the 
nicaraguan contras were run by national security council officials 
who did not normally work with these procedures 
some allowance must be made for that rare case where a limited 
delay in congressional notification is critical to preserve the 
absolute security of an operation when for example lives are at 
stake webster said 
he added that the new presidential policy requires top 
administration officials to reevaluate at least every 10 days a 
presidential decision to delay notification of a given finding

a union representing vatican lay employees 
on wednesday announced a unique way to call attention to their 
salary complaints donating part of their pay to pope john paul ii 
to help feed the poor 
the association of lay vatican workers which represents about 
1500 employees said workers next monday would stage an active 
strike for three hours at the start of each shift to protest 
plans to change their pay schedule 
the workers will do their jobs but will donate their first three 
hours pay directly to the holy father as our contribution toward 
his work and in favor of those suffering from hunger in the 
world a union statement said 
this is clearly a new type of protest said union president 
mariano cerullo we felt we had to send a clear message and the 
best way was to send it directly to the pope 
for years the vatican employees have complained about their 
salaries which cerullo said range from 927 to 1370 a month 
they are exempt from italian taxes work a 36hour week and have 
one month of vacation and 26 paid holidays 
the labor action was called to protest the vaticans plan to pay 
workers at the end of each month like most employees in italy 
until now most vitan workers have been getting their paychecks on 
the first day of the month 
the union said the change will cause hardship to the families of 
the vatican employees vatican officials have said the change is 
primarily to facilitate administrative matters 
the change also would affect about 1000 religious employees of 
the vatican 
the lay employees work at the vatican museums post office main 
library the daily newspaper losservatore romano and vatican radio 
and many offices

sen paul simon of illinois said today he 
would not challenge his democratic rivals including tuesdays 
winners michael dukakis and richard gephardt in the march 8 super 
tuesday contests but would rejoin the battle the next week 
his announcement came one day after dukakis and gephardt each 
notched their second victories of the campaign in minnesota and 
south dakota respectively with simon well back in both states 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts won the new hampshire 
primary last week and rep gephardt of missouri was the victor in 
iowa the week before 
simon told reporters he would bypass the primaries and caucuses 
being held in 20 states on super tuesday because he didnt have 
the resources for winning there 
but he promised to continue his campaign in his home state and 
in the primaries that follow 
the campaign will begin anew after super tuesday starting in 
illinois simon said 
he spoke of growing evidence that for the first time in recent 
history there will be no firstballot winner at the democratic 
convention and he said the primaries and caucuses on march 8 
will not clear up the confusion 
super tuesday is likely to result in a very mixed picture 
he said 
dukakis and gephardt meanwhile were settling in for a lengthy 
slugout 
this is a marathon dukakis said its going to be a long 
one 
each had something to crow about the missouri congressman 
pointed to his great victory while dukakis gleefully noted 
that minnesota is a long way from massachusetts trumpeting 
the fact that he has shown votegetting power outside his home turf 
we did well in these two states which are a long way from 
massachusetts and very much in the backyard of some of the rest of 
these candidates dukakis said in new york city referring to 
gephardt and paul simon the illinois senator 
remember im somebody that nobody knew in the midwest 
dukakis said 
gephardt in texas was exultant its a great victory in 
south dakota he said tonight is a gephardt night 
dukakis targeted both south dakota and minnesota early but 
gephardt staged a lastminute campaign blitz in south dakota in an 
effort to head off a midwest sweep by his rival 
with all but one precinct counted in south dakota gephardt had 
44 percent followed by dukakis at 31 percent trailing were 
tennessee sen albert gore jr at 8 percent simon at 6 percent 
gary hart and jesse jackson at 5 percent and 10 votes apart 
with 74 percent of the vote in minnesota dukakis had 34 
percent jackson 20 percent simon 18 percent gephardt 7 percent 
and uncommitted 19 percent gore had 1 percent and hart trailed 
with just 179 votes 
gore and hart had virtually ignored minnesota 
gore tried to look past his dismal showings in the two states 
we didnt focus on it he said from arkansas i made it clear 
from the beginning of the campaign were focusing on the national 
primary march 8 when over 1000 delegates will be selected 
jackson in new york city said his minnesota showing indicated 
we are attractive to voters in every region with the scene 
shifting southward jackson was considered well positioned for 
super tuesday march 8 when 20 states mostly in the south will 
hold primaries and caucuses 
dukakis was the bestorganized democratic candidate in minnesota 
and spent the most money his supporters recognized that anything 
less than a victory in minnesota would jolt his effort to prove he 
could win outside the northeast 
gephardt ran ads in south dakota asserting that dukakis knew 
nothing of agriculture recalling dukakis suggestion in iowa a 
year ago that frmers should turn to products such as belgian endive 
and blueberries dukakis countered with an ad saying that while 
dick gephardt has been publicly promising to fight for you hes 
taking political action committee money from corporate insiders and 
washington lobbyists 
south dakota and minnesota democrats bucked the national party 
to hold their contests earlier than party rules allowed 
under a compromise worked out with south dakota the vote in the 
democratic primary was legally nonbinding although the results 
were to help determine the allocation of delegates a march 12 
statewide caucus will apportion delegates according to the primary 
results 
under the agreement with minnesota the presidential preference 
poll taken at the democratic caucuses was to be kept secret by the 
party until 5 pm on march 8 but the state set up an independent 
reporting system to gather caucus results and make them public

the government today banned 
all political activities of the countrys largest antiapartheid 
organization the united democratic front and 16 other groups in 
one of its harshest crackdowns on the opposition 
it banned several front leaders individually from working for 
the organization writing articles giving speeches or granting 
interviews it also ordered that the main black labor federation 
the militant congress of south african trade unions limit its 
activities only to labor issues and stay out of politics 
the government has declared war against all peaceful 
opposition said azhar cachalia treasurer of the united 
democratic front and one of its few leaders not in detention the 
front represents more than 600 antiapartheid organizations with 
more than 2 million members 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace 
prize for his fight against apartheid also said many south 
africans would see the restrictions as a declaration of war 
the governments idea of reform is to smash all effective 
possible political opposition in the country no matter how 
peaceful and lawful and to rule with a jackboot tutu said he 
appealed to the united states and other western countries to 
intensify economic pressure on south africa 
the restrictions announced in a special government gazette do 
not technically outlaw the front and the other groups but 
effectively ban them by prohibiting them from carrying on any 
activities not approved by law and order minister adriaan vlok 
the crackdown affects virtually all of the largest militant 
black political groups in south africa and appears aimed at 
eliminating competition for black moderates willing to accept the 
concept of white political control 
the copresident of the united democratic front archie gumede 
was taken away by police from his office in durban served with 
individual banning orders and released colleagues said albertina 
sisulu the other copresident was barred from leaving her home 
between 6 pm and 5 am and also was affected by the new orders 
the united states in a statement issued in washington and 
pretoria said it was appalled by the ban by acting to 
outlaw the nonviolent political activity of these organizations 
the south african government dealt a severe blow to efforts to 
achieve a peaceful solution to south africas problem it is a 
giant step backward for south africa said the statement issued 
by the us embassy in pretoria 
britain the staunchest opponent of sanctions against south 
africa condemned the crackdown foreign secretary sir geoffrey 
howe said the oppressive restrictions could breed more violence 
the rev allan boesak a cofounder of the front said the 
government had acted out of frustration because its tough tactics 
during a 20monthold state of emergency had failed to quell 
militant opposition 
it is not possible really to ban the udf he said in a 
telephone interview the udf is much less an organization than a 
symbol of the determination of south africas oppressed people to 
be free 
he said one of the governments aims was to crush organizations 
that planned to call for a boycott of black municipal elections 
scheduled for october if the united democratic front was unable to 
promote a boycott he said he would do so personally 
under the restrictions the organizations will be permitted to 
maintain bank accounts perform administrative functions and 
undertake legal action but no other activities will be permitted 
unless authorized by vlok 
several of the affected groups said they would challenge the new 
orders in court 
vlok who signed the order said the regulations will 
contribute to a climate of stability peaceful coexistence and good 
neighborliness among all population groups 
he said the groups affected by the regulations encouraged civil 
disobedience and rebellion advocated alternatives structures to 
replace official ones and waged campaigns of intimidation 
antiapartheid activists had anticipated some type of crackdown 
this year suggesting that president pw bothas national party 
government would move to blunt criticism from extremeright white 
opponents 
the order comes exactly a week before two parliamentary 
byelections in which candidates from the farright conservative 
party are favored to beat national party candidates the 
conservatives oppose even the limited racial reforms implemented by 
botha over the past few years 
in addition to the united democratic front groups affected by 
the ban include 
the azanian peoples organization the largest group espousing 
the black consciousness philosophy pioneered by steve biko an 
activist who died in police custody in 1977 
the national education crisis committee which has sought to 
promote peoples education in which black communities would 
exercise greater control over their schools 
the detainees parents support committee which monitors 
detentions and provides support for relatives of people detained 
without charge 
the soweto civic assoiciation the main antiapartheid 
community group in the countrys largest black township and a key 
factor behind the rent boycott which has persisted there for nearly 
two years 
other affected groups include local and regional youth and 
community organizations and the release mandela committee a group 
which campaigns for the release of jailed african national congress 
leader nelson mandela 
the black trade union congress known as cosatu said vloks 
order has turned the clock back to the days of absolute control 
and no democracy 
the order demonstrates that the government is completely 
incompetent said cosatus spokesman frank meintjies the end 
result is going to be conflict fear and uncertainty 
the countrys 5 million whites control the government and 
economy and maintain segregated living areas schools and 
hospitals the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs

republican senators reacted angrily today 
after us capitol police seized sen robert packwood and carried 
him to the senate floor feet first to answer a quorum call 
during an allnight filibuster over campaign financing legislation 
sen arlen specter rpa said the parliamentary arrest of 
packwood by senate sergeantatarms henry guigni and five 
plainclothes capitol policemen was demeaning and pointless 
packwood was treated like a common criminal brought 
forcefully to the floor of the united states senate said specter 
but several republican senators actually ran away from police to 
avoid arrest said sen dale bumpers dark 
senators went off in a dead sprint they should have been in 
calgary in one of the olympic events he said the spectacle of 
a united states senator running from the sergeantatarms in order 
to keep from being compelled to attend a session of the united 
states senate is an outrage 
packwoods spokesman bob witeck said the oregon republican 
reinjured a broken hand which has been in a cast the last two 
weeks when the police entered his office with a passkey witeck 
said that packwood went to a hospital early today to have xrays 
taken but that no new breaks were found 
sen orrin hatch rutah said packwoods arm was severely 
jostled and hurt by banana republic tactics 
when a senator is locked in his own chamber i question 
whether it is constitutionally sound to break into his office and 
force him out of his office and carry him to the floor hatch 
said 
packwoods spokesman said the senator tried to hold the door 
closed with his shoulder but they were able to push it open 
i had to take him in siad guigni a onetime honolulu 
motorcycle and vice officer i knew he was not going in under his 
own power 
guigni said packwood walked with the detectives to the capitol 
but made it clear he would not walk into the chamber we picked 
him up in the elevator and carried him to his desk guigni said 
the motion to arrest absent senators was made by senate majority 
leader robert byrd of west virginia and was approved on a 453 roll 
call vote with democratic senators dennis deconcini of arizona 
howell heflin of alabama and richard shelby of alabama voting no 
specter said the actual warrants were signed by sen brock adams 
dwash 
senate officials said the arrest was the first since democratic 
senators burnet rhett maybank of south carolina and lister hill of 
alabama were compelled to come to the floor in 1942 
packwood a leader of gop opposition to a democratic campaign 
finance bill was brought in by four officers under terms of an 
unusual motion approved through late tuesday by the majority 
democrats 
the democrats who were forcing the republicans to wage the 
filibuster in an effort to subdue the gop opposition to the 
democrats proposed limits on campaign spending and contributions 
from political action committees employed the rarely used 
procedure to require absent members to answer quorum bells or face 
arrest 
republicans had been taking turns holding the floor to prevent 
the democrats from bringing the bill to a vote they can win this 
upset the democrats who had been forced to stay close to the 
chamber maintain a quorum and keep the senate in session 
when most republicans stopped answering quorum calls the 
democrats resorted to ordering guigni to scour the hallways and 
offices and arrest absent senators he carried warrants for each of 
the 46 republicans 
packwood was found in his russell building office guigni said 
i had to shove in a door to get into his office guigni 
said i think he hurt his finger he was very courteous 
packwood was not available for immediate comment 
some 13 hours after the filibuster began the two sides called a 
truce of sorts republicans would continue to talk but there would 
be no more quorum calls until 10 am giving most members a chance 
to sleep 
as dawn broke sen david durenberger rminn wound up an hour 
of holding the floor speaking against the bill in a steady 
conversational tone 
ive immensely enjoyed this particularly at this time of day 
theres nothing id rather be doing durenberger said as turned 
control of the floor over to sen john h chafee rri 
durenberger spoke to an almostempty chamber freshman sen kent 
conrad dnd sat at the podium while sen wendell ford dky 
represented the democratic side of the aisle 
eight teenaged pages sat quietly on the carpeted steps leading 
to the podium and a few detectives sat in the otherwise empty 
gallery 
the fullfledged filibuster was formally proclaimed by 
majority leader robert byrd dwva on tuesday after republicans 
had done for five days what they had done for 22 days last year 
prevent a vote on the democrats campaign spending bill 
byrd has the votes to pass the bill which would set voluntary 
spending limits for senate general elections but he is still about 
five votes short of the 60 he needs to shut off debate and force a 
roll call 
early today democrats filed a cloture petition which probably 
will be considered on friday 
republicans who last year beat byrd on a record seven cloture 
votes say the proposed system to curb escalating campaign spending 
would prevent them from gaining seats in heavily democratic states 
dove said the filibuster is the chambers first knockdown test 
of attrition since a nineday battle in 1960 over civil rights 
legislation 
four senators from each camp have been negotiating since last 
week trying to find a compromise they say they have found some 
common ground on issues such as better disclosure of money going to 
political paries and forcing broadcasters to offer rockbottom ad 
rates to candidates 
but they report nothing but disagreement over limiting campaign 
spending which has risen from 600000 for the average senate race 
in 1976 to 3 million in 1986 with a bigstate race often topping 
10 million 
the chief gop negotiator mitch mcconnell of kentucky said 
republicans were willing to discuss a compromise on another 
democratic demand putting a ceiling on how much money a candidate 
can get from political action committees 
the democrats bill would establish voluntary spending limits 
ranging from 950000 to 55 million depending on a states 
population 
a candidate observing the limit would get campaign funds from 
the treasury if the opponent exceeded the limit or an independent 
group spent large amounts of money against the candidate 
the republicans would have some limits on individual pac 
contributions while strengthening campaignfinance disclosure 
requirements and opposing spending limits

federal trade commission member terry calvani 
escaped a contempt of congress citation wednesday by turning over 
documents demanded by a congressional panel but he said he felt he 
had become a scapegoat in a turf fight between two congressmen 
calvani had been subpoenaed to appear before the house committee 
on energy and commerces subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations because he had refused to turn over some internal 
ftc documents sought by the panel concerning unfair advertising 
practices by the airline industry 
he told the panel that the subcommittees insistence on 
obtaining internal advisory documents represents a very poor 
development in the exercise of this subcommittees oversight 
reponsibilities over the federal trade commission 
calvani said that violation of the confidence between a 
commissioner and his or her personal attorneyadvisers makes 
government less efficient 
i tell the men and women that serve in my office that i want 
their wholly candid assessment and unvarnished recommendation about 
matters before me calvani said due to the subcommittees 
insistence on access to internal documents he said this morning 
i have instructed my staff that from henceforth they should not 
commit their work to paper 
he said that until friday the panel had not provided the legal 
justification for him to provide the documents and said he could 
not test the legality of the demand without being willing to stand 
criminal trial 
to my knowledge this kafkaesque mode of operations is unique 
in our system of justice calvani said 
after his appearance calvani said he believed he had become 
caught in a turf fight between panel chairman john d dingell 
dmich and rep james j howard dnj chairman of the 
committee on public works and transportation 
im the pawn he said they were looking for a scapegoat 
and im the unfortunate person chosen for that 
subcommittee counsel patrick mclain refused to comment on 
calvanis allegation dingells office referred all request for 
comment to mclain 
at issue were internal documents concerning the ftcs views on 
whether unfair and deceptive advertising practices were occurring 
in the airline industry 
a letter on the matter from the ftc to the national association 
of attorneys general indicated that the agency had not studied the 
matter but a press release on the report indicated that the agency 
believed there was no problem with the airline industrys practices 
a reference to the press release comment included in a story by 
the washington post was read on the house floor last october and 
helped defeat an amendment by dingell that would have transferred 
responsibility for oversight for consumer protection regarding the 
airline industry from the department of transportation to the ftc 
mclain said 
the subcommittee began asking the ftc for internal documents on 
the matter several days later two commissioners said they had no 
such documents two others allowed subcommittee staff to read 
pertinent materials in their offices but calvani refused to 
provide access to such documents 
after several letters back and forth between the subcommittee 
and calvani who was insisting on the legal justification for the 
demand the panel on feb 4 subpoenaed calvani to appear and bring 
the documents

throughout the nation 
feb 23 
tulsa okla world on jimmy swaggart 
jimmy swaggarts tearful confession of sin presumably sexual 
misconduct was greeted with immediate forgiveness by many of his 
followers sunday 
some of his parishioners went beyond mere charity they praised 
swaggart for his admission it took a man to do that 
the reaction of the public is likely to be less tolerant 
swaggarts confession reportedly came only after he was confronted 
with photographs showing him entering a motel room with a 
prostitute 
the socalled pearly gate scandals vary in some ways but 
there seems to be one common rule if you get caught confess and 
ask forgiveness but only if you get caught

charleston wva dail mail on us support of contras 
democratic leaders in congress hooted when president reagan 
wanted to give military aid to the nicaraguan contras in case the 
peace process broke down in central america 
they should now send the same message to the marxist regime in 
nicaragua 
with the contras out of the way sandinistabacked warriors have 
picked up the pace of their battles elsewhere 
americans who decry contra involvement in the deaths of 
nicaraguans might also find time to mourn victims of the 
sandinistabacked marxist guerrillas in el salvador 
reagans plan to keep the contra movement alive as a check on 
the sandinistas was prudent and necessary

the times record brunswick maine on filing tax returns early 
the head of the internal revenue service is worried by a trend 
among many taxpayers to delay filing their federal tax returns 
according to irs commissioner lawrence gibbs five years ago 14 
percent of all individual returns were filed in january and 34 
percent in april last year only 4 percent were filed in january 
and almost 40 percent in april 
gibbs told a senate finance subcommittee that the trend if 
exacerbated by the 1986 tax reform law could pose big problems for 
the irs 
thats because the government is obligated to pay interest on 
refunds whenever returns are not processed within a 45day period 
after april 15 
hes unlikely to generate much sympathy among taxpayers with 
that complaint 
the irs ought to be glad that every taxpayer does not wait until 
april 15 to file

baltimore sun on president reagans budget 
for the first time in years president reagan has sent congress 
a budget that wasnt immediately dismissed as dead on arrival 
the 11 trillion budget for 1989 has been received on 
capitol hill as his most realistic spending plan 
the note of realism injected into this years spending proposal 
reflects the twoyear budget agreement reagan reached with congress 
last year after the stock market crash brought home the drastic 
need for deficit reduction 
it reflects the politics of this year an election year in which 
the president lacks the kind of muscle needed to push through 
daring new proposals 
and it reflects the constraints imposed by huge deficits which 
rose to record levels during the reagan years

los angeles daily news on oscar nonnominations 
yes well probably be seated in front of our sets on april 11 
tuned in to watch the academy awards 
but that doesnt mean something wont be missing once again the 
academy of motion picture arts and sciences has snubbed director 
steven spielberg 
this time spielbergs empire of the sun failed to be 
nominated for best picture and spielbergs name was conspicuously 
absent from the best director category 
of course its the academys right to make its own nominations 
but its too bad that hollywoods elite has chosen repeatedly to 
ignore spielberg who has captivated the country as few other 
living directors have done 
spielberg has the talent to make american film classics that 
will entertain young and old for generations 
perhaps thats too much talent to bring him recognition from his 
peers

farmington nm daily times on president reagans budget 
president reagan has submitted a 11 trillion federal budget to 
congress for the fiscal year beginning next oct 1 
reagan campaigned for the presidency eight years ago with a 
promise to balance the federal budget 
he has failed to provide the kind of leadership that would 
encourage congress to act in a fiscally responsible fashion 
as a result we can expect annual budgets of more than 1 
trillion and continued growth of the national debt now somewhere 
around 25 trillion 
to the millions of taxpayers who had looked to reagan to clamp 
down on the big spenders in washington his two terms in the white 
house have been a dismal failure

kennedy had to deal with 
william manchester in the making of the president 1960 
noted that kennedy turned the bias issue so that a vote for kennedy 
signified religious tolerance while a vote for hubert humphrey

gephardts campaign however hardly sounded presidential after 
an iowa caucus victory and a second place in the nations first

his campaign manager william carrick didnt make his boss 
sound like much of a frontrunner 
among other things carrick called us sen albert gore and his 
presidential campaign staff twobit bastards followed by 
meddlesome bastards 
only after several days did carrick apologize for the remarks 
gore and his camp took the unintended compliment with good 
grace refusing to engage in a namecalling match 
apparently gephardts campaign manager thinks gore is someone

reading pa eagle on social security 
is social security strictly a retirement account or is it an 
annuity that takes effect when a participant reaches age 65 and is 
eligible for full benefits or reaches age 62 and is eligible for 
reduced benefits 
thats the argument that has flared in washington once again as 
the effort is launched to eliminate the 8400 a year earnings cap 
those who support the proposal argue that the cap punishes 
the elderly 
critics insist the original intent of social security was to 
provide income after retirement they tread on uncertain grounds 
however when they bring up the matter of the original intent of 
social security 
original intent was changed in a wholesale manner by 
revisions a notable example of that is that widows of farmers who 
never paid social security taxes were granted benefits 
also the earnings cap ends at age 70 if earnings are a 
factor between the ages of 65 and 70 why not after 70 
repeal of the earnings cap is clearly in the public interest

the tacoma wash news tribune on violence in israelioccupied 
areas 
at first it seemed too reprehensible to be true at this 
distance from israel americans couldnt know for certain whether 
to believe a report that israeli soldiers had severely beaten four 
palestinian youths and then buried them alive using a bulldozer 
the allegation it turns out is fact 
the youths who were dug out by villagers after the soldiers 
left the scene in the west bank village of kfar salem all 
surivived the youths were being punished for participating 
in disturbances 
even israelis who have supported the governments policy of 
force might and beatings to quell palestinian unrest in the 
occupied territories were stunned by the news reports on the 
incident 
israel is going to have to make a choice it will have to choose 
between continuing an indefensible policy of repression in the 
occupied areas or taking steps to address the legitimate 
grievances of more than 500000 palestinians living under israeli 
control 
israels future as a nation of democratic ideals depends on the 
outcome

the american association of blood banks 
announced wednesday it is studying new screening techniques that 
may further reduce the chances of the aids virus being transmitted 
through blood donations 
the aabb said the new study was prompted by reports that have 
raised concerns about the safety of blood transfusions administered 
to over 4 million people in the united states annually 
the aabb cited a study published feb 25 in the new england 
journal of medicine which traced 13 units of blood infected by the 
aids virus back to seven people who donated blood even though they 
had been recently exposed to the virus 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal disease 
caused by the human immunodeficiency virus it is spread most often 
through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers 
infected blood or blood products and from infected pregnant women 
to their offspring 
donated blood is routinely tested for the hiv virus but the 
tests are able only to detect antibodies which may not develop 
until long after the exposure to the virus the aabb said its study 
will test for the hiv antigen a marker that may appear in the 
blood of an infected person before the antibodies 
the results of this study will determine if an antigen test 
would be useful in detecting individuals in early stages of 
infection who donate blood the statement said it added that 
there are currently no tests for the antigen that have been 
licensed 
dr paul j schmidt the aabb president said current tests are 
nearly 99 percent sensitive but do not detect people recently 
exposed to hiv 
we expected that there would be some infection developing in 
transfusion recipients he said we are working on solutions to 
the problem of detecting persons even earlier iln this infectious 
state and on how to discourage them from donating blood 
schmidt added the risk from not getting a needed transfusion 
is infinitely greater than the risk of getting one 
the federal centers for disease control estimates that at least 
12000 americans have been infected by the aids virus from 
transfusions given before rigorous bloodscreening programs were 
adopted that reduced the presence of the virus in blood supplies to 
less than one unit in 50000 
as of feb 15 aids had been diagnosed in 53814 americans of 
whom more than half or 30158 have died since 1981 according to 
the cdc no one is known to have recovered from aids 
aids kills by destroying the immune system leaving patients 
susceptible to opportunistic infections which often prove fatal 
blood banks now screen donor candidates for aids risk factors 
but the aabb said it would review these procedures to determine if 
they should be tightened 
the aabb is the worlds largest organization of blood banks and 
transfusion services with 2500 members it accredits blood banks 
and transfusion services and sets standards for agencies collecting 
nearly half the nations donated blood

bryancollege station texas eagle on president reagans budget 
ronald reagan is going down in history as the countrys biggest 
spendthrift president he has put the nation in hock to the hilt 
and mortgaged the future of our children and their children 
the budget he presented to congress last week raised the 
national debt to 25 trillion a figure that has doubled during 
his administration interest payments alone cost 140 billion a 
year 
to be sure the president has had lots of help getting us into 
all this trouble it was only with the help of a spineless congress 
that he was able to borrow vast sums to finance his massive defense 
buildup and to offset revenues lost in his taxcutting programs 
the next president simply must force the country to face the 
fact that we cant continue spending money we dont have 
with all the presidential candidates whistling dixie this month 
voters would be wise to listen closely for who is sounding the 
clear notes on this issue

unless he had been hiding in a cave rick gates knew what

the duluth minn newstribune on the 1990 census 
lets conduct a census and count everybody but swedes or 
maybe irish or americans who migrate with the seasons or 
some other identifiable population group 
why do that to fix the outcome silly what other reason could 
there be 
a coalition of congressional members wants to do that in 1990 
when the constitution says the country must conduct a decennial 
head count 
about 40 house members want to count everyone but illegal aliens 
and will sue the census bureau to force the exclusion it is 
estimated there are about 2 million illegal aliens in the united 
states 
why do these members of congress want to ignore illegal aliens 
to fix the outcome of the 1990 census of course 
the national head count is used to distribute seats in the house 
of representatives and they fear aliens will cause unfair shifts 
from one state to another 
to their credit census officials say they read the constitution 
to say everyone must be counted the whole number of persons 
of course everyone should be included

sen paul simon battered in the early 
democratic contests said today he is bypassing the march 8 super 
tuesday primaries and caucuses because he does not have the 
resources for winning them 
but the illinois democrat said he was not dropping out of the 
race and would continue to campaign to win his home state primary 
on march 15 and the contests in the states that follow 
the campaign will begin anew after super tuesday starting in 
illinois simon told a news conference 
simon was dealt a crippling blow tuesday when he finished far 
behind massachusetts gov michael dukakis and was trailing jesse 
jackson in minnesotas caucuses he came in a distant fourth in the 
south dakota primary behind rep richard gephardt of missouri 
dukakis and albert gore jr 
last week after coming in third in the new hampshire primary 
simon said he would withdraw if he did not finish first in either 
minnesota or south dakota he later backed off that statement 
faced with primaries and caucuses in 20 states and american 
samoa on march 8 simon said he cannot raise the money to match the 
big warchests of dukakis and gore in the region 
there is no sense in my fooling myself the illinois 
democrat said we just dont have the money 
his campaign plunged into debt before the new hampshire primary 
but he has been talking of close to half a million dollars gathered 
in the past two weeks 
we have had recordbreaking fundraising simon declared 
monday for example 137000 came in we never had a day like 
that before but you take 137000 and then look at 20 states and 
what it would cost for a media buy and youre talking about 
something that is nowhere near adequate 
simon also said he had made the judgment that march 8 will not 
settle the race and that the battle for the 1988 democratic 
presidential nomination will go to the convention in atlanta in 
july 
super tuesday is likely to result in a very mixed picture 
he said phase one of the selection process ends on march 8 
but we do not have the resources for winning in the super tuesday 
states 
phase two of the selection process begins march 15 i shall 
use phase two to deliver the message that we must become a nation 
with leadership characterized by compassion and vision and common 
sense it is on to atlanta with that message 
simon is on the ballot in all the super tuesday primaries but 
he said he will do little or no campaigning in those states 
except for the nationally televised debates that are a major 
feature of the next two weeks 
im not writing off the south i want my friends there to vote 
for me he said im realistic about resources i simply cannot 
do everything 
dukakis and gephardt have split the four major democratic 
contests so far and simon said he had concluded the party will not 
have a certain winner going into the atlanta convention 
he cited growing evidence that for the first time in recent 
history there will be no firstballot winner at the democratic 
convention 
simons best day so far was in iowa on feb 8 where he finished 
a very close second to gephardt he was third in new hampshire 
he talked to reporters after a speech to the united auto workers 
at a washington hotel

the kremlins attempt to bring 100 nationalities 
under one communist umbrella has been difficult in the southern 
caucasus mountain region where dozens of ethnic groups strive to 
assert their identity far from the seat of soviet power 
about 50 different nationalities have been identified in the 
caucasus area some represented only by a few thousand individuals 
largely isolated amid the remote mountain valleys the main peoples 
of the region are the azeris georgians and armenians all of whom 
have their own soviet republics 
armenians drew attention this week because of demonstrations in 
their capital yerevan and in a small adjoining area that is part 
of azerbaidzhan thousands of demonstrators in yerevan demanded 
that the area the nagornokarabakh region be made part of armenia 
nagornokarabakh is a microcosm of the inconsistencies of soviet 
nationality policy its population of 157000 was 81 percent 
armenian and just 18 percent azeri but the region was made part of 
azerbaidzhan in 1923 after having been deeded to armenia when it 
became part of the soviet union in 1920 
the caucasus residents tend to be fiercely independent 
bristling at attempts by the soviet unions dominant ethnic group 
the russians to interfere with their languages customs and 
religions 
in armenia the most bitter fuel to nationalist passions 
occurred while turkey controlled western armenia in 1915 more than 
a million armenians are believed to have died or been massacred 
when turkey deported the local population 
other armenian nationalism stems from religious beliefs which 
are discouraged by the communist party government patriarch vazgen 
i of the armenian church said in an interview at church 
headquarters in etchmiadzin last year that the majority of 
armenians are believers and that more than half of newborns are 
christened 
the regions turmoil has led many armenians to leave their 
homeland settling principally either in other parts of the soviet 
union or in the united states armenian emigration to the united 
states approaches 1000 per month 
to the north georgians say they have been more successful than 
their caucasus neighbors at resisting russification because 
they tend to stick close to home limiting assimilation but 
georgian students protested by the thousands in 1979 when the 
republics government tried to change the official language to 
russian 
georgians spirit of independence is reflected in their business 
dealings they are known for doing a brisk business growing produce 
in georgias mediterraneanlike climate and selling them in areas 
where supply is scare 
azerbaidzhans wealth traditionally was the oil found in its 
capital baku on the caspian sea but oil production has dropped 
causing economic problems in the republic 
ethnic tensions have surfaced in areas of azerbaidzhan with 
large populations of armenians in addition to nagornokarabakh 
demonstrators have also asserted armenian national rights in the 
village of chardakhlu the village was the scene in october of a 
clash between native azeris and longtime armenian residents 
there also is a sizable moslem population in azerbaidzhan which 
is officially tolerated by the kremlin but serves as yet another 
wedge between the republics people and the russiandominated 
moscow government

about 100 hampshire college students 
occupied a dormitory office for a second day in a protest over 
racism and marched across campus today to present a list of 12 
demands to the college president 
the group then withdrew to the dakin house office they seized 
tuesday morning and said they did not plan to meet again with 
president adele simmons until 9 am thursday 
the protesters deliberately delayed negotiations said penny 
predmas a junior from new york city 
we are building our sense of our community so we can feel 
invincible she said 
the protesters were escorted across campus by about 100 
students who snaked through a classroom building and a building 
housing administrative offices chanting one two three four 
racism has got to go 
among the protesters demands were additional library materials 
dealing with third world nations establishment of a college policy 
on racial harassment a fulltime adviser for minority students a 
permanent meeting place for nonwhite students a minority 
recruitment week each semester and no retaliatory actions against 
the protesters 
about a dozen white supporters pitched tents and staged an 
overnight vigil outside dakin house and students from nearby 
amherst mount holyoke and smith colleges as well as the university 
of massachusetts joined the demonstraters this morning 
a week ago about 125 minority students at the university of 
massachusetts began a sixday occupation at a building there 
the problems are the same although the sizes of the minority 
communities are different said hampshire freshman anita fearman 
of los angeles 
theres a general feeling here that weve been more or less 
pushed under the rug said ms fearman who is black 
although there have been racial attacks at the university of 
massachusetts there have been none at hampshire which lists 100 
minority students among its 1100 undergraduates but minorities 
complained of verbal harassment and a lack of attention to third 
world issues 
we have been to the administration several times over the past 
three years with our demands and concerns and nothing has been 
done premdas said its been all lip service it seemed this 
was the only way to get something done

angry palestinians today lynched an arab who 
they apparently suspected of collaborating with the israelis 
stringing him up on a utility pole after he went on a shooting 
spree that killed a 4yearold boy and wounded 13 other people 
security sources said 
israel radio called the incident in a west bank village a 
serious escalation of the unrest in the occupied territories and 
linked it to the palestine liberation organizations calls to deal 
with collaborators 
the dead mans identity was not immediately known 
details were sketchy concerning the incident in qabatiye near 
jenin 60 miles north of jerusalem however israel radio said the 
violence began when hundreds of residents marched to the mans 
house threw firebombs and setting it afire 
security sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
man shot into the crowd which apparently suspected him of 
collaborating with israeli authorities killing the boy and 
wounding the others 
israel radio said the crowd then dragged the man away and hanged 
him security sources confirmed the report 
an army spokesman said soldiers arrived after the hanging 
according to the united nations 63 arabs have been killed most by 
soldiers since the wave of unrest began dec 8 in the occupied 
territories 
a general strike gripped the west bank and gaza strip today as 
businesses shut down and arab workers stayed home in response to a 
call for stepped up protests before secretary of state george p 
shultz arrives 
also today the army reported what it said may be the first 
armed attack against the military in the past 2 months of unrest 
in the territories seized by israel in the 1967 middle east war 
an army spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said a 
bomb exploded on a road near gaza as a vehicle was passing tuesday 
night and shots were fired there were no injuries 
extratight security arrangements went into effect today at ben 
gurion airport in advance of shultzs arrival thursday airport 
police said riot police units were called in and will stay on duty 
through tuesday as shultz conducts his shuttle mission in the 
middle east 
in the gaza strip today few people were on the streets and only 
one or two cars were seen moving most arab laborers stayed away 
from their jobs in israel there was little public transport and 
there were reports of a few scattered tireburning and 
stonethrowing incidents 
much of the west bank was dusted white with a thin layer of snow 
that fell overnight and some arab youths in a jerusalem 
neighborhood threw snowballs at passing cars a relief from the 
stonethrowing of previous days 
business was at a standstill today there was little traffic and 
few workers left home according to army radio 
the underground national leadership of the uprising in leaflets 
distributed throughout the territories called for a general strike 
today and thursday 
shultz is coming to israel to launch a new peace initiative he 
hopes will put an end to the violence of past weeks bring the 
arabs and israelis to the negotiating table and eventually achieve 
an overall solution to the mideast conflict 
the secretary of state has acknowledged he has only a slim 
chance of accomplishing that goal during his visit the shultz 
initiative which includes trading territory for peace is likely 
to encounter opposition from prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud 
bloc 
deputy prime minister david levy interviewed on army radio 
said on tuesday the new initiative contradicts the 10yearold camp 
david agreement 
there is confusion in it and an attempt to sell it to israel 
as camp david and to sell it to the arabs that will give them 
almost all of the west bank and gaza he said 
the plo has prohibited local palestinians from meeting shultz 
fayez abu rahme a gaza lawyer who was among a group of arabs who 
met with a us official on saturday said as far as we are 
concerned there wont be a meeting 
david good spokesman for the us consulate in jerusalem said 
he did not know if palestinians will meet with shultz 
informed us sources said shultz would not meet with 
palestinians outside jerusalem were not taking directions from 
the plo on how to meet with palestinians said the source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity

cooling expenses wolpe said 
the considerable erosion of federal support is all the more 
shocking considering the fact that eligible costs represent only 
about 40 percent of a recipients energy bill wolpe said 
the declining funding for the program an outgrowth of the oil 
crises of the 1970s comes amid a background of rising energy 
costs the study said 
in 1981 the nation spent 747 billion on heating and cooling 
and in 1988 the cost likely will be 967 billion the study said 
many poor families in this country are threatened with the 
loss of their home heating and other basic utility services because 
they cannot afford to pay their bills the study said as a 
visible result the nations poor experience a high level of pain 
stress and homelessness 
the program is grossly and tragically underfunded said sen 
john heinz rpa the cochairman of the coalition both the 
administration and the congress are to blame the administration 
for failing to honor its longstated commitment to the safety net 
and congress for acquiescing 
heinz and wolpe said they oped to stave off further cuts in the 
program and to roll back last years 16 percent reduction in 
funding 
the institute is a policy group formed by senators and 
representatives from the northeast and midwest

mayor tom young is asking a federal judge 
to order former mayor lee alexander and the people who bribed him 
to pay 15 million in restitution to the city 
in a letter to us district judge thomas a mcavoy and us 
probation officer frank waterson young asked that the city be 
named a victim of alexanders extortionkickback scheme in the 
presentence report now being prepared 
if that request is rejected the city may sue alexander and five 
or more local businessmen who paid bribes for city contracts young 
said tuesday 
if your household was robbed of cash and valuable jewels and 
the thieves were found along with some of the loot they stole 
whod receive the stolen cash and jewels obviously the owner of 
the home young said 
im head of the household were requesting that whats been 
stolen from this household be returned to it 
waterson declined to comment specifically about the alexander 
case but he said consideration of restitution to the victim of any 
crime is a matter commonly brought up during sentencing 
alexander and nine others who pleaded guilty to federal charges 
of racketeering tax evasion and conspiracy will be sentenced march 
10 and 11 the charges stemmed from a probe by the fbi and internal 
revenue service into corruption during alexanders tenure as mayor 
from 1970 to 1986 
the administration believes the city was a victim and were 
doing the best we can to recover as much of the assets as 
possible said syracuse corporation counsel frank harrigan 
the city is asking for a portion of the money alexander has 
returned to the federal government as well as restitution from the 
exmayor and his associates harrigan said 
alexander already has surrendered 14 million in cash bonds 
and coins to the federal government 
the exmayor could be sentenced up to 30 years in prison but 
the us attorney will recommend a term of 10 years 
federal authorities have said they will administer a lie 
detector test to alexander next week to determine if he is 
withholding any other illegally gained assets

the nations record trade deficit began to 
shrink in the final three months of 1987 as us exports climbed 6 
percent to record levels the commerce department said wednesday 
while narrowing just 200 million from the summer the decline 
of the trade deficit to 402 billion on a balanceofpayments 
basis marked the first quarterly improvement since the spring of 
1986 
we have a genuine export boom going on and i think a lot of 
people are are pleasantly surprised said robert ortner 
undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs 
ortner said further improvements were likely in the months ahead 
at present levels of the dollar which he said appears to have 
stabilized in foreign exchange markets 
still the year finished with a record 1593 billion 
balanceofpayments trade deficit for all of 1987 the report said 
in terms of volume alone the trade deficit actually showed a 5 
percent improvement from 1986 to 1987 the fact that import prices 
rose more rapidly than export prices helped mask this improvement 
commerce department analysts said 
the new figures confirmed an endofyear narrowing of the trade 
shortfall that already had shown up in the departments monthly 
merchandise trade reports the earlier figures showed a 43 billion 
deficit for the fourth quarter and a 1712 shortfall for all of 
1987 
wednesdays figures were smaller because they subtracted factors 
such as the cost of shipping insurance and military sales from the 
monthly numbers the balanceofpayments deficit is also adjusted 
for seasonal variations the monthly figures are not 
the octoberdecember deficit was down from the 404 billion 
deficit sustained in the third quarter that figure was revised 
upward from the 389 billion originally reported 
exports buoyed by a weakening exchange value of the dollar 
increased 39 billion or 6 percent to a record 691 billion 
imports also rose to a record 1092 billion in the fourth 
quarter but the increase of 4 percent or 38 billion was smaller 
than that for exports 
the report was cited by analysts as further evidence that 
exchangerate changes since 1985 finally are helping to trim the 
trade deficit 
the dollar is worth just 50 percent of its midl985 value 
against japanese and key european currencies a devaluation that is 
making imports more expensive to us consumers while making 
american goods cheaper and more competitive abroad 
the trend has changed exports will continue to grow and i 
think you will see a major decline in imports in the first second 
and third quarters of this year the biggest surprise of 1988 will 
be the narrowing of the trade deficit said jay goldinger chief 
economist for capital insight a los angeles bond brokerage 
during the fourth quarter the trade deficit with japan 
increased 13 billion to 15 billion the deficit with western 
europe was up 15 billion to 82 billion and the shortfall with 
canada rose 100 million to 18 billion 
in the same period the deficit with the newly industrialized 
countries in the far east taiwan south korea hong kong and 
singapore fell 2 billion to 81 billion 
nonpetroleum imports increased 53 billion or 6 percent to 
981 billion in the fourth quarter passenger cars from canada 
were up 52 percent a 1 billion increase auto imports from all 
other countries including japan fell by 7 percent or 700 
million 
petroleum imports decreased 15 billion or 12 percent to 
111 billion both prices and volume were down 
on exports nonagricultural shipments of us products 
increased 45 billion or 8 percent to 613 billion among the 
largest increases were machinery up 21 billion or 12 percent 
and automotive products to canada up 1 billion or 21 percent 
however agricultural exports fell during the quarter by 600 
million or 7 percent to 77 billion 
if constant dollars were used subtracting the effects of 
inflation since 1982 the trade deficit would show a 12 billion 
decline in the fourth quarter to 414 billion for the year the 
deficit would have shown a decline to 1686 billon from a 
hypothetical 1774 billion constantdollar deficit in 1986 
the commerce department will use the figures to calculate an 
even broader measure of trade the current account deficit which 
measures not only trade between countries in merchandise but also 
in services primarily investment earnings and transfer payments 
such as foreign aid

reports that toxic chemicals may have been 
dumped into the ohio river while the water was fouled with diesel 
fuel have been turned over to environmental protection agency 
criminal investigators an epa official said wednesday 
robert boodey head of the epa region iii criminal unit in 
philadelphia declined however to say whether his office has 
opened a formal investigation he said agency policy forbids 
commenting on criminal investigations 
all i can tell you is we passed the information along said 
thomas voltaggio superfund chief for region iii once we send 
the reports over to them we are really out of it we want to 
separate any criminal activity from regulatory activity 
epa officials received the toxic dumping reports in midjanuary 
several weeks after the jan 2 collapse of an ashland oil inc tank 
near pittsburgh fouled the monongahela and ohio rivers with an 
estimated 730000 gallons of diesel fuel 
sen arlen specter rpa on tuesday asked epa to investigate 
the reports 
traces of chloroform and methylene chloride which both cause 
cancer and another industrial solvent 111trichloroethane were 
found in water samples by the west virginia department of natural 
resources according to officials in that department 
they found no hard evidence however that the toxins were 
deliberately dumped to take advantage of the ashland pollution 
crisis said ron sandy branch head of field opertions for the 
natural resources department 
the pittsburgh press reported sunday that the toxic chemicals 
were found in a 15mile stretch of the river between wheeling and 
moundsville 
the concentrations exceeded the levels set by epa as cancer 
risks but probably had no effect on public health said peter 
tennant water quality program manager for the ohio river valley 
sanitation commission 
the intakes of all the water companies were shut down as the 
spill passed tennant said also those compounds are 
easily removed by the carbon filtration systems water companies 
use 
the tank collapse cut tap water service to about 23000 suburban 
pittsburgh residents and threatened to do the same for an estimated 
1 million others water companies along the ohio which is formed 
by the monongahela and allegheny in pittsburgh closed their 
intakes and relied on reserves and emergency supplies until the 
diesel fuel passed 
the pennsylvania emergency management agency has helped process 
70 claims against ashland from municipal governments seeking a 
total of about 1 million karen critchfield pema disaster 
assistance officer said tuesday at a meeting of federal state and 
local officials involved in the spill

the son of one of first two men to conquer mount 
everest has set his own sights on the mighty mountain joining a 
team that hopes to scale the worlds highest peak to mark the 35th 
anniversary of the feat 
tenzing norbu a connecticut travel agent and the son of tenzing 
norgay said he joined the expedition to honor his late father the 
sherpa guide who joined new zealander edmund hillary at the top of 
the world in 1953 
for me it is a pilgrimage to a mountain which has reshaped 
the lives of my family and my people tenzing 25 said at a news 
conference wednesdayit will allow me to pay homage to my late 
father 
the young tenzing a university of new hampshire graduate who 
works for a travel agency in westport conn only will go as far 
as the base camp about 17000 feet on the chinese tibetan side of 
the mountain that straddles the nepalchina border 
the final assault on the summit of the 29028feet peak the 
worlds highest will be made by an international team of 
mountaineers led by robert anderson 30 a denver native now living 
in auckland new zealand 
anderson joined by two other americans and a british climber 
will attempt to reach the peak without oxygen by an untried route 
along the eastern side of the mountain 
like the nepalese tenzing and hillary in 1953 the everest 
88 expedition will be supported by the united nations miklos 
pinther chief cartographer of the un secretariat will travel to 
the base camp and the climbers will have a un flag to plant on 
the summit 
the group leaves beijing on thursday for lhasa the capital of 
tibet from there they will begin a fiveday journey accompanied 
by 45 yaks to a site where they will set up their base camp 
anderson who came within 800 feet of the summit in a 1985 
expedition to everest said the team hopes to put a man at the peak 
by the end of april 
he said the climbers will forgo oxygen to relive some of the 
challenge of the original assault much of which has been 
diminished by technological advances in climbing equipment tenzing 
and hillary used oxygen in their climb 
the young tenzing said he will give the summit assault team 
objects similar to those his father took up the mountain including 
a wooden black cat a broken pencil and candy to pay respect to the 
mountain gods 
tenzing and hillary reached the summit on may 29 1953 since 
then 209 people have conquered the mountain but only about 15 
without oxygen according to anderson 
tenzing norgay the tiger of the snows died in may 1986 at 
the age of 72 in darjeeling india where he set up a climbing 
school hillary now sir edmund is new zealands ambassador to 
india the two men kept their vow never to reveal which first set 
foot on the majestic pinnacle

gov evan mechams new attorney says he 
will seek a postponement of the impeachment trial before the 
arizona senate which is set to start monday 
we will be requesting that the trial be postponed 
jerris leonard said in an interview late tuesday night he said he 
would meet today with state supreme court chief justice frank 
gordon who is presiding over the trial and with senate president 
carl kunasek 
senate majority leader bob usdane a republican noted today 
that the trial already has been delayed a week and added my 
inclination is to not give them another minute of delay i 
think its a tactic i think theyve known all along what they were 
going to be doing 
meanwhile the state houses impeachment prosecutors today asked 
that contempt sanctions be imposed against mecham attorney murray 
miller for refusing to provide a list of planned witnesses before 
the senate trial begins prosecutors william french and paul 
eckstein accused miller of patent blatant disregard and 
disobedience of a deadline set by gordon 
leonard who headed the law enforcement assistance 
administration in the nixon administration also said he planned to 
meet with miller 
leonard said he was retained by mecham monday night 
i am certainly very enthusiastic to take the case leonard 
said 
were going to put together a very strong defense in his 
behalf a very forceful fruitful responsible defense and hope 
that the members will be persuaded by it leonard said 
roy dunton former mohave county republican party chairman and 
founder of the mecham legal defense fund said tuesday that leonard 
was hired as the lead defense counsel 
edith richardson chief spokeswoman for mechams recall election 
campaign said tuesday night that leonard had been added to the 
defense team but im not sure of the terminology whether he is 
the lead attorney 
she said she believed that miller and michael scott the 
attorney for mechams brother willard would handle the criminal 
defense 
in addition to the impeachment trial mecham and his brother 
face felony charges stemming from mechams alleged failure to 
properly report a 350000 campaign loan 
leonard ran unsuccessfully for the us senate from wisconsin in 
1968 and in 1969 was named director of the law enforcement 
assistance administration by president nixon he also served as an 
assistant us attorney general in washington 
he joined the washington law firm of manatt phelps rothenberg 
tunney amp evan in may 1986 
french and eckstein in their motion for contempt sanctions 
said mechams defense should not be permitted to call any witnesses 
during the trial unless they meet todays 5 pm deadline to 
provide a list 
the prosecution submitted a list of 41 possible witnesses monday 
miller said in a letter monday he did not want to disclose his 
planned witnesses because he thought it was unfair to hold mechams 
impeachment trial before his criminal trial is over 
gordon also had set a 9 am deadline today for miller to file 
any objections to the impeachment counts but no documents were 
filed by that time 
usdane said he thought the deadlines set by gordon appeared to 
be more of a request than an order and questioned whether 
sanctions could be imposed if there was no direct order involved

evangelist jimmy swaggart who is said 
to have confessed an obsession with pornography once wrote a 
newspaper column saying pornography is as addictive as drugs 
swaggart faces disciplinary action by his denomination the 
assemblies of god for sexual misconduct he was reportedly 
observed and photographed while visiting a prostitute in new 
orleans 
the rev glen cole of sacramento calif one of 13 members of 
the assemblies of gods ruling executive presbytery said swaggart 
had confessed last week to having an obsession with pornography 
dating back to his youth 
james hammill of memphis tenn a member of the denominations 
general counsel said monday night that the panel had been given 
pictures of swaggart going in and out of a new orleans motel room 
with a woman 
in a july 1986 column for the baton rouge sunday advocate 
swaggart wrote 
pornography is now considered as addictive as drugs leading 
as with any addiction to a need for escalated doses and 
intensity that in turn breeds desensitization which leads to 
the acting out of roles that have been at the heart of the nations 
most sensational serial murder and serial rape cases 
women and children portrayed as nothing more than debased 
objects on screen and in print pay a particularly high price when 
fantasy turns into reality 
swaggart called those who make their living from pornography 
wretched disgusting and dangerous 
in another column swaggart wrote most of todays sex im 
afraid is a consequence of lust and that has absolutely nothing 
to do with love 
you see the laws of god cannot be abrogated with impunity 
yes we can do it we are free moral agents to do so however 
means that we pay the piper and were now starting to do so 
the december issue of swaggarts magazine the evangelist was 
critical of mercer university a baptist school that did not take 
disciplinary action against six women who posed for playboy

portuguese prime minister anibal cavaco silva 
disappointed in american aid levels said today his nation wants to 
review a 1983 usportugal defense agreement giving the united 
states access to a key air base 
cavaco silva emerging from a twohour meeting at the white 
house with president reagan said he told the president that cuts 
in american aid have posed difficulties particularly at a time 
when we are committed to the reequipment of our armed forces and 
trying to modernize the country 
i stated to president reagan that the portuguese government 
intended to request that consultations be held under the terms of 
the agreement cavaco silva said 
reagan reiterated us desire to help portugal but he said 
the efforts remain firm even within the context of the harsh 
budger realities that we all face the task of leadership is to 
rise to the challenge 
the portuguese leader is using his first official visit to 
washington to register disappointment that the united states is 
providing barely more than half the 205 million that portugal 
wants in aid each year for us rights at lajes air base in the 
azores a vital refueling point in the atlantic 
the us deficitreduction program is responsible for the cuts 
not just in aid to portugal but to the philippines greece and 
turkey other baserights countries with struggling economies 
a senior us official briefing reporters in advance of cavaco 
silvas meeting at the white house with president reagan today 
said were going to have a foreign policy job to do in convincing 
them why were doing it and why we have to share the pain 
together 
cavaco silva arrived on tuesday for three days of talks 
portugal is disappointed in the aid levels which have dipped to 
117 million this year after hitting a high of 205 million in 
1984 one year after the current base agreement was signed 
in his budget proposal last week reagan asked congress for 163 
million for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
the us official speaking on condition of anonymity said he 
doubted the prime minister wanted a confrontation during his 
visit to washington 
rather well look for ways we can figure out at least in 
the short run some of our problems the official said 
earlier this month defense secretary frank c carlucci appeared 
to have soothed portuguese feelings enough to head off a request 
for a formal review of the usportugal defense agreement he 
received permission from cavaco silvas government to send over 
surplus us military equipment to make up part of the shortfall in 
financial assistance 
experts from both defense departments are to meet soon to figure 
out what portugal can use from us stocks 
in the past two weeks however portuguese foreign minister joao 
de deus pinheiro and president mario soares have expressed 
reservations about the plan 
nevertheless the us official said i think what he cavaco 
silva told frank carlucci at the beginning of february we expect 
holds 
obviously the portuguese are disappointed with the levels of 
assistance so are we the official said invariably weve 
requested more money out of congress and in recent years have not 
done very well as the budget crunch is being faced by all 
agencies obviously security assistance is one of those areas hit 
were probably going to face it in a great amount of 
countries particularly countries that feel they have a commitment 
for a certain level of military assistance and believe that they 
have been good allies

michael s dukakis said wednesday he will do 
whatever he has to do to counter any negative ads by his rivals for 
the democratic presidential nomination but hopes we can get this 
campaign back on the high road 
the massachusetts governors secondplace showing in the south 
dakota primary tuesday was blamed in part on attack ads by top 
votegetter missouri rep richard gephardt dukakis south dakota 
chairman fritz wiecking was quoted as saying 
the ads claimed dukakis has no farm or trade policy and is the 
biggest taxer in massachusetts history dukakis called the ads 
inaccurate 
at a news conference dukakis said maybe it is a vain hope 
for the democrats to avoid the kind of charges and countercharges 
circulating among the republican candidates which dukakis termed 
damaging to the gop their candidates and the election process 
i would prefer that the democrats not copy the republicans 
and that we try to run strong positive campaigns in which if we 
disagree with each other we do so agreeably and accurately 
dukakis said 
but he added negative campaigning and negative advertising 
apparently is the thing all of the sudden i have had to go through 
that before and if i have to do what i have to do i will do so 
but i would hope that we can get this campaign back on the high 
road 
asked to elaborate dukakis said ill deal with that when the 
time comes ive had to do it before i hope i dont have to do it 
again 
but he did specifically mention gephardt and tennessee sen 
albert gore 
dukakis said the american people are not interested with what 
mr gore thinks of mr gephardt mr gephardt thinks of mr gore 
what both of them think of me 
these two guys are at it every day now they are trying to get 
me into it dukakis said 
there is nothing wrong with disagreeing on particular 
issues he said i have no problem with that but i would hope 
we could avoid it negative campaigning can we well see 
saying he was the only democratic candidate competing with equal 
force in all states dukakis summed up tuesdays results including 
his victory in minnesota by saying we competed aggressively in 
minnesota competed aggressively in south dakota and the results 
i think are very heartwarming 
but as the candidates head toward super tuesday march 8 with 
1307 delegates up for grabs in 20 states and american samoa 
dukakis said i dont think any of us is in a strong position i 
think its wide open 
super tuesday is two weeks ahead and if there is one thing 
that we are learning as a result of this process is that nobody 
knows whats going to happen next he said

cia director william webster said wednesday 
that president reagan isnt buying the house and senate 
intelligence committees proposals for preventing another 
irancontra affair including a required 48hour notice to congress 
of any covert action 
webster said the proposals would tie a presidents hands in 
cases where a premature leak could cost lives and when a foreign 
intelligence service with vital information insists that congress 
not be told 
a 48hour notification requirement would promote tension 
between congress and a president for years to come webster 
added 
the cia director told a house intelligence subcommittee that a 
recent presidential directive would make certain all but the most 
extraordinary covert activities would be promptly reported to 
congress 
and in any rare case where the president ordered a delayed 
notification a toplevel policy group would review the decision 
every 10 days webster said 
some lawmakers have suggested that they might have persuaded 
reagan not to sell arms to iran had he notified the intelligence 
committees or congressional leadership of his plans 
reagans approval was withheld from congress for 10 months in 
1986 until us negotiations with iran were disclosed by a 
lebanese publication 
the administration has already lost round one in its battle to 
maintain greater discretion on when to notify congress the senate 
intelligence committee voted 132 for legislation that includes the 
48hour requirement it is similar in other respects to the house 
bill webster is now trying to derail 
a bill which fails to preserve the flexibility and authority 
the president needs to conduct intelligence activities effectively 
will not be acceptable to the president webster said he did not 
say specifically whether reagan would veto such a measure 
current law requires an administration to give the intelligence 
committees or eight top congressional leaders prior notification of 
significant intelligence activities but it allows the president to 
delay in extraordinary circumstances and issue the notification in 
timely fashion 
in fact webster said there have been only three instances when 
timely notification was not given the irancontra affair the 
rescue of americans from iran who were hidden by canadian diplomats 
and the failed military attempt to rescue american hostages in iran 
webster said the irancontra affair in which profits from the 
arms sales to iran were diverted to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
was caused by officials failing to follow existing procedures and 
rules 
some allowance must be made for that rare case where a limited 
delay in congressional notification is critical to preserve the 
absolute security of an operation when for example lives are at 
stake he contended 
but former defense secretary clark clifford testified that the 
legislation does not go far enough 
he suggested that congress stop financing any covert activity 
for which notification was not given and he proposed that any 
government employee who willingly violated the prohibition of funds 
be subject to criminal activity 
we are better off without covert activities entirely than with 
them out of control said clifford who served in the johnson 
administration

the supreme court today overturned a 200000 
award won by evangelist jerry falwell against hustler magazine and 
its publisher larry flynt extending the legal protections for 
parody and satire even when they are pornographic 
the court unanimously ruled that even pornographic spoofs about 
a public figure enjoy the freespeech protections of the 
constitutions first amendment if those spoofs could not reasonably 
have been interpreted as stating actual facts about the person 
the justices stripped falwell of the award he had won for 
emotional distress caused by an advertising parody in hustler 
outrageousness in the area of political and social discourse 
has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to 
impose liability on the basis of the jurors tastes or views or 
perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a particular expression 
chief justice william h rehnquist wrote for the court 
an outrageous standard thus runs afoul of our longstanding 
refusal to allow damages to be awarded because the speech in 
question may have an adverse emotional impact on the audience he 
said 
falwells lawsuit arose out of a fullpage ad parody that 
appeared in the november 1983 and march 1984 issues of hustler a 
sexually explicit magazine 
featuring a photograph of falwell the ad purportedly quotes him 
discussing a sexual encounter with his mother and describing 
himself as a habitual drunkard 
at the bottom of the page in small print readers are told that 
the ad is a parody not to be taken seriously 
falwell charged hustler and flynt with libel invasion of 
privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress he asked 
for 45 million in damages 
a federal jury in roanoke va in late 1984 ruled that the ad 
did not libel falwell and the presiding judge threw out the 
invasionofprivacy allegation 
but the jury ruled for falwell on his emotionaldistress 
allegation and awarded him 200000 the 4th us circuit court of 
appeals upheld the award but todays decision threw it out 
falwell a baptist minister and founder of an organization known 
as the moral majority said he had sued flynt and his magazine to 
protect his late mothers reputation i cant imagine any 
redblooded male in the world not being incensed he told 
reporters when attending supreme court arguments in the case last 
december 
i fully appreciate the deep concerns the court has shown for 
the sacredness of the first amendement falwell said in a 
statement today however i respectfully disagree with their 
ruling just as no person may scream fire in a crowded theater 
when there is no fire and find cover under the first amendment 
likewise no sleazemerchant like larry flynt should be able to use 
the first amendment as an excuse for maliciously and dishonestly 
attacking public figures as he has so often done 
i believe the supreme court has given the green light to larry 
flynt and his ilk to print what they wish about any public figure 
at any time with no fear of reprisal 
flynt who also attended the december argument session had 
voiced concern about his fate before the high court but added my 
indictment is mainly for bad taste 
he said today im excited absolutely delighted even though 
the suit had no merit in the beginning i still spent over 1 
million in attorneys fees there is no way to get those back its 
what you call paying to defend the first amendment 
flynt added with this record on the book i have protected 
other newspapers and magazines im not talking about 
pornography we are blazing a trail for a lot of people like 
political cartoonists 
in todays decision the court noted that graphic depictions 
and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public and 
political debate 
it discounted falwells contention that the hustler parody was 
so outrageous that it should be distinguished from more traditional 
political cartoons 
there is no doubt that the caricature of falwell published 
in hustler is at best a distant cousin of the traditional 
political cartoons and a rather poor relation at that rehnquist 
said but he added that there is no way the law can punish one and 
let the other flourish 
the courts vote was 80 justice anthony m kennedy who joined 
the court last thursday did not participate in the decision 
in other action the court 
expanded the power of communities to impose rent controls 
ruling that hardships to tenants may be considered when landlords 
seek rent increases 
by a 62 vote the justices upheld a san jose calif ordinance 
that has been attacked as a robin hood law that steals from the 
rich to pay the poor 
broadened protection for criminal defendants who claim they 
were enticed by law enforcement officials into committing a crime 
by a 62 vote the justices overturned a bribery conviction 
against frederick mathews of milwaukee wis a former small 
business administration official 
made it a bit easier for prosecutors to talk to criminal trial 
juries about a defendants failure to testify 
in splintered voting the court reinstated the mail fraud 
conviction of a man who prosecutors say set his tennessee home 
afire so he could file a false insurance claim 
bolstered the right defaultjudgment losers have to challenge 
a judgment entered after they fail to respond to a lawsuit 
the justices unanimously ruled for a houston businessman in his 
challenge of a default judgment awarded against him six years ago 
for a 5000 debt owed to a medical center 
ruled that federal judges lack authority to order the 
government to pay fees to lawyers who successfully obtain overdue 
federal welfare for poor people who are aged blin or disabled 
the 80 ruling in a case from arkansas held that federal 
officials are not required by law to withhold a portion of a 
recipients benefits to pay the attorney 
the hustler case was hustler vs falwell 861278

a reagan administration proposal to reduce the 
questions asked in the 1990 census drew fire wednesday from city 
officials and statisticians who said vital information would be 
lost 
the white house office of management and budget has required 
that several questions be dropped or asked of fewer people in 
this springs census dress rehearsal 
no final decision has been made on whether the changes will be 
extended to the 1990 census according to joseph r wright jr of 
omb who contended the cuts were made to reduce the paperwork 
burden on the public 
but the dress rehearsal head counts in the states of washington 
and missouri are scheduled for march 20 on april 1 the formal 
questions planned for the 1990 census must be sent to congress 
the proposed changes would introduce crippling sampling 
errors into the census charged arthur young retired chief of 
the census bureaus housing division 
young spoke at a joint hearing of the house select committee on 
aging and the subcommittee on housing and consumer interests 
it will look like a full census but it will be nothing but a 
hollow shell young said eliminating questions or cutting by 
half the number of people answering some of them would all but 
eliminate much data on city block areas he said 
the omb cuts will leave the nation after the 1990 census with 
a housing data base inadequate for decision making at the local 
level he said and this loss of information would occur at a 
time when more and more programs are being switched from federal to 
state and local operation 
art holland mayor of trenton nj added the warning that the 
cuts could have potentially debilitating impacts upon the cities 
of this nation to adequately plan for the future and to allocate 
scarce resources for the betterment of their residents and 
businesses 
you dont have to be a statistician to know that reducing the 
number of people asked a particular question reduces the quality of 
the data collected holland went on 
cities use census information to target community development 
block grant funds and economic development money to prepare 
housing master plans to target neighborhood eligibility for 
federal state and local assistance and to pinpoint areas in need 
of programs he said 
the cities depend on the census every 10 years as their primary 
source of information and all other collections of information use 
the census as a base or are mere estimates he added 
the omb proposal would drop questions on the cost of utilities 
type of heating equipment and fuel used to heat water in addition 
seven questions would be moved from the short form answered by 
everyone to the longer form sent only to a sample of households 
those include information on number of rooms in a house plumbing 
rent and value presence of a telephone and whether the residence 
is a condominium

taxpayers are apt to get the wrong answer to 
one of every four tax questions they telephone to the internal 
revenue service the agency acknowledged tuesday even correct 
replies may not be complete 
we are obviously not satisfied with answering only three out 
of four questions correctly irs commissioner lawrence b gibbs 
said in reporting the results of a test of his employees he 
questioned the validity of a separate survey by the general 
accounting office which found even less chance of a correct answer 
gao an arm of congress made 224 calls to irs telephone 
assistors and got the correct answer to only 61 percent of the 
technical tax questions asked 57 percent of the answers were 
complete and 4 percent were accurate but incomplete 
jennie s stathis an associate director of gao acknowledged 
that because of the limited number of calls and because they were 
not statistically weighted the results are very preliminary and 
not projectable at this time 
the irs expects 22 million telephone calls for tax answers this 
filing season 
the irs own survey is based on 5000 calls to some of the 4500 
agency employees whose job is to answer taxpayers questions about 
how to fill out their tax returns sixtyone percent of the 
questions were answered completely and correctly and another 13 
percent were answered correctly but not completely 
at this time a year ago before most provisions of the massive 
1986 tax overhaul took effect gao said the irs was giving the 
correct answers to questions 79 percent of the time 
i am comfortable that we are answering three out of four 
questions correctly gibbs said 
but rep jj pickle dtexas chairman of the house ways and 
means oversight subcommittee said with onefourth being given 
the wrong information i dont know that that is a complimentary 
figure 
no matter the source of advice on filling out a tax return the 
taxpayer has the responsibilty to see that the return is correct 
even if the irs makes a mistake in its advice a taxpayer can be 
subject to a penalty and interest for underpaying the agency 
traditionally has waived penalties if a taxpayer can prove a 
mistake resulted from bad irs advice but there is a question 
whether the law permits interest on an underpayment to be waived 
because of the new law gibbs said he is not surprised that the 
irs assistors are giving more wrong answers than they did a year 
ago he noted money magazine had asked 50 tax professionals outside 
the government to calculate how much tax a hypothetical family owed 
and had received 50 different answers 
very simply taxpayers practitioners and the irs are having 
trouble coping with the magnitude and the velocity of taxlaw 
changes gibbs said noting that congress has fallen into the 
habit of passing a major tax bill almost every year 
in the 1986 overhaul said rep richard schulze rpa 
congress may have passed such sweeping tax changes that they 
will prove impossible to implement 
most of the changes in that new law including lower rates 
fewer deductions and higher personal exemptions are being 
reflected for the first time on the returns that are due by april 
15 
if another gao survey is any indication the 1986 law brought 
anything but simplification the agency asked 423 taxpayers outside 
irs offices in six cities how preparing this years return compared 
with last year the results 
43 percent said it was harder or much harder this year 
32 percent found little difference 
13 percent said this year was easier or much easier 
10 percent were not sure 
overall the gaos ms stathis said irs did a good job in 
trying to prepare its employees and the taxpaying public for the 
1988 filing season 
in addition to the problem with incorrect answers to telephoned 
questions she said some irs offices have run out of certain tax 
forms some tax professionals also have complained that the irs has 
provided insufficient guidance on some fine points of the new law 
she added 
about 84 percent of taxpayers who went to irs offices for advice 
were satisfied with the result and 74 percent received assistance 
within 15 minutes gao found

the chairman of a white house commission 
recommended wednesday that federal and local governments spend an 
additional 20 billion over the next decade to fight aids among 
drug abusers 
retired navy adm james d watkins head of the aids commission 
appointed by president reagan last summer acknowledged that the 
call for such massive spending on drug addicts might prove 
controversial 
but he said 200 hours of testimony from 350 witnesses has left 
the panel convinced that the deadly disease is spreading most 
rapidly among the nations estimated 13 million intravenous drug 
abusers and their sexual partners 
watkins noted that some health leaders are estimating 10000 to 
20000 infants could be infected with the aids virus three years 
from now as a result of sexual unions involving drug addicts who 
can easily spread the disease among themselves by sharing 
contaminated needles 
any realistic attempt to combat aids in general must focus on 
drug abusers he said 
health leaders have long feared that any significant outbreak of 
aids into the general population most likely would start with the 
sex partners of iv drug users most of whom are concentrated in 24 
major cities 
the full 13member aids commission is expected to adopt most or 
all of watkins recommendations at a daylong business meeting next 
monday and then formally submit them to reagan the following week 
in what will be the panels first substantive report 
a final report is due at the white house june 24 watkins 
promised it will get into such controversial areas as widespread 
aids testing discrimination against people with aids and other 
legal and social questions 
he said the commission would be at loggerheads with 
ourselves if it tried to agree on recommendations on those 
matters at this point the commission will turn specifically to 
hearing testimony on those topics next month 
meanwhile he said the panel saw no reason to delay making 
recommendations in areas where there was consensus there could be 
subsequent interim reports before the final one this summer 
watkins said 
watkins call for an additional 1 billion a year in federal 
spending on drug abuse intervention programs alone would nearly 
double the total 13 billion public health service aids budget 
reagan has proposed for fiscal 1989 
the retired chief of naval operations told reporters that state 
and local governments will need to increase their own combined 
spending on drug programs by a like amount and that both the 
federal and local efforts will need to continue for 10 years 
you cannot just throw in some money one year and drop it out 
next year said watkins 
he said only 15 percent of the nations intravenous drug abusers 
are in treatment plans and tht there are three to sixmonth 
waiting lists in most major cities for addicts seeking help in 
getting off drugs 
anyone crying for help should get help on demand watkins 
said 
another major theme among watkins 60 pages of recommendations 
is additional financial support for the food and drug 
administration which he characterized as a kind of orphan agency 
standing on their own in the annual budget fights 
were picking up his advocacy watkins said of fda 
commissioner frank young the chairman said the panel had toured 
fda headquarters in surburban maryland and concluded we look 
something like a third world agency out there 
he noted that the new reagan budget proposes 25 million for an 
fda laboratory were saying he needs another building in 
addition to the one proposed said watkins 
watkins expressed confidence that the full commission would 
adopt most of his recommendations and declared it is not in our 
charter to worry about the political impact 
asked his reaction to the possibility of presidential 
candidates particularly democrats using his recommendations to 
zing the white house for not doing more earlier watkins 
replied 
how do you avoid politicizing something in an election year 
if they all adopt this and say lets get on with it thats the 
kind of politicization i like

park superintendent michael finley agreed with the cabinet and 
said the park already is stressed by south floridas expanding 
population 
to add one more type of stress to everglades national park 
could be the nail in the coffin said finley at some point 
the everglades will be to south florida what central park is to new

examined southwest of lake okeechobee north of alligator alley 
the training missions would not use live ammunition or bombs he

cheaper than continuing to send figters to other bases for combat 
training

a crisis over an unconstitutional state 
budget blew over wednesday almost as quickly as it developed after 
west virginia officials agreed to continue government as usual 
until they hear more from the state supreme court 
the high court issued a 32 opinion on tuesday calling the 
budget unconstitutional because it contains a 26 million deficit 
but the court granted a 60day grace period during which the order 
would be suspended while a rehearing is requested 
checkwriting officials were thrown into a panic initially with 
treasurer a james manchin saying he would not process any more 
state bills but manchin reversed himself overnight and said 
wednesday he would process the checks as usual 
he called the high courts ruling a whimper in the wind and 
said it carried enough delays to put off any final action until the 
new fiscal year that starts on july 1 
manchin released a number of checks for hospital workers on 
wednesday manchins reversal also apparently clears the way for 
the state payroll to be distributed on monday as scheduled 
gov arch moore already has scheduled a special session of the 
legislature for april 12 to look at education matters and the 
budget problem presumably could be considered at that time 
the governor has a possible safety valve on tuesday he 
received a bill that would allow him to borrow up to 50 million 
from the states pension and workers compensation trust fund said 
gubernatorial press secretary john price 
if he signs the bill it might be possible to solve the crisis 
by simply dumping 26 million into the current budget 
auditor glen gainer who also signs the states checks said he 
questions whether the loan is legal but said he would not contest 
it in court 
a lawsuit filed last fall by the west virginia education 
association challenging 135 million in cuts in education this 
year sparked the high court decision 
the unprecedented ruling comes as lawmakers grapple with bills 
that gainer estimates will be 170 million by the june 30 end of 
the fiscal year in addition lawmakers are trying to write a 
budget for the next fiscal year 
tax collections are 357 million behind predictions this year 
and a national investment firm issued a national bond rating 
warning against west virginia on dec 15 because of the financial 
crisis facing the state 
house finance chairman george farley suggested his colleagues 
simply ignore the high court decision and continue to work on the 
budget for next year

a 625000 fund to assist us artists appearing 
in international festivals and exhibitions was announced tuesday by 
the national endowment for the arts the us information agency 
and the rockefeller foundation 
in 1988 325000 will be available from the fund for performing 
artists and 300000 for visual artists 
frank hodsoll chairman of the national endowment for the arts 
said that private contributions could raise annual funding to 1 
million 
i think it is important this fund never become so big or so

the city of baytown banking that city 
hall may be sitting on a pool of oil is looking in its own back 
yard for more income 
the city council has approved a plan for trace oil and gas to 
drill a shallow 50006000foot well near the entrance to the 
30acre wooded city hall complex the city would receive a 20 
percent royalty on any petroleum uncovered under the agreement 
were keeping our fingers crossed said emmett hutto mayor 
of this town of 57000 people about 30 miles east of houston if 
the well brings in 100000 a year we could knock a halfcent off 
our tax rate 
jim bob jackson a geologist and coowner of trace oil in 
houston projects the company has a 5050 chance of hitting oil 
we feel confident we drilled a well 500 feet south of there 
on maryland avenue last year and got the smell of oil he said 
after careful calculations his research indicated an oil pool 
could be trapped beside a fault under the lush complex he said 
the company has permission to drill about 2000 feet from the 
city buildings an 80foot derrick will be erected and the drilling 
will continue around the clock for five to six days jackson said 
if oil is discovered a fence will be erected around the site and 
landscaping will be used to disguise the oil pumping operations he 
said 
we made stipulations in the lease so that it wont be a messy 
operation hutto said 
the company will spend about 150000 on the prospecting venture 
we expect it could bring in anywhere from 500 to 15000 per 
day in revenue which is a minor find jackson said 
the prospect of oil under the building is not outlandish said 
assistant city manager bobby rountree 
after all this is an oil town agreed jackson exxon one 
of the worlds largest refineries made baytown what it is today

the supreme court expanded significantly the 
legal protections for parody and satire wednesday as it overturned 
a 200000 award evangelist jerry falwell had won against hustler 
magazine and publisher larry flynt 
the justices ruled unanimously that emotional distress 
lawsuits filed by public figures targeted by such spoofs should be 
as difficult to win as libel suits 
and the court unanimously said that even pornographic spoofs 
enjoy the freespeech protection of the constitutions first 
amendment 
the hustler material was a phony ad purportedly quoting falwell 
discussing an incestual encounter with his mother in a virginia 
outhouse and his habit of getting drunk before giving sermons 
small print at the bottom of the page said the ad was not to 
be taken seriously 
led by chief justice william h rehnquist the court rejected 
falwells arguments and a federal appeals courts ruling that 
some parodies are so outrageous they do not deserve legal 
protection 
outrageousness in the area of political and social discourse 
has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to 
impose liability on the basis of the jurors tastes or views 
rehnquist said adding that such results are constitutionally 
impermissible 
the decision was praised by news organizations 
its easy to stand up for nice talk from nice people but the 
first amendment protects all speech even the outrageous said 
paul mcmasters of the society for professional journalists 
editorial cartoons have been a particular target of lawsuits 
lately mcmasters said the court was right to speak up so 
forcefully on behalf of tools editorial cartoonists wield so 
well 
but falwell a baptist minister and founder of an organization 
called the moral majority disagreed no sleaze merchant like 
larry flynt should be able to use the first amendment as an excuse 
for maliciously and dishonestly attacking public figures he said 
after learning of his defeat im sure the justices were holding 
their noses while making the ruling 
flynt said he was absolutely delighted by the ruling 
even though the suit had no merit in the beginning i still 
spent over 1 million in attorneys fees its what you call 
paying to defend the first amendment flynt said by telephone 
from los angeles 
he said he was concerned about small newspapers and house organs 
and others unable to afford to fight such a battle 
they just go out of business flynt said 
rehnquists opinion drew a distinction between the hustler ad 
and more traditional forms of parody such as editorial cartoons 
calling the falwell spoof a distant cousin of the political 
cartoon and a rather poor relation at that 
following publication of the parody in november 1983 and march 
1984 falwell sued hustler a sexually explicit magazine and its 
publisher for 45 million in damages for libel invasion of privacy 
and the intentional infliction of emotional distress he won on the 
emotionaldistress allegations only and a federal jury in roanoke 
va awarded him 200000 in damages in late 1984 the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals upheld the award 
but the high court said the same tough standard of proof falwell 
faced in trying to prove he was libeled should have applied as well 
to his emotionaldistress allegations 
the supreme court since 1964 has required that freespeech 
considerations be taken into account in libel cases but those 
considerations never before have been required in 
emotionaldistress cases 
in order to win a libel suit a public figure must prove that 
the allegedly libelous statement was false and was made with 
actual malice knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity 
until wednesday winning an emotionaldistress suit was easier 
for public figures they only had to prove that the defendant 
intended to cause the distress that the defendants conduct was 
extreme and that emotional distress actually was suffered 
now if public figures sue over some spoof whether alleging 
libel or emotional distress they must meet the actualmalice 
standard of proof and in proving falsity they must show that the 
spoof reasonably could have been interpreted as stating actual 
facts 
the courts vote was 80 justice anthony m kennedy who joined 
the court thursday did not participate in the decision 
in other decisions the court 
expanded by a 62 vote the power of communities to impose rent 
controls ruling in a case from san jose calif that tenant 
hardships may be considered when regulating the increases sought by 
landlords 
ruled unanimously in an arkansas case that federal judges may 
not order the government to pay fees to lawyers who successfully 
obtain overdue federal welfare benefits for the aged blind or 
disabled 
made it a bit easier for prosecutors to talk to criminal trial 
juries about a defendants failure to testify as it reinstated a 
mans tennessee mail fraud conviction 
broadened protections for criminal defendants who claim they 
were enticed by law enforcement officials into committing a crime 
by overturning 62 on entrapment grounds a milwaukee mans 
bribery conviction

democrat paul simon admitting there is no 
sense in my fooling myself said wednesday his battered 
presidential campaign is skipping the super tuesday primaries and 
caucuses to try to recover from four straight defeats 
republican alsoran jack kemp vowed he too would press on 
despite an 05 record unlike simon the new york congressman said 
he would take his chances in the clump of primaries in the south 
and elsewhere on march 8 
im in this all the way to new orleans and the gop 
convention in august said kemp in beaufort sc 
it is on to atlanta and the democratic convention in july 
echoed simon at a washington news conference 
simon the illinois senator has yet to win a democratic event 
watching massachusetts michael dukakis and missouri rep richard 
gephardt split the early contests so he said he will skip the 
south and focus on his home state primary on march 15 one week 
after super tuesday 
the campaign will begin anew after super tuesday starting in 
illinois simon said 
money is the problem simon sees in the south 
there is no sense in my fooling myself the illinois 
democrat said we just dont have the money 
simons campaign plunged into debt before the new hampshire 
primary but he has collected close to half a million dollars in 
the past two weeks 
we have had recordbreaking fundraising simon said 
monday for example 137000 came in we never had a day like 
that before but you take 137000 and then look at 20 states and 
what it would cost for a media buy and youre talking about 
something that is nowhere near adequate 
im not writing off the south i want my friends there to vote 
for me simon added im realistic about resources i simply 
cannot do everything 
on the republican side kemp said he was outspent in the tuesday 
contests in south dakota and minnesota but that would not happen 
in the south senate gop leader bob dole won both contests with 
former evangelist pat robertson coming in second vice president 
george bush trailed 
we beat bush in minnesota i was outspent 8to1 by dole 
and probably 10to1 by robertson were going to match them 
dollarfordollar in the south and in south carolina kemp said 
kemps hopes have been badly shaken by robertsons strong 
showing in the early caucus states and robertson has said that he 
will win the south carolina primary on march 5 the dooropener to 
the super tuesday primaries 
i think last night proved the race is wide open thats all i 
really needed i needed to break up the idea that this is a 
bushdole race this is no longer a bushdole race kemp added 
kemp finished second in michigan third in new hampshire and 
minnesota and fourth in iowa and south dakota 
among the democrats simon said he has concluded that the super 
tuesday contests will continue the early pattern of confusing 
results with no clear frontrunner emerging leading to a brokered 
convention in atlanta 
super tuesday is likely to result in a very mixed picture 
he said phase one of the selection process ends on march 8 
but we do not have the resources for winning in the super tuesday 
states 
phase two of the selection process begins march 15 i shall 
use phase two to deliver the message that we must become a nation 
with leadership characterized by compassion and vision and common 
sense it is on to atlanta with that message 
he cited growing evidence that for the first time in recent 
history there will be no firstballot winner at the democratic 
convention 
simon claimed he was in second place in the delegate count but 
the ap count places simon in third place with 33 delegates behind 
dukakis with 445 and gephardt with 39 simon aides said he is 
claiming delegates out of minnesota even though the returns 
allocating the delegates there will not be known until march 8 
simon is on the ballot in all the super tuesday primaries but 
he said he will do little or no campaigning in those states 
except for the nationally televised debates that are a major 
feature of the next two weeks 
simons best day so far was in iowa on feb 8 where he finished 
a very close second to gephardt he was third in new hampshire and 
then fourth in the tuesday contests

two of the networks have decided that the super 
tuesday primary is so unlikely to produce a clear winner in the 
presidential nominating races that they are cutting back on their 
planned primetime coverage 
cbs had planned to preempt its entire primetime schedule for 
super tuesday coverage on march 8 but decided tuesday to cut back 
to two hours nbc which had planned a twohour special cut it to 
one hour 
the reasoning is that after iowa and new hampshire we 
determined that super tuesday was not going to be as conclusive as 
previously thought said nbc news spokesman bill mcandrew in 
planning coverage we protectively booked two hours and decided we 
could cover it comprehensively in one 
gene f jankowski president of the cbs broadcast group said 
the network decided the public wasnt interested enough in the 
primary results to spend more than two hours 
what we did was took a look at the publics attitude in iowa 
what the publics reaction to the coverage in new hampshire was and 
did a reevaluation of what the reaction was going to be to the 
primaries that take place on march 8 and said to ourselves from an 
editorial point of view and journalistic point of view can we 
really fill three hours in a meaningful way that the audience would 
want to watch he said 
abc was sticking to its plan to have two hours of coverage 
despite the fact that tuesday is its highestrated night of 
primetime programming cnn will have comprehensive coverage 
throughout the evening beginning at 6 pm est 
on pbs the macneillehrer newshour will wait until 
wednesday to assess the results 
because were not stupid were going to avoid projecting or 
predicting what may happen said associate editor jim lehrer 
it is so diverse and diffused down there who knows what all of 
these many many results are going to add up to when its all said 
and done 
this is the first year for super tuesday when 20 states most 
of them in the south will select delegates to the two presidential 
nominating conventions coverage of the event stretching from 
massachusetts to american samoa has confounded the networks who 
are additionally hampered by budget cutbacks in the news divisions 
before the presidential campaign began the networks believed 
super tuesday would likely clinch the race in one or both parties 
but after the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary failed to 
produce clear frontrunners the networks decided super tuesday was 
less likely to be decisive 
the networks are backing and filling theyre less sure than 
they were that well actually know who the nominee will be said 
abc correspondent jeff greenfield you have to assume at present 
its going to be an extremely diffuse result we may come out of 
this not knowing a thing

president reagan on wednesday sent congress 
the truth in federal spending act aimed at attacking budget 
deficits with a payasyougo approach to new programs 
the legislative proposal is part of the economic bill of 
rights reagan announced last july it would force the executive 
and legislative branches to spell out the costs of programs and 
legislation 
reagan said the bill will help us carry out the important 
goals reflected in the deficitreduction accord reached in the 
aftermath of the oct 19 wall street crash 
faced with indications of growing investor uneasiness with 
redink budgets reagan and leading lawmakers signed the nov 20 
agreement calling for a twoyear 76 billion reduction program 
that accord also provided for 9 billion in tax increases in 
fiscal 1988 which began oct 1 and 14 billion in fiscal 1989 
in asking for enactment of the truthinspending bill reagan 
said the agreement with congressional leaders reflects a strong 
consensus that federal spending must be brought under control 
protecting the federal budget from special interest 
budgetbusting legislation requires a continued ongoing 
commitment he said in a message to congress despite recent 
encouraging efforts to bring the federal budget deficit under 
control major problems persist 
the truthinspending proposal was among several reagan unveiled 
last july 3 in a speech at the jefferson memorial here 
other components of the socalled economic bill of rights 
included a balanced budget amendment and lineitem veto authority 
for presidents it also contained a proposal to require a 
supermajority vote rather than a simple majority for 
enactment of tax hikes 
the truthinspending legislation would require executive 
agencies and the congress to submit legislation and programs that 
are revenue neutral 
each piece of legislation would have to be accompanied by a 
financial impact statement showing how much it would cost and 
proposing concurrent cuts in other programs or increases in 
federal revenues to cover the costs 
reagan said in his message he wanted to make it clear that there 
is no intent in the legislation simply to shift the costs of 
legislation from the federal to state and local governments 
in another development reagan budget director james c miller 
iii said the president will not propose legislation to rescind 
porkbarrel spending as he promised in his state of the union 
address 
it will not be in the form of a package of rescissions but a 
list for congress to review he told the senate appropriations 
committee the president will be leaving it up to you members of 
congress he said 
if the president proposed rescissions those accounts would be 
frozen for 45 days while congress decided whether to make the cuts 
permanent in a process with procedural advantages the list 
however would have no force of law 
sen mark o hatfield rore criticized the administration for 
focusing so much attention on small items that really add up to a 
hill of beans compared to the huge budget deficit problems 
every dollar counts he said but keep matters in 
perspective 
hatfield also complained that the administration touts its own 
initiatives such as buying new leather flight jackets for the 
military as good government while congressional priorities become 
pork barrel

a moslem guerrilla leader said 
wednesday that the united states has struck a secret deal with 
moscow to betray the insurgents fighting to overthrow afghanistans 
sovietbacked government 
gulbaddin hekmatyar head of the extremist islamic party 
guerrilla group reiterated his vow to keep fighting in afghanistan 
until peace is forged on the insurgents terms 
speaking to reporters and diplomats he said evidence of 
washingtons alleged betrayal was its acceptance of soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs offer to begin removing red army troops from 
afghanistan on may 15 if a unsponsored peace accord is signed 
next month 
soviet troops intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 and by 
western estimates 115000 are still there 
hekmatyar said the soviet pullout would leave the country in the 
hands of the communist kabul government making it impossible for 
the nearly 5 million afghan refugees in pakistan and iran to return 
home 
i dont think gorbachev made the offer without making a deal 
with the americans he said 
pakistan recently has insisted that any un accord on foreign 
intervention in the afghan conflict include an agreement that an 
interim government would be installed in kabul during the 
withdrawal 
asked why he thought the united states would betray the 
guerrillas after supporting them throughout the war hekmatyar 
said thats an impertinent question 
asked whether his group would continue to accept us military 
aid he said nobody can buy us or sell us out 
the mujahedeen alliance comprising the seven political factions 
of the insurgents this week announced its own blueprint for a 
government to replace the sovietbacked one in kabul 
it envisons a joint executive committee composed of all seven 
guerrilla leaders to preside over a 28member cabinet composed of 
mujahedeen afghan refugees and moslems presently living in 
kabul 
the plan says the head of the cabinet would also be head of 
state but it did not suggest who would have that post 
hekmatyars said that if pakistan the mujahedeens 
headquarters signed a un accord without the guerrillas 
approval they might change their external operating base to iran 
the next round of peace talks is scheduled to begin march 2 in 
geneva islamabad the capital of pakistan and kabul have been the 
principal negotiators in the talks 
pakistan has indicated it might not sign any agreement until a 
new government is installed in kabul

president reagan said wednesday the decline in 
the value of the dollar has opened opportunities for us exporters 
but they could be undermined by protectionist legislation being 
considered in congress 
the fact that the dollars exchange rate is at a far more 
realistic level is of great significance to the market for us 
exports the president told members of export now a publicprivate 
group organized by the commmerce department 
new opportunities are emerging because of the adjustment in 
the value of the dollar he said at the current exchange rates 
many american companies can now quote a lower price to customers in 
hamburg antwerp or osaka than their competitors and still make a 
higher profit than on sales in the domestic market 
in addition he said in the last few years american industry 
has been going through an unprecedented period of renovation 
computerization and modernization 
what we dont need now however is protectionisn that 
undermines all the progress weve made the president said 
i strongly urge congress to send me a trade bill that does not 
imperil our ability to export by causing other countries to close 
their markets he said we shouldnt shoot ourselves in the 
foot after we have worked so hard and are in a position to win the 
race 
the president said legislation being considered by a 
housesenate conference committee contains provisions that 
encourage exports and we dont want to lose those 
but he said other provisions would violate the general agreement 
on trade and tariffs and make us business less competitive 
we ask for your support to ensure that we dont end up with an 
economykilling protectionist bill reagan told the group 
secretary of commerce william verity introduced reagan saying 
he was to make introductory remarks and wave the flag 
verity said the president had told him in no uncertain terms 
that the comemrce department would lead an effort to expand sale of 
us goods overseas the commerce secretary said there has been a 
tremendous improvement in the climate for exporting he 
attributed that to an exchange rate that favors the united states 
and to an administration in washington that cares and would like 
to do more to stimulate us sales abroad

washington republicans angrily complained of banana 
republic tactics wednesday after armed capitol police broke into 
gop sen bob packwoods locked office arrested him and hauled him 
feetfirst into the senate chamber during an allnight filibuster 
over democratic campaign finance legislation 
on a motion by senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva 
sergeant at arms henry k giugni was handed warrants for the arrest 
of absent republican senators thus forcing them to answer a quorum 
call and keep the filibuster alive 
it was after midnight more than 10 hours after the filibuster 
began when giugni and five armed plainclothes capitol policemen 
began stalking senate hideaways and senators suites in nearby 
office buildings 
giugni found several senators offices empty but saw sen steve 
symms ridaho running down a hallway to escape arrest then in an 
extraordinary incident that the senate historian said had not 
occurred since 1942 giugni used a passkey to unlock packwoods 
office door 
bob witeck a spokesman for the oregon republican said packwood 
resisted and somehow jammed a finger he had broken two weeks ago in 
a fall he tried to hold the door closed with his shoulder but 
they were able to push it open witeck said 
i had to shove in the door to get into his office said 
giugni a stocky army veteran of world war ii and former vice squad 
policeman in honolulu i think he hurt his finger he was very 
courteous 
packwood walked with giugni and his police escort a block or so 
from the russell senate office building to the senate wing of the 
capitol but refused to walk on the floor willingly witeck said 
at that point three policemen grabbed packwood by his ankles 
and both arms and carried him bodily into the senate chamber feet 
first packwood later went to a hospital where xrays showed that 
his left hand enclosed in a cast had not been reinjured during 
the scuffle with giugni 
i rather enjoyed it packwood told reporters later i 
instructed four of my staff to bring a sedan chair but except for 
the honor of it id rather walk 
packwood said he boltlocked his main office door after his 
staff reported that giugni would try to arrest him 
the senator said it sounded like a battering ram at the 
door with his shoulder pushing from inside against three shoulders 
on the other side their mass beat my mass packwood said 
adding that he suffered only swollen knuckles 
giugni served the arrest warrant signed by the presiding 
officer sen brock adams dwash after 1 am 
on a more serious note packwood said the campaign spending bill 
has no chance of becoming law because senate republicans have more 
than enough votes to sustain a certain veto by president reagan 
and that byrd succeeded only in alienating his gop colleagues 
packwoods arrest provoked angry clashes between democrats and 
republicans sen arlen specter rpa said the incident brought 
to mind the policestate measures of nazi germany and communist 
russia he protested that packwood was hustled into the senate 
chamber like a common criminal 
sen orrin hatch rutah complained of banana republic 
tactics and said packwoods arrest flaunted the constitution of 
the united states he proposed a change in the senate rules to 
forbid any future arrest of absentee senators 
sen john kerry dmass responded that republican senators had 
engaged in a shameful display of fleeing the chamber to avoid a 
quorum call requiring giugni to search them down like a 
headmaster chasing schoolchildren 
senators went off in a dead sprint said sen dale bumpers 
dark they should have been in calgary in one of the olympic 
events 
the incident was prompted by a walkout by republican senators 
from the filibuster that they had started in opposition to the 
democratic proposal to impose voluntary spending limits in general 
election campaigns for the senate 
the republicans charge that the bill was a democratic attempt to 
discriminate against them in states with a heavy democratic edge in 
registered voters they began a filibuster early tuesday afternoon 
to prevent the democratic majority from bringing the bill to a 
floor vote they are virtually certain to win 
but when the gop senators failed to answer repeated quorum calls 
requiring the presence of a majority of no fewer than 51 senators 
byrd invoked a parliamentary rule that requires every senator to 
attend floor sessions unless excused after a series of roll calls 
failed to lure republicans back to the floor byrd moved to have 
the sergeant at arms arrest the absentees and escort them to the 
chamber 
his motion was approved 453 with dissenting votes cast by 
democrats howell heflin and richard shelby of alabama and dennis 
deconcini of arizona the arrest warrants were signed by adams who 
was presiding over the senate at the time 
byrd said later he had no choice but to resort to the arrest 
tactic because only 50 senators one short of a majority had 
answered the last quorum call and three democrats were unavoidably 
absent he appealed for an end to the republicans guerrilla 
warfare against the bill 
the senate rules provide that the sergeant at arms can be 
ordered to request or compel the attendance of absentees 
if that doesnt work the senate can direct the sergeant at arms 
or his deputies to arrest absent senators and bring them to the bar 
of the senate 
democrats and republicans have been at loggerheads for nearly a 
year over the democratic proposal which has 52 cosponsors to 
impose voluntary senate campaign spending limits of 950000 to 
55 million depending on a states population 
under the bill a candidate who observes the voluntary spending 
limit would get campaign funds from the treasury if an opponent 
exceeded the limit or an independent group spent large amounts of 
money in opposition 
senate historian richard baker said the last time something

and escorted sen kenneth mckellar dtenn to the senate floor 
for a vote on poll tax legislation

us secretary of state george p shultz will 
find israel deeply divided over how best to approach peace 
negotiations with the arabs 
shultzs mission will take him to neighboring arab states but 
he will also have to shuttle between conservative prime minister 
yitzhak shamir and his liberal foreign minister shimon peres 
it may be difficult to wring concessions from shamir many in 
his likud bloc are grumbling about the american timing worried 
that any change of position will create the impression that israel 
is giving in to arab rioters 
the country is in a very defiant mood said a shamir 
adviser adding that any hint of us pressure would likely 
backfire 
the shamir aide said he doubted an agreement on starting 
negotiations with the arabs was not possible in the five days 
shultz has set aside for his trip 
a more upbeat assessment came from yossi beilin 
directorgeneral of the foreign ministry 
we are welcoming the initiative we are welcoming the timing 
we understand all of us that there is no military solution for 
the uprising in the territories but only a peaceful solution 
beilin said 
i am far from thinking that it is an impossible mission he 
added 
the main difference between peres and shamir is over whether 
israel should exchange territory captured in the 1967 middle east 
war for peace with the arabs the two also disagree over whether 
israel should participate in an international peace conference 
peres favors the return of some land and has agreed to jordanian 
king husseins demand for an international conference 
shamir opposes returning land and argues an international 
conference would be a biased forum and would give the soviet union 
too great a say 
shultz has tried to find middle ground in one disagreement by 
proposing that arabisraeli talks be launched at an international 
event 
shamir who has accepted the idea of sovietamerican auspices 
has not closed the door to shultzs proposal but asked the 
secretary for clarification on what kind of format he has in mind 
to satisfy the arabs shultz needs israeli approval for a 
landforpeace trade 
but his mention of this formula in a recent speech irritated 
shamir and prompted him to send emissaries to washington to stress 
that no pledge to give up land would be made in advance 
shamir hinted at the possibility that he was ready to 
negotiate territory we are ready to negotiate on the territorial 
issue but that doesnt mean we are ready to agree in advance to 
withdraw from occupied lands said yossi olmert a legislator 
shamir sent to talk with shultz 
a senior israel official who demanded anonymity said shultz 
would try to hammer out guidelines for arabisraeli talks on both a 
temporary and a permament solution in the west bank and gaza strip 
the first obstacle he faces in this quest is a usproposed 
yearlong timetable designed to get the process moving before us 
and israeli elections in november 
according to his schedule an international conference would 
convene in april elections for a palestinian selfrule council 
would follow in october and in december talks would begin on a 
final settlement 
shultzs formula is designed to overcome arab suspicions that 
negotiations would never move beyond the limited autonomy idea a 
concept rejected by the palestinians since it was first proposed in 
the 1978 camp david accords 
the palestinians seek an independent state which is opposed by 
israelis on both the right and left 
shamir has demanded a confidencebuilding period of several 
years to set the stage for talks on a final disposition of the west 
bank and gaza strip 
not even the most optimistic israelis are predicting shultz will 
iron out the final guidelines for talks during his visit the best 
they hope for is an initial breakthrough that will set the 
stage for further trips by shultz or other us officials 
shultz was dealt an early setback when palestinian moderates 
were banned by yasser arafats palestine liberation organization 
from meeting with the secretary in jerusalem 
without palestinian participation the new us peace initiative 
is unlikely to have the desired calming effect on rioting in the 
occupied lands 
in fact his visit may have the opposite effect responding to 
leaflets calling for antishultz protests a general strike was 
launched on the eve of shultzs visit and israeli security 
officials are preparing for an escalation of violence

the later life of josephine baker the 
american entertainer known as the darling of paris in the jazz 
age is documented in a collection of personal papers photographs 
and clippings acquired by the yale university library 
the collection was assembled by harry harford janes of england 
who died last year before he could complete a biography of her 
yales beinecke rare book and manuscript library bout the 
collection at auction in london in december 
i knew that she was of ongoing interest patricia willis 
beinecke curator of american literature said wednesday 
baker who died in 1975 at age 69 was known for her opulent 
costumes singing and exotic dancing in the folies bergere in the 
1920s 
the st louis native first dazzled french audiences in 1925 in 
her performance in the revue negre or the black review when she 
dressed in scarlet ostrich plumes and danced on a mirrored drum 
that role along with her love of the exotic illustrated by a 
daily stroll down the champs elysees with her leashed pet leopard 
earned her another nickname siren of the tropics 
she was the first to have highly unusual costumes and to work 
with a chorus that was extravagantly beautiful making a whole 
image of the stage willis said 
the yale collection acquired in december focuses on the second 
half of her life beginning with her work entertaining allied 
troops during world war ii willis said 
the collection includes letters from princess grace of monaco 
and photographs and articles from the french and british press 
baker and her husband jo bouillion adopted 12 children whom 
they dubbed their rainbow tribe one picture shows baker with 
the entire clan by a swimming pool at les milandes their home in 
southern france 
willis said she did not know if a collection of papers 
documenting bakers earlier life exists and she said she did now 
know of any major biography of her 
the papers have become part of the beineckes james weldon

a test of a redesigned nozzletocase 
joint for the space shuttle booster rocket was set for wednesday 
despite computer problems which forced a delay 
the sixsecond test the fourth of six nozzle joint environment 
simulator experiments and one of hundreds of tests of booster 
rocket components was rescheduled for 3 pm mst at the wasatch 
operations plant of morton thiokol inc 25 miles west of here 
the joint was deliberately flawed to allow hot gases to blow 
past bonded adhesive insulation and one of three orings to reach 
the crafts main seal or primary oring said company spokesman 
rocky raab 
he said the test was designed to evaluate the main seals 
ability to contain any gases that might leak through the insulation 
and a wiper oring during a launch 
the test had been scheduled for 1 pm but was delayed because 
of unspecified problems with a ground computer raab said 
engineers concluded after the third test of the joint on oct 8 
that the oring system withstood gas pressure after a deliberate 
flaw was built into the joint which connects the nozzle to the 
body of the segmented booster rocket 
however during a fullscale test on dec 23 a blow hole 
was detected in the joints adhesive sealant a defect nasa had 
not built into the test but one which officials described as very 
benign 
for wednesdays test engineers created a quarterinch by 
fivehundredthsinch hole through the bonded insulation and damaged 
the wiper oring two flaws aligned to assure a gas path in the 
joint up to the primary seal 
raab said the double defects would subject the joint to a 
little bit more severe conditions than previous tests 
again its another step in the process of ensuring that this 
is a failsafe and faulttolerant design raab said it builds 
our experience base on the behavior of the joint and it also 
serves as a precursor for the april fullsize motor firing which 
will have similar flaws raab said 
blow holes can occur during assembly of the 126foot rocket 
so it happens here at the factory if it happens he said 
raab said the test simulates the most difficult portion of the 
environment for the orings that is the first one second of 
launch 
the solidfuel rocket booster was redesigned following the jan 
28 1986 explosion of the shuttle challenger the disaster which 
killed the crafts sevenmember crew was blamed on a faulty seal 
in a booster joint that allowed hot gases to escape and ignite the 
shuttles external fuel tank 
while the blow hole detected in december was not considered a 
major problem the failure of a nozzle boot ring during the same 
test prompted national aeronautics and space administration 
officials to push back the june 2 target date for resuming shuttle 
flights 
the launch of discovery is now planned sometime in august 
in addition to the final two njes tests scheduled before shuttle 
flights resume nasa and morton thiokol will conduct several more 
joint environment simulator tests of the booster rocket and three 
more fullscale horizontal tests the first one tentatively set for 
early april raab said

up to 1 million taxpayers will receive federal 
refunds as much as three weeks earlier this year by having a 
professional file their tax returns directly into the irs computer 
already this year 119494 returns have been filed 
electronically compared with 77612 for the entire filing season 
in 1987 if the taxpayers choose their refunds will be deposited 
directly into their bank account 
although the number of electronic returns are up considerably 
this year the volume of ordinary paper returns filed so far is 
67 percent below last years pace however the gap which 
officials blame partially on the new tax law is closing each week 
through feb 19 the internal revenue service said wednesday 
2355 million returns had been filed compared with 2524 million a 
year ago the irs has processed 974 million of this years 
returns up slightly from 972 million last year 
the inventory of unprocessed return totaled 138 million last 
week compared with 155 million a year ago 
the number of returns qualifying for refunds is down 144 
percent a decline that irs officials cannot explain through last 
week 38 million refunds had been certified the figure was almost 
45 million at this time last year 
the average refund is bigger this year 782 compared with 727 
by the time all 107 million individual returns are filed this year 
the irs estimates nearly 80 percent will qualify for refunds 
averaging about 1000 
it is taking the irs about five weeks to process a return and 
certify a refund check this year but those taxpayers who file 
electronically are getting refunds within two or three weeks 
this is the third year of electronic filing and within three or 
four more years says richard f moran who manages the project 
about 35 million returns will be filed annually by computer 
electronic returns save the irs considerable time said moran 
and these returns generally have fewer errors that would delay a 
refund the irs estimates electronic filing could save 200 million 
in processing and storage costs over the next 10 years 
and if a taxpayer who files electronically chooses to have the 
refund deposited directly into a bank account that saves the 
treasury 23 cents that would have been spent to issue and mail a 
paper check 
so far electronic filing is available only to taxpayers in 10 
states and parts of four others who are due refunds and who pay any 
of about 2000 professional preparers to fill out their returns 
although the preparer sends the completed return directly into the 
irs computer by telephone line the taxpayer must sign a signature 
form which is mailed to the irs 
electronic filing is avaible in alabama arizona indiana 
kentucky nebraska north carolina utah virginia washington and 
wisconsin and in the albany and buffalo areas of new york the 
sacramento and san jose areas of california and the cincinnati and 
dallas areas 
all electronic returns are processed to irs centers in ogden 
utah or cincinnati

an anesthesiologist performed experiments on a 
comatose patient his superior said wednesday after frances health 
minister suspended the doctor for experiments on another comatose 
patient 
on tuesday a professor of medicine testified in a criminal 
trial in the western city of poitiers that a doctor he did not 
identify had placed a deeply comatose patient considered legally 
dead on sabotaged medical equipoment 
professor jean lassner said the experiment was carried out to 
see if the effects were the same in the case on trial in which a 
young woman died possibly from medical sabotage 
maurice peria director of the regional hospital center of 
amiens said wednesday that the experiment was carried out by dr 
alain milhaud on 24yearold man who had been in a deep coma since 
late january he said the mans family had been notified and the 
patient survived the experiment 
the experiment was videotaped and sent to dr lassner so he 
could use it at the trial peria said he said milhaud proceeded 
without the consent of the hospital 
lassner gave his testimony in the trial of three doctors charged 
in the 1984 death of nicole berneron after her operation for a 
benign tumor at jean bernard hospital in poitiers 
mrs berneron then 33 and the mother of two children 
apparently received nitrous oxide instead of oxygen after the 
operation and died of asphyxiation an investigation showed that 
the tubes had been switched 
milhaud was condemned by the medical community after he admitted 
experimenting in 1985 on a 20yearold comatose man 
health minister michele barzach on wednesday ordered milhaud 
suspended from his duties in amiens north of paris and asked the 
state prosecutor to investigate to find out who had carried out the 
latest experiment 
the minister a doctor said she was indignant and revolted 
that in this country one can carry out experiments on humans 
obviously without their consent given their state 
in comments during the 1985 controversy milhaud called patients 
in a prolonged chronic vegetative state almost perfect human 
models who constitute intermediaries between animal and man 
in the 1985 experiment he injected in two minutes a quart of 
blood into the patients bone marrow to try to show this was a 
viable treatment for patients in shock the man comatose for three 
years died within months but no link between the experiment and 
the death was established 
president francois mitterrand condemned human experimentation 
human beings are not instruments he said neither the 
search for truth nor scientific progress must distance us from this 
certitude this value of civilization

the nation must double its spending on public 
works projects ranging from highways to waste disposal plants to 
keep them from falling into ruin a governmentappointed commission 
said wednesday 
but in an era of high budget deficits and a push to reduce 
spending not increase it there are few signs that either congress 
or the white house is prepared to embrace the call for spending 
billions of additional dollars for such programs 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny said he was introducing 
legislation calling for an additional 5 billion a year in public 
works spending but aides acknowledged there is little chance the 
bill would go far this election year 
the white house gave little notice to the report by the national 
council on public works improvement although it appointed three of 
its five members the administration recently sent a proposed 
fiscal 1989 budget to congress calling for reduced highway and mass 
transit spending 
the special government council created four years ago to 
examine the nations public works needs concluded that the 
quality of americas infrastructure is barely adequate to meet 
current requirements and insufficient to meet the demands of future 
economic growth without sharply increased spending 
for americas public works the yellow light is flashing the 
danger sign is apparent there is serious and very real cause for 
alarm joseph giglio the councils chairman and a wall street 
investment banker 
if we do not act to shore up our nations infrastructure we 
could very soon be faced with enormous problems that imperil future 
economic growth giglio said at a news conference 
the report called for all levels of government and the private 
sector to double their capital spending on public works projects 
from an annual level of 45 billion to 90 billion by the end of 
the century 
the council criticized the federal government for hoarding funds 
in various public works trust funds a cash balance of 24 billion 
in 1987 according to the report but said additional revenue must 
also be obtained 
it suggested possible sources of new money ranging from higher 
federal fuel taxes to local impact fees on developers 
in most cases we cannot rely simply on wiser spending we also 
must generate additional sources of funding the council declared 
the five council members acknowledged that the call for billions 
of dollars of increased spending for public works comes as a 
variety of social programs the military and other government needs 
are competing for limited funds 
to throw one more urgent monetary request into the pot may 
seem foolhardy said panel member freeman holmer president of 
eugene ore city council it is anything but ignoring our 
infrastructure the foundation of our economy will be even more 
costly in the long run 
the study also included a report card on progress made in 
dealing with each major type of public works 
the panel gave no failing grades however it raised serious 
concerns about efforts to deal with toxic wastes which received a 
grade of d as well as attempts to grapple with mass transit solid 
waste disposal and waste water treatment needs all three areas 
received a c or cminus grade 
highway programs did a little better with a cplus programs to 
manage water resources was given a b the best grade followed by 
bminuses for aviation and water supply management 
as a whole this is a report card that would make most parents 
weep said council member peter goldmark jr a vice president of 
the times mirror co of los angeles 
discussing hazardous wastes the council said that while 
spending to clean up contaminated sites has increased fivefold in 
the last two years only a small fraction of the 2 tons of waste 
per capita produced in america each year is being treated safely 
on water quality the council suggested that governments at all 
levels have been fighting a losing battle despite a 44 
billion federal investment in sewage treatment since 1972 water 
quality has not improved significantly due in part to 
uncontrolled sources of pollution it said 
the report said overall spending on public works has declined 
from 36 percent of the gross national product in 1960 to 26 
percent in 1985 money for public works programs accounted for 20 
percent of total government spending in 1950 but only 7 percent in 
1984 it said 
in effect were drawing down past investments without making 
commensurate investments of our own the report said failure 
to reverse this decline will exact a high price for the nation in 
the future both in the cost of deferred investment and in reduced 
economic competitiveness 
other members of the council are lowell b jackson an 
engineering consultant from aurora colo and freida k wallison 
a washington dc lawyer

three democratic presidential candidates could 
lose future federal matching funds based on poor showings in the 
south dakota primary but they have 30 days to turn that around 
before the money is cut off 
democrats jesse jackson sen albert gore jr of tennessee and 
former colorado sen gary hart became ineligible for matching funds 
by attaining less than 10 percent of the vote in two successive 
primaries south dakota on tuesday and new hampshire a week 
earlier 
but election law stays the actual cutoff of money for 30 days 
after the second primary giving the candidates a chance to 
reestablish their matching fund status by doing better in a 
subsequent primary 
during the 30 days the candidates can continue to receive 
federal matching funds for every contribution of 250 or less that 
they raise privately 
there is absolutely no harm done to the campaign by this 
said gore spokesman paul risley he added that gore by focusing 
his campaign on the south had never expected to do well in new 
hampshire or south dakota but anticipated better results before the 
30day period ended 
the candidates can regain eligibility by achieving a 20 percent 
or better showing in a successive primary 
that means they have a chance to redeem themselves on march 8 
when the super tuesday series of 20 primaries occurs most of the 
states are in the south where both jackson and gore have strong 
support 
jacksons campaign manager gerald austin said he anticipates 
no problem in keeping matchingfund eligibility he said that since 
jacksons respectable showing in iowas caucuses on feb 8 when he 
came in fourth the campaign has raised 400000 
harts possibilities are weaker his campaign organization is 
tiny and he raised only 70000 during january 
the matching money is distributed from an us treasury account 
that is supported by the voluntary 1 checkoff on individual income 
tax forms 
gop contender pat robertson dropped below the 10 percent 
threshhold in new hampshire but he redeemed himself with a 20 
percent showing in south dakota 
to be declared eligible initially by the fec a candidate must 
raise 100000 across 20 states in contributions of 250 or less

prince charles said tuesday he has banned the use 
of aerosols in his household because of concern that they damage 
the environment and so far the only problem has been finding an 
alternative to hair spray 
aerosols contain chlorofluorocarbons cfcs which float into the 
stratosphere and attack the ozone layer a 20miledeep belt of 
protective gas around the earth 
we are always told that it is not scientifically proved 
charles said 
but i personally as i have become older and more autocratic 
have banned the use of aerosols in my household 
in a lighthearted reference to his wife princess diana the 
39yearold heir to the british throne added 
trouble still remains with finding adequate and good enough 
alternatives to hair spray as i am sure all husbands here will 
find 
he spoke to representatives of businesses which won awards for 
improving the environment under a program organized by the royal 
society of arts 
he said the awardwinners had found solutions to environmental 
problems so if anybody can come up with a really good answer an 
alternative to hair sprays then for gods sake do so and i will 
come and give the award next year 
the environmental group friends of the earth welcomed the 
princes action but said he did not have to ban sprays completely 
from his household 
there are environmentally safe alternatives for every single 
kind of spray including hair spray said charles secrett a 
spokesman for the group 
holes in the ozone layer allow the suns ultraviolet rays to 
reach the earth causing skin cancer and threatening to damage 
crops and alter weather patterns

the supreme court was told wednesday that 
police should be allowed to pursue someone who starts running at 
the sight of them without having any other reason to suspect a 
crime has been committed 
the alternative is for the police to shrug their shoulders and 
let a crime occur said andrea l solak an assistant state 
prosecutor from detroit 
but carole m stanyar representing a man who started running 
when he spotted a police cruiser on a detroit street said 
people run from the police for a variety of reasons she said 
some people fear harassment that they will be falsely accused of a 
crime or they may not like the police 
the justices hearing arguments in a case that could expand 
police power to stop people on the street reacted skeptically to 
ms stanyars assrtions 
dont you think sound law enforcement would want the police 
to see whats up asked justice antonin scalia 
justice thurgood marshall suggested that ms stanyars client 
michael mose chesternut initiated the chase could it be he had 
a guilty conscience marshall said 
michigan authorities are seeking to reinstate as evidence drugs 
dropped by chesternut who was standing on a detroit street corner 
talking to another man a little after midnight on dec 19 1984 
when he saw the cruiser 
police said chesternut immediately started running away and they 
followed him in the car after turning a corner and as the cruiser 
drew alongside of him chesternut threw a number of packets to the 
ground and then stopped 
the officers said they picked up the packets which appeared to 
contain narcotics and they then arrested chesternut he was 
charged with possessing heroin codeine and diazapan 
a judge in detroit threw the case out on grounds police lacked a 
reasonable suspicion to pursue chesternut and therefore seized the 
evidence unlawfully 
michigan law enforcement officials said the judge may have 
dismissed the case out of a concern for innocent joggers 
mrs solak argued wednesday that the show of police authority 
which apparently prompted chesternut to drop the packets and stop 
did not amount to an illegal search and seizure barred by the 
constitutions fourth amendment 
she also said that when chesternut dropped the packets he 
abandoned any right of privacy he had to protect them from a police 
search 
ms stanyar countered that chesternut reasonably believed he was 
being seized when police chased him and acted in an aggressive 
and confrontational manner 
under the circumstances a reasonable person would feel he was 
not free to leave she said he was prevented from asserting 
his right to go on his way she said 
the supreme court previously has held that police must have a 
reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing before stopping and questioning 
someone in a public place the court also has said police must have 
more specific probable cause to believe a crime has been committed 
when arresting or detaining someone 
a ruling in the case argued wednesday is expected by july 
the case is michigan vs chesternut 861824

the bechtel group inc offered in 1985 to sell 
oil to israel at a discount of at least 650 million for 10 years 
if it promised not to bomb a proposed iraqi pipeline a foreign 
ministry official said wednesday 
but thenprime minister shimon peres said the offer from bruce 
rappaport a partner in the san franciscobased construction and 
engineering company was unimportant the senior official told 
the associated press 
peres now foreign minister never discussed the offer with 
other government ministers said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the comments marked the first time israel has acknowledged any 
offer was made for assurances not to bomb the planned 1 billion 
pipeline which was to have run near israels border with jordan 
the pipeline was never built 
in san francisco tom flynn vice president for public relations 
for the bechtel group said the company did not make any offer to 
peres but that rappaport a swiss financier made it without 
bechtels knowledge or consent 
another bechtel spokesman al donner said bechtel at no 
point in development of the pipeline project had anything to do 
with the handling of the oil he said proposals submitted by the 
company did not include any specific arrangements for the 
handling of the oil or for the disposal of the oil once it reached 
the terminal 
asked about bechtels disclaimers after they were made in san 
francisco the israeli foreign ministry official said peres 
believed rappaport made the offer for the company 
rappaport came to peres as a representative of bechtel and 
said he was speaking on behalf of bechtel the official said 
if he was not he misrepresented himself 
the jerusalem post on wednesday quoted sources close to peres as 
saying that according to rappaport bechtel had said the oil sales 
would have to be conducted through a third party to keep the sales 
secret from iraq and jordan 
the foreign ministry official said peres did not take the offer 
seriously 
this is a man who sees 10 people every day he said 
thirty percent of them come with crazy ideas he just says yes 
yes well think about it thats how things work in israel 
the offer appeared to be the one mentioned in a september 1985 
memo to attorney general edwin meese iii the memo referred to an 
arrangement between peres and rappaport to the effect that israel 
will receive somewhere between 65 million and 70 million a year 
for 10 years 
the memo from meese friend e robert wallach rappaports 
attorney also states what was also indicated to me and which 
would be denied everywhere is that a portion of those funds will 
go directly to labor a reference to the political party peres 
leads 
the wallach memo has become the focus of an investigation into 
whether meese knew of a possibly improper payment peres has denied 
any wrongdoing and has denounced the memo as complete nonsense 
the israeli official said rappaport a native of israel and a 
close friend of peres relayed the offer to peres earlier in 
september 
peres thought the offer was unimportant for him the most 
important thing was to have an iraqi oil port near israels 
border the official said 
the thinking was that this would put iraq in a position where 
it would not be able to wage war with israel out of concern for 
its pipeline 
a person answering the telephone at rappaports swiss residence 
said he was out of town and could not be reached for comment

sailors from an american guidedmissile 
cruiser risked their lives in a threehour operation to free a 
30ton sperm whale tangled in fishing nets in the arabian sea us 
officials said tuesday 
at one point ltjg james m syvertsen of wading river ny 
rode the back of the 40foot mammal like something out of a 
rodeo while cutting the nylon cords according to a navy news 
release issued in manama 
he was one of four divers who went into the water to cut the 
nets loose in the dangerous operation sunday 
in the end the female whale was freed and swam off with one 
last piece of line dangling like dental floss between its 
teeth according to capt clinton j coneway skipper of the 
cruiser truxtun 
through the ordeal the whale made no attempts to harm the 
swimmers it seemed that she knew they were trying to help said 
coneway all in all it was a most unusual and rewarding way to 
spend a sunday afternoon jacques cousteau would be proud 
the rescue occurred after crewmen aboard a helicopter from the 
nuclearpowered carrier enterprise spotted the whale floating 
listlessly the helicopter was on a routine patrol and the crew 
dropped smoke flares to mark the spot for the truxtun which was 30 
miles away 
the two ships are part of a us battle group that arrived in 
the arabian sea earlier this month to support naval operations in 
the persian gulf 
the helicopter crewmen said they thought the whale was dead 
until they saw water spouting from its blowhole according to 
petty officer james cox a rescue specialist aboard the helicopter 
rear adm guy zeller commander of the enterprises escort 
group ordered the truxtun to the scene 
its crew used grappling hooks to snag the net and pull the tired 
animal next to the ship where they worked to remove the net the 
navy said the nylon net was a type used by fishermen in the area 
but it was of unknown orgin 
curtis michitsch of reno nev was lowered in a sling to cut 
the nets 
when he became exhausted he was replaced by seaman gerald 
samples of wilbur neb 
although they appeared to have nearly freed the whale which 
swam a short distance away coneway said he feared the animal still 
might not survive because of the the remaining nets and he 
dispatched a whaleboat to overtake it 
syvertsen one of two volunteers became entangled in the net 
for about 15 minutes and finally was relieved by seaman adam 
webber a rescue swimmer from portland maine who finished the 
task 
coneway said he doubted at first his sailors would be able to 
free the whale from the tangled mess but i completely 
underestimated the ingenuity perseverance and courage of truxtuns 
swimmers and deck force

about 5000 lawyers marched on 
parliament on wednesday to demand the ouster of indias top 
policewoman and they vowed to continue a strike that began because 
police handcuffed a lawyer who allegedly rifled a womans purse 
the lawyers voted by show of hands to keep up their paralyzing 
boycott of new delhis district courts and indias supreme court 
which has been shut since feb 15 
the dispute also closed courts around the country monday when an 
estimated 500000 lawyers struck in sympathy for their new delhi 
colleagues that strike also continues 
the object of their ire is kiran bedi a deputy police 
commissioner who has a reputation for stepping on toes she made 
headlines last year by arresting a member of parliament for 
violating curfew laws 
the continuance of ms kiran bedi in her official position is 
detrimental to the interests of justice the lawyers said in a 
petition to the government 
she has struck a blow at the independence of the judiciary 
which we will not allow protest leader gobinda mukhoty told the 
lawyers demonstration 
home minister buta singh on wednesday rejected demands to 
suspend ms bedi 38 
the controversy began jan 4 when students at a college caught a 
man who allegedly rifled a female students purse 
he was handed over to police and taken in handcuffs to district 
court where he identified himself as rajesh agnihotri a new delhi 
lawyer 
angry district court lawyers went on strike the following day to 
protest the handcuffing of a colleague and demanded the suspension 
of the police officers involved 
on jan 21 striking lawyers picketed the office of ms bedi 
who has jurisdiction over the agnihotri district where the arrest 
took place 
police charged the corridors with bamboo clubs to disperse the 
barristers injuring 13 lawyers the following day the high court 
bar association joined the strike and the supreme court lawyers 
followed suit on feb 15 
the lawyers say that ms bedi was responsible for ordering 
police to charge them with clubs but they underestimated her 
public support more than 1000 people demonstrated in her favor on 
feb 17 
ms bedi was the first female member of the indian police 
service the training ground for senior officers 
in the past she has booked several senior officials and 
politicians for traffic violations in the indian capital where 
such minor indiscretions by the powerful are routinely ignored 
ms bedi has been uncharacteristically silent on the lawyers 
strike and her office has refused to comment she met with lawyers 
on the eve of the national strike in an unsuccessful pitch to call 
it off 
lawyer ram jethmalani said the issue goes beyond the recent 
handcuffing incident 
we are against this officer because she represents an evil 
principle the arrogance of the executive he said 
jethmalani considered one of indias best criminal lawyer said 
the strike would cause difficulties to litigants 
i want the people to suffer a little inconvenience this show 
of solidarity will help us serve the people better he said 
but new delhis largest daily newspaper the hindustan times 
rendered a different verdict 
the lawyers must plead guilty to the charge of having ignored 
their obligation to the clients and the society at large it said

margaret thatcher rebuked ireland on tuesday for 
conducting its own investigation of the death of a man killed by a 
gunshot from a british army observation post just inside northern 
ireland 
the prime minister said she did not think it right or 
possible under the 1985 angloirish agreement for the irish 
republic to investigate the shooting sunday of aidan mcanespie 23 
in the british province 
during the house of commons questionandanswer period she 
declared the irish government can inquire into anything they 
wish but not of course into matters north of the border the 
angloirish accord gives ireland an advisory role in the northern 
ireland affairs in an effort to redress grievances of roman 
catholics in the protestantdominated province 
mrs thatchers remarks appeared likely to worsen relations 
already strained by disputes that include britains refusal to 
prosecute police officers involved in the shooting deaths of six 
unarmed catholics in 1982 
the british army also disclosed tuesday that a soldier given 
life in prison for the shooting death of a catholic in belfast had 
been freed and returned to his regiment after serving three years 
reports that pvt ian richard thain was back in uniform 
although not in northern ireland provoked sharp responses from 
leaders of the provinces catholic minority 
thain was convicted of fatally shooting thomas reilly road 
manager of the pop group bananarama on aug 9 1983 he claimed in 
court that he fired because riots were going on and he believed 
reilly was about to pull a gun 
the judge found him deliberately untruthful thain was the 
first soldier sentenced to life in prison for actions in northern 
ireland 
an army statement said thain was 18 at the time and while the 
army in no way condones his action we consider the incident to 
have been a tragic error of judgment made by a young man in very 
difficult circumstances 
the home office said thain was released on a life license a 
form of parole under which he can be returned to prison should 
his behavior give rise to concern 
a security cordon ringed the town of aughnacloy for mcanespies 
funeral tuesday he was buried across the border in the irish 
republic 
the irish government sent eugene crowley deputy police 
commissioner to the border town of monaghan to investigation 
mcanespies death protestant politicans called the irish inquiry 
unwarranted interference by a foreign government in northern 
irelands affairs 
mcanespie supported sinn fein the legal political wing of the 
outlawed irish republican army he was killed by a bullet from a 
british army observation tower at a checkpoint near aughnacloy in 
county tyrone half a mile from the border 
relatives said he was walking to a weekly gaelic football game 
and had passed through the checkpoint 
press association the british domestic news agency said the 
soldier told interrogators the shooting was an accident he was in 
military custody tuesday

the government on wednesday 
banned political activity by 18 opposition groups including the 
nations largest antiapartheid organization and its biggest union 
federation in the most sweeping crackdown in a decade 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu said the move would be seen by 
many government opponents as a declaration of war 
law and order minister adriaan vlok however said the 
regulations will contribute to a climate of stability peaceful 
coexistence and good neighborliness among all population groups 
vloks order prohibits the united democratic front which 
represents more than 2 million members from any activity except 
bookkeeping and court action the same order was applied to 16 
other groups covering most of the large militant black political 
groups in south africa 
it gives vlok the power to prohibit any organization from 
carrying on or performing any activites or acts whatsover 
security police notified at least nine udf members of 
restrictions on their activities which included being confined to 
home and prohibited from speaking publicly 
udf copresident archie gumede was prohibited from participating 
in any udf activities and banned from speaking to journalists 
albertina sisulu the other copresident was ordered confined 
to her home from 6 pm to 5 am prohibited from participating in 
activities of the udf and other organizations and barred from 
addressing meetings of more than 10 people 
we are all peaceful organizations trying to unite the people 
is this the way of reform we dare say the government is 
declaring war on the people of south africa mrs sisulu told 
reporters she said she wasnt sure if she was prohibited from 
speaking to the press 
the 750000member congress of south african trade unions was 
ordered to stick to labor issues and barred from political 
activities such as advocating holidays with special meaning to 
blacks and calling for the release of detained union members 
antiapartheid activists had anticipated a crackdown this year 
suggesting that president pw bothas national party government 
would seek to blunt criticism from the extreme right in advance of 
parliamentary byelections next week 
the union and several of the affected organizations said they 
would consider legal action to challenge the regulations 
the governments idea of reform is to smash all effective 
possible political opposition in the country no matter how 
peaceful and lawful and to rule with a jackboot said tutu who 
won the nobel peace prize in 1984 for his fight against south 
africas system of racial segregation 
tutu appealed to the united states and other western countries 
to intensify economic pressure on south africa saying that if they 
do not act then god help us 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
the government was appalled at the restrictive measures 
this is a giant step backward for south africa redman told 
reporters 
jay naidoo generalsecretary of the trade union federation 
said the closing of the avenues of democratic expression will 
possibly lead to an escalation of civil conflict and violence 
there cannot be a peaceful resolution of south africas crisis 
without freedom of expression and association and without credible 
organizations which can articulate the needs and interests of the 
majority 
vlok said the groups being acted against had encouraged civil 
disobedience and rebellion advocated alternative structures to 
replace official ones and waged campaigns of intimidation 
all the groups denied wrongdoing 
in addition to the udf groups affected by the ban include 
the azanian peoples organization the largest group espousing 
the black consciousness philosophy pioneered by steve biko the 
activist who died in police custody in 1977 
the national education crisis committee which has promoted a 
peoples education philosphy in which black communities would 
exercise greater control over their schools 
the detainees parents support committee which monitors 
detentions and provides support for relatives of people detained 
without charge 
the soweto civic association the main antiapartheid 
community group in the countrys largest black township and a key 
factor behind the rent boycott that has persisted there for nearly 
two years 
others included regional and national youth and community 
organizations and the release mandela committee a group 
campaigning for the release from prison of african national 
congress leader nelson mandela 
the outlawed anc is the main group fighting to oust south 
africas whiteled government under the governments system of 
apartheid the nations 26 million blacks have no voice in national 
affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate schools and districts

bulgaria and turkey signed a 
protocol on good neighborly relations tuesday in an apparent effort 
to resolve their bitter dispute over bulgarias estimated 1 million 
ethnic turks 
the text of the protocol as released by the yugoslav state news 
agency tanjug was a clear indication that the two feuding 
neighbors are determined to normalize relations after years of 
discord 
the signing averted a clash between the two countries at the 
balkan foreign ministers meeting opening here wednesday 
earlier sources said the turkish delegation was planning to 
raise the issue of the ethnic turks who were forced by bulgarian 
authorities to adopt bulgarian names the sources spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the bulgarization campaign began in 1984 and reportedly led 
to violent clashes between the turkish population and bulgarian 
police it was first reported by turkish newspapers and was later 
confirmed by western diplomats and amnesty international 
foreign ministers peter mladenov of bulgaria and mesut yilmaz of 
turkey signed the protocol at a meeting in a belgrade hotel said 
tanjug 
mladenov and yilmaz arrived in belgrade on tuesday for the first 
meeting of foreign ministers from six balkan countries the other 
participants come from albania greece romania and yugoslavia 
neither the protocol nor the two ministers in news statements 
mentioned bulgarias turkish minority whose existence has so far 
not been acknowledged by bulgarian officials in public 
the protocol we have just signed does not solve the problems 
but i am convinced that it will serve as a sound basis for seeking 
positive solutions to the existing problems mladenov was quoted 
as saying 
tanjug quoted yilmaz as saying the protocol makes it possible 
for us to develop and settle a number of issues of our bilateral 
relations 
the protocol as reported by tanjug provides for a joint 
working group with a view to finding a solution to the existing 
problems in bilateral relations the area of humanitarian 
cooperation included 
it said another highlevel working group shall be established 
to determine specific measures to speed up cooperation in the 
field of economics trade tourism technology transport 
communications and culture 
under the protocol the two countries foreign ministers are to 
make periodic visits to the other country and review the 
activities of the two working groups with regular political 
consultations between the two foreign ministries 
a similar protocol between the two countries was signed in 1975

spanish officials and leaders of the basque 
separatist organization eta established preliminary contacts in 
algeria tuesday that could lead to a ceasefire spains national 
efe news agency reported 
it said the resumption of talks between the government and eta 
leaders living in exile in algeria might bring an end to 20 years 
of violence that has convulsed the three basque provinces in 
northern spain and spilled over into the rest of the country 
last friday government spokesman javier solana told reporters 
socialist prime minister felipe gonzalez was willing to resume the 
talks broken off after a dec 11 car bombing at a civil guard 
barracks in zaragoza that killed 11 people 
he said the eta appeared to be respecting a 60day truce it 
offered jan 28 in return for a resumption of the talks 
efe citing unnamed algerian sources said chief negotiators at 
the talks in algeria were eugenio etxebeste an eta leader and 
julen elgorriaga representing the government 
the government made no comment on the efe report solana said 
last week the news media should not expect daily updates on the 
progress of any future talks 
eta is an acronym in the basque language that stands for 
homeland and liberty 
since taking up arms in 1968 the group has claimed 
responsibility for killing more than 600 people in its campaign for 
independence for the basque area most of the victims were police 
and military officers 
gonzalez acknowledged in august that his government had made 
contacts with eta leaders in algeria in an attempt to secure a 
ceasefire as a basis for future talks 
the government has said it is prepared to discuss when where 
and how eta guerrillas will lay down their arms and possible 
pardons for jailed eta members not directly involved in attacks 
according to various reports eta still seeks greater political 
autonomy for the basque region that would include predominantly 
basque parts of neighboring navarre province 
the el pais newspaper said gonzalez was expected to discuss the 
contacts with eta in his annual stateofthenation address to 
parliament wednesday 
but it reported government sources said gonzalez probably would 
warn there could be breakdowns during arduous negotiations and no 
guarantee of success

sen bob dole the gop winner of the south 
dakota primary and minnesota caucuses now has 60 delegates to the 
republican national convention one fewer than vice president 
george bush 
the kansas senator got all 18 of the national convention 
delegates from south dakota by winning 55 percent of the vote dole 
was the only candidate to win more than 20 percent of the vote the 
minimum necessary under state gop rules to win any delegates 
former television evangelist pat robertson came close but with 
99 percent of the precincts reporting he finished at 196 percent 
just shy of the threshold 
the democratic primary in south dakota which missouri rep 
richard gephardt won with 44 percent of the vote was nonbinding 
party leaders in the state say they feel an obligation to honor 
the voters wishes nevertheless the results must first be 
ratified by a statewide caucus on march 12 to have any effect on 
how south dakotas 15 pledged delegates to the democratic national 
convention will be awarded 
if the caucus accepts the results of the primary gephardt would 
gain nine delegates and massachusetts gov michael dukakis would 
win six none of the other democratic candidates on the ballot 
received at least 15 percent of the vote the minimum needed under 
party rules to claim any delegates 
following bush and dole on the republican list so far is rep 
jack kemp of new york with 35 delegates and robertson with eight 
ten are uncommitted those totals include delegates allocated in 
michigan kansas pennsylvania new hampshire guam and south 
dakota 
in all 2277 delegates will attend the gop national convention 
in new orleans next august and 1139 are needed to win the 
nomination 
in minnesota dole won a straw poll taken in the republican 
caucuses but that has no binding effect on how the states 31 gop 
national convention delegates will be allocated among the 
candidates that will not be decided until minnesota republicans 
pick 24 national convention delegates at congressional district 
conventions in midapril and choose the remaining 7 delegates at 
the state convention in midjune 
minnesota democrats will have to sort their way through a 
mountain of paper ballots that will come in from tuesdays precinct 
caucuses before the allocation of their national convention 
delegates can be calculated 
the figures from the tuesday night caucuses represented an 
informal poll of the presidential preferences of the delegates 
elected to attend the county conventions that poll had no binding 
effect and the county convention delegates will be expected to 
follow the results tallied from the separate paper ballots 
state party leaders do not plan to count those ballots before 
march 8 under an agreement worked out with the national party 
which had objected to minnesota democrats holding their caucuses so 
early in the season 
democratic national delegate totals remain unchanged by 
tuesdays events 
dukakis has 445 gephardt has 39 simon has 33 gore has 1055 
jackson has 98 and 2784 are uncommitted those totals include 
delegates allocated in iowa and new hampshire as well as the 
results of an associated press survey of party leaders who 
automatically will hold seats as convention delegates 
in all the democratic national convention next july in atlanta 
will include 4162 delegates and 2082 are needed to win the 
nomination

injected sedatives hastened the death 
of an 83yearold woman whose severed head was frozen in hopes she 
could someday be restored to life with a new body officials said 
wednesday in classifying the case as a homicide 
the riverside county coroners office after reviewing the 
results of extensive toxological tests on the tissues of dora 
kents headless body said she was given a lethal dose of a 
barbiturate shortly before her death in early december 
the coroner has classified the death as the result of a 
homicide due to the administration of medicinal drugs which 
assisted kents death supervising deputy coroner dan cupido said 
wednesday 
those involved in the attempt to preserve mrs kents head for 
eventual resurrection denied the coroners office charge saying 
the drug was administered after she died as part of their effort to 
preserve the brain 
the coroners office amended its death certificate tuesday 
referring the case to the riverside county district attorneys 
office where it is now under investigation the original death 
certificate did not state a cause of death pending further tests 
deputy district attorney curt hinman said the tests indicated 
mrs kent was alive when the drugs were administered the sedatives 
pentobarbital and secobarbital were found throughout the womans 
system including her liver kidneys and bone marrow and 
investigators concluded her body had metabolized the drugs he said 
we think they gave it the drug to her before she was dead 
hinman said 
but mrs kents son saul 48 said wednesday the allegations of 
homicide were smear tactics to discredit the alcor life 
extension foundation a cryonics lab here 
kent is a strong supporter of the cryonics movement which 
believes bodies or heads may be stored at subfreezing temperatures 
and then brought back to life through future advances in science 
mrs kent had been living in a riverside nursing home but on 
dec 9 her physician dr steve harris determined that she was 
gravely ill based on that information kent moved her from the 
home to alcor 
kent said his mother was maintained there briefly on a 
respirator before dying dec 11 her head was surgically removed 
soon afterward 
alcor spokesman carlos mondragon said the drug nembutol was 
given to mrs kent after the death her son explained barbiturates 
are given immediately after death to slow damage to the brain from 
lack of oxygen and another alcor official michael darwin said 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation was also given after death to 
distribute the drugs throughout her system 
kent said the foundation had previously explained those methods 
and the use of drugs in its notes regarding his mothers 
preservation 
now suddenly to come up and say that they think its homicide 
is kind of absurd he said i was there and she died of natural 
causes and then the procedure was started 
but cupido said the drugs expedited dora kents death 
the death certificate amendment states mrs kent died between 
dec 9 and dec 11 cupido said 
mrs kents death has been under investigation since the 
coroners office learned of it she died at alcors lab in 
riverside where a body and six other heads are frozen in liquid 
nitrogen 
no doctor was present when she died which prompted the 
coroners office to investigate her death the location of her head 
has been kept secret by her son and alcor officials despite a 
coroners request to examine it 
a judge earlier this month blocked the coroner from disturbing 
any of the frozen remains at alcor

the kremlin on wednesday installed an armenian as 
the communist party chief of a disputed territory in an apparent 
effort to end ethnic protests in soviet armenia that a dissident 
said involved 200000 people 
soviet authorities also ordered an end to the unrest 
protesters in yerevan the armenian capital want the 
nagornokarabakh region in neighboring azerbaidzhan turned over to 
armenia smallest of the soviet unions 15 republics 
in another apparent concession moscow radio said armenian party 
leaders would ask the central committee in moscow to discuss 
nagornokarabakh in a meeting on nationality policy no such 
meeting has been scheduled but soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
proposed one last week 
yerevan was the scene tuesday and wednesday of industrial 
strikes school boycotts and public demonstrations said to be the 
largest in the soviet unions 70year history 
in the baltic republic of estonia on wednesday there was a 
rally on an national anniversary day with demonstrators shouting 
get the russians out according to a dissident 
the demonstrations were the latest in a recent burst of ethnic 
conflicts in a huge nation that stretches from europe through asia 
and encompasses more than 100 nationalities under a central 
government dominated by ethnic russians 
paruyr ayrikyan an armenian activist who spent 17 years in 
labor camps and internal exile for national activities said 
200000 people gathered in the central square of yerevan 
he said in a telephone interview that they chanted we want a 
session demanding that a special session of the republics 
legislature decide whether nagornokarabakh should become armenian 
western reporters could not travel to yerevan immediately and 
telephone contact was not always possible 
about 150000 people most of them armenians live in 
nagornokarabakh the disputed autonomous region in the caucasus 
mountains whose 1760 square miles make it smaller than delaware 
annexation would increase armenias area by 14 percent and its 
population about 34 million by 4 percent 
last fall armenian sources said more than 2000 ethnic 
armenians marched in the region just north of turkey to protest 
mistreatment by azeris the dominant ethnic group in azerbaidzhan 
the party central committee has declared nagornokarabakh should 
remain part of azerbaidzhan which caused armenian protests and 
began an argument about whether the party has the right to decide 
such issues 
in a dispatch wednesday night the official news agency tass 
said the regional party organization named a 56yearold armenian 
genrikh pogosyan party leader in nagornokarabakh 
while tass said pogosyan was armenian and born in 
nagornokarabakh it did not give the nationality of his 
predecessor the surname of the former leader boris kevorkov 
indicates he is russian or azeri 
the agency also referred to a passive waitandsee attitude 
of the autonomous regions party and government bodies whose 
leadership had displayed a superficial approach to evaluating the 
situation and the existing sentiments 
tass said party leaders plan to take all necessary steps to 
restore order in yerevan effectively declaring an end to the 
dispute 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov confirmed there 
were mass demonstrations in yerevan he described them as peaceful 
and said he did not know the number of protesters 
arikyan the armenian activist said protesters were angered by 
central committee interference in a territorial question which he 
said the soviet constitution defines as a matter for the 
government not the party 
in a telephone interview from yerevan he said major industries 
were crippled by strikes wednesday and virtually all students at 
colleges and technical institutes boycotted classes 
ethnic tensions have arisen with increasing frequency over the 
past year as soviets embrace gorbachevs call for glasnost or 
more openness about some social problems 
another national demonstration was reported in tallinn the 
capital of estonia wednesday was the 70th anniversary of the 
establishment of an independent estonia which was annexed by the 
soviet union in 1940 
alexander podrabinek a moscowbased dissident said 25003000 
people gathered at a tallinn landmark and shouted independence to 
estonia and get the russians out 
plainclothes agents photographed the demonstrators and militia 
surrounded them bringing in a bus with a loudspeaker that blared 
music and propaganda to drown out the demonstrators no one was 
detained and the demonstrators dispersed after about three hours 
he said 
podrabinek said he received his information from a correspondent 
in tallinn for the underground journal express chronicle which 
podrabinek edits 
earlier tass reported there was an official rally in tallinn to 
protest what they considered us provocation of nationalist 
activists 
street demonstrations occurred last summer in estonia and its 
neighbors latvia and lithuania which were annexed at the same time 
in the central asian republic of kazakhstan at least 3000 
people rioted dec 1718 1986 in the capital alma ata to 
protest appointment of an ethnic rusian to replace a kazakh as the 
republics party leader 
in a tass report tuesday the government acknowledged the unrest 
in armenia and said it was not in the public interest 
gerasimov said the government believes things should remain as 
they are now in terms of which republic governs nagornokarabakh 
he said he had spoken with officials in armenia by telephone but 
had no more information than that contained in media reports 
izvestia the government newspaper recommended more public 
discussion of the dispute it acknowledged a mass meeting of 
protesters in yerevan student boycotts and involvement of national 
party figures in seeking a solution 
wednesdays edition of the communist party newspaper pravda 
carried the tass report but no commentary on the events 
ayrikyan who said he spoke from an apartment 100 yards from the 
protest site said wednesday there are at least 200000 people 
in front of the opera house ive never seen anything like it 
he said two members of the central committee secretariat 
vladimir i dolgikh and anatoly i lukyanov arrived in yerevan on 
tuesday to calm the people in the city 1100 miles south of 
moscow 
dolgikh addressed the protesters tuesday the armenian activist 
said 
on wednesday lukyanov and dolgikh asked the demonstrators to 
send a small delegation to party headquarters in yerevan to discuss 
the dispute ayrikyan said

rep richard gephardt echoed a george wallace refrain on 
wednesday saying there is hardly a dimes worth of difference 
between his chief democratic presidential rivals on economic 
issues republican sen bob dole sought to slice into vice 
president george bushs southern support 
gephardt blistered gov michael dukakis and sen albert gore 
jr while a fourth democrat announced he would not compete in the 
delegaterich round of primaries known as super tuesday on march 8 
illinois sen paul simon reeling after a spate of poor finishes 
insisted he would remain in the race but conceded he lacked the 
money to compete across the south 
among the republicans former television evangelist pat 
robertson said his christian broadcasting network once knew the 
whereabouts of the american hostages in lebanon and suggested they 
could have been rescued 
the assertion drew a tart response from the white house where 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said why didnt he tell us where they 
were 
it was the second startling comment in as many days from 
robertson he suggested on tuesday that bushs campaign aides were 
behind the recent public disclosure of television evangelist jimmy 
swaggerts sexual misconduct and said they timed the disclosure to 
make life difficult for another television evangelist running for 
president 
bush denied that charge anew saying id like to see an 
apology or proof 
the vice president shrugged off doles solid victories tuesday 
night in the south dakota primary and minnesota caucuses saying 
you cant win them all he made a flying tour through new 
england where he hopes to win the maine caucuses over the weekend 
and the vermont primary next tuesday 
but those events one in a state where the vice president owns 
a home and the other that has no bearing on the hunt for convention 
delegates drew little attention from the rest of the field 
instead other eyes turned to dixie which is hosting most of 
the 20 democratic and 17 republican contests that will be held on a 
single day on march 8 
dole campaigned in south carolina with sen strom thurmond at 
his side and said he supports legislation on textile imports that 
is popular in the state 
i recognize that ive got to catch up he said but we 
believe there is some momentum after his twin wins in south 
dakota and minnesota 
even so a fresh poll showed just how far dole has to go 
the denver post survey of southern voters showed bush favored by 
54 percent of republicans most likely to vote on march 8 with dole 
favored by 33 percent and the dole forces said their prospects 
were particularly bleak in texas which offers the biggest single 
cache of super tuesday delegates 
dukakis was a narrower favorite in the democratic survey at 26 
percent with gore at 18 percent jesse jackson at 16 percent and 
gephardt at 12 percent the poll was conducted feb 1921 among 759 
registered voters in 13 southern states 
but if gephardts speech in waco texas was any indication the 
fight for the regions hundreds of delegates will be intense 
he said gore and dukakis seem committed to nothing more than 
redecorating the facade of the status quo he charged that the 
approach both men have taken to the federal deficit problem 
invites a postelection round of income tax increases and federal 
cuts in medicare and social security 
on the central economic issues of this campaign there is 
hardly a dimes worth of difference between gov dukakis and sen 
gore said gephardt 
he also ridiculed dukakiss foreign policy experience saying it 
consists almost entirely of negotiating with the governor of new 
hampshire over the issue of nuclear power 
the dimes worth of difference phrase was a reminder of 
former alabama gov wallaces third party campaign theme of 1968 
when he used it to sneer at the major party nominees 
dukakis initial response was made by campaign aide leslie dach 
we welcome a comparison of the candidates records but first 
we need to know which of dick gephardts records hes talking 
about he said 
mike dukakis is the only candidate in this race whos balanced 
budgets put people back to work and lowered taxes five times in 
five years 
there was no immediate response from gore who ridiculed dukakis 
and gephardt as two peas in a pod i dont see either one of 
them to stand out as a principal challenger gore has based his 
candidacy on making a strong showing in his native south 
simon announced his scaledback campaign at a news conference in 
washington saying theres no sense in fooling myself about 
his chances for success in the south 
simon said he would concentrate on the primary in his home state 
of illinois on march 15 and the states that follow but without 
prospects for delegates from the super tuesday states his chance 
of winning the nomination appeared nonexistent 
republican alsoran jack kemp vowed he would stay the course 
despite two more disappointing finishes in minnesota and south 
dakota 
kemps campaign has been victimized by robertsons emergence as 
a strong contender in the early caucus states i needed to break 
up the idea that this is a bushdole race he said this is no 
longer a bushdole race

heavy rain on wednesday slowed the search 
for a kidnapped us marine and forced a top un official to 
postpone a helicopter flight to beirut to press for his release 
the rain flooded citrus groves in south lebanon where amal the 
largest shiite moslem militia faction and united nations 
peacekeepers have searched since lt col william r higgins was 
abducted feb17 near tyre 50 miles south of beirut 
an amal spokesman confirmed a report the militia captured gunmen 
involved in the kidnapping of higgins a onetime aide to former 
us defense secretary caspar weinberger and leader of a un 
observers group in lebanon 
defense secretary frank c carlucci weinbergers successor 
said wednesday in washington that too much was being made of 
higgins role with the defense secretarys office 
carlucci responding to a question said let me point out 
that lt col higgins was a lowerranking officer in the office of 
the secretary of defense which has about 38 people in it my 
principal military aide is a major general 
lt col higgins functions were mainly administrative i 
think overly much is being made of this in the press and if i may 
say id prefer to limit by comments to that because i think any 
further comment tends to encourage undesirable and unwise press 
speculation 
the amal spokesman said the detainees had not been able to 
provide information on the whereabouts of higgins or the 
abductions mastermind who escaped 
the proiranian organization of the oppressed on earth has 
claimed it abducted higgins and alleged he was a cia spy us and 
un officials denied the accusation 
on monday the group released a videotaped message in which the 
captive recited conditions for his release israeli withdrawal 
from south lebanon release of palestinian and lebanese detainees 
held by israel and suspension of us diplomatic activity in the 
middle east 
security sources in tyre said the amal search for higgins 43 
of danville ky was continuing 
the weather has generally been against the search campaign 
said one source speaking on condition of anonymity heavy rains 
and storms hamper the search by amal 
the amal spokesman said the group arrested in the tyre region 
three gunmen who seized col higgins and forced him into the 
first getaway car and three men who had monitored higgins 
movements before the abduction 
amal also captured the man who was supposed to transport 
higgins to beirut he said 
the seven detainees are among 42 members of the fundamentalist 
hezbollah or party of god arrested by amal in the past week 
hezbollah which is backed by iran has supported higgins 
abduction calling him a filthy american it claimed amal has 
abducted 150 of its members 
hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for smaller 
factions involved in the kidnapping of 24 other foreigners missing 
in lebanon the kidnapped include eight other americans 
the longestheld foreign hostage is terry anderson 40 of 
lorain ohio anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press was abducted march 16 1985 
hezbollah and amal have been vying for control of south lebanon 
the amal spokesman said the group was coordinating efforts 
with the united nations interim force in lebanon we keep unifil 
informed on all developments 
the amal spokesman said his militia group which is headed by 
justice minister nabih berri and backed by syria supports unifil 
and will not permit such acts to reflect negatively on the 
peacekeeping force 
higgins headed a 76man un team of observers that monitored 
violations of a 1949 lebaneseisraeli armistice agreement along the 
border the observers were attached to the un forces when the 
ninenation 5800man force deployed in south lebanon in 1978 
after an israeli intervention 
the un commander lt gen gustav hagglund of finland told 
reporters tuesday that further kidnappings of un personnel would 
endanger the future of the peacekeeping forces he said swedish 
soldiers have been ordered not to leave their posts or move 
around south lebanon alone 
hagglund met in naqoura on wednesday with un 
undersecretarygeneral marrack goulding a un source said 
goulding had flown to unifil headquarters by helicopter from 
israel hoping to fly on to beirut 
he later returned to israel said the source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
unifils chief spokesman timur goksel said only that mr 
gouldings helicopter flight to beirut has been postponed due to 
bad weather conditions

thirtyfour oil rig workers arrived 
safely on land tuesday after their platform sank into the gulf of 
mexico forcing them to flee in watertight capsules 
the workers on the rig e302 owned by keyes offshore inc of 
sugar land were evacuated monday night from the rig 82 miles 
south of galveston then transferred to a workboat for the trip 
back to galveston said bill keyes president of keyes offshore 
the vessel radioed the us coast guard about 115 am that it 
had picked up the workers said coast guard duty officer don merwin 
about three hours earlier a distress call had been relayed to 
the coast guard from the rig merwin said coast guard rescue ships 
were dispatched from houston corpus christi and sabine 
the accident occurred when one of the 396foot legs of the 
triangular jackup rig punched through the gulf floor keyes said 
it resulted in bending the three legs on the rig he said 
the rig was about five feet above the water because we had not 
jacked up all the way 
workers had been at the site about three hours before the 
accident which happened in seconds he said 
southwesterly winds at 30 knots causing 7 to 10foot waves 
may have contributed to the collapse merwin said 
that kind of wind though shouldnt have been enough to sink 
a rig like that merwin said the rig was capable of drilling 
20000 feet he said 
the coast guard marine safety office would investigate he said 
company spokesman bill flores said the rig appeared to be 
salvageable

the soviet union has bought 350000 metric 
tons of us corn for delivery this year under a longterm 
agreement between the two countries the agriculture department 
said wednesday 
it was the first us corn sale to the soviet union since last 
fall although moscow has been buying huge quantities of wheat at 
subsidized prices under the departments export enhancement program 
eep corn is not eligible for the subsidy 
jean nollmeyer of the departments foreign agricultural service 
said it was the first substantial sale of corn to the soviets since 
last oct 23 when us exporters reported 600000 tons some small 
quantities were sold after that she said 
no selling prices or other information about the corn sale were 
disclosed when subsidies are involved the exporting firms 
quantities and amounts of eep payments are shown but not when 
straight cash deals are involved 
under eep private exporters are given surplus commodities owned 
by the departments commodity credit corp so they can sell a 
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive 
world prices 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 350000 tons of 
corn would be about 138 million bushels 
corn prices recently have been averaging about 182 per bushel 
at the farm level meaning that the sale could have a farm value of 
around 25 million 
the corn is part of the grain the soviet union is committed to 
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement which calls 
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of us grain 
the pact expires sept 30 
according to the agreement the annual purchases are supposed to 
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn the 
soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as 
wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting as two 
tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
with the latest purchases the soviets now have bought a little 
more than 2 million tons of corn or just half of the minimum 
amount specified by the agreement 
by comparison the soviet union has bought more than 63 million 
tons of wheat at subsidized prices plus 800000 tons of soybeans 
and 13 million tons of soybean meal for delivery this year

panamanian president eric arturo delvalle has 
indicated to associates that he may be ready to break his close 
links to military strongman manuel antonio noriega according to 
us officials 
the officials in interviews this week said any such move would 
narrow further noriegas base of support and possibly hasten his 
demise as panamas dominant political force 
the reagan administration looks upon noriega as the principal 
obstacle blocking its goal of an eventual transition to elected 
civilianled rule in panama 
the officials who asked not to be identified said delvalle has 
privately expressed his intention for many weeks to distance 
himself from noriega but they recognize that such a step would 
require considerable courage 
we get information from all sorts of sources including 
friends and relatives that he is about to do something along these 
lines one official said congressional sources also insisting 
on anonymity said they have heard the same reports 
since last summer the administration has been publicly 
encouraging panamas military officers to withdraw from politics as 
a means of promoting a return to rule by civilians in the 
meantime much of the us aid program to panama has been suspended 
and panama has expelled all american aid personnel 
two federal indictments against noriega on drug trafficking 
charge added a new dimension to the already strained relationship 
the indictments handed down in florida earlier this month 
portrayed noriega as a key member of an international 
drugsmuggling conspiracy in congress opposition to noriega spans 
the political spectrum 
delvalle assumed the presidency in 1985 under circumstances that 
strongly suggested noriega had forced his predecessor nicolas 
ardito barletta from office 
it was a constitutional succession but delvalle has been widely 
perceived as no more than panamas titular head 
noriega has maintained that executive authority rests with 
delvalle and that panama has achieved a full transition to 
democracy noriega says his us critics are campaigning against 
him for the purpose of annulling the panama canal treaties under 
which the waterway reverts to panamanian control at the end of 1999 
attempts to obtain comment from the panamanian embassy on 
delvalles purported intentions were unsuccessful 
for the united states the stakes in panama are extraordinarily 
high the administration believes that a democratic politically 
stable panama offers the best assurance for the continued efficient 
operation of the canal 
the us officials noted that challenging noriega would not be 
an easy step for delvalle they said the presidents extensive 
business interests and his family could be threatened if he breaks 
with noriega in addition delvalles health is said to be tenuous 
because of a heart operation 
however the officials said delvalle has become increasingly 
disturbed by his ties to noriega and that some of his friends have 
rebuffed him because of that association 
delvalle also may be tempted to act because of panamas growing 
financial crisis the country is falling apart all around him 
said one source 
lawrence chewning fabrega a panamanian diplomat who resigned

assemblies of god leaders swamped with 
protests that the penalty recommended for television evangelist 
jimmy swaggarts moral lapses was too mild indicated wednesday it 
may be stiffened 
a torrent of complaining telephone calls has poured into the 
denominations headquarters here more than 3000 of them in the 
past two days 
theres a strong sense of moral outrage at the leniency 
applied in this case said the rev howard cummings of aurora 
colo who said he got that assessment from two of the 
denominations top executives 
a special meeting was called for thursday of the churchs 
13member executive presbytery which rules on such matters to 
examine the louisiana state presbyterys recommendation that 
swaggart be suspended from preaching for three months and undergo 
two years rehabilitation 
swaggart known for his harsh denunciations of sexual lapses in 
his worldwide tv preaching was charged with such an offense 
himself although details have not been specified 
photographs showing swaggart with a prostitute reportedly were 
given to church officials by rival evangelist marvin gorman who 
filed a 90 million suit charging swaggart with unjustly accusing 
him of numerous sexual affairs 
an unidentified new orleans prostitute said on abctv tuesday 
night that she had had sex with swaggart while other reports 
described the case as involving pornographic activity 
a suburban new orleans sheriff said wednesday that a tattooed 
prostitute with an arrest record in louisiana florida and 
tennessee is believed to be the woman photographed with swaggart 
last october 
jefferson parish sheriff harry lee told the statetimes that the 
28yearold woman was rumored to be in florida on thursday he said 
he has a warrant for her arrest for failure to show up for a dec 9 
hearing on a soliciting for prostitution charge 
the likelihood that swaggarts penalty may be extended came in 
official word that the issue was expected to be turned back to the 
louisiana district which had proposed the penalty for 
reconsideration 
that is the prescribed procedure under church bylaws for getting 
a punishment revised if it is deemed inadequate 
if the matter is returned to the state district a final 
decision may not come for several weeks said juleen turnage the 
denominations information officer 
church sources also said the louisiana district in announcing 
its decision tuesday had violated a church bylaw that such 
recommendations are not to be disclosed until approved by top 
officials 
it created tremendous pressures appearing that the louisiana 
district was trying to dictate its judgment cummings said 
it was learned that some members of swaggarts board are on the 
louisiana district council and did not abstain from participating 
in the case 
asked whether the 12 million that swaggart contributes annually 
to the denomination might have been a factor in the louisiana 
handling of case ms turnage said it wont affect the decision 
here 
the churchs final verdict when it comes will be in accord 
with the seriousness of the offense ms turnage said 
an unwritten church precedent is that those involved in sexual 
offenses are barred from preaching for at least a year its 
never been less than a year she said 
ms turlage said a high percentage of those calling the 
church about the louisiana districts proposal were not pleased 
a lot of people are unhappy with the initial recommendation 
said the rev richard champion editor of the denominations 
weekly pentecostal evangel but he added many thought it too 
light some thought it too severe 
cummings pastor of 2000member first assemblies of god church 
in aurora and former district presbyter said protests at the 
lightness of the sentence had come from overseas as well as across 
the united states 
pastors and leaders are deeply concerned about the adverse 
effects on young people and church efforts to teach them moral 
principles he said as well as on the image of the church and 
american christianity generally 
most pastors take their marriages seriously he said and to 
give approval to this sentence is to say were soft on sin 
he said some overseas leaders have demanded immediate cutting 
off of swaggarts overseas broadcasts 
the denomination has 2 million members nationally and about 16 
million in autonomous assemblies churches overseas 
nobody is out for blood or after swaggarts hide cummings 
said he said most want the case handled not only with compassion 
and forgiveness but with a sense of accountability for conduct

a communist official who monitors 
religious affairs indirectly attacked thursday a group of roman 
catholics who organized a petition to the government signed by more 
than 300000 believers 
deputy culture minister frantisek jelinek said socalled 
activities we have witnessed in recent days not only do not explain 
accurately church problems but essentially damage their 
solution 
jelinek oversees church affairs in the czech republic 
the 31point petition said by knowledgeable religious activists 
to have garnered 243000 signatures in slovakia and about 100000 
in the czech lands demands separation of church and state more 
religious education and permission for priests and bishops to fill 
vacant positions in 10 dioceses 
it gained support from cardinal frantisek tomasek and was signed 
by far more people than any other document of its kind in 40 years 
of communist rule in czechoslovakia 
authorities were slow to comment on the petition which has 
circulated since late december an article in the communist party 
daily rude pravo last saturday however attacked some points as 
unconstitutional while admitting that some demands such as the 
one for more bishops were natural 
in reporting jelineks remarks the state news agency ctk did 
not quote him as mentioning the petition but the comments appeared 
directed at petition organizers who have been attacked in the 
staterun media 
jelinek was speaking in the moravian capital of brno to leaders 
of the governmentsponsored pacem in terris group a priests 
organization not recognized by the vatican 
in prague an official at the state office for church affairs 
said talks between the communist authorities and the vatican on 
filling vacant sees will not resume for at least one month the two 
sides met last month but did not report progress 
the official spoke on condition of anonymity 
the government favors pacem in terris candidates to fill the 
vacant sees the vatican wants other candidates no new bishops 
have been named in czechoslovakia since 1973 
no official statistics are kept on the number of believers in 
czechoslovakia but church sources estimate the roman catholics 
make up about 60 percent of the 155 million population 
interest in roman catholicism and other religions in 
czechoslovakia has revived in recent years particularly among 
young people 
in an article feb 13 the north bohemian communist party daily 
pruboj attributed this to what it described as the low morals of 
society and suggested the new believers could not be condemned for 
turning to religious faith 
a public show of the strength of religous belief is expected 
march 6 in prague during a mass for the blessed agnes a 
13thcentury czech princess who became abbess of a prague convent 
she is to be made a saint later this year 
czechoslovakia is a federal socialist republic consisting of two 
nations the czech socialist republic and the slovak socialist 
republic

former navy secretary james h webb never 
approached defense secretary frank c carlucci to complain about 
proposed navy budget cuts before webb quit in anger carlucci told 
congress on wednesday 
carlucci said he had heard that webb was unhappy but said webb 
never elected to come and talk to me about it 
webb abruptly resigned monday with a public blast at carlucci 
for rejecting webbs proposals on the navy budget which was 
reduced along with budgets for the other services to meet lowered 
military spending totals approved by congress and president reagan 
webb will be replaced by william l ball iii a veteran capitol 
hill lobbyist for the administration 
carlucci appeared before the house armed services committee to 
defend reagans military budget unveiled last week and carluccis 
decisions about how to reduce defense spending by the 33 billion 
total approved by reagan and congress late last year 
to meet the lowered spending goals carlucci said he ordered 
reductions in ships helicopters and other hardware and chose to 
retain spending for pay raises and training 
carlucci pronounced himself committed to the 600ship navy the 
fleet size set by reagan shortly after he took office in 1981 when 
the navy had about 450 ships 
carlucci ordered 16 aging frigates mothballed which will mean 
that the navy will have 580 ships at the end of the current fiscal 
year but carlucci also pointed out that the navy would be 
authorized to build 17 ships in reagans proposed budget 
as most people whove worked with me know i function with an 
open door said carlucci a veteran of numerous top government 
jobs 
he said webb never came to me with any protest over the budget 
cuts nor was i aware of his intention to resign until the letter 
actually landed on my desk monday 
carlucci was generally praised wednesday by legislators who 
noted that he had a difficult job taking office late last year at 
about the same time the 33 billion cut was ordered because of 
that reduction the proposed pentagon budget for the next fiscal 
year will be 299 billion 
rep william dickinson rala ranking republican on the panel 
referred to webb and noted i dont understand where this fit of 
pique comes fromif anybodys living in fat city its the navy 
the past few years weve worked toward a 600ship navy thats 
fine but theres nothing magic about that 
he criticized webb for what dickinson said was ill grace 
adm william j crowe jr chairman of the joint chiefs of 
stafff also disputed webbs statements that the joint chiefs had 
opposed carluccis plan to mothball the 16 frigates webb said the 
ships should have instead been transferred to the reserves where 
they could later be returned to the active fleet 
crowe said didnt support putting the ships into the reserve 
fleet 
both crowe and carlucci reiterated their warnings that us 
security might be damaged if defense budgets are not increased 
the budget reflects significant force structure reductions 
fewer ships fewer aircraft fewer weapons systems that have 
longterm implications for our national security said carlucci 
he added we must weigh carefully our future decisions on 
defense budgets and programs if we are not to reverse the 
substantial achievements in our military forces realized at great 
cost over the last seven years

a new condom for females pioneered in europe 
will be tested this spring in the united states and its developers 
predicted wednesday it would be a major weapon in the fight against 
aids and other sexually transmitted diseases 
the new disposable contraceptive made of polyurethane 
resembles a condom but is worn by women researchers said wednesday 
as they unveiled the device 
it takes the advantages of both the male condom and the female 
diaphragm and gets rid of significant disadvantages said mary 
ann leeper head of the research team developing the device for 
wisconsin pharmacal co which will market it in the united states 
and canada 
but dr gerald zatuchni a gynecologist with 25 years experience 
in researching and developing new contraceptives said he saw the 
potential for real problems with the device 
i have not seen the device nor have there been any published 
studies that would indicate its acceptability to couples the 
effectiveness of the device in preventing pregnancy or any 
sideeffects from using the device zatuchni said 
the device known in europe as a femshield or vaginal 
shield isnt sold anywhere yet but testing has begun in europe 
and is scheduled to start in the united states in march officials 
said 
the contraceptive consists of a soft loosefitting polyurethane 
sheath and two flexible polyurethane rings ms leeper said 
one of the rings lies inside the sheath and serves as an 
insertion mechanism and internal anchor fitting against the 
womans cervix much like a diaphragm she said the other ring 
forms the outer edge of the sheath and remains outside the vagina 
it is no more difficult to insert than a tampon said dr 
paul salmon who helped organize tests of the device at londons 
middlesex hospital 
the company based in jackson wis said the device would 
provide more protection than the male condom in part because the 
material is stronger than most condoms and covers a larger physical 
area reducing chances of infection or exposure to body fluids 
from a medical perspective this product is likely to offer 
additional protection against sexually transmitted diseases 
salmon said 
it also is more convenient to use than a diaphragm ms leeper 
said because it doesnt have to be initially fitted by a doctor 
and can be inserted up six hours before the sex act or six 
minutes before 
zatuchni a gynecology and obstetrics professor at northwestern 
university medical school in chicago said the idea of a 
onesizefitsall condom for women would be sort of 
ridiculous because womens anatomy varies so much 
it would be hard to envision such a device staying on during 
the act of intercourse he said 
ms leeper said secure and proper fitting actually would occur 
during intercourse 
she said the company had no estimate on how much the device 
would cost consumers 
the female condom was developed by an group of gynecologists 
and obstetricians headed by danish gynecologist dr erik gregersen 
and his wife bente 
the device has been tested so far on 80 couples in the united 
kingdom denmark and sweden and clinical trials are continuing in 
europe ms leeper said 
the world health organization also plans to conduct clinical 
trials in 15 countries including brazil thailand singapore and 
african nations battling the spread of aids 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is believed to be spread 
mainly through sexual intercourse shared hypodermic needles and 
from infected mothers to their infants at or before birth 
researchers wont have statistics on how effective the device is 
in preventing pregnancy or the spread of diseases like aids until 
additional studies are completed salmon said 
the company hopes to apply to the us food and drug 
administration sometime this summer for permission to begin 
marketing the device commercially in the united states 
if everything goes as planned ms leeper said this 
product will be available to the consumer by the end of the year

a house panel voted unanimously wednesday to 
approve legislation requiring additional disclosures for 
increasingly popular home equity loans 
the measure received the full support of the eightmember house 
banking consumer affairs subcommittee chaired by rep frank 
annunzio dill including rep fernand j st germain dri 
chairman of the house banking committee 
similar legislation is expected to be introduced in the senate 
in the near future sen christopher j dodd dconn chairman of 
the senate banking consumer subcommittee held hearings last year 
on the general subject of home equity loans in which a home owner 
borrows money against the equity in his or her home 
according to us housing markets a research survey published 
by lomas amp nettleton the dallas mortgage banking and financial 
services firm the value of new second mortgages and home equity 
loans were to increase to more than 150 billion by the end of 1987 
home equity loans totaled 30 billion in 1981 according to the 
report but topped 50 billion in 1984 the popularity of such 
loans began mushrooming when a new tax law took effect in january 
1987 that limited the deductibility of interest on most consumer 
loans but preserved deductions for home loans 
the house bill introduced by annunzio and rep david price 
dnc would among other things put limits on a creditors 
ability to terminate a home equity credit line and demand full and 
immediate repayment of the balance due 
the measure also prohibits the creditor from unilaterally 
changing the terms of the home equity credit line agreement and 
allows states leeway to provide for additional requirements 
the consumer bankers association a group representing retail 
banks savings and loans and credit unions supported the 
subcommittees action 
two major consumers organizations consumers union and the us 
public interest research group applauded annunzio for moving the 
bill out of the subcommittee but criticized the panel for failing 
to correct major abuses in the hel home equity loan market 
the organizations said panel members promised to work toward 
changing the bill when it is considered by the full banking 
committee 
michelle meier counsel for government affairs with consumers 
union said the present bill doesnt do enough to protect 
consumers it doesnt prohibit some fundamentally unfair contract 
terms it only makes the lenders tell you about them

jesse jacksons campaign manager on wednesday 
heralded his secondplace finish in the minnesota caucuses as a 
rainbow coalition victory and proof that the socalled 
electability issue is dying off 
jackson got 20 percent of the vote in a state with a votingage 
black population of 1 percent proof that his appeal went far 
beyond the his traditionally strong base among blacks said gerald 
austin 
were thrilled about what happened yesterday he said 
observers said there was evidence that jacksons targeting of 
the hardpressed blue collar workers may be paying off although 
there were no exit polls to confirm that 
austin predicted that as voting occurs in more states people 
will stop talking about whether the fact that jackson is black 
means he cant be elected 
i havent heard it in a couple of weeks he said of the 
electability issue 
opinion polls tend to support the notion that jackson has made 
some strides in his effort to reach out out to whites although 
this early in the election season it is not yet clear how much of 
that will translate into votes across the country 
overall i think he has made a slight inroad into the white 
vote i do not think theres any evidence so far that it has been 
substantial said polling associate john brennan of abctvs 
polling operation 
pollster geoffrey garin of peter hart research associates said 
the firms polling has consistently found that were looking at 
very different jesse jackson than in 1984 
the sense of polarization that was there four years ago really 
isnt there this time there are obviously some white voters who 
are not open to jesse jackson but the negatives and the degree of 
antagonism has really worn out over four years 
for whites who are either strongly liberal or sort of feel 
ignored by the establishment there is a real sense of sympathy for 
the things that jacksons been saying 
jackson himself makes a particular point of chiding white voters 
who think along the lines of i like jackson i like what hes 
saying but 
he told a ballroom full of receptive united auto workers members 
this week that those people should move from but to 
therefore 
jackson edged out sen paul simon for second place after the 
illinois senator had banked heavily on a good showing there 
jackson also had targeted the state where he got only 24 
percent of the vote in his 1984 race but had spent only four days 
campaigning there this time around and put only about 45000 into 
the state said austin he credited much of the success to 
organizing by a devoted crew of volunteers 
minnesota political analyst dj leary said jacksons support 
appeared strong among liberal whites and blue collar workers 
jackson has gone after union worker support across the country 
travelling to many strike locations to back them including the 
hormel strike in austin minn 
he was doing very well among working people leary said he 
said he attended a minneapolis caucus where 44 of the 134 
participants supported jackson and only one of those 44 was black 
austin said jackson also got strong support from gays in 
minnesota jackson had drawn a capacity crowd during a campaign 
appearance last week at a minneapolis church led by a lesbian 
pastor 
in the super tuesday primaries on march 8 jackson expects also 
to expand his large base of black supporters into the gay community 
and trade union groups austin said 
nationwide polls show jackson has his work cut out for him 
among white voters a cbsnew york times poll taken last week 
showed jackson was the choice of 3 percent of the white voters and 
13 percent overall 
in a midjanuary poll he did better getting 6 percent among 
the whites polled said cbs news director of surveys kathleen 
frankovic 
however she noted the polls have also shown that he gets a 
clear measure of respect from whites admiration for his 
leadership qualities and a feeling that he cares strongly about 
their problems 
in jacksons adoptive home state a chicago tribune poll in 
midjanuary showed that among 507 democratic voters 39 percent 
picked him as their first or second presidential choice the 
electorate is 26 percent black 
among the whites 35 said they had a impression of him and 37 
percent reported a negative impression

her mother wanted her to come home to 
massachusetts but 17yearold lenora rolle wanted to stretch her 
vacation in new york by just one day it turned out to be her last 
i begged and pleaded with her to come home coralie rolle 
said after learning that her daughter had been shot to death at a 
party in brooklyn i missed her i wanted her back i didnt like 
her being there too long i begged her to be careful 
it was a lack of care or a surfeit of trust that led to miss 
rolles death tuesday morning according to accounts by police 
miss rolle a senior at rindge and latin high school in 
cambridge had used the money she earned as a cashier at 
warburtons pastry shop in harvard square to finance the trip to 
new york where she stayed with aunts in the bronx 
detectives say she was at the port authority bus terminal in 
manhattan on monday night with a 15yearold friend bianca when 
the two were lured away from their bostonbound bus by a peddler of 
exotic fragrances 
the man who may have known bianca urged the girls to come to a 
party at his mothers house in the brownsville section of brooklyn 
and promised to pay their bus fare home 
she was a good girl but she liked to party her mother 
said she also said that lenora was not very streetwise 
the party was in a twobedroom apartment on the second floor of 
a fourstory apartment building police sgt arthur stoecker who 
is investigating the case said at least seven people were at the 
party one of those in attendance told new york newsday that there 
were about 15 stoecker said a few empty crack vials were found in 
the apartment afterward 
after miss rolle arrived police and witnesses say she was 
approached by a man who demanded to have sex with her 
is she for me is this one for me the man asked according 
to a witness quoted by the new york post 
when miss rolle refused the man pulled out a 9mm handheld 
machine gun and fired two shots into the floor authorities said 
he then forced her to undress and as she screamed in protest 
dragged her into a bedroom 
the other partygoers fled in terror they were fearful for 
their own lives stoecker said 
he said the witnesses tried to telephone police but were unable 
to get into an apartment building across the street a street phone 
was out of order they said 
after about a halfhour they saw the gunman still clutching 
his pistol leave the building when they entered they found miss 
rolle dead 
an autopsy wednesday determined that she had been shot in the 
back the right thigh and the left arm according to a spokeswoman 
for the city medical examiners office ellen borakove fluid 
samples were sent to a lab to determine if miss rolle had been 
raped 
stoecker said police were searching wednesday for michael mays 
20 a convicted felon hes a suspect stoecker said although 
he added that there hasnt been an official warrant yet 
mays served about two weeks in rikers island in 1986 on a 
misdemeanor sexual misconduct conviction according to a 
spokeswoman for the city correction department ruby ryles last 
june he was sentenced to three to nine years in state prison after 
pleading guilty to attempted robbery according to glenn goldberg 
a spokesman for the brooklyn district attorneys office 
criminal court records indicate the sentencing was imposed in 
absentia in any case mays never served the time a spokesman for 
the state correctional services department james flateau said the 
prison system had no record of mays goldberg said the prosecutors 
records end with mays sentencing ms ryles said mays never served 
time in city jail on the attempted robbery charge

richard gephardt opened fire wednesday on 
michael dukakis and albert gore rivals in the race for the 
democratic presidential nomination saying their vague positions 
invite a round of income tax increases and cuts in medicare and 
social security after the election 
echoing the rhetoric of former alabama gov george wallace in 
past presidential campaigns gephardt called dukakis and gore the 
favorites of editorialists and elites with hardly a dimes 
worth of difference between them on economic issues 
with the crucial super tuesday primaries and caucuses less than 
two weeks away gephardt a missouri congressman leveled his 
charges at dukakis governor of massachusetts and gore a senator 
from tennessee who are the two he must beat march 8 to become the 
democratic frontrunner gephardt generally trails both in the 
polls in the super tuesday states 
on foreign policy gephardt said dukakis experience consists 
almost entirely of negotiating with the governor of new hampshire 
over the issue of nuclear power 
on the economy gephardt said gore has talked more about what 
is wrong with the iowa caucus than what is wrong with the national 
economy 
he accused gore of having no budget solution at all and 
dukakis of being off the mark by as much as 95 billion with his 
claim of the return on more aggressive pursuit of tax cheats 
on the central economic issues of this campaign there is 
hardly a dimes worth of difference between governor dukakis and 
senator gore gephardt said in a speech the goredukakis 
approach is to distract the voters from those fundamental questions 
to divert the campaign to tactics or drown it in generalities 
the goredukakis approach is worse than an evasion it invites 
a postelection round of income tax increases and federal cuts in 
medicare and social security which is the standard prescription 
of too many editorialists and elites gephardt said 
i am not their candidate i have not been a favorite of the 
establishment editorialists michael dukakis is i have not been 
endorsed by the neoliberals of the new republic they have 
endorsed albert gore 
on farm policy trade and the idea of an oil import fee 
gephardt contended governor dukakis talks competence senator 
gore talks strength but there is nothing competent or strong 
about their policies 
dukakis and gore were on the road campaigning wednesday and did 
not have an immediate response to gephardts blast 
but dukakis aide leslie dach said we welcome a comparison of 
the candidates records but first we need to know which of dick 
gephardts records hes talking about 
dach said that mike dukakis is the only candidate in this race 
who has balanced budgets put people back to work and lowered taxes 
five times in five years 
gore has ridiculed dukakis and gephardt as two peas in a pod 
i dont see either one of them to stand out as a principal 
challenger 
gephardt has been hitting dukakis with ads accusing him of 
raising taxes in massachusetts and of making ridiculous suggestions 
to farmers that they should diversify with crops such as 
blueberries and belgian endive 
gephardt and dukakis have split early democratic tests while 
gore has focused on super tuesday when 20 states and american samoa 
hold primaries and caucuses many of them in the south 
polls across the south generally put gephardt third or fourth in 
the field jesse jackson has usually been the leader in the 
southern surveys but a new gallup poll conducted last week gave 
dukakis the lead 
dukakis and gore have big campaign warchests for march 8 while 
gephardts campaign has been on a slimmer budget 
in austin texas gephardt who won tuesdays south dakota 
primary said he doesnt think gore will have much impact on the 
march 8 elections 
albert gore has not run and won anything in any of these races 
so far gephardt said he pulled out of iowa he ran hard in 
new hampshire and got not many votes he was very active in south 
dakota probably spent more than i did and did not get many votes 
i dont see this as a gephardtgore race i think its a 
gephardtdukakis race

west bank villagers burned the home of a fellow 
arab accused of helping the israelis and lynched him after he fired 
on a crowd wednesday with a submachine gun killing a 4yearold 
boy and wounding 13 people security sources said 
israel radio called the event a serious escalation of 11 
weeks of violence in the occupied west bank and gaza strip and 
linked it to calls by the palestine liberation organization for 
harsh action against collaborators 
a reporter for the arabiclanguage jerusalem newspaper al quds 
said residents of qabatiya village accused the man of collaborating 
with israeli authorities the reporter who spoke on condition of 
anonymity identified the man as mohammed al ayad 
palestinians began a general strike in the occupied territories 
wednesday and the army reported the first attack on israeli 
soldiers with explosives and firearms since riots began dec 8 
the army said a bomb exploded on a road near gaza as a military 
vehicle passed at about 11 pm tuesday and shots were fired at the 
soldiers but no one was injured 
secretary of state george p shultz arrives in jerusalem on 
thursday to discuss a new us plan for ending the unrest and 
reviving negotiations for middle east peace 
israel radio said hundreds of residents marched to the suspected 
collaborators house in qabatiya near jenin 60 miles north of 
jerusalem and destroyed it with firebombs 
security sources said the man killed the boy and wounded the 
others when he fired from the house at the attackers 
the national itim news agency said ayad fired an uzi submachine 
gun and that after the shooting people dragged him away and hanged 
him security sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed the report saying the man was strung up on a utility 
pole 
the arabrun palestine press service identified the slain boy as 
mohammed qassem abu zeid kmeil 
an army spokesman called it a fight among arabs and said 
soldiers arrived later 
at least 63 arabs have been killed by israelis since the 
violence began according to un figures about 15 million 
palestinians live in the west bank and gaza which israel captured 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
three arabs were shot and wounded wednesday during disturbances 
at the nuserat refugee camp in the gaza strip including a 
9yearold girl hospital officials said several other 
confrontations were reported between soldiers and young arabs 
throwing stones and burning tires in the streets 
jerusalems police force has been strengthened for the shultz 
visit by 1500 officers to at least twice its normal size 
the military also provided extra manpower at the request of 
jerusalem police an army spokesman said 
no details were available on the attack on the military vehicle 
palestinian protesters have avoided using firearms in what they 
call the uprising against israel confining themselves to 
throwing stones bottles and occasionally firebombs several knife 
attacks have been reported 
plo chief yasser arafat has said arms would not be used at this 
stage but did not rule out using guns and explosives later 
escalation of the violence could prompt an even harsher military 
response and might cost the arabs much of the sympathy they have 
won abroad 
in jerusalem police said about 20 arabs were arrested in recent 
days on suspicion of taking part in disturbances all palestinians 
leaving silwan an arab village inside the jerusalem city limits 
were checked and searched wednesday 
a senior police officer at the scene said we are throwing the 
book at them traffic violations drug trafficking not paying 
taxes the people in silwan for the last two months thought they 
belonged to palestine we are now teaching them they live in 
israel and they will never forget it 
amnesty international the human rights organization based in 
london urged israel to conduct a thorough investigation of human 
rights violations 
sometimes soldiers have found themselves in the immediate 
context where some force was necessary or maybe even gunfire was 
necessary but in our view the step toward firing a combat rifle at 
people who are not themselves armed with firearms is a very big 
step to make clayton yeo head of research for amnesty said on 
israel radio 
the general strike called for wednesday and thursday by the 
underground united national leadership of the uprising 
appeared to be almost total 
few people were on the streets in the gaza strip in the west 
bank business was at a standstill 
shultz is likely to meet resistance in jerusalem particularly 
from prime minister yitzhak shamir whose rightwing likud bloc 
opposes the secretarys idea of trading land for peace 
it also appeared shultz will not be able to meet with 
palestinians during his mideast shuttle between jerusalem and arab 
capitals those invited say they will not confer with him because 
the plo has forbidden such a meeting in jerusalem 
a meeting with palestinians is considered critical to the peace 
effort

uclas lambda delta lambda is believed to be 
the nations first sorority founded by lesbians but the groups 
nine charter members say they started out to make friends not 
history 
when you meet someone from a sorority its almost like a 
builtin friendship marci kaye one of the groups founders 
said wednesday we just wanted something like that that we could 
have kind of a way for people to meet other people 
officials of the sprawling university of california los 
angeles campus in westwood formally recognized lambda delta lambda 
as a campus organization last week 
it was very validating for us said sorority president 
allison adler a junior creative writing major 
university regulations forbid exclusion of heterosexuals who may 
want to join and krisi burk the groups spokeswoman said lambda 
delta lambda hopes to sign up some heterosexual women during 
sorority rush week next month 
if theyre comfortable with us then were comfortable with 
them said the 20yearold junior political science major 
she said several heterosexual women have inquired about joining 
and the group hopes to at least double its membership next month 
i hope people dont think our nondiscriminatory policy is a 
paper policy because its not she said i have a lot of 
straight friends and id like to see them all join 
several lambda delta lambda members said they considered 
pledging traditional greek sororities before forming their own 
they said they were frightened away by stories of lesbian members 
who had been ostracized after their sexual preferences became known 
maybe im just paranoid but i dont always feel comfortable 
about traditional sororities ms burk said 
now that shes a member of her own group she spoke excitedly as 
she outlined some of lambda delta lambdas plans for the weeks 
ahead including participation in rush week the spring mardi gras 
carnival homecoming and other campus activities 
also high on the agenda will be raising the money to rent a 
sorority house the group now meets on campus 
ms burk said the sorority hopes to get more involved in 
political issues than most traditional greek letter organizations 
including efforts on behalf of women gays and minorities 
she said the group can also serve as a support network for its 
gay members 
weve all had family problems or at least tense moments she 
said we can help each other 
in her case after the group went public she decided to tell her 
grandparents she was a lesbian because i was afraid someone might 
send them a letter she said they took the news well 
thus far members said reaction to the sorority has been 
generally positive 
yesterday in one of my classes someone approached me and said 
he thought it was very courageous what we were doing said ms 
kaye a 25yearold senior english major 
ms burk noted that one person did complain in a letter to the 
editor of the campus newspaper the daily bruin that if lesbians 
were allowed to share a sorority house it would be the same as 
allowing men and women to share sorority and fraternity houses she 
dismissed the argument with a chuckle 
its not just a sexual thing which of course everybody thinks 
it is she said of the sorority its no more sexual than any 
collection of human beings

the 159nation general assembly will 
convene monday on the dispute between the united states and the 
united nations over the fate of the palestine liberation 
organization mission un officials said 
congress passed an antiterrorism law ordering the plo observer 
mission closed by march 22 despite a 1947 treaty in which the 
united states agreed to let official delegations function in new 
york the un headquarters 
the legislation is really an assault on the independence of 
the united nations and on its integrity said former us 
attorney general ramsey clark who has been providing legal advice 
to the plo 
state department and un officials also said closing the 
mission would violate the treaty under which the united states 
became un headquarters 
but attorney general edwin meese iii has reportedly said he 
intends to enforce the measure 
what plan of action the general assembly might advance at the 
special session is not clear it has already passed a resolution 
calling on the united states to leave the mission alone 
the plo and the 21nation arab league say the assembly may ask 
the international court of justice in holland for a ruling the plo 
and the league have also said they may ask the assembly to move 
from new york to geneva if the united states closes the mission 
clark said binding arbitration as called for in the treaty is 
the best way to resolve the dipute he said the plo would bring 
suit in a us court only as a last resort 
the plo was given official observer status 13 years ago its 
mission is a manhattan townhouse with a staff of three political 
officers and two secretaries

a federal judge on wednesday gave the 
environmental protection agency until april 15 to ban the sale and 
commercial use of products containing an antitermite pesticide 
believed to cause cancer 
us district judge louis oberdorfer ruled that the epa had 
acted illegally by allowing 197 holders of federal pesticide 
licenses to sell existing stocks of products containing the 
pesticides chlordane and heptachlor 
oberdorfer said epa failed to take into account whether 
continued sale or use of the products would pose any unreasonable 
risk to man or the environment 
epa scientists have concluded that chlordane causes cancer and 
excessive residues remain in homes even after proper application of 
the chemical which is usually injected into soil around the 
foundations of houses 
last year velsicol chemical corp the nations only 
manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor agreed to stop selling 
the chemical while it tries to find an acceptable method of 
applying the pesticide 
but the epas agreement with velsicol did not cover products 
containing chlordane made by other companies for the retail market 
epa separately agreed to allow 197 companies that hold federal 
pesticide licenses to sell existing stocks of their chlordane 
products if they surrendered their licenses 
the agency estimates these companies have 1700 pounds of 
chlordane products in their stocks compared with the 110000 pounds 
in velsicols inventory 
the judge found that epas decision to permit continued sale of 
the products is arbitrary capricious and an abuse of 
discretion and violates the federal insecticide fungicide and 
rodenticide act 
epa spokesman albert heier said the judges decision has 
really tied our hands on this one because it will actually result 
in the product returning to the market 
if we go ahead and ban these products they can appeal the 
ban heier said under the law the registrants can appeal and 
while its under appeal they can manufacture and sell the 
chemicals 
that s the reason we went on the voluntary route heier 
said it will take two years to get rid of them we thought we 
could get rid of them faster this way 
jay feldman a spokesman for the national coalition against the 
misuse of pesticides one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against 
the epa said the agency can always use its emergency powers to 
suspend use of chlordane 
they have assumed they have no authority to use their 
emergency powers and that is certainly incorrect feldman said 
they have simply misused their discretionary authority in this 
case and refused to consider emergency suspsnsion feldman said 
if epa believes that application of the regulatory standards 
in fifra results in extended product life and the only way to 
protect public health and the environment is to circumvent fiftra 
they should be seeking statutory changes feldman said 
besides the coalition the lawsuit was brought by 10 other 
environmental groups and two labor unions

doctors who believe any humanitarian aid to 
nicaraguans must help both sides in the conflict said wednesday 
they are seeking 20 million to set up an american hospital in the 
wartorn country 
they want the money from congress which is voting on a 
democratsponsored aid package thursday but say theyll try to 
raise it elsewhere if necessary the hospital proposal has been 
sent to congressional leaders but is not included in the democrats 
plan 
dr william burman of the newly formed pan american trauma 
association said he and swiss dr hansjurg holdener would be 
willing to work for one year in nicaragua to set up the facility 
which they said should include three airplanes 10 ambulances and a 
150bed hospital to treat sandinista contra and civilian victims 
burman described the proposal as an unprecedented offer by 
american doctors to help the united states provide humanitarian aid 
to central america he provided a list a dozen doctors supporting 
the project and said us doctors would work in nicaragua for a 
salary of no more than 20000 a year 
there is no way to consider food and clothing for an army 
engaged in a war as humanitarian said chris orsinger of the 
council on hemispheric affairs which sponsored a news conference 
with the doctors and endorsed their project the council describes 
itself as a nonpartisan supporter of democratic political processes 
in the western hemisphere 
burman said he resigned as an assistant professor of orthopedic 
surgery at the state university of new york to work fulltime on 
the nicaraguan proposal he and holdener said they met last 
november with medical officials in nicaragua and toured the area 
where the hospital would be set up 
burman said east germany cuba and czechoslovakia all have 
hospitals in nicaragua which he said are apparently open to all 
victims of the conflict 
he said the us hospital proposal was intended to put the 
united states best foot forward in the region and express the 
highest ideals of medical ethics 
wilson morris an aide to house speaker jim wright dtexas 
said congressional leaders had seen the doctors proposal but 
funding for it it was not included in the democrats 305 million 
contra aid measure which wright said he is confident will pass the 
house narrowly defeated president reagans proposal for 362 
million in military and other aid to the contras three weeks ago 
the democrats propose to give 146 million for food clothing 
medicine and shelter for the rebels and about the same amount for 
medical aid to nicaraguan children who are victims of the conflict 
an additional 14 million would go for aid to miskito indians who 
ended their resistance to the sandinista government earlier this 
month

the quintessential chanteusse liliane 
montevecchi has brought the songs the movements and all the 
atmosphere of the cosiest french cabaret to the offbroadway 
kaufman theater 
the petite singer with gamin face and haircut wins the 
audience before she sings a note she wears a longsleeve 
highneck black minidress which almost covers her black leotard 
revealing slim shapely legs in black hose and spike heels 
when she sings her voice proves even more winning and her 
jolie unflappable air delights 
draping herself across the top of joel silbermans upright piano 
to sing what she calls new frangles tango she says this 
song i have not done it yet once perfectly she flubs the first 
line everybody laughs and she starts over 
miss montevecchis show on the boulevard which opened 
monday night wisely varies its mood she dips into bittersweet 
regret a mood which fits a french singer so well but only does 
it a couple of times and she throws herself entirely into songs 
but again not too often fervently raising temperature and volume 
she has a light touch with humor and exquisite timing 
introducing cole porters you dont know paree her voice is as 
beautifully inflected as any dramatic actress conveying emotion as 
she says i have friends there some are still there and some are 
gone 
miss montevecchis frenchaccented english singing has been 
heard here before in nine on broadway here she often moves 
directly from one song to the next so the audience doesnt break 
its french enchantement with applause 
lighting by jeffrey schissler is subtle and effective martin r 
kaufman who owns the tiny theater with seats on two sides of the 
stage is the presenter in association with jeanclaude baker

britain and japan have been asked to 
participate in a program that would allow their subjects to visit 
the united states for up to 90 days without a visa a state 
department spokeswoman said wednesday 
a 1986 immigration law authorized the state department and 
immigration and naturalization service to approach up to eight 
countries to see if they were interested in participating in a 
pilot project to determine if visa requirements could be waived in 
some cases 
britain announced earlier this week that it is interested in 
taking part in the program and us spokeswoman ruth van heuven 
confirmed that japan also has been asked to participate 
current rules require all visitors except canadians bahamians 
and some mexicans to obtain a visa to come to the united states 
the normal process is for us embassies to rule on visa 
applications and check the names against lists of people barred 
from entry 
visitors from some nations are required to prove they have the 
means and the intention to go home again 
the pilot program would allow tourists and business people from 
the two countries to come to the united states for 90 days or less 
without going through that process 
among those for whom visas are required britons and japanese 
top the list of visitors to the united states last year the state 
department issued nearly 12 million visas to citizens of japan and 
496000 visas to britons 
those two countries also are high up on the list of countries 
where visa applications are rarely rejected 
van heuven said the program would not go into effect until the 
immigration and naturalization service completes the installation 
of an automated arrival and departure system that would permit 
authorities to monitor people coming and going from the united 
states a completion date for the system has not been announced 
under the 1986 law the program would permit entry by people 
with roundtrip nontransferable tickets valid for a year or less 
and not refundable in the united states 
carriers also would be required to certify that they will 
provide return transportation for the visitors 
participating countries also would have to waive visa 
requirements for us visitors britain does not require visas for 
americans but japan does

her mother wanted her to return home to 
massachusetts but 17yearold lenora rolle wanted to stretch her 
vacation in new york by just one day it turned out to be her last 
i begged and pleaded with her to come home coralie rolle 
said after learning that her daughter had been shot to death at a 
party in brooklyn i missed her i wanted her back i didnt like 
her being there too long i begged her to be careful 
miss rolle a high school senior in cambridge mass had used 
the money she earned as a cashier at warburtons pastry shop in 
harvard square to finance the trip to new york where she stayed 
with aunts in the bronx 
detectives say she was at the port authority bus terminal in 
manhattan on monday night with a 15yearold friend identified 
only as bianca when the two were lured away from their 
bostonbound bus by a peddler of exotic fragrances 
the man who may have known bianca urged the girls to go to a 
party at his mothers house in brooklyn and promised to pay their 
bus fare home 
she was a good girl but she liked to party her mother 
said she also said that lenora was not very streetwise 
police sgt arthur stoecker who is investigating the case said 
at least seven people were at the party one of those in attendance 
told new york newsday that there were about 15 stoecker said a few 
empty crack vials were found in the apartment afterward 
after miss rolle arrived police and witnesses say she was 
approached by a man who demanded to have sex with her 
is she for me is this one for me the man asked according 
to a witness quoted by the new york post 
when miss rolle refused the man pulled out a 9mm handheld 
machine gun and fired two shots into the floor authorities said 
he then forced her to undress and as she screamed in protest 
dragged her into a bedroom 
the other partygoers fled in terror they were fearful for 
their own lives stoecker said 
he said the witnesses tried to telephone police but were unable 
to get into an apartment building across the street a street phone 
was out of order they said 
after about a halfhour they saw the gunman still clutching 
his pistol leave the building when they entered they found miss 
rolle dead 
an autopsy wednesday determined that she had been shot in the 
back the right thigh and the left arm according to a spokeswoman 
for the city medical examiners office ellen borakove samples 
were sent to a lab to determine if miss rolle had been raped 
stoecker said police were searching wednesday for a 20yearold 
man with a previous felony conviction but no official warrant had 
been issued 
the man spent two weeks in jail in 1986 on a misdemeanor sexual 
misconduct conviction then was sentenced to three to nine years 
after pleading guilty to attempted robbery officials said 
criminal court records indicate the sentencing was imposed in 
absentia and prison officials said there was no record that he had 
served the time 
at warburtons pastry shop which serves soups and pastries to a 
clientele heavily weighted with harvard students and professors 
manager ed buschard recalled lenora rolle as a very desirable 
employee 
i thought that she was a good worker buschard said she 
came in on days when i was shorthanded if i needed someone to 
work she would work she probably was a very popular girl in 
school because she got along with everybody here at work she 
seemed like a very outgoing girl 
everybodys pretty shaken up its a shock to everybody

overweight people often get that way because their 
bodies burn calories more sparingly than normalsize folks and 
this difference between the fat and the lean can be seen in the 
first months of life two new studies show 
together the studies demonstrate that whether people are chubby 
or svelte may depend as much on how efficiently their bodies use 
energy as it does on what they eat 
in one of the studies researchers found that fat babies all 
of whom had overweight mothers were already expending less energy 
than other infants when they were just 3 months old 
low energy expenditure in infants seems to be making them 
become overweight said dr susan b roberts of massachusetts 
institute of technology who directed the study 
the other report found that some grownups have lower metabolic 
rates or energy expenditure than others they need less food to 
keep going and they gain weight more quickly 
it all boils down to how much you eat and how much you expend 
some people are just unlucky enough that they cant eat too much 
said a coauthor of the adult study dr clifton bogardus of the 
national institutes of health in phoenix ariz 
other studies have shown that fat people often use up relatively 
low amounts of calories when resting but a crucial question 
remained is their metabolism low because they are fat or are they 
fat because their metabolism is low 
by following people over time the new studies conclude that 
people get fat because their bodies are especially fuel efficient 
although overeating also aggravates this problem but when two 
people the same height and sex eat the same amount it appears that 
one may stay trim while the other gets chubby solely because of 
this difference in metabolism 
whats being shown here is that there is some broad pattern of 
vulnerability to weight gain commented dr william i bennett of 
harvard medical school they are starting to get awfully close to 
showing that there is a set of genes that controls obesity 
the two latest studies were published in thursdays issue of the 
new england journal of medicine 
in the infant study doctors studied six babies who were born to 
lean mothers and 12 who were born to overweight women they used a 
newly developed urine test called the doubly labeled water method 
to measure the infants energy expenditure while living at home 
at age 3 months all of the babies were normal sized but by age 
1 six of the fat mothers babies had become overweight total 
energy expenditure at 3 months was 21 percent lower in the infants 
who later became fat 
the researchers theorize that these babies have an inherited 
tendency to be fat their bodies have a high set point or 
weight goal they try to reach this point by taking in more energy 
or using up less 
roberts said she believes that the fat babies ate no more than 
the normal ones so they put on weight to reach their set point by 
being less active 
that would be a logical thing to do in small infants because 
their food intake is largely controlled by their mothers so they 
didnt have the option of going to the fridge and having another 
sandwich she said but in adults who have the option of going 
to the fridge high food intake may also contribute to the 
maintenance of being overweight 
the phoenix study was conducted on pima indians who have a high 
rate of obesity researchers measured their energy expenditure 
while resting and while living for 24 hours in a small room 
they found that those whose 24hour energy expenditure was low 
were four times more likely than those with high metabolisms to 
gain over 17 pounds during the following two years they also found 
that low and high metabolisms tend to run in families 
it means that some people have to eat less than others to 
maintain their weight its like they always said but nobody ever 
believed said bogardus 
he said he hopes the research will help convince doctors that 
everyone who is fat isnt that way just because they are 
gluttonous slobs they have something wrong

communist party leader milos jakes 
pledged to implement reform in czechoslovakia wednesday while at 
the same time denouncing the prague spring reforms crushed by 
warsaw pact forces 20 years ago 
jakes spoke at a celebration marking the 40th anniversary of 
communist rule here on the same day that czechoslovakia and east 
germany announced the imminent removal of soviet nuclear missiles 
czechoslovakia was the last country in eastern europe to turn 
communist setting the seal on kremlin domination of the region 
the 65yearold jakes gave little indication he is about to 
plunge into economic and political reforms now being enacted in the 
soviet union poland hungary and bulgaria 
jakes took over party leadership last december from gustav 
husak now 75 his hourlong speech to about 500 communists in the 
resplendent white and gold spanish hall of pragues hradcany castle 
displayed the same cautious conservatism that characterized husaks 
leadership for 18 years 
he had harsh words for the communists who under the leadership 
of alexander dubcek tried in 1968 to introduce some of the reforms 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev advocates today 
as head of the partys chief disciplinary body from 196877 
jakes was responsible for purging almost half a million people from 
the communist party after sovietled warsaw pact tanks crushed the 
1968 reforms 
on wednesday jakes denied there is any need to reassess the 
official view of 1968 and rejected any comparison between dubceks 
reforms and gorbachevs perestroika or restructuring of communist 
society 
without mentioning dubcek by name jakes said czechoslovaks were 
hopeful and supportive when dubcek was made party leader in january 
1968 but that antisocialist forces frustrated the great 
opportunity that occurred for the solution of important problems 
the healthy forces in the party and society saw this growing 
danger and conducted a difficult and complicated struggle against 
it jakes said 
he said dubcek failed to ally with these forces and a tragic 
development was averted only thanks to the international 
assistance of our friends public reference to the warsaw pact 
invasion has been rare over the past year 
jakes went on to praise husak who presided over the ceremonial 
meeting the first official event to mark the communist takeover in 
february 1948 
the communists got almost 40 percent of the vote in elections in 
1946 but assumed sole power only after a series of political 
maneuvers during street demonstrations from feb2025 1948 
it was no communist coup as its always described by hostile 
propaganda jakes said of the 1948 takeover it was the will of 
the people 
jakes speech set off celebrations that will include a mass 
rally thursday in pragues old town square scene of a triumphant 
speech by then communist party leader klement gottwald on feb 21 
1948 
jakes speech signaled that his leadership is likely to be 
conservative despite official talk of economic reform 
czechoslovakias communists adopted the rhetoric of reform a 
year ago but a muchdelayed blueprint for economic changes will be 
published only later this week and reforms are not to be finally be 
implemented until 1991 
political change is scarcely mentioned jakes made clear it will 
not as in hungary poland and even the soviet union lead to a 
dialogue between communists and unofficial opposition groups 
the broadening of democratization in no case means the 
creation of space for the legalization of political opposition 
which as all experiences to date show cannot be other than 
antisocialist he said 
in announcing the imminent removal of soviet missiles east 
germany and czechoslovakia hailed the move as a goodwill gesture 
before the us congress votes on ratification of the superpower 
arms treaty 
east germany said removal of shorterrange ss12 missiles from 
its territory would begin thursday czechoslovakias communist 
party daily newspaper rude pravo said withdrawal of ss12s deployed 
here would begin in the next few days 
neither country specified how many rockets will be removed nor 
how long the process will take 
the announcements came one day after us secretary of state 
george shultz ended a moscow visit and talks with soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze 
east germany said last week that ss12s there had been 
dismantled and were ready for removal but did not say then when 
withdrawal would begin 
under the arms control agreement signed by the united states and 
the soviet union last december in washington all intermediate and 
shorterrange nuclear weapons in europe will be scrapped within 
three years

st josephs aspirin for children once a 
leader in overthecounter pain relief for youngsters is slowly 
disappearing from medicine cabinets 
the manufacture of the chewable orange tablets ended in december 
1986 as shering plough corp of madison focuses on chewable 
lowdosage aspirin products for adults concerned about preventing 
heart disease 
aspirinfree pain relievers and namebrand aspirin products 
competed with each other until the american academy of pediatrics 
in a report in 1982 said giving aspirin to children suffering from 
chicken pox and influenza increased the risk of contracting reyes 
syndrome 
the illness is fatal in about 20 percent to 30 percent of the 
cases and some survivors suffer permanent brain damage the 
government in 1986 ordered warning labels on all aspirin bottles 
about the risk to children and teenagers of contracting reyes 
syndrome 
the market dropped considerably from 1980 with the reyes 
syndrome business said terry kelly a spokesman for sterling 
drug inc of new york which still manufactures bayers aspirin for 
children 
we feel there are certain patients for whom childrens aspirin 
is appropriate kelly said 
st josephs aspirin for children first marketed in 1949 was 
replaced with aspirinfree tablets called st josephs aspirinfree 
fever reducer 
jim saberton a consultant with kline amp co inc in fairfield 
said wednesday that the childrens aspirin market has become 
relatively small with sales of about 15 million in 1986 compared 
with sales of about 115 million for the nonaspirin pain reliever 
acetominophen that same year 
the risk and work involved in making aspirin is unattractive 
especially since theres acetominophen he said 
st josephs aspirin for children and bayer childrens aspirin 
each had about 5 million in sales in 1986 with the balance of 
sales taken up by generic brands he said 
he also said johnson amp johnsons tylenol products which use 
acetominophen cut heavily into sales of st josephs which once 
held 50 percent of the childrens painreliever market while bayer 
had the other half 
lewis nolan a schering plough spokesman said however that 
his company disputes the link of aspirin to reyes syndrome 
its been our position that theres been no scientific valid 
evidence to link aspirin and reyes syndrome he said 
st josephs low dose adult aspirin was introduced last month 
although the company makes no claim in relation to aspirins 
effectiveness against heart disease the low dose aspirin product 
label advises it not be given to young children he said 
kelly said his company showed higher sales of bayer childrens 
aspirin during 1987 although he could not say if it was due to 
shering plough leaving the market 
i think the first increase you saw was ours last year i 
cannot analyze why that is he said

czechoslovakia and east germany 
said they will start removing shorterrange soviet nuclear missiles 
from their territory thursday 
dmitri t yazov the soviet defense minister said monday while 
secretary of state george p shultz was in moscow that withdrawal 
of the ss12s would begin this month as a display of goodwill 
the weapons must be eliminated under the ussoviet treaty on 
intermediaterange nuclear arms signed in december which has yet 
to be ratified 
dusan rovensky spokesman for the czechoslovak foreign ministry 
said wednesday under an agreement between the czechoslovak and 
soviet governments the withdrawal of soviet army rocket units 
armed with operationaltactical missiles from czechoslovak 
territory will start on feb 25 
ctk the official news agency said the defense ministry 
confirmed the announcement 
a brief announcement by the east german diplomatic mission in 
bonn west germany said withdrawal of the soviet shorterrange 
missiles from the german democratic republic will begin on febrary 
25 thursday 1988 
east germany announced last week that soviet ss12s stationed at 
waren had been dismantled crated and prepared for return to the 
soviet union 
according to figures released after the treaty was signed there 
are 54 ss12s in east germany czechoslovakia has not said how many 
soviet missiles were installed on its territory but western 
analysts put the number at 39 
the intermediaterange treaty requires elimination of nuclear 
weapons with ranges between 300 and 3000 miles 
east germany said missiles would be removed thursday from waren 
and another site at bischofswerda the only location ever given for 
the weapons in czechoslovakia was a military base near hranice 180 
miles southeast of prague 
in 1983 nato began installing usbuilt cruise and pershing 2 
missiles in western europe to counteract soviet ss20s pointed at 
the west the kremlin responded by moving some ss12s from bases in 
the soviet union to east germany and czechoslovakia

foreign ministers from six balkan 
nations meet in belgrade wednesday to discuss ways of ending 
conflicts in the area long troubled by regional disputes 
the threeday session will be the first such conference since 
world war ii 
military ethnic environmental and political disputes mar 
relations among the six 
ministers from nato allies greece and turkey warsaw pact 
members bulgaria and romania and nonaligned yugoslavia and albania 
arrived in belgrade tuesday 
at a meeting in sofia bulgaria on monday prime minister 
andreas papandreou of greece and bulgarian leader todor zhivkov 
said the balkan conference should be a forum for cooperation 
we hope that this meeting will turn into an institution the 
official bulgarian news agency bta quoted papandreou as saying in a 
dinner speech he suggested that such meetings be held every two 
years 
bta quoted zhivkov as saying the conference first should 
discuss the questions that unite us 
we do not underestimate the contradictions and the 
difficulties between the balkan states but they must continue to 
be discussed on a bilateral and multilateral basis 
although the conference is expected to focus largely on 
economic scientific and cultural cooperation festering issues are 
expected to be raised 
bulgaria and greece are likely to raise the possibility of 
establishing a nuclearfree zone in the balkans a proposal opposed 
by turkey 
turkish and greek diplomats however have said they wont raise 
the dispute over cyprus which is divided by forces loyal to each 
nation 
the yugoslav state news agency tanjug has reported that bulgaria 
plans to propose a special balkan conference on environmental 
issues apparently to take romania to task for pollution on the 
bulgarianromanian border area 
one potential problem apparently was resolved tuesday when 
bulgaria and turkey signed a protocol on good neighborly relations 
a turkish diplomat had said earlier his delegation planned to 
raise the issue of bulgarias ethnic turkish minority at the 
conference bulgarias estimated 1 million ethnic turks were forced 
by the government to adopt bulgarian names as part of a 
bulgarization campaign 
the protocol was seen as a clear indication that the two 
neighbors seek to normalize relations after years of discord 
ethnic tensions also strain relations between albania and 
yugoslavia which has a large albanian minority in the southern 
province of kosovo 
there are many problems that we must review concerning both 
bilateral cooperation and cooperation among the balkan countries in 
general in order to create an atmosphere of confidence albanian 
foreign minister reis malile said in a television interview upon 
his arrival in belgrade 
malile is the highestranking albanian to visit yugoslavia in 40 
years albania strongly condemned yugoslavias decision in 1948 to 
break with the soviet loc but 20 years later albania followed suit

the federal government will seek supreme court 
review of a ruling that overturned mandatory drug and alcohol 
testing for railroad workers the justice department said wednesday 
in a 21 decision a federal appeals court in california 
declared on feb 11 that such testing violates the constitutional 
protection against unreasonable search and seizure 
justice department spokeswoman amy brown said the government 
planned to seek high court review within the next several weeks 
brown also said the justice department will notify the court 
that the government no longer opposes supreme court review of 
another drug testing case involving the us customs service 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals in new orleans last year 
supported a drug testing program for customs workers in sensitive 
positions such as those involved in drug interdiction the appeals 
court overturned a us district court decision which had held the 
testing to be unconstitutional 
the justice department originally had opposed supreme court 
review of the customs service case because at that time there were 
no conflicting decisions from other appeals court circuits 
the national treasury employees union which brought the suit 
challenging the customs program went to the supreme court last 
summer seeking review

energy secretary john herrington was asked 
wednesday to halt rail shipments of radioactive waste from the 
three mile island nuclear plant until a new study can be made of 
the route by which they are transported 
sen john danforth rmo ranking minority member of the senate 
commerce science and transportation committee made the request in 
the wake of an incident involving a tmi train in the st louis area 
earlier this month 
herrington took the senators request under consideration a 
danforth aide said 
the federal railroad administration confirmed on wednesday it is 
investigating a rail car switching incident on feb 9 just before a 
tmi train passed through st louis the agency is determining 
whether there were violations of rail regulations which could draw 
civil penalties of up to 10000 
the train was carrying casks of radioactive wastes from the 
damaged tmi plant in pennsylvania to a government laboratory in 
idaho 
bill loftus an fra spokesman said the possible violations 
involve mislabeling of a covered hopper car which was added to the 
tmi train in a railyard in east st louis ill 
the car carried a placard stating that it contained a flammable 
material but later was found not to be carrying the dangerous 
cargo 
loftus said the investigation is looking at possible violations 
by the rail switching yard the union pacific railroad which 
operated the train after it left the yard and a lime company that 
was shipping the car 
federal rail regulations loftus said require shippers to 
properly label goods being moved by rail regulations also prohibit 
switching yards from offering mislabeled cars for addition to a 
train and railroads from transporting any improperly labeled 
freight 
herrington met on wednesday with danforth and several other 
senators from states along the tmi rail route the missourian wants 
the energy department to halt the waste shipments until the 
transportation department can study the rail route used by the 
energy department to move the materials to the laboratory in idaho 
falls idaho 
since the shipments began in 1986 missouri officials have 
complained that the governments route takes the radioactive 
materials through densely populated cities such as st louis

amtrak has begun installing smoke detectors 
in crew cars as a result of a weekend fire that killed an employee 
a spokeswoman said wednesday 
the installation of smoke detectors began monday in the 15 or so 
doubledecker cars that serve as crew sleeping quarters on 
longdistance trips debbie marciniak said in a telephone interview 
from chicago 
the move came after a 70yearold amtrak employee died of smoke 
inhalation from a fire that began early saturday in the crew car of 
a westbound california zephyr nineteen people suffered minor 
injuries 
the fire was discovered as the train pulled into hastings about 
150 miles west of here for a scheduled stop 
some passengers complained that they were not warned about the 
fire and questioned why there were no smoke detectors on the train 
marciniak said the train crews first priority was to rescue 
those in the employee car and evacuate those in a passenger sleeper 
amtrak officials said the passengers were in no danger because 
the burning crew car and the passenger sleeper were detached from 
the coach section of the train 
amtrak spokesman john jacobsen had said commercial smoke 
detectors were too sensitive and that the vibration of the trains 
would set them off he said train fires were rare but that amtrak 
had been looking for a reliable smoke detector 
marciniak said wednesday that the newly installed smoke 
detectors may go off as a result of cigarette smoke or dust but 
that the false alarms would be preferable to not having any alarms 
the railroad also is considering installing smoke detectors in 
passenger sleepers she said 
amtrak has been trying to develop a fire and smoke alarm system 
for several years and during the last six months has asked vendors 
for assistance marciniak said 
four companies appear to have a concept that may work and amtrak 
is working with them she said 
the state fire marshals office has blamed the fire on an 
electrical short in the crew car 
marciniak said amtrak officials believe the fire may have begun 
when boxes of pillows placed next to a heating element in the 
luggage storage compartment of the crew car ignited however 
amtrak officials are continuing to investigate she said 
in the meantime marciniak said amtrak had disconnected all 
heating elements in the luggage storage compartments in similar 
crew cars in addition emergency windows in the dormitory section 
of the cars are being expanded she said

an inmate who had called eight killers to 
the stand as character witnesses was sentenced a second time 
wednesday to die in the electric chair for the rapemurder of his 
13yearold stepniece 
judge gary formet said the convicts statements on behalf of 
31yearold james hitchcock were believable but fall short of 
convincing this court to spare his life 
testifying last week under extraordinary security the eight 
death row inmates from florida state prison had portrayed hitchcock 
as a model prisoner a peacemaker teacher and generous person who 
should be spared execution 
a jury late saturday recommended by a 75 vote that the judge 
impose the death penalty 
formet was free to set aside the recommendation but cited 
hitchcocks confession which he later recanted and agreed with 
the prosecution that the 1976 slaying of cynthia driggers was 
heinous atrocious and cruel

president roh taewoo was sworn into 
office thursday and promised to end decades of harsh authoritarian 
rule and form a peoples government 
it was the first peaceful transfer of power in south koreas 
violent 40year history 
roh said human rights abuses and government repression would not 
be tolerated under the new sixth republic and his administration 
would swiftly carry out democratic and social reforms 
the day when freedoms and human rights could be slighted in 
the name of economic growth and national security has ended the 
day when repressive force and torture in secret chambers were 
tolerated is over the 55yearold roh said in a tough speech 
but roh also warned opposition groups to work with his 
government and end the countrys long tradition of confrontational 
and violent politics he said he would not tolerate disorder 
outgoing president chun doohwan whose authoritarian government 
crushed opposition and imprisoned and beat dissidents listened 
impassively as roh criticized past abuses of power and said south 
korea could accept nothing less than full democracy 
roh was chuns handpicked successor 
there is a strong wind of change blowing over the country 
roh said to applause at the heavily guarded ceremony 
roh said the new government would ensure full democracy along 
with social and economic reforms to aid the poor and other 
disadvantaged groups 
i declare that the new administration will be a government of 
the people it will open an era of democracy in which each citizen 
can reach his full potential he said 
then in a warning to the opposition he said the day when 
confusion was irresponsibly created on the pretext of freedom and 
participation must also come to an end 
thousands of radical students staged demonstrations wednesday to 
protest rohs inauguration and protesters hurling firebombs and 
rocks battled police in seoul and two other cities 
it was massive demonstrations led by students last summer that 
prompted chun to agree to democratic reforms he accepted the 
changes after roh publicly urged him to do so 
but roh a former general is identified with the 
militarybacked governments that ruled the country since 1960 and 
many koreans are doubtful he can achieve widespread democratic 
change 
in washington an international observer team said wednesday 
that rohs election appears credible despite some government abuses 
during nationwide voting last dec 16 the observers cosponsored 
by the washingtonbased international human rights law group said 
it appears that the vast majority of the korean people have 
accepted rohs victory 
thousands of riot police and security agents guarded thursdays 
ceremony attended by 25000 invited guests in the square in front 
of the national assembly building under a hazy late winter sky the 
general public was not admitted and the 120000man national police 
force was on nationwide alert 
army and navy bands played trumpeters blew fanfares and a 
traditional korean folk orchestra in red robes and black horsehair 
hats performed 
detachments of riot police stood guard in side streets as roh 
rode to the inauguration ceremony 
about 150 protesters remained thursday in the compound of the 
roman catholic myongdong cathedral in seoul after battling riot 
police in the surrounding streets during the night 
five students armed with bombs and knives briefly seized a us 
government building in seoul and detonated two bombs wednesday 
before being overpowered by police nobody was hurt or taken 
hostage in the hourlong incident 
main streets of seoul were decorated with the white red and 
blue south korean national flags and thursday was declared a 
national holiday pink and blue arches proclaimed the founding of 
the new republic that comes into being with the adoption of a new 
constitution 
roh told this nation of 41 million people let us here and now 
bury regional antagonism partisan and factional egoism and 
personal resentment roh won the countrys first democratic 
presidential election in 16 years on dec 16 with 366 percent of 
the vote he defeated rival opposition candidates kim youngsam and 
kim daejung who split the opposition vote 
opposition parties contend the government will continue to be 
run by the armed forces and an entrenched elite of government 
officials and business leaders 
many koreans reacted with dismay last week when roh announced a 
new cabinet that included seven holdovers from the chun government 
top security posts went to rightwing hardliners 
other koreans argue roh must be given time to meet his promises 
for major reforms 
roh has emphasized the need for political stability and 
continued economic expansion as well as democratic reforms he has 
stressed that security must be sufficient to ensure the 1988 
olympic games are carried out successfully in september 
chun stepped down at the end of a sevenyear term

president reagan said wednesday the us 
government was constrained from helping black south africans 
fighting the government partly because of divisions among them 
reagan was asked at a news conference whether he had considered 
aiding the african national congress or other groups opposing the 
pretoria government since his administration has aided guerrillas 
fighting oppression in other countries 
no we have not involved ourselves in that other than things 
such as the sanctions and so forth reagan said we have tried 
our best to be persuasive in this very difficult problem 
he was asked what the difference was between south africa and 
other countries where the united states is supporting freedom 
fighters 
the difference is that we dont have an armed insurrection 
going as we have in some other countries and we have a great 
division even among the people who are being oppressed he said 
its a tribal policy more than it is a racial policy and that is 
one of the most difficult parts here 
reagan noted that the state department had contacted the south 
african government earlier wednesday to object to the governments 
banning of antiapartheid organizations 
they should be working toward a multiracial democracy and not 
oppressing political organizations there and weve made our 
feelings clear about that he said 
the state department had said it was appalled by south 
africas decision to ban political activity by the nations largest 
antiapartheid group and 17 other opposition organizations 
by acting to outlaw nonviolent political activity of these 
organizations the south african government has dealt a severe blow 
to efforts to achieve a a peaceful solution to south africas 
problems state department spokesman charles redman said 
he said the affected organizations represent the aspirations of 
a broad cross section of the black community 
we are appalled by the announcement from the south african 
government today that it is effectively outlawing the activities of 
a large number of organizations redman said adding this is a 
giant step backward for south africa 
redman said assistant secretary of state chester crocker had 
summoned south africas ambassador to the state department to 
register shock and distress over the crackdown

foreign ministers of eight latin 
american countries opened a conference wednesday at which they will 
consider calling for the readmission of cuba to the organization of 
american states 
the foreign ministers of peru panama brazil colombia mexico 
uruguay venezuela and argentina are scheduled to meet for three 
days in the colombian port city of cartagena 
also on the agenda are peace efforts in central america british 
naval drills near the falklands the regions 400 billion foreign 
debt and increased policing of drug trafficking said esther lozano 
de rey chief secretary for the colombian foreign ministry 
the ministers make up what is called the group of eight 
organized last year mainly to monitor the situation in central 
america 
mrs lozano de rey told the associated press that a preliminary 
agenda for the group of eight meeting drawn up by assistants to 
the foreign ministers included a proposal to support cubas 
reentry into the oas 
cuba was expelled from the organization in 1962 three years 
after fidel castro came to power 
in a meeting of the eight latin american countries presidents 
last november in acapulco mexico president jose sarney of brazil 
told reporters that the leaders had agreed that the communist 
nation should be readmitted to the oas however such a statement 
was not included in a final document from the meeting 
the us state department has said the united states can not 
support the readmission of cuba to the oas until that country stops 
trying to subvert democratic rule in the hemisphere 
at the cartagena meeting the latin american ministers are 
considering calling for an end to the british naval maneuvers that 
have taken place around the falklands islands in the south atlantic 
since the 1982 war between argentina and britain according to ms 
lozano de rey 
argentina invaded the islands which it calls the malvinas but 
later surrendered to the british 
the ministers planned to discuss a statement urging wealthy 
countries to fight consumption of cocaine and calling on the eight 
latin american countries to work to cut production of the drug 
colombia peru and bolivia are south americas three biggest 
cocaineproducing countries 
panamas foreign minister jorge abadia said wednesday his 
government is not discounting the possibility of us military 
intervention in panama because of the indictment on drug 
trafficking charges of gen manuel antonio noriega head of 
panamas armed forces 
if there is an invasion we wont have the capacity to stop 
it abadia said 
the reagan administration publicly called for noriega to step 
down following his indictment this month by a federal grand jury in 
miami 
abadia said the charges do not constitute an attack on noriega 
but on the panamanian military he claimed the charges are an 
attempt to break the treaty under which the united states has 
promised to turn the panama canal to panama by the year 2000 
when the meeting ends the eight foreign ministers will head for 
hamburg west germany for a series of meetings with central 
american officials on the situation in their region

republican presidential candidate pat 
robertson said wednesday his christian broadcasting network once 
knew the whereabouts of american hostages in lebanon and they 
could have been freed but president reagan said if that were so 
he kept it to himself 
robertsons comments came at an atlanta news conference during 
which he complained that us intelligence in the middle east is 
inadequate and declared that action must be quick when americans 
are taken hostage 
a robertson aide said later that the former television 
evangelist was referring to passengers who had been taken hostage 
by hijackers of a twa flight in the middle east 
we identified in our news department at cbn the location of 
those hostages in lebanon very shortly after they were taken and 
they were in a position where they could have been rescued 
robertson said 
they were in beirut and they could have been freed 
robertson did not provide specifics and did not say which 
hostages were involved 
reagan at a nationally broadcast news conference responded to 
robertsons claim 
itd be very strange if he actually did have information as to 
the location of those hostages said the president isnt it 
strange that no one in our administration was ever apprised of 
that 
if he thought that he knew the president said of robertson 
he kept it to himself 
reagan added that we have tried our best and through every 
kind of channel to establish their the hostages whereabouts 
because thats the beginning of efforts to try and get them free 
its very frustrating to try and establish a location 
reagan said but weve never let up and we never will in trying 
to obtain the freedom of all the hostages 
after reagan spoke robertsons deputy press secretary scott 
hatch said i think what pat said was accurate 
benton miller spokesman for cbn based in virginia beach va 
later issued a synopsis of the news report to which robertson 
referred he said it involved hostages who had been taken from twa 
flight 847 
the synopsis said that in response to a question from robertson 
a cbn middle east correspondent who was not named said the 
hostages are in several locations in and around lebanon and we 
have also learned that maybe at least one of them and we do not 
know which one but we have been told by intelligence sources in 
lebanon that at least one may be being held in tehran 
the suspicion concerning the hostage thought to be held in 
tehran was later reported as incorrect in a subsequent news report 
on robertsons 700 club talk show miller said 
asked whether he had told the reagan administration what he 
knew the former television evangelist said i broadcast it on 
national television they monitor our programs virtually every 
day 
later in an interview on atlanta radio station wgst robertson 
said the information about the hostages was obtained by a 
cbnaffiliated tv station in lebanon my reporters in lebanon had 
information initially on where these hostages were taken he 
said 
robertson said that was several years ago when the first 
hostages were taken 
rival republican candidate jack kemp called robertsons 
statements irresponsible and said he should apologize to the 
families of the hostages whom he has needlessly hurt in an attempt 
to gain publicity 
vice president george bush campaigning in boston was asked 
about robertsons statements my question would be how come he 
didnt get hold of the proper authorities in the united states 
government that were working day and night trying to figure out 
how they could get these people out 
in his news conference robertson said action to rescue hostages 
has to be quick and it has to be a surprise that once the 
situation has hardened six months have gone by eight months a 
year its virtually impossible to get any movement because the 
hostages are dispersed and the captors are more or less dug in 
robertson aide gary lane told the associated press that in 1985 
during the twa flight 847 crisis cbn beirut bureau chief gus 
hashem had information from sources where the hostages were being 
held in west beirut and who was holding them 
lane said the state department contacted cbn for information at 
that time but he said he did not know exactly who made the contact 
a state department terrorism expert said he was puzzled by the 
contention 
the official who commented only on condition of remaining 
anonymous said he was unaware that cbn ever broadcast the precise 
locations of any hostages he also said knowledge of hostages 
whereabouts in terms of a particular city or even a section of a 
city wouldnt be enough to mount a rescue mission 
nine americans are in captivity in lebanon including marine lt 
col william r higgins who was captured last week terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
is the longestheld captive having been kidnapped on march 16 
1985 
robertsons comments on the hostages marked the second time in 
two weeks that his statements on international matters have sparked 
controversy during a republican presidential debate on feb 14 he 
alleged that the soviets have nuclear missiles in cuba pointing to 
the united states the reagan administration denied it 
in yet another controversy bush asked robertson to apologize or 
provide proof to back up his suggestion on tuesday that 
antirobertson political motivations were behind the timing of 
public allegations of sexual misconduct against television 
evangelist jimmy swaggart 
by sundown in the old south id like to see him stand up like 
a southern gentleman with a little evidence bush said id 
like to see an apology or proof

federal agents wednesday arrested 17 people 
most of them in virginia and were looking for seven more in the 
windup of a fouryear sting operation aimed at illegal bear hunting 
nineteen search warrants were executed in 12 states and trophies 
and animal parts were seized at some locations five airplanes were 
seized at anchorage alaska but no arrests were made there 
clark r bavin chief of law enforcement for the fish and 
wildlife service said at a news conference we may have 30 to 35 
people charged eventually 
arrest warrants were obtained for two people in maryland one in 
montana four in north carolina four in west virginia and 11 in 
virginia a total of 22 twelve people in fact were arrested in 
virginia and an additional suspect was being sought but officials 
in washington did not immediately know where 
agents established a kind of hunters brokerage in purcellville 
va about 50 miles from washington that arranged hunts for 
customers bringing guides and hunters together 
bavin said the company abrams creek outfitters spent a year 
establishing its cover through advertisments attendance of 
employees at conventions and visits to guides 
the investigation began with a focus on outofseason and 
airborne hunting of caribou and brown bears in alaska but grew to 
include illegal killing of black bears frequently in and near 
shenandoah national park in virginia and sale of bear parts 
bavin displayed a mounted stuffed bear he said was taken in 
alaska by a twoplane party that landed the hunters at a makeshift 
camp to kill the bear as it was driven toward them by the other 
airplane 
this is totally illegal he said 
appearing with federal officials at the news conference gerald 
simmons chief of law enforcement for the virginia game and inland 
fisheries commission said virginia was delighted to take part 
because it appeared that as many as 200 black bears were killed 
illegally last year out of a population of 2000 to 2500 in legal 
hunting 557 bears were killed in the state 
simmons and bavin displayed about a dozen bear gall bladders 
wrapped in plastic bags that had been seized in one arrest earlier 
in the day these organs are considered valuable medicine in the 
far east and may bring 300 each 
in addition hides brought up to 250 each 
the forestdwelling black bear was found in 49 states 200 years 
ago but practically decimated by the early part of this century 
conservation programs have restored the bear to 30 states and 
hunting is often permitted 
federal law makes it a crime to transport across state lines 
widlife taken in violation of state law that statute says 
violations can bring a year in prison and a 10000 fine unless a 
sale across state lines is involved in which case the term may be 
five years and the fine 20000 under a 1984 law the fine may be 
multiplied to 250000 
a 1971 law makes it a federal crime to shoot or harass wildlife 
from aircraft with penalties specified as a possible yearlong 
prison term and fine of 5000 the 1984 statute makes it possible 
to multiply the fine to 100000

president reagan said wednesday night weve 
never let up and we never will in efforts to free the american 
hostages in lebanon adding that if republican presidential 
candidate pat robertson knew of their whereabouts it was very 
strange that he kept it to himself 
in his first fulldress news conference in four months reagan 
also said he thought outside terrorists had been at work stirring 
up the middle east violence on the west bank that has prompted an 
israeli military crackdown 
the president said he had every confidence in the personal 
integrity of embattled attorney general edwin meese iii but said 
he could not comment on reports of the investigation of meeses 
role in a proposed middle east oil pipeline 
as is his custom reagan opened the nationally televised session 
in the white house east room with a quip on the networks at 
last he said in a wry reference to the refusal by cbs nbc and 
abc to carry his primetime feb 2 speech on the eve of a house 
vote on aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
the news conference blended international affairs with the 
domestic presidential campaign swirling outside the white house 
gates and reagan showed his zest for political combat with a few 
jabs at the field of democratic contenders 
to hear them he said were in an economic slump suffering 
from a variety of ills at the moment none of those things are 
true he said 
so i just think you know the kids will play he said as 
laughter filled the room 
the president also confirmed anew that vice president george 
bush expressed reservations during the irancontra affair but he 
refused to say precisely what bush had told him 
on other topics reagan 
said secretary of state george shultz had given him an 
encouraging report on his justcompleted trip to the soviet 
union during the talks in moscow shultz and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze set a onemonth deadline for arms 
negotiators to complete drafts on key elements of a new treaty to 
curb strategic nuclear weapons 
noted that shultz was embarking on a fresh peaceseeking 
mission to the middle east and said he hoped israelis and arabs 
would rid themselves of old ideas and stances that cannot work 
and begin serious negotiations 
issued a fresh condemnation of the leftist sandinista 
government of nicaragua and said the soviet union had doubled 
military assistance to the nation in the first two months of this 
year over 1987 levels he provided no figures 
said he had not decided whether to tell congress that aid 
should be resumed to panama he has to certify that panama is 
helping in antidrug efforts but gen manuel noriega panamas 
military leader has been indicted on us drugtrafficking charges 
reagan passed up several invitations to criticize israeli action 
against arab protesters on the occipied west bank and gaza strip 
we dont support that sort of thing was as strong a 
statement as the president would make but he added quickly that 
there was evidence that the riots that provoked an israeli military 
crackdown were not spontaneous 
asked to elaborate he said we have had information that 
there have been certain people suspected of being terrorists 
outsiders coming in and stirring up the trouble in those areas 
he ducked a request for more information replying that to say 
more would get into areas that violate security 
the subject of associated press correspondent terry anderson 
nearly three years in captivity and the other american hostages 
in lebanon arose early in the 30minute nationally televised 
questionandanswer session 
weve never let up and we never will in trying to bring 
freedom for all our hostages reagan said 
asked about gop candidate robertsons claim that his christian 
broadcasting network had once known the location of some of the 
hostages and the administration may have missed a chance for a 
rescue the president said 
i can only say this it would be very strange if he did have 
information isnt it strange that no one in our administration 
was apprised of it 
reagan said he didnt want to become involved in the campaign to 
succeed him in the white house but he said if he felt that he 
robertson knew he kept it to himself 
the presidents statement on the contras seemed to be a soft 
appeal for support in congress for fresh aid to the rebels he 
noted with regret that the democraticrun house had rejected his 
call for 362 million in fresh aid to the contra including some 
money for weapons 
house leaders have scheduled a vote for next week on an 
alternative support calling for humanitarian aid 
reagan was unclear on a number of points for example he said 
that soviet membershinnt on tariffs and trade is under review but he 
failed to point out that the united states strenuously opposes 
soviet participation 
he also said that secretary of state george shultz and former 
defense secretary caspar weinberger did not object to the secret 
sale of arms to iran on grounds that it was a trade of arms for 
hostages however the secretaries have said otherwise and the 
irancontra report issued by two congressional committees said 
shultz and weinberger called it a straight armsforhostages deal 
that was contrary to us public policy 
reagan jockeyed a busy round of talks on foreign policy problems 
wednesday with lastminute preparations for the news conference 
the 42nd in his seven years as president but his first since last 
oct 22 
his first appointment wednesday was with shultz who returned 
from moscow on tuesday night after talks on arms control and the 
likelihood of a soviet pullout of military forces from afghanistan 
shultz headed out again wednesday night this time to the middle 
east to try to spark arabisraeli peace talks shultz said in 
advance he had only a slim chance of succeeding and that the two 
sides would have to moderate their extreme positions 
during the talks in moscow shultz and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze set a onemonth deadline for arms negotiators 
to complete drafts on key elements of a new treaty to curb 
strategic nuclear weapons

the roman catholic prelate of guatemala 
offered wednesday to mediate peace talks between the government of 
president vinicio cerezo and leftist guerrillas who have waged a 
sporadic war since 1960 
monsignor prospero penados del barrio told reporters he accepted 
a request to act as mediator from the general command of the 
guatemalan national revolutionary union which is made up of three 
leftist armies 
there was no immediate comment from the presidents office 
the archbishop told at a news conference we would carry out 
our mediation at any place whether it be proposed by the 
guerrillas or by the government since the important thing is to 
end the fratricidal fight that has served to blind useful 
lives 
he said the first round of talks should be held before holy week 
at the end of march 
the talks would be held in accordance with a central american 
peace plan signed last august by the presidents of guatemala 
nicaragua el salvador honduras and costa rica 
asked about the talks defense minister gen hector alejandro 
gramajo morales said the army is very close to achieving a total 
victory over the rebels 
in a very short time he said the subversive activity in 
the country will be ended 
he said the guerrillas number 500 to 700 
last october representatives of the government and the 
guerrillas met for the first time since the rebels took to the 
hills in 1960 after a failed coup attempt their fourday talks 
were held in madrid spain 
the talks foundered over the role of the army how to interpret 
the term ceasefire and rebel concern over whether the 
government can control rightist death squads 
foreign minister alfonso cabrera said then that further peace 
talks would be pointless and called on the rebels to become part 
of the countrys political and productive framework once again 
the request to the archbishop to negotiate new talks was made by 
leaders of the three rebel armies in the revolutionary union 
rolando moran of the guerrilla army of the poor gaspar ilom a

an ira bomb exploded in central 
belfast late wednesday night killing two parttime soldiers of the 
ulster defense regiment and wounding two others and a civilian 
pedestrian police said 
the irish republican army claimed responsibility in a telephoned 
statement to belfast news organizations 
belfast police headquarters said in a statement that the 
explosion occurred at security gates in royal avenue 
the british broadcasting corp said the blast was heard more 
than 12 miles away police estimated the size of the bomb at 150 
pounds the explosion shattered shop and office windows hundreds of 
yards away 
the police statement said the four soldiers were on patrol in a 
land rover it said police believe the bomb was hidden behind an 
advertising billboard fronting a building site 
police earlier said they believed the bomb was thrown by hand 
but later amended this saying they thought the bombers detonated 
it from some distance away using a control wire 
the vehicle was stationary at the time one soldier died almost 
instantly the other died later in belfast city hospital police 
said 
they said a 57yearold pedestrian passing by was slightly hurt 
the army said the two wounded soldiers received only minor injuries 
chief inspector jim boyd of belfast police said the attack 
occurred about 11 pm when few people were around 
the locally recruited ulster defense regiment is part of the 
british army 
wednesdays death brings to at least 2628 northern irelands 
overall toll since sectarian and political violence flared in 1969 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to drive the british from 
northern ireland and unite the predominantly protestant province 
with the overwhelmingly catholic irish republic under socialist 
rule 
earlier wednesday police charged an 18yearold british soldier 
with unlawfully killing an unarmed roman catholic civilian 
a magistrate in cookstown 25 miles west of belfast ordered 
pvt david jonathan holden held in police custody until his 
appearance at a belfast court on march 9 
the defense said holden will plead innocent to the charge of 
unlawfully killing aidan mcanespie 23 he was hit sunday by a 
bullet fired from an army observation post at a checkpoint near 
auchnacloy half a mile from the irish republics border 
the irish government angered britain by launching its own police 
investigation 
angloirish relations have also been strained by britains 
refusal to prosecute police officers involved in shooting to death 
six unarmed catholics in 1982 
british and irish leaders wednesday held their first meeting 
since october under the auspices of the 1985 angloirish agreement 
which gave ireland an advisory role in northern ireland affairs in 
an effort to redress grievances of the catholic minority 
irelands foreign affairs minister brian lenihan met with 
northern ireland secretary tom king the top british official in 
the province after the meeting king said they had arranged for 
their police chiefs to meet next month to discuss security 
cooperation along the border 
but the irish government later denied that the two sides agreed 
on such a meeting 
a joint communique issued after wednesdays talks focused on 
proposed british legislation aimed at guaranteeing a fair division 
of employment between catholics and protestants in northern ireland 
meanwhile police in dublin said they had uncovered a cache of 
weapons including 30 sovietmade kalashnikov semiautomatic 
rifles in a makeshift bunker beaneath a shed at malahide in the 
citys northern outskirts 
police speaking on condition of anonymity said the weapons 
apparently were destined for the ira and may have been part of four 
shipments they believe were smuggled from libya into ireland over 
the last three years 
the cache included a dozen rocket warheads 64 hand grenades 
30000 bullets and 500 pounds of explosives

president reagan said wednesday night the 
administration has information that suspected terrorists from the 
outside have been stirring up trouble in the israelioccupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
reagan made his statement in a nationally televised news 
conference as secretary of state george p shultz headed for the 
middle east with admittedly little chance of setting up 
arabisraeli negotiations 
reporting on shultz mission reagan said in the middle east 
its time for all parties to rid themselves of old ideas and 
stances that cannot work and to begin a serious process of 
negotiation and reconciliation 
he was not specific however and he passed up several 
invitations to criticize israeli action against arab protesters in 
the occupied territories 
we have spoken to the government there and we have also spoken 
to the palestinian leadership because there is every evidence that 
these riots are not just spontaneous and home grown the 
president said 
asked about the israeli actions against palestinian protesters 
reagan said we dont support that sort of thing and we are 
trying to persuade all the participants to try to arrive at a 
solution representing justice for all 
when he was asked to whom he was referring in his statement 
about the riots not being home grown the president responded 
we have had information that there have been certain people 
suspected of being terrorists outsiders coming in not only with 
weapons but stirring up and encouraging the trouble in those 
areas 
now that isnt something you can go out and say we absolutely 
know but certainly the violence is both ways the president said 
he said he could not be more specific because i get into areas 
there that would be violating security rules and i dont think i 
should 
on a related subject reagan was asked about reports out of 
geneva that palestinian liberation organization leader yasser 
arafat might be willing to accept two united nations resolutions 
which he has scorned in the past and which are the cornerstone of 
us policy in the mideast 
well i know that this is one other thing were pursuing 
the president said if he really is and if he is willing to 
acknowledge the right of israel to exist as a nation im sure 
that the secretary of state will be is apprised of that fact and 
will see what we can do there 
reagan said his administration would continue to seek ways to 
alleviate israeliarab conflict 
thats a goal that i think would be one of the greatest 
achievements of this administration if before i leave we could 
bring about a peace in the middle east he said 
before departing for jerusalem shultz added syria to his 
itinerary despite us sanctions against a country the state 
department has condemned as a supporter of terrorism 
when we have an issue to address were going to address it in 
the most effective way we can department spokesman charles e 
redman said he called syria one of the key players in the 
region 
sources in damascus said shultz would visit on saturday redman 
refused to provide a specific itinerary saying only that shultz 
would make stops in israel jordan egypt and syria and that he 
was ready to meet with palestinians 
he will remain in the region until next tuesday when he flies to 
london to see king hussein of jordan who is in the british capital 
for dental work and then to brussels for a summit meeting of the 
north atlantic treaty organization 
shultz is leaving his schedule open for a return to the middle 
east next thursday for a few more days of diplomacy before 
returning to washington on march 6 
shultz rates his chances of setting up negotiations as slim and 
said succcess would depend on the israelis and arabs moderating 
their extree positions 
at a news conference tuesday in brussels he said its just 
possible attitudes have shifted enough 
looking forward to it shultz joshed its going to be 
tough 
the us goal is to find a way for israel and a mixed delegation 
of jordanians and palestinians to hold negotiations to lower 
tensions on the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
temporary selfrule for the 15 million palestinian arabs who 
live under israeli control is the shortterm aim negotiations by 
december that leave open the option of a state linked to jordan is 
the projected second step 
this would mean israels surrendering most of the territory it 
gained from jordan and egypt in the 1967 sixday war israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir and his likud bloc do not accept the state 
departments concept of trading territory for peace while 
hussein refuses to commit himself to negotiations with an uncertain 
outcome 
the palestinians meanwhile are divided about their objectives 
and unable to agree on who would represent them in negotiations 
i dont think many people give me much chance shultz said 
in brussels he said he found intense skepticism even among the 
nato allies 
however he said we do have a few ideas the engagement 
of the united states on an intense basis is welcomed i believe 
that even if the chances are small its worthwhile trying and you 
cant be too afraid of failing 
shultz will have some good news for mubarak a us official 
said wednesday the state department will notify congress it plans 
to go ahead with a 2 billion 10year project to produce m1 tanks 
jointly with egypt 
the official who demanded anonymity said the project would 
involve the first foreign purchase of the topoftheline us 
tanks it will be financed from the 13 billion in grants that 
egypt receives annually from the united states 
shultz returned to washington tuesday night to report to 
president reagan on his two days of talks in moscow he also met 
with visiting portugese prime minister anibal cavaco silva and 
spoke to a meeting of the business council 
ten years ago the united states israel and egypt produced the 
camp david agreements this led in 1979 to a peace treaty between 
israel and egypt and to unsuccessful negotiations over palestinian 
autonomy or limited selfrule 
as shultz weighed a trip to the region this month many arab 
countries led by egypt and jordan informed the united states that 
they firmly rejected another interim negotiation based on camp 
david 
egyptian president hosni mubarak who heads the only arab 
country formally to make peace with israel called the camp david 
formula a thing of the past whose time has ended

a lively pentecostal denomination shattered by 
the successive shaming of its two most dazzling tv evangelists 
this week was in a state of trauma 
some of its leaders were questioning the propriety of television 
preaching itself 
theres a great deal of sadness shock and grief over the 
whole situation said juleen turnage communications officer for 
the assemblies of god based in springfield mo 
were back in the shades of 1987 she added referring to 
when the sexual lapses struck in the case of extv star jim bakker 
and now had hit fiery tv preacher jimmy swaggart 
its a tremendous shock so totally out of character with what 
he preached said the rev robert spence president of the 
denominations evangel college 
its going to have a very very serious effect on those 
ministries that are still on television the element of suspicion 
of it is going to become even more acute 
some think that may be a good idea clinical psychologist larry 
bass a denominational member says there is something corrupting 
about the power of dominating huge crowds 
theres a kind of narcissistic evil that attracts people to 
that kind of work all the selfaggrandizement it gives them tv 
gives it even larger magnitude 
he suggests local congregations should teach people to be more 
critical in viewing tv preachers and particularly to guard against 
these dangerous tendencies 
putting anyone up on a pedestal or believing theyre 
virtually the voice of god 
ministers who put down other religions and people and who are 
extremely judgmental about the faults of others 
he said swaggart seemed to fit these categories almost 
mesmerizing crowds with his sizzling emotional fervor and his 
blistering attacks on other religions and on other peoples sexual 
flaws 
nobody has all the answers and for anyone to act as if they 
do is a big danger sign bass said noting that swaggart 
sometimes said anyone who disagreed with him was wrong bass added 
anyone who sets himself up with that kind of authority that 
hes always absolutely correct is a dangerous thing and hardly to 
be trusted 
however he said its unfortunately true that the typical 
kind of followers swaggart attracts are the most gullible 
religion professor stanley m burgess an assemblies scholar of 
southwestern missouri state university in springfield said the 
fall of such highpowered evangelists as swaggart serves this clear 
warning 
we must be careful not to label as gold everything that 
glitters 
such celebrated preachers still have feet of clay burgess 
said people have to show greater discernment about them 
recognizing that were not dealing with god here but humans who can 
fall 
even in the scandals he said i would hope people will not 
drool over it but learn from it and look for a silver lining 
for one thing he added people who have supported tv 
ministries may now put their support back in local churches and 
synagogues where it has been missing in many cases 
a noted church communications expert the rev william f fore 
maintains that religion when it buys into television is coopted 
by it and becomes a victim to its focus on selfgratification and 
quickfix answers 
it maximizes selfinterest he said in his recent book 
television and religion grossly twisting the biblical emphasis 
on selfless service 
this corruption of the fundamental biblical concept of 
conscience into selfinterest is perhaps the most serious of all 
the electronic churchs distortions 
spence said there is nothing wrong with the medium of 
television itself but that it does involve detachment from the 
local congregation where there is a greater degree of 
accountability 
in television theres not that closeness of a minister 
living among his people spence said 
furthermore he added other aspects of tv raise the 
posibility of distortion such as tvs continual concern of 
what it will look like and how a program will go over with 
a mass theologically uninformed audience 
he said that when someone in that situation has been very 
successful theres a tendency to live in an unreal world filled 
only with people who are saying what they think he wants to hear 
its an artificial environment that distorts the whole 
perspective and can lead to a point of assuming youre stronger 
than you really are that what might bother other people does 
not affect me 
but despite the deflecting aspects he said a person has to 
be of the compromising type to cross over the line in his morals 
something swaggart was definitely not in his words his conduct 
turned out to be something else 
that spence said is part of the tremendous shock 
the rev richard champion editor of the denominations weekly 
pentecostal evangel said church leaders are going through a 
personal trauma here was this brother in christ and suddenly this 
happens and we have to deal with the fallout

people who attempt to determine just what is 
going on in the executive suite are eyeing a vital statistic that 
appears to have changed direction again 
the average age at which chief executive officers are appointed 
to lead top corporations is declining again after a fairly steady 
rise since the mid and late 1960s 
the changing numbers are likely to prompt a spate of 
explanations along with interpretations about the consequences for 
management and the economy but says one authority they could 
signify only a tendency of herd behavior 
professor eugene jennings finds that in each fiveyear period 
from 1950 through 1969 the average age of newly appointed chief 
executives fell from 577 in 19501954 to 501 in 19651969 
after that the age at appointment rose steadily again reaching 
567 years in the 19801984 period 
but he advises it is now on the way down again and he 
projects it will be down to 52 years or less in the 19891994 
period 
such patterns obviously invite economic and political 
interpretations but jennings cautions against reading too much 
into them 
it may be he speculates that it simply becomes proper 
smart 
jennings a pioneer in the study of executive mobility has been 
observing corporations since 1949 and has written the book so to 
speak on the upward sideways and downward patterns in the 
fortunes of highranking executives 
his basic studies the mobile manager and routes to the 
executive suite have educated graduate students helped 
executives understand where they fit in the larger scheme and 
guided executive recruiters 
in studying the numbers the professor he teaches business at 
michigan state university when he isnt offering confidential 
advise to chiefs found two curious telling splits or 
indications of bimodality in the age groupings 
these splits occurred in 19651969 and 19801984 and in each 
instance led to changes in the pattern 
when the age level fell to 501 years in the earlier period it 
hardly represented uniformity instead 33 percent of the 
appointments were below age 47 and 35 percent were above 52 years 
that bimodality says jennings was a turning point thereafter 
the average age of appointment began rising again reaching a top 
in 19801984 but then that old bimodality came into play again 
in the latter period the split found by jennings was made up of 
36 percent below age 50 and 37 percent above age 55 and just as 
the split back in the 1960s led to a change in direction of the age 
pattern this one did also 
following the latest split the average age fell sharply in the 
19851987 period to 546 years and jennings speculates it should 
continue falling right into the 1990s 
jennings recalls that in the 1960s when he was well into a 
career of advising corporations about their own behavior he had 
little difficulty in selling the idea that a chief executive was 
good for five years 
the notion then he explains was to seek optimum power from the 
executive staff get them at their peak utilize them and get 
another 
companies were growing you didnt want to block the movement 
of cream to the top he said 
there was a strong belief in the system in this is the way we 
do things at this company executives were there to manage within 
the system not necessarily to lead 
eventually however that attitude changed and the age pattern 
rose accompanied by a feeling that a good chairman was hard to 
find and so you kept him or her for 10 to 15 years 
the feeling developed that if age plugged up the movement of 
cream to the top then so be it those who left because the plug 
was stuck in the neck of the bottle were felt to detract less from 
the organization than the continued contribution of a wellseasoned 
chief jennings said 
the new bimodality began showing up as early as 1982 and says 
jennings probably indicates less belief in the systems strength 
in fact there is a suspicion that the whole system is probably 
faulty and needs changing 
this split jennings says suggests the feeling has developed in 
some corporations that people are needed at the helm who arent so 
enamored with the system that they wouldnt dare to change it 
if my speculation is correct jennings says we have two 
or three years during which corporate systems will continue to be 
rebuilt by younger chief executive officers

you wouldnt think perry king and lauren 
hutton would need a makeover to be perfect people until you 
saw them in makeup for the abc movie 
king a chiseled matineeidol type spent more than two hours 
in makeup every morning to look like a middleaged overweight 
outofshape couch potato the same for hutton a former fashion 
model 
in perfect people which abc will telecast monday the 
couple take a good look at themselves and their lifestyle and 
decide to change 
when i read the script i said this is great but it would be 
physically impossible for me to play this role said king 
after they did a transformation on me and took pictures nobody 
recognized me except my daughter louise she knew me instantly 
id walk around in makeup and in the fat suit and see how 
people reacted to me i had thinning hair bags under my eyes 
jowls i also spent some time watching fat people to see how they 
moved i also stole from tom bray one of my costars on riptide 
hes thin but he has a lot of mannerisms and gestures i called 
him up and said i was going to use some of them 
the movie follows kenneth and barbara ken and barbie as they 
work to regain their lost youth 
everything we do is possible king said the plastic 
surgery the hair transplants the implants the liposuction but i 
hope that we make it very clear that its potentially dangerous 
painful and takes a long time so the differences between the way 
we looked in the beginning and the way we look at the end can be 
done 
our approach is humorous we show how they want to look as 
they did 20 years earlier and the problems it causes theyre no 
longer grounded in reality if you can change your appearance 
whats real they were high school sweethearts it bothers ken that 
men are now ogling at his wife it shows that you dont fall in 
love with someone for their looks you fall in love with someone 
for what they are its really a sweet little movie about two good 
people 
king calls it a nice change from his role as a terrible 
person in the miniseries ill take manhattan 
im getting older and more of my life shows on my face he 
said that makes it better for me as an actor i can be cast in 
different parts 
king said he was most excited about a pilot for abc he will do 
with dorian harewood with whom he has been friends since they did 
the tv movie foster and laurie in 1975 about two new york city 
policemen killed in an ambush in 1972 
the projected series was developed from an idea by harewoods 
wife ann mccurry and her friend louise hoven the working title 
is black and white 
were not cops said king were halfbrothers our mother 
has left us only one thing an investigative newspaper the only 
way we can keep it going is to work together theres a lot of 
rivalry and dissention between us hopefully itll have the humor 
of the rockford files jim garner used to call his show an 
hourlong smile 
were two brothers whove had no contact with each other 
although we knew about each other our mother had had two marriages 
and two separate lives if would be great if we could do something 
with this people talk all the time about doing something together 
but they never do so here are two friends who got an idea and 
decided to do something with it

the news lately has been anything but comforting 
for people getting ready to file their tax returns for 1987 
when the general accounting office made test queries in the 
internal revenue services telephone assistant program for 
taxpayers it says it got wrong answers 39 percent of the time 
when money magazine asked 50 professional preparers to compute 
the taxes owed by a hypothetical family no two came up with the 
same number and the preparers fees ranged from 187 to 2500 
a person might conclude from this that the annual exercise of 
reckoning up with uncle sam is becoming a high stakes game played 
under very uncertain rules 
if you cant rely totally on the irss own people for guidance 
and if the professionals appear to be taking no more than educated 
guesses to whom should you turn for guidance 
even for middleincome taxpayers a lot rides on the answer to 
that question you dont want inadvertently to pay a bigger tax 
bill than you have to but at the same time you dont want to 
venture into territory that invites an irs audit 
and the value of say a 500 tax saving pales if it costs you 
600 in preparation fees to get it 
the whole situation is certainly troublesome but it need not be 
cause for panic as money magazine describes it the financial 
profile of its theoretical family was more complicated than most 
people in the real world are likely to have 
the tax reform law that contributed so much to all this 
confusion also made it possible for larger numbers of americans to 
file using short forms 
furthermore there have been gray areas for many years in the 
black and white of the income tax forms though many people 
complain about this few have been eager to give up their favorite 
deductions and credits to the cause of simplification 
even in the present turmoil many people relish the challenge of 
tackling the tax forms on their own they reason that it is about 
the only chance they get to work for aftertax pay since a refund 
isnt taxable income 
if you prefer to let somebody else do the work there are ways 
to improve your chances of coming out in good shape 
first of all says robert smith an assistant professor of 
accounting at boston university school of management its 
important to figure out what kind of help you need 
if you determine that your situation is pretty simple for 
instance you dont want to choose a highpriced preparer who 
specializes in dealing with top corporate executives or rock stars 
if youre not sure whether your case is simple or complicated 
smith suggests asking for a meeting with a preparer simply to 
evaluate the degree of service you need 
get organized as soon as possible smith says if your 
preparer has to spend time sorting through your records your bill 
may be higher 
organized records reduce the chance that an error will 
occur he adds 
another incentive not to put the business off until the april 15 
deadline approaches that is precisely the time when preparers are 
the busiest and most in demand 
some firms lower their fees for clients who come in early or 
who are willing to have their return filing date extended smith 
observes 
should you find that you need continuing and fairly elaborate 
tax help it makes sense to seek out a preparer the way you would a 
family dentist doctor or lawyer 
as smith concludes you may establish a longterm relationship 
that will save tax dollars for years to come

the minister basked in glory so exalted that 
special choirs of women sang praises to him born poor he had 
become rich and famous when he preached people sighed and waved 
handkerchiefs in admiration 
but he tumbled into obloquy 
that happened to a thirdcentury syrian bishop paul samosata 
dethroned as a heretic a story recalled as resembling the fall of 
modern tvfamed evangelists including the latest jimmy swaggart 
theres nothing new in this its as old as the hills says 
stanley m burgess professor of religion at southwestern missouri 
state university in springfield mo but tv makes it a spectacle 
for millions 
the higher the pedestal the heavier the winds burgess said 
in a telephone interview the higher they get up the mountain 
the thicker the fog 
its harder for them to reflect on themselves and see who they 
really are with people constantly telling them how wonderful they 
are that theyre the man of god for this hour its not a 
position to be in if one wants to be honest with himself 
its the old egocentric problem as old as the biblical adam who 
sought to be god himself but burgess said the glorified are 
especially vulnerable 
this is a common strand that runs through all religious 
literature he said 
as second samuel 125 puts it how the mighty are fallen 
swaggarts fall over reported involvement with a prostitute is 
particularly stark because of his hardline preaching burgess 
said 
he had preached against almost everything imaginable and then 
for him to do the very thing he preached against makes it all the 
more dramatic burgess said 
burgess a scholar of the assemblies of god the denomination to 
which swaggart belongs said some ministers go wrong in every 
century and in every denomination virtually every day 
but swaggart who lashed out at sexual lapses becomes the 
epitome of hyprocrisy burgess said i do appreciate that he 
came out with it 
richard champion editor of the denominations weekly 
pentecostal evangel said that when people surround themselves 
with those who always agree who tell them only good things they 
get tripped up in public adulation 
ego takes over and gets out of control they see evil as 
something in other people and rationalize their own 
behaviorwith somebody like swaggart it a very visible thing 
clinical psychgologist larry bass of springfield mo said that 
without being specific about swaggart his case seemed to fit the 
category of someone who has difficulty accepting his own 
humanness 
while he is so vocal attacking other peoples sexual sins he 
is guilty of some of that himself and struggling with it but he 
feels as if he has to be above it and so he hides it 
he comes across as very judgmental and critical of other 
people he cant accept his his own vulnerability to sin so what 
he has to do is hide it in a kind of selfrighteous hypocrisy 
bass who also belongs to the assemblies of god said that many 
times those who are the most judgmental putting down others and 
condemning are guilty of the same thing theyre haranguing about 
but they have to hide it thats the shame theyre so afraid 
to deal with it 
that kind of ego is a tremendous burden to carry around 
bass said adding that swaggarts preaching often was bigoted and 
absolutist condemning other religions as well as other people 
that was his downfall bass said 
he noted swaggart had been very very vocal in condemning 
preachers caught in sex scandals including fallen tv evangelist 
jim bakker and new orleans evangelist marvin gorman 
swaggart admitted to his congregation sunday he had been 
involved in sin after gorman reportedly supplied church officials 
with pictures of swaggart at a motel with a prostitute 
bass said the highly judgmental types have a kind of 
omnipotence that i can get away with things that im above it 
all above the rules but it finally catches up with them 
he had pushed himself and was most successful but he had 
faults and inferiorities that he was hiding and running from that 
isnt healthy or mature and it finally is selfdefeating 
robert spence president of the denominations evangel college 
in springfield said the eminently successful tend to live in 
an unreal world filled with people who say only what they 
think is wanted 
it become unreal an artificial environment that distorts the 
whole perspective and leads a person to the point of assuming hes 
stronger than he really ishes lulled to the place he thinks 
that what bothers other people doesnt bother me

at age 65 native texan george a 
mcalister is a big friendly drawling former coach educator and 
inventor turned businessman rancher historian author and dreamer 
his dream was to make a film based on the battle of the alamo 
that dream is coming true 
with blazing cannons and bloody sabres the heroes of the alamo 
relive on a giant new screen this week the fateful 13day siege 
that inspired texas to win its independence from mexico in 1836 a 
blacktie premiere of the docudrama is set for saturday 
entitled alamo the price of freedom the 45minute film 
is an account of the battle based largely on the research and books 
of mcalister and it has stirred some controversy 
academy awardwinning filmmaker kieth merrill directed the 
movie part of a 72 million project that includes a new imax 
theater with its 84foot wide sixstory high screen the 426seat 
theater is housed in the new rivercenter mall which overlooks the 
alamo grounds 
the imax system is designed to give viewers visually stunning 
images as well as a sense of participation in the onscreen 
activity 
the price of freedom was filmed last summer at alamo village 
near brackettville where john wayne built the set for his epic 
1960 film the alamo 
saturdays premiere benefits the research library operated by 
the daughters of the republic of texas and includes a reception and 
dinnerdance and remarks by dallas billionaire nelson bunker hunt 
gov bill clements will be on hand the next day for formal 
dedication ceremonies which coincide with the 152nd anniversary of 
the fall of the alamo to mexican gen santa anna 
there are two great symbols of freedom in america mcalister 
said first is the statue of liberty but it is just that a 
symbol of freedom then there is this old stone mission the alamo 
a shrine to the price of freedom 
and there is a difference between a symbol of freedom and a 
price of freedom 
a veteran of world war ii and the korean conflict mcalister 
pointed out gently that a lot of people are willing to live for a 
cause but only a very few are willing to die for one 
the defenders of the alamo were willing to die for freedom 
he said and more than 3 million people from all over the world 
came to the alamo last year to pay homage to those 189 brave men 
who gave their lives that texas might be free 
mcalister once stood outside the alamo for days asking visitors 
if they would pay to see an authentic movie of the historic battle 
and if they were familiar with imax theaters 
he liked the answers and the premiere this weekend showcases 
the results of that private poll 
while stressing the importance of authenticity mcalister points 
out quickly that much of what occurred at the alamo is subject to 
speculation and individual interpretation 
there are no chronicles of the alamo and what happened 
there he said 
still mcalister spent 12 years researching his books his 
travels took him to goliad san jacinto washingtononthebrazos 
and other battle sites and to louisiana tennessee south carolina 
and alabama to visit the hometowns of the most famous defenders of 
the alamo col william b travis jim bowie davy crockett and 
james bonham 
mcalister also describes the alamo contribution of the tejanos 
the nine mexicans who supported the texas cause 
he and his colleagues say they have made their movie as 
historically accurate as possible without sacrificing dramatic and 
entertainment value 
if we were going to make a movie for several generations i 
did not want it to be fiction mcalister said 
the movie has no stars but uses 450 members of warenactment 
societies across the country who are dedicated to historical 
accuracy costume and customs 
mcalister was surprised and dismayed when san antonio city 
councilman walter martinez and a group of residents accused the 
producers of distorting historical facts 
after viewing a rough cut of the movie martinez complained that 
the film demeaned hispanics by making them look like bad guys and 
presented a list of objections to texas cavalcade corp the 
production group headed by mcalister 
kathy penasosa a spokeswoman for texas cavalcade said some 
objectionable scenes were deleted in the final editing from 73 
minutes to 45 minutes but professed to be puzzled by the criticism 
in a community thats 54 percent hispanic she said were 
not going to make a movie thats offensive to hispanics 
born and raised in east texas mcalister got his first exposure 
to texas history in a tworoom twoteacher schoolhouse in a tiny 
hamlet near commerce 
he interrupted his collegiate studies at east texas state in 
1942 to enlist in the marines but returned after the war to get a 
masters degree in math his minor was history 
during an academic career that was interrupted when he was 
recalled to active duty in korea in 1950 mcalister was a dean at 
howard county junior college in big spring as well as chairman of 
the math department coach of the track team and an amateur 
inventor 
in 1955 with 150 he founded a company called gamco to create 
and build teaching aids for math students including a classroom 
computer and an electronic teaching machine the sale of gamco in 
1966 made him a millionaire 
it also freed him to pursue his ranching and writing interests 
and to devote more time to historical research 
his first novel nothing is forever was based on the early 
life of travis that book evolved into a second novel a time to 
love a time to die 
this led in turn to alamo the price of freedom a 
nonfiction book which mcalister describes as history as i view 
it and my personal research reveals it 
for mcalister the price of freedom is more than a movie or 
a business venture 
said he i would like to leave a legacy on the screen that 
retells the story of this sacrifice for freedom that 
demonstrates to a new generation that freedom isnt free that 
liberty rests finally on those willing to die for it

the united states and the soviet union both are 
pushing for an end to the war in afghanistan as negotiations in 
geneva enter a decisive stage this week but complex issues remain 
to be settled 
secretary of state george p shultzs talks in moscow last week 
ended on a note of optimism the kremlin said again it wants to end 
the red army intervention that has cost an estimated 10000 soviet 
lives in what mikhail s gorbachev has called a bleeding wound 
pakistan and afghanistan are negotiating with united nations 
mediation but the two major players are the soviet union which 
intervened in 1979 and the united states which backs the moslem 
guerrilla forces fighting afghanistans marxist government 
the soviet leader sent hopes soaring when he pledged moscow will 
withdraw its estimated 115000 troops within ten months starting 
may 15 provided a peace settlement is signed by pakistan and 
afghanistan by march 15 
with the geneva talks starting wednesday gorbachevs deadline 
would leave just 13 days to tie up the package of agreements 
designed to end nine years of fighting 
after a 20day shuttle between kabul and islamabad un 
mediator diego cordovez reported early this month virtual 
agreement on the timetable of the soviet withdrawal the united 
states and pakistan still would prefer to give the soviets less 
than 10 months to leave 
in almost six years of negotiations accords have been reached 
on mutual noninterference on superpower guarantees that 
afghanistan will be nonaligned and on the return of 35 million 
afghans sheltered by pakistan the largest concentration of 
refugees in the world 
but crucial aspects are still unresolved the major issues 
at what stage is the aid to the guerrillas to be cut off 
gorbachev hinted in a feb 8 statement the american support is no 
longer a problem 
but washington officials have said the timing of the cutoff has 
not yet been determined us supplies reportedly totaled 670 
million in 1987 the supplies funneled through pakistan include 
shoulderfired stinger missiles said to have downed more than 200 
soviet and afghan aircraft 
how should the withdrawal be phased gorbachev has said a 
relatively greater portion of the soviet forces will be 
withdrawn rapidly but a diplomatic source close to the talks who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said there were still very 
different approaches to the pace of the withdrawal 
will the settlement involve iran host to another 2 million 
afghan refugees and base for other moslem resistance groups 
pressing for a nonmarxist islamic government iran has refused to 
join in the talks but says it will accept any settlement satisfying 
the legitimate aspirations of the afghan people 
the most difficult question however is outside the scope of 
the geneva talks who will sign for afghanistan and what government 
will be installed in kabul during the withdrawal 
pakistan argues that a durable settlement requires the prior 
formation of a broadbased interim government to prevent more 
bloodshed and assure the refugees safe return 
president zia ulhaq said in an interview in the washington post 
last month that pakistan would not sign any settlement with the 
present marxist government headed by president najib in kabul the 
afghan capital 
pakistan does not recognize najibs government and insists the 
geneva talks be conducted in an indirect fashion with cordovez 
acting as gobetween zia reportedly would like to see an interim 
coalition in kabul including the antimarxist guerrillas afghan 
exiles and some representatives of najibs peoples democratic 
party 
gorbachev who assured a visiting najib in december 1986 that 
moscow would not abandon him says the makeup of the future 
government is an internal matter and none of our business 
still gorbachev is expected to seek some guarantee to prevent a 
bloodbath during or after the troop withdrawal otherwise najib 
and members of his government as well as departing soviets could 
be left defenseless against reprisal killings 
the soviet union shares a long border with afghanistan and there 
has been no indication whether the kremlin will be willing to 
relinquish any attempt to influence events in the country once the 
red army is withdrawn 
most of the pakistanbased groups representing the estimated 
200000 moslem guerrillas fighting the soviets and the kabul 
governments army of about 50000 have ruled out any powersharing 
with najib 
last week the guerrillas announced plans for a 28member 
transitional cabinet to replace najibs government and sign the 
geneva settlement on behalf of afghanistan if the terms are 
deemed acceptable 
the insurgents vowed they would not lay down their arms until an 
islamic government was established 
kabul radio reported that najib insisted a new government should 
be formed after the soviet forces withdraw and the composition of a 
new government is a matter for afghans alone 
at the same time pakistan is trying to win allies in its push 
for an intersion would be similar to president 
reagans proposal that was narrowly killed by the house three weeks 
ago but would exclude any money for new weapons it would retain 
the cia as delivery agent for the supplies and would give 
president reagan the right to seek a new vote on a weapons package 
after may 1 
house speaker jim wright dtexas called the democratic 
proposal the most workable kind of program and one that will 
provide balanced incentives for the contras and the leftist 
sandinista government to pursue peace talks called for in a 
regional accord 
the package was unveiled late tuesday by rep david bonior 
dmich after two weeks of intensive negotiations among several 
factions of the chambers majority party it went before the rules 
committee today where republicans were expected to demand the 
right to offer their own alternative 
president reagan did not immediately react to the democrats 
package his own 362 million aid proposal for the rebels 
including weapons was narrowly rejected by the house three weeks 
ago 
among major elements in the democratic proposal 
about 36 million a month for the contras half to buy food 
clothing medicine and shelter and the other half to pay for 
delivery of the supplies to rebel troops inside nicaragua the aid 
would run from march 1 after current aid expires until june 30 
it could continue until the end of the year if a ceasefire is 
reached by june 30 
about 14 million for nicaraguas miskito indians an 
opposition group that has been carrying out its own battle against 
the sandinistas but has consistently refused invitations to join 
with the contras the indians already have worked out their own 
ceasefire with the managua regime 
a new 14 million childrens survival fund to provide 
medical help for children on all sides of the conflict the aid 
would be administered by nonpolitical private aid groups or 
international relief agencies already working in the region 
not included in the package was any longterm economic 
development aid for the region but a democratic fact sheet said 
congress will welcome proposals from reagan on that subject 
current aid to the rebels expires feb 29 and with it the legal 
authority for the cia to continue air drops of previously 
stockpiled weapons and ammunition the new package contains no such 
authority 
under the new proposal the contras humanitarian supplies 
would be delivered by private contractors supervised by the defense 
department until the contras and the sandinistas are able to agree 
on a ceasefire 
the deliveries would be monitored by the congressional 
intelligence committees and the general accounting office 
congress investigative arm to ensure that no weapons were 
included 
after fighting stops responsibility for delivery would shift to 
a private aid group or an international relief agency such as the 
red cross 
the package also would provide for an expedited procedure for a 
vote on new military aid for the rebels a high priority for the 
reagan administration if a ceasefire should fall apart and the 
sandinistas should fail to keep their promises to democratize 
the determination of whether expedited procedures should be 
initiated would be made by the house intelligence committees 
according to a fact sheet on the package but republicans were 
skeptical of the provision saying it was not a solid guarantee 
that military aid would come to a quick vote in both the house and 
senate 
wright said he was not necessarily confident of the votes to 
pass the package republicans have remained aloof from the drafting 
process holding out for more aid and for continued authority for 
the cia to deliver previously stockpiled eapons 
the key to this really will be how much support it gets on the 
republican side said rep stephen solarz dny a longtime 
contra aid opponent who added that he planned to vote against the 
package 
other democrats said they expected at least 70 in their party to 
oppose the proposal 
the party is seeking a middle ground on an issue that is not 
compromisable said rep robert torricelli dnj it appears 
to me to be an exercise in attempting to cover ourselves and 
avoid political blame if the contras go out of business and the 
sandinistas renege on promises to increase civil liberties 
democrats have argued against new military aid saying that 
providing it would endanger peace efforts talks between the 
contras and sandinistas broke off over the weekend without 
progress and no date has been set for their resumption 
reagan and many congressional republicans have countered that it 
is only consistent military pressure from rebel attacks that has 
forced the sandinistas into peace talks

a dozen turbaned bearded men with 
machine guns patrol a walled villa where the seven leaders of 
afghanistans guerrilla alliance draw up plans for an islamic 
nation of afghanistan 
the meetings have become almost continuous in this dusty 
frontier city a short ride from the afghan border since the 
soviet union announced last month it planned to pull out troops 
backing afghanistans marxist government moscow said it would 
withdraw its estimated 115000 soldiers within ten months starting 
may 15 if pakistan and afghanistan sign a peace agreement by march 
15 
with the geneva talks entering a crucial stage on wednesday the 
time pressure is helping fuse the often fractious mujahedeen 
guerrilla military alliance into a united political force 
theyre closer than before but the question is for how 
long said abdul haq a guerrilla commander from kabul province 
so far the resistance leaders have agreed to install themselves 
as a joint executive over a 28member cabinet that will include 
guerrillas afghan refugees and moslems presently living in 
kabul 
it calls for the head of a cabinet to be head of state but the 
plan contains no names it proposes to replace the sovietbacked 
kabul government before an accord is signed at the unsponsored 
talks in geneva 
neither pakistan which backs the guerrillas nor the afghan 
communists appears likely to accept the proposal unchanged the 
pakistanis have told the insurgents they may have to share power 
with the communists at least in a transitional regime 
were in a hurry there is little time said abdul qadir 
karyad head of the political wing of the fervent moslem party 
hezbiislami led by gulbaddin hekmatyar 
although his party is considered the most extreme of the 
fundamentalist groups karyad indicated the hezbiislami was 
coming around to compromise with the more moderate ones in the name 
of unity 
we want to be logical we want to show the world we can accept 
responsibility for our country karyad said 
nevertheless the guerrillas blueprint for a new government 
does not explain just how it would come to power it assumes the 
sovietbacked kabul regime will simply step aside 
the flurry of compromise follows pakistans insistence that an 
afghan settlement must consist of a military accord such as the 
one near completion at geneva and a political accord for a 
broadbased interim government that could head off a bloody 
power struggle as soviet troops head home 
the three moderate guerrilla parties ittehad the afghan 
national liberation front and the national islamic front for the 
liberation of afghanistan apparently have dropped their support 
of bringing back ousted king zahir shah to head a neutral 
transitional regime 
its not really proper to raise the zahir shah issue just 
now said zabiullah mojaddedi son of anlf leader sibghatullah 
mojaddedi we should have a leader from within the mujahedeen if 
not then we can consider that option 
all seven parties fully agree on one point they refuse to join 
even a temporary coalition with communists 
how can i work in an office with somebody who killed my 
brother my neighbors said karyad 
hezbiislami along with the jamiatiislami and the 
hezbiislami faction led by alliance chairman yunis khalis have 
gone so far as to threaten to ignore a geneva accord as long as the 
mujahedeen are excluded from the talks 
the indirect negotiations have been between the kabul government 
and pakistan which serves as the guerrillas headquarters and 
shelters about 35 million afghan refugees the united states 
which backs the guerrillas and the soviet union are to be the 
guarantors of an accord 
all seven resistance parties say they want to negotiate directly 
with the soviets because they view the kabul government as moscows 
puppet 
i hope the soviets will be wise enough to sit down and discuss 
the technicalities of a withdrawal with the mujahedeen

here is a brief look at what the soviet union 
hopes to achieve in the march 2 negotiations in geneva between its 
ally afghanistan and pakistan 
through their afghan allies the soviets likely will formally 
commit themselves to withdrawing their estimated 115000 troops 
starting may 15 and to completing the process within 10 months 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev announced the plan on feb 8 
the kremlin is likely to reiterate its demand that the united 
states pakistan and other western countries stop supplying weapons 
to the moslem guerrillas fighting the prosoviet kabul government 
the soviets have suffered heavy losses of aircraft since the united 
states and britain first began sending the rebels stinger 
antiaircraft missiles which can track and down aircraft by sensing 
engine heat 
gorbachev has said his country wants no say in who governs 
afghanistan or the countrys politics after the troops come home 
even so he is expected to seek some guarantee that a bloodbath 
will not occur during or after the troop withdrawal without such a 
promise afghan leader najib and members of his government as well 
as departing soviets would be left defenseless against a 
widespread insurgency which could lead to reprisal killings 
the soviets likely will resist any attempts by pakistan to tie 
an afghan settlement in geneva to formation of a coalition 
government in afghanistan gorbachev said afghanistans future 
government should be decided as an internal matter ranking 
soviet officials have accused pakistan of delaying a settlement by 
insisting the future government issue be resolved before the troop 
withdrawal begins soviet first deputy foreign minister yuli 
vorontsov contended in a pravda interview published thursday that 
the future government has nothing to do with the geneva 
agreements

here is a brief look at what the united states 
hopes to achieve in the negotiations between afghanistan and 
pakistan in geneva 
the withdrawal of an estimated 115000 soviet troops from 
afghanistan has been a high priority for the white house and 
congress since the soviet occupation began in december 1979 
quick withdrawal remains an immediate goal of the united states 
the antimarxist moslem guerrillas and the prowestern government 
in pakistan which has provided sanctuary for 35 million afghans 
and channels millions of dollars in covert military aid to the 
resistance from the united states china and arab nations 
secretary of state george p shultz and other us officials 
welcomed the statement by kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev that he 
wants to start pulling the estimated 120000 red army soldiers out 
of afghanistan by may 15 if unsponsored negotiations produce an 
agreement by march 15 
but the reagan administration is pushing the soviets to either 
shorten their proposed 10month withdrawal or to pull out most 
troops early 
we dont see any reason why they couldnt be out by the end of 
the year if they start in the middle of may shultz said 
under a plan being discussed behind the scenes the united 
states would stop sending military aid as soon as the soviets began 
to withdraw half the soviet troops would withdraw within the first 
90 days 30000 more over the next 90 days and the remaining 
30000 over the following four months 
a longer term goal on which guerrilla groups and the 
pakistani government are split is over the government to replace 
the sovietbacked regime in kabul us officials believe that no 
prosoviet regime could survive after the red army leaves 
shultz said this month that the guerrillas would not accept 
positions in a government run by president najib the head of the 
kabul regime 
it is difficult to imagine how an interim regime is going to 
be put together shultz said

for the first time since 1928 a us governor 
faces trial before his legislature monday in the following report 
an ap special correspondent offers a portrait of arizona its 
people and their governor at the crossroads of impeachment 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for evan mecham arizonas 
governorinexile it has come to high noon 
here in the land of geronimo and wyatt earp and the ok corral a 
part of america never known for pussyfooting the arizona senate on 
monday begins the final act in a course of redress not seen in this 
nation in more than half a century it will decide whether to 
remove the impeached governor from office 
members of the senate will not predict the outcome only that it 
likely will be close and that however it turns out there will be 
politically speaking a lot of blood left on the ground 
its ripping up our party and state in a fashion thats going 
to take years to recover says us sen john mccain 
when mccain and three other republican members of arizonas 
congressional delegation suggested that fellow republican mecham 
resign the senator began receiving hate mail by the sackful 
the mob that crucified our precious lord is the same kind of 
mob that is after our governor wrote one constituent 
the other day about 2000 mecham supporters took out their 
anger while raising money for his defense by bashing an 
automobile with a sledgehammer three licks for a dollar the car 
was painted with slogans such as media bias identifying what 
they perceived as the causes of the governors predicament 
the arizona house approved impeachment articles feb 5 accusing 
mecham of concealing a 350000 campaign loan misusing 80000 
from funds raised by his inauguration committee and trying to 
thwart an investigation into a state officials alleged death 
threat against a witness in a grand jury probe of mecham 
the 63yearold staunchly conservative governor also had 
antagonized many arizonans with controversial statements on ethnic 
groups and social issues 
after the vote mecham stepped down provisionally as governor 
and moved into political exile in an office in nearby glendale 
now the house charges are to be tried in the 30member senate 
where 20 votes would convict him and remove him permanently from 
office 
but not even the extreme measure of an impeachment trial is 
likely to put to rest the turmoil in arizona if mecham survives 
he still faces a criminal trial for not reporting a campaign loan 
and a recall election resulting from a public petition 
recall election all right then said mecham supporters and 
began circulating petitions to recall as well house members who 
voted for the governors impeachment 
yes there is little stability these days in arizona politics 
anywhere in arizona for that matter 
the phoenix area maricopa county is the secondfastestgrowing 
urban area in america just behind san diego it gains one new 
citizen every 12 minutes thats net gain state figures also show 
that for every four newcomers three others move out 
all that coming and going causes such instability that one 
mental health organization recommended a state program to 
discourage growth arizona for instance has one of the nations 
highest divorce rates a suicide rate 50 percent higher than the 
national average and among adolescents 70 percent higher it also 
ranks last in percapita funding for mental health 
we have an enormous amount of work to do in this state says 
state sen greg lunn a tucson republican 
thats another reason why the impeachment is such a 
distracting turn of events the senate will be tied up with it for 
weeks important matters that should be dealt with this session 
will have to be deferred to the next 
lunn has a special interest in environmental matters well he 
might the phoenix area is promoted to tourists and potential 
settlers as the valley of the sun but dust and emissions and 
temperature inversions conspire against the sun phoenixs smog 
rivals the worst in the nation so do its traffic jams

once outside phoenix however or tucson the states only two 
urban areas you can drive for hours without seeing another car 
geographically as well as politically and socially arizona is a 
state of stunning contrasts and contradictions 
the state is sixth in the nation in size but its 335 million 
population ranks 25th threefourths of its people live in the 
phoenix and tucson metropolitan areas the rest live in villages 
and towns scattered across mountains and deserts and forests 
staggering in their solitude and in many areas their poverty 
in rural areas much of the frontier west prevails and not just 
in the rigorously independent attitude of the people at cordes 
junction near prescott the cafe requires patrons to check their 
weapons at the door many do just that since in arizona its 
perfectly legal to pack a gun openly 
rivalry in arizona is fierce between city and country for the 
states attention to their needs mecham was supported by rural 
voters who saw his two election opponents as representing the 
phoenix elite his impeachment intensifies those jealousies 
feelings for and against evan mecham are held with such passion 
that some longtime friends are reluctant to bring up the subject 
not knowing how the other stands 
some thingsks and orientals he dismissed those petitioning for his 
recall 
as dissident democrats and homosexuals 
now it comes down to the impeachment trial itself 
only 15 us governors have faced impeachment proceedings only 
seven were removed from office the last oklahomas henry simpson 
johnston in 1928 
thomas jefferson was once impeached in 1781 as governor of 
virginia his accuser was patrick henry who thought jefferson left 
the capital with unseemly haste when british troops attacked 
jefferson insisted on a trial and won vindication 
so evan mecham it appears is in pretty good company but 
then so are his accusers

the battle for the white house wont be the only thing on the 
minds of some super tuesday voters in mississippi theyll begin 
choosing a new senator in louisianas 4th district they may elect 
a new congressman and in monroe nc theyll decide whether to 
legalize sales of mixed drinks 
of the 20 mostly southern and border states holding presidential 
primaries and caucuses march 8 four arkansas mississippi 
maryland and texas are holding their regular state primaries at 
the same time 
but even in places where the state primary will be held later 
officials have slipped statewide or local issues onto the super 
tuesday ballot 
its a costeffective measure and it would tend to draw a 
larger turnout for both issues explains jim hamilton of the 
florida division of elections 
in mississippi the retirement of sen john c stennis after 41 
years has sparked a close democratic primary race between rep 
wayne dowdy and secretary of state dick molpus ed cole state 
democratic chairman says the combination of the presidential and 
senate primaries should ensure a pretty good turnout rep 
trent lott is unopposed for the gop nomination 
in maryland and texas democratic sens lloyd bentsen and paul 
sarbanes faces token challenges for renomination and will be 
heavily favored over whichever republicans win their partys 
nominations texas also has primaries for five of nine seats on its 
supreme court which has become a political battleground with two 
justices publicly reprimanded two others quitting and republicans 
hoping to achieve an unprecedented majority 
arkansas features a heated democratic primary in the 1st 
congressional district where 10term rep bill alexander is 
challenged by campaign consultant darrell glascock who says the 
incumbent neglects his district and spends too much time jetting to 
central america 
the texas secretary of state estimated it would have cost 12 
million extra to hold separate state and presidential primaries 
bob fisher of the arkansas attorney generals office said the two 
parties would have had to raise filing fees to an unholy amount 
to finance separate primaries 
in louisiana voters in the 4th district will select a 
replacement in the us house for govelect buddy roemer who 
takes office on march 14 roemer asked that the balloting be 
scheduled for super tuesday to cut down on election costs in his 
financially strapped state 
nine democrats and one republican are competing in the open 
primary in which a candidate is elected if he receives a majority 
otherwise the top two finishers compete in a runoff the field 
includes former rep claude buddy leach who lost to roemer in 
1980 following leachs acquittal on votebuying charges 
in georgia legislators added a statewide referendum to the 
ballot with the hope of bolstering turnout for the presidential 
primary the measure asks voters whether to increase from 8000 to 
10000 the amount of gross income people 62 and older may receive 
and still be exempt from some school and property taxes 
every presiding officer that ive talked with every governor 
is worried about a low turnout said speaker of the house tom 
murphy prior to pushing the referendum through the general 
assembly we need a tremendous turnout the more folks the 
better 
in north carolina referendums on whether to permit mixed drink 
sales are scheduled in monroe and three other cities and counties 
this is an excellent way to avoid the cost of a separate 
election said state treasurer harlan boyles in wake county 
for example theyre having a separate election and it will cost 
something like 100000 
in tennessee state election coordinator david haines estimates 
that about 40 of 95 counties will hold their primaries for tax 
assessor and school superintendent on march 8 mainly to save money 
the tennessee legislature last year appropriated 2 million to 
cover the cost of the presidential primary and gave counties the 
option of conducting their county primaries then at state expense 
or in may at their own counties must also pay for the august 
statewide primary and the november general election 
ironically in oklahoma two ballot issues relating to economic 
development were taken off the march 8 ballot and rescheduled for 
september because of fears that they wouldnt get the necessary 
attention because of the presidential campaign 
the two were so important that we were afraid they would get 
lost in all the hullabaloo in all the things going on said gov 
henry bellmons assistant press secretary wendy johnson

footwear maker nike inc which has been using 
the beatles recording of the song revolution in its 
advertising despite the groups protests plans to scrap the ads 
next month 
nike spokesman kevin brown said the athletic footwear company 
was happy with the results of the ads which have been running 
since last spring but wants to freshen its advertising approach 
as a result he said nike decided against exercising its option 
to use the beatles recording for another year 
its license to use the recording expires march 22 but before it 
runs out brown said nike plans to run one more new commercial with 
the song the new ad which debuts this week is aimed mainly at 
women he said 
nikes revolution commercials to date have shown people 
walking playing basketball and participating in other sports while 
wearing nike shoes the only sound is the beatles recording 
the three surviving beatles through their recording company 
apple records have claimed they never intended that their 
recordings be used in commercials 
nike which is based in beaverton ore has insisted it is an 
innocent bystander in a longstanding dispute between apple and 
companies that hold the licensing rights to the beatles original 
recordings 
nike reportedly paid 250000 to capitol records inc which 
holds the north american licensing rights to the beatles 
recordings for the right to use the groups rendition of 
revolution in nike ads for a year 
last july apple records controlled by the three surviving 
beatles and john lennons widow yoko ono filed a suit charging 
that nike was using the rock groups persona and goodwill in 
its advertising without permission 
the suit which is still pending in us district court in new 
york asked for 15 million in damages and named nike and its ad 
agency capitol records and emi records ltd which holds licensing 
rights outside north america 
nike has contended it had a valid contract to use the recording 
intended no disrespect to the beatles and was an innocent victim in 
a dispute between apple capitol and emi 
leonard m marks an attorney for apple said he felt the 
decision showed nike was being responsive to the lawsuit and the 
numerous complaints of beatles fans about its use of the 
recordings 
he said he was optimistic that after nikes action we will be 
able to reach a settlement of the case with nike shortly 
but brown insisted the decision not to renew rights to the music 
was unrelated to the suit 
it was a business decision he said it makes sense to 
continuously update your ads 
he said nike had received about 150 to 200 letters from people 
objecting to nikes use of the song but said the company was 
generally satisfied with the performance of the ads he said sales 
for the six months ended nov 30 were up substantially from the 
same period a year earlier

public service co of new hampshire which 
sought bankruptcycourt protection because of the stalled 52 
billion seabrook nuclear plant has attracted takeover interest 
from a neighboring utility 
the proposed takeover disclosed tuesday by new england electric 
system based in westborough mass would not include public 
services 36 percent share of seabrook 
it also would require approval by a bankruptcy judge state 
regulators in massachusetts and new hampshire both companies 
directors and possibly some federal agencies 
public service new hampshires largest power company and the 
lead seabrook owner sought federal bankruptcy protection last 
month a move that symbolized the difficulties facing public 
utilities with heavy investments in nuclear power it became the 
first major investorowned utility to seek the refuge of bankruptcy 
court since the depression 
under new england electrics proposal public service would be 
left only with its share of the reactor which is completed but has 
been unable to surmount evacuationplanning obstacles to an 
operating license 
new england electric subsidiary new england power co owns 10 
percent of seabrook officials of the parent company would not 
comment on why they dont want to increase their share of the 
controversial plant 
samuel huntington president of the parent company said in a 
statement that the takeover would let the new public service pay 
its share of the costs of keeping seabrook ready while plant owners 
keep fighting for an operating license huntington did not explain 
how that would happen 
a spokesman for seabrooks joint owners david scanzoni 
speculated that it would be likely that there would be some kind 
of cash infusion that would be part of the arrangement to let the 
new public service maintain its share of seabrook carrying costs 
estimated at 3 million to 4 million a month 
scanzoni said new england electric would want to continue 
supporting seabrook since it already owns a chunk of the plant 
in many ways this a very positive step for seabrook station 
scanzoni said of the takeover talks 
one seabrook foe said he cant see how the takeover would let 
the remaining public service pay seabrook carrying costs on its own 
they cant gt any revenue out of it unless they license it 
manchester lawyer robert backus noted 
new hampshire law bars utilities from charging ratepayers for 
power plants before they operate commercially the state supreme 
court upheld that law on jan 26 denying public service an 
emergency rate increase and forcing the utility to seek bankruptcy 
protection two days later 
a wall street utility analyst dan scotto of lf rothschild 
holdings inc said a takeover would make business sense for new 
england electric since aside from seabrook public service is a 
profitable company 
but this is not going to be clear sailing scotto said 
partly because of unresolved questions about ratemaking authority 
scotto also said the proposal indicates new england electric is 
showing a lack of confidence in seabrooks prospects 
evacuation plans for a 10mile zone around seabrook must be 
approved before the plant can be licensed massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis a democratic presidential hopeful has played a 
key role in blocking the plant by refusing to submit plans for six 
communities in his state within the zone 
seabrook has submitted its own plans for massachusetts no 
hearings have been set on them yet

american standard inc faced intensified 
takeover pressure from black amp decker corp after the powertool 
maker raised its offer to 211 billion but analysts began to 
query whether the price was getting expensive 
black amp decker said tuesday it would pay 68 a share for the 
american standards stock compared with 65 a share or about 203 
billion offered previously it was the third time black amp decker 
has raised the offer 
some wall street securities analysts were surprised and said the 
price was becoming inflated for american standard a maker of 
plumbing heating and air conditioning equipment it has been 
maneuvering to escape a takeover 
they black amp decker obviously see something i dont see 
said guy nielsen an analyst at brown brothers harriman and co in 
new york the bidding has gotten to the point where i cant 
justify the 68 price 
he said the bidding already is a bit on the rich side 
others had expected black amp decker to raise the offer or drop 
the takeover attempt entirely after american standard announced 
monday it had financing commitments for a recapitalization aimed at 
thwarting the hostile bid 
black amp deckers latest offer which would expire at midnight 
est march 7 compares with the initial offer of 56 a share made in 
late january the towson mdbased manufacturer had said 
previously it would not raise the offer above 65 a share unless it 
could see american standards books 
american standard has rejected both previous offers as 
inadequate the new yorkbased company urged shareholders tuesday 
not to tender shares under the latest bid until it was reviewed by 
the board of directors 
american standard stock rose 12 cents to 6825 a share in new 
york stock exchange trading while black amp decker dipped 12 cents 
to 1937 
in a news release black amp decker said it also intended to file 
counterclaims in federal court in delaware seeking to invalidate 
american standards poison pill takeover defense and to halt 
any action on the recapitalization 
the 21 billion recapitalization plan would make american 
standard less attractive as a takeover target by boosting its 
longterm debt to more than 2 billion and sharply increasing its 
outstanding shares and equivalents such as stock options 
american standard incorporated in delaware had asked the 
federal court to validate its poison pill designed to make a 
takeover prohibitively expensive by diluting the target companys 
stock the court last week rejected black amp deckers attempt to 
block american standard from seeking such a ruling 
black amp decker also has challenged delawares new antitakeover 
law as unconstitutional 
in addition black amp decker is awaiting regulatory approval to 
begin a maneuver similar to a proxy fight to oust american 
standards board of directors if successful black amp decker could 
repeal the recapitalization and the poison pill

texaco incs agreement to pay the government 
125 billion to settle claims it overcharged customers during the 
197381 era of pricecontrols removes one uncertainty confronting 
the troubled oil giant which has been under federal bankruptcy 
court protection for nearly a year 
but the thirdlargest us oil company still faces a complicated 
exit process from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a 3 billion 
payment to pennzoil co a possible takeover fight with two well 
known corporate raiders and a backtax bill of up to 65 billion 
from the internal revenue service 
under the overchargedispute settlement announced tuesday with 
the energy department texaco will pay the first installment 
totaling 400 million with the rest to be paid over 5 years it 
is one of the largest settlements ever reached between the 
government and a company 
james w kinnear texacos president said in a statement that 
the company had set aside reserves for such a contingency and it 
would have no impact on earnings 
kinnear also said the settlement would free texaco from what he 
called a costly and timeconsuming legal process and enable the 
company to concentrate its efforts on getting out of chapter 11 
federal bankruptcy protection 
the company sought bankruptcy court refuge last april because of 
its protracted legal dispute with pennzoil which had won a record 
103 billion judgment against the oil giant from a texas jury that 
ruled texaco unfairly sabotaged pennzoils plan to buy part of 
getty oil co 
in december texaco settled that battle by agreeing to pay 
pennzoil 3 billion cash but the companys efforts to return to 
normal operations have been complicated by disputes over its 
bankruptcy reorganization 
in addition the company faces a possible takeover threat from 
carl c icahn the companys largest shareholder t boone pickens 
another wellknown takeover strategist also has expressed interest 
in buying texaco stock 
texacos problems have been further complicated by the irs 
company officials said last month that the irs had told texaco it 
may owe 65 billion in back taxes because of possible 
undervaluations of oil purchased from saudi arabia from 197981 
some analysts have said texaco would be virtually destroyed if 
it had to come up with that amount but they also speculated the 
final bill would be much lower 
the white plains nybased oil giant is the latest in a line 
of companies forced to relinquish large sums of cash to resolve 
charges they violated pricing restrictions on crude oil and refined 
products during the eightyear period of federal controls 
jack vandenberg a spokesman for the department of energy in 
washington said prior to the texaco settlement it received about 
61 billion in settlement funds he said the department expects to 
collect about 1 billion more to resolve similar claims bringing 
the total to 82 billion 
the government had argued that during the era of price controls 
companies illegally profited by classifying old oil obtained 
from properties producing before 1973 as new oil and selling 
it at higher prices 
texaco had argued that federal regulations defining old and new 
oil were ambiguous but said tuesday that challenging the 
government on this dispute was not worth the effort 
vandenberg said about 15 percent of the 125 billion settlement 
covered refined product price violations with the money destined 
to go into a fund to repay injured parties 
the remaining 85 percent covers crude price violations and a 
fifth of that will go into the injured party fund and the rest will 
be split evenly between the federal government and the states he 
said 
late last year the department of energy extended the deadline 
for injured parties to file claims to june 30 more than 16000 
claims had been filed before the extension 
the agency said at that time that a claim for a million gallons 
of refined products overcharged would mean about 800 coming to the 
claimant 
most of the injured parties are businesses school districts and 
municipalities that kept detailed records of crude oil and refined 
products purchased from oil concerns that the government accused of 
overcharging 
other companies that have paid to settle complaints include 
exxon corp amoco corp shell oil co mobil corp and atlantic 
richfield co

ford motor co said it was able to expand 
its largest automatic transmission plant without interrupting 
production and at less than half the cost of similar projects 
because of worker participation 
it truly was a team approach each plant area analyzed how the 
expansion and quality improvements could be achieved issues were 
discussed openly and plans were refined to reflect the suggestions 
of each team henry nickol general manager of fords 
transmission and chassis division said tuesday 
the 50 million project added 100000 units to the plants 
795000 yearly transmission production while improving quality and 
saving 190 jobs without interrupting the assembly line ford said 
the expansion has helped ease a shortage of automatic 
transmissions for rearwheeldrive cars and trucks particularly 
fords popular fseries pickup that use 49liter sixcylinder 
engines and 50liter v8 engines 
the fseries pickup was the bestselling vehicle in the united 
states in 1986 and 1987 but ford was forced to offer incentives to 
boost sales of manual transmission trucks because it didnt have 
enough automatic transmissions company spokesman rex greenslade 
said 
greenslade said a comparable transmission plant expansion would 
have cost 100 million to 150 million

a finance ministry committee wednesday approved a 
report calling for tougher laws against insider trading on japans 
stock markets where traders say information about companies 
frequently is leaked to selected investors 
the ministrys securities and exchange council approved an 
advisory panels findings including a recommendation that insider 
trading be made a criminal rather than a civil offense it proposed 
that the offense carry a penalty of up to three years in prison and 
a fine of up to 3 million yen or 23000 ministry officials said 
the panel also called for a revision of japans current 
securities and exchange law to specifically prohibit insider 
trading or the use of inside information about companies to profit 
on stock markets 
other recommendations called for an expansion of the ministrys 
investigation powers and a tightening of the definition of actions 
falling under insider trading laws the officials said 
ministry officials now will formulate legislation based on the 
panels recommendations to submit to japans parliament probably 
this spring 
largescale insider trading is limited in japan because of the 
infrequency of corporate takeovers analysts say but leaks of 
information about company developments to certain investors is 
believed to be frequent along with stock manipulation by some 
large brokerages financial sources say 
japans markets are dominated by four large securities firms 
nomura nikko daiwa and yamaichi creating a climate favorable to 
market manipulation 
the advisory panel began forming its recommendations about two 
months ago after allegations of stock sales by officials at a 
chemical company shortly before it announced bankruptcy news 
reports said 
implementation of the recommendations will make japan the last 
major industrialized country to adopt such regulations the japan 
broadcasting corp nhktv reported 
the panel said insider trading restrictions should apply to 
employees and others inside companies that issue stocks to 
underwriting securities firms lawyers and certified public 
accountants and to reporters that have access to sensitive 
information 
the report also recommended that securities firms be required to 
report the stock ownership of large stockholders 
the changes are not likely to take effect before the summer of 
1989 because of a oneyear notice period necessary for the 
strengthened criminal penalties officials said

year compared with 633 million pounds or 112 billion in 1986 
included in the 1986 figure was a onetime gain of 21 million

reflect a credible performance said chairman john quinton

the quality of ldc debt by making further provisions the impact on 
our capital has been comfortably absorbed

subsidiary reported a loss of 11 million pounds or 19 million

the nations foreign trade deficit edged down to 402 billion 
in the final three months of 1987 pressured lower by a 6 percent 
boost in us overseas sales the commerce department reported 
today 
in the previous quarter the gap had hit a record 404 billion 
while the year finished with an overall record 1593 billion 
deficit calculated on a balanceofpayments basis 
the new figures confirmed a yearend narrowing of the trade 
shortfall that already had shown up in the departments monthly 
merchandise trade reports 
those parallel figures showed a 43 billion deficit for the 
fourth quarter and a 1719 deficit for all of 1987 
todays figures are smaller because they subtract factors such 
as the cost of shipping insurance and military sales from the 
monthly numbers 
the balanceofpayments deficit is also adjusted for seasonal 
variations while the monthly merchandise figures are not 
exports increased 39 billion or 6 percent in the final 
quarter of 1987 to 691 billion bolstered by the weakening 
dollar which made us goods more pricecompetitive overseas 
the report came one day after federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan said he did not forsee a recession or heightened 
inflation this year 
greenspan made his assessment in testimony tuesday before 
congress where he appeared unperturbed by a commerce department 
report that orders for socalled big ticket americanmade 
durable goods fell 28 percent in january 
the fed chief who wields enormous control over interest rates 
and the supply of money said the risk of a recession is about 
equal to the risk of renewed inflation but he agreed with the 
reagan administration that neither appears imminent 
the remarks by the head of the nations central bank were seen 
as inconclusive by the financial markets 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials lost 117 points to 
203912 while the price of the key 30year treasury bond rose 
about 750 for every 1000 in face value the dollar was lower 
against most major foreign currencies 
the decline in orders to us factories for durable goods 
reflected a return to more normal levels of demand for aircraft and 
primary metals the commerce department said 
the steep decline only the third setback in the past 13 months 
was the biggest since an 8 percent drop in january 1987 the latest 
figures followed a big december advance of 41 percent the 
strongest rise since march 
the numbers that were released on durable goods if one 
subtracts some of the temporary fluctuations were really quite 
strong greenspan said during an appearance before the house 
banking committee 
delivering the feds semiannual report on monetary policy to 
congress greenspan took pointed exception to the economic 
philosophies espoused by chief white house economist beryl sprinkel 
if the fed had let the nations money supply grow to the extent 
sprinkel would have liked it would have spawned an unduly 
inflationary environment greenspan told the house committee 
analysts suggested that greenspans testimony did not signal any 
imminent fed action on interest rates 
he left himself a lot of room to either tighten or loosen 
said david wyss chief financial economist for data resources inc 
wyss said there are signs that the fed does not know what it 
wants to do yet it is seeing some very conflicting signals from 
the economy and it wants to leave itself as much room to react as 
it can

a federal judges landmark ruling 
that occidental chemical corp was liable for the cost of cleaning 
up love canal strengthens antipollution laws nationwide a federal 
official says 
after nine years deliberations judge john curtin ruled tuesday 
that occidental was responsible because wastes generated by the 
companys plant were stored in a way that would eventually result 
in leakage 
a trial expected to start in 1990 will determine the amount of 
damages but state and federal officials say 200 million has 
already been spent on the cleanup and estimate that 50 million 
more will be required 
the judge ruled in a 1979 lawsuit filed by the federal 
environmental protection agency in 1978 earlier toxic chemicals 
at love canal prompted state officials to evacuate children and 
pregnant women and eventually 728 families of those 175 families 
are still waiting to learn whether it is safe to return 
curtins ruling upheld the federal comprehensive environmental 
response compensation and liability act of 1980 the judge said 
that law was designed to compel the waste disposal industry to 
correct its past mistakes and to provide a solution for the dangers 
posed by inactive abandoned waste sites 
this will strengthen environmental laws throughout the 
country roger j marzulla head of the us justice departments 
land and natural resources division said in washington 
frank ashley a spokesman for occidentals parent company 
occidental petroleum based in los angeles said the company did 
not agree with the decision and would appeal 
the decision which has just been issued on partial summary 
judgment without a trial and without any factual determination 
that occidental had acted negligently or with fault contradicts the 
resolution of these problems by amicable adjustments reached in 
other actions involving occidental chemical corp ashley said 
the law entitles a judge to determine the issue of liability 
and the next stage of the case is a trial to determine the amount 
of damages said martin littlefield assistant us attorney for 
the buffalo district 
in its motions occidental had challenged that procedure 
about 1300 former residents of the love canal neighborhood 
accepted a 20 million damage settlement with occidental in 1984 
the eventual amount occidental pays will depend on costs proved 
in court and assessed by the judge us attorney roger williams 
staff said that 200 million has been spent so far and it is 
estimated that there will be 50 million more in costs 
lois gibbs a former love canal resident who runs the citizens 
clearing house for hazardous wastes in alexandria va said she 
hopes the company will be found liable for the full 250 million 
that will at least make them blink gibbs said 
the company said it was covered by insurance and that the 
expenses would not adversely affect its finances 
occidental contended that it was not responsible for the 
landfill because hooker chemicals and plastics co which was later 
acquired by occidental in 1968 yielded ownership to the niagara 
falls school board in 1953 the board built a school on the grounds 
occidental said the construction project broke a clay seal on 
the dump and allowed the chemicals to leach into the environment 
the company acknowledged that hooker dumped 20000 tons of chemical 
wastes into the canal during the late 1940s and early 50s 
littlefield assistant us attorney for the buffalo district 
said tuesdays decision was a great victory for the state because 
it means companies are indeed responsible for what theyve done in 
years past 
state attorney general robert abrams said the decision was a 
resounding defeat for occidentals strenuous and expensive public 
relations campaign to shift the entire blame for love canal 
curtins ruling does however allow occidental to sue other 
parties the chemical giant contends should share the 
responsibility the company is expected to countersue the state 
the city of niagara falls and its school board 
nunzio loverdi president of the love canal environmental action 
committee said i think occidental should accept the decision 
and not take action against the city and school board because if it 
does we will all suffer we want to get on with our lives and put 
this behind us

a federal judge has rejected black amp 
decker corps request to block delawares new corporate 
antitakeover law but did not rule on the constitutionality of the 
statute 
us district judge joseph j longobardi on tuesday rejected 
black amp deckers request for an injunction against the law which 
it contended was hindering its attempt to acquire american standard 
corp 
black amp decker a power tool and household appliance maker based 
in towson md has a hostile 68 a share or 212 billion tender 
offer outstanding for american standard which is based in new york 
but incorporated in delaware 
american standard had rejected two previous black amp decker 
offers and proposed a defensive recapitalization that analysts 
have valued at between 68 and 71 a share 
american standard rose 50 cents to 6875 a share in early new 
york stock exchange trading black amp decker dipped 50 cents to 
1887 
delawares new antitakeover law was enacted on feb 2 and 
immediately was challenged as unconstitutional by black amp decker 
black amp decker also claimed shareholders of american standard 
an airconditioning plumbing and building products company were 
confused by the law and reluctant to tender their shares 
but longobardi rejected the request for an injunction he ruled 
black amp decker hadnt shown it would suffer irreparable harm under 
the law and therefore would not rule on its constitutionality 
such a gratuitous discussion of the constitutionality of the 
statute could be used to upset the balance between the parties in 
the quest for their respective positions longobardi said of the 
takeover battle 
the court also noted that black amp decker was attempting to take 
control of the american standard board and if successful then 
could exempt the company from the law 
the boards of directors of delaware corporations have 90 days 
from the laws enactment to exempt their companies 
under the law any shareholder who acquires more than 15 percent 
of a companys stock is prohibited for three years from entering a 
business combination that would allow the stockholder to acquire 
the firm 
if a takeover is launched before the law is triggered the 
bidder would have to acquire 85 percent of the outstanding shares 
in a single transaction to complete the merger 
john f geer vice president of american standard said the 
company was gratified by the decision richard l templeton 
delawares assistant secretary of state said he was encouraged 
by the decision

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
today that he had objected quite strongly to an instance of 
political pressure from the reagan administration and warned that 
further pressure on the central bank could be counterproductive 
greenspan said his protest was sparked by a letter written in 
january by michael darby assistant treasury secretary for economic 
affairs 
greenspan was questioned about the letter by sen william 
proxmire dwis who said the letter was one of a series of recent 
attempts by the reagan administration to pressure the fed to lower 
interest rates as a way of spurring economic growth during a 
presidential election year 
i think it is both deplorable and counterproductive for the 
reagan administration to pressure you as much as they have in 
recent months proxmire the chairman of the senate banking 
committee told greenspan 
greenspan said that he had a disagreement with both darby and 
beryl sprinkel the presidents chief economic adviser over the 
matter of money growth 
he said that while disagreements over policy were acceptable he 
was concerned about the manner in which the administrations 
criticism could be perceived by financial markets 
when i heard about dr darbys letter i objected quite 
strongly as best as i could determine he was not aware of the 
implications greenspan said i am reasonably sure such an 
action will not occur in the future 
greenspan said his concern was that the letter was sent in the 
weeks before a key meeting where top fed officials were going to 
set monetary targets for the next year 
greenspan did not say with whom he raised his objections 
although it has been reported that treasury secretary james baker 
was instrumental in toning down criticism of the fed in the 
economic report of the president before it was released last week 
greenspan said he fully expected to have policy disputes with 
this administration and the next administration but he added 
the only thing i hope that does not happen is that the concern 
over political pressure gets so extraordinary that we end up taking 
actions in the opposite direction just to prove that the fed is 
independent 
greenspans comments on political pressure came during the 
second day of his congressional testimony on the feds economic 
outlook and monetary targets for 1988 
in his appearance tuesday before the house banking committee 
greenspan had also been critical of sprinkels monetary arguments 
in the presidents report sprinkel suggested that tightfisted 
fed policies were partly to blame for the collapse of the stock 
market on oct 19 
sprinkel is a proponent of monetarism the theory that 
steady growth in the money supply is esential to economic growth 
the presidents report noted that the money supply expanded very 
slowly last year below the targets set by the federal reserve 
one measure of the money supply m2 grew just 4 percent in 
1987 the slowest increase in almost three decades the advance was 
even below the rate of inflation something that has occurred only 
three previous times in each of those instances a recession 
followed 
asked about this greenspan contended that money growth was 
influenced by special factors last year and that traditional 
relationships between money growth and economic activity have 
broken down since banking deregulation created a host of new types 
of savings accounts 
greenspan said that he and sprinkel had a difference of 
opinion on this particular issue he argued that the central bank 
could not have allowed the money supply to grow more rapidly 
without creating an unduly inflationary environment 
private economists generally gave greenspan high marks for his 
testimony contending that he steered the proper course between 
concern about inflation and concern about economic growth 
in setting monetary targets for 1988 the fed expanded the 
distance between the lowpoint and highpoint of acceptable growth 
by a full percentage point saying it was now aiming for m2 growth 
of between 4 percent and 8 percent 
this money growth will be enough to support economic growth this 
year of between 2 percent and 25 percent as measured by the gross 
national product the fed said in its economic outlook this would 
be in the range of the 24 percent gnp growth being forecast by the 
administration 
greenspan left himself a lot of room to ither tighten or 
loosen said david wyss chief financial economist of data 
resources inc the fed is seeing some very conflicting signals 
about the economy and it wants to leave itself as much room to 
react as it can 
greenspan confirmed in his testimony that the fed in an effort 
to keep the recovery alive had taken a small easing step a few 
weeks ago many analysts had suggested that the fed had eased 
slightly based on the fact that a variety of interest rates 
including mortgage rates have dropped sharply in the past six 
weeks 
greenspan said that currently he believed the risks of a 
recession or accelerating inflation were about equal and said he 
agreed with the administrations view that neither appeared 
imminent 
he said that it was still too early to assess the full impact of 
last years stock market collapse but there are very few signs 
that we are about to tilt over into a recession

general motors corp said today it will 
restore 1900 jobs at its van nuys calif plant on march 14 by 
putting both shifts back to work six weeks earlier than expected 
the announcement came as gm indicated it will be recalling about 
8600 workers nationwide to produce an extra 175000 cars and 
trucks annually 
the night shift at the van nuys plant was elminated feb 15 
because gm had too much unsold inventory of the pontiac firebirds 
and chevrolet camaros assembled there 
at the time gm said it expected the plant would operate with 
only one shift until at least may 2 or until the inventory was 
reduced 
in a unique experiment that had run into stiff resistance among 
senior workers all 3800 of the plants hourly workers were 
affected with half being off for two weeks at a time then 
returning to their jobs while the others were furloughed for two 
weeks 
the staggeredlayoff system was to have continued at least until 
may 2 or longer if necessary gm said 
similar systems of staggered layoffs have been tested elsewhere 
in the gm system but at van nuys the plan had to be approved in a 
vote by workers 
the vote was required because when the workers agreed in 1986 to 
adopt japanesestyle work rules to speed production and cut costs 
the company agreed to negotiate with the union to ease any impact 
from changes in staffing levels 
in an initial vote the plan was defeated by eight votes but 
after some maneuvering the union agreed to hold a second vote and 
to do it at the plant so more workers with less seniority could 
cast ballots the plan was approved on the second vote despite 
grumbling by older workers that making all workers take part in the 
furloughs was an attack on seniority rights 
the camaros and firebirds produced at the van nuys plant have 
been plagued for some time with slow sales when gm announced plans 
for the layoffs earlier this year the companys inventory of the 
two cars was well in excess of 100 days meaning it would take that 
long at existing sales rates to dispose of alreadyassembled cars 
normally gm operates with about a 60day inventory on its 
various models 
with both shifts operating the van nuys plant produces about 
800 of the two car models daily

obviously im quite disappointed by the outcome but were 
going to go back and put it back together and go on he said 
he said the umw will look for other ways to expand 
trumka said the apparent sticking point for the ocaw board was 
the umws inability to guarantee there would be no dues increases 
during its next regularly scheduled constitutional convention in 
1990 
trumka said he cannot control what the delegates will do and 
therefore i consider it a closed deal 
the ocaw board voted late tuesday to reject the merger proposal 
theres a decision from ocaw not to go forward spokesman 
rod rogers said late tuesday night i dont know that that sets 
everything in concrete but thats where it stands for now 
a news conference had been tentatively set for this morning to 
announce the merger but the ocaw backed out after meeting with umw 
leaders most of tuesday afternoon 
the merger would have bolstered the strength of the two energy 
workers unions whose memberships have been shrinking throughout 
the last decade 
the umw board has authority to approve a merger without a vote 
of its full membership though rogers said any merger required a 
twothirds majority vote at the ocaw convention in august 
the umw and the ocaw find themselves negotiating with the same 
companies because the major oil companies own the lions share 
of the energy and coal reserves in the united states rogers said 
since 1986 the two unions have been sharing information about 
employers 
the umw once had more than 400000 members but it now has about 
85000 active members about twothirds of the nations working 
miners 
ocaw membership is down by half from a peak of nearly 200000 
members in the early 1970s

the computers and high technology now used to 
search for oil and gas would have been a mystery to anthony lucas 
who relied largely on a hunch to drill the famed 1901 spindletop 
gusher 
there was almost no science at spindletop says dave 
kingston a retired standard oil of new jersey geologist today 
its just the reverse we want to know all we can about a 
prospect before we drill 
using stunning advances in geology geochemistry and other 
disciplines oilmen now analyze a broad range of information in 
searching for unfound storehouses of earths most crucial commodity 
theres no way to relate today to what we had in the past 
says houston oilman michel halbouty the technology has changed 
every day of every year that the industry has been alive 
central to nearly all the developments has been the increasing 
use of computers to sift store and massage massive amounts of data 
among other things computers can generate threedimensional 
views of prospective drill sites based on information from rock 
samples previous drilling and other sources creating hypothetical 
composite pictures of what lies below grassy forested or desert 
surfaces 
in the past the same process has been done with pencil and 
paper said richard d bowden spokesman for energy software inc 
of midland its like comparing the wright brothers to the 
concorde its the same kind of advance 
advances in seismic technology have also aided the search for 
oil says don bennett divisional vice president of exploration and 
production technology division of texaco inc 
by measuring the movement of seismic shock waves through the 
earth scientists can derive clues as to whether the waves are 
traveling through rock sand or possibly unfound oil formations 
since 1968 when plate tectonics the theory that earths 
surface is composed of massive shifting rock plates became widely 
accepted dramatic advances in geology have been made 
what plate tectonics does instead of just hunt and peck here 
and there you now have a unifying theory about how these plates 
were formed said manik talwani director of the geotechnology 
research institute in houston it helps you very much in your 
guessing about which might be good oil provinces 
in addition developments in the complicated science of 
geochemistry have provided clues to locating oil through testing 
sample rocks in the laboratory as have improvements in sensing 
equipment lowered into drill holes to conduct electrical and other 
analyses 
patrick shannon another retired standard oil of new jersey 
geologist now runs his own consulting firm specializing in 
analyzing satellite photos of earth for telltale signs of oil and 
gas deposits 
in addition to being able to see large structural features that 
could hint of oil and gas different kinds of rock and minerals 
often respond differently to varying light and infrared 
frequencies shannon says 
the use of those satellite photos is among the most 
important new technologies that weve got in the business today 
shannon said adding that future satellites may provide even more 
sophisticated data 
most experts agree oil and gas exploration remains a risky 
business fraught with the potential for failure and new techniques 
only help to create a more comprehensive mosaic of information for 
decisionmaking 
its like putting together a jigsaw puzzle burnett said 
you want to get as many pieces as possible 
one reason for burgeoning technology in oil exploration has been 
the huge increase in drilling costs which have risen sharply over 
the past 20 years halbouty says 
whats more most of the biggest deposits of oil and gas in the 
united states have already been found making discoveries of 
smaller more isolated remaining pockets more difficult and more 
important said mel friedman spokesman for the department of 
geosciences at texas aampm university 
in 1901 lucas decided to drill the spindletop gusher on a small 
hill where he and others suspected oil might exist but where a 
number of unsuccessful wells had been drilled 
when the drillers hit a huge reserve of oil a gusher of black 
gold shot hundreds of feet into the air igniting the legendary 
texas oil boom 
during the 1950s and 1960s kingston and shannon roamed the 
globe as geologists for standard oil using what might now be 
considered rudimentary tools and techniques 
kingston takes a somewhat skeptical view of many advances 
the same guy who finds oil with a computer is the same guy who 
can find oil without the computer kingston said a geologist 
with his hammer and his eyes and his brain is far superior to 
anything else 
today there are about 150 kinds of maps and studies that can 
be run in a certain area to study the geology but there are only 
10 or 12 that are really necessary kingston said the rest are 
just window dressing 
for kingston technology can only aid human intuition which 
remains the primary key to finding hidden treasure troves of oil 
and gas 
an analogy would be reading a mystery novel with half the 
pages torn out you have to guess about what is in there 
kingston said

general motors corp said wednesday it boosted 
1988 production plans by 175000 cars and trucks and will recall 
8600 laidoff workers and reopen a temporarily closed assembly 
plant 
the strengthening demand for gm vehicles reflects the ongoing 
product quality improvements resulting from plant modernization and 
employee involvement programs gm president robert stempel said 
in a statement 
this combined with very competitive retail incentive programs 
has increased the value of gm products he said 
gm will increase production by running some plants particularly 
for trucks on overtime restoring second shifts at two us plants 
and one in canada and reopening its closed framingham mass 
assembly plant 
at the three plants where gm had dropped the second shift 
workers from both shifts were sharing jobs by alternating between 
two weeks on layoff and two weeks on the job gm said 
the framingham assembly plant which gm closed abruptly nov 30 
will reopen may 9 on one shift with 2000 of its 3700 workers the 
plant will build the oldsmobile cutlass cierra but will not resume 
production of the chevrolet celebrity gm spokeswoman kathy tanner 
said 
gm will restore the second shift at its 
buickoldsmobilecadillac group lansing assembly plant asystem on 
april 11 returning 2000 people to fulltime work the 
4350worker plants builds the oldsmobile cutlass calais and buick 
skylark 
the second shift at gms 4200worker van nuys calif assembly 
plant will be restored march 14 bringing 1900 employees back full 
time the plant which gms only chevrolet camaro and pontiac 
firebird source dropped the second shift last week 
gm also will restore the second shift at its oshawa no 1 plant 
in oshawa ontario bringing back 2700 laidoff workers on march 
21 the plant builds the oldsmobile cierra and pontiac 6000 
meanwhile gm said it would increase production at its cadillac 
plant in the detroit enclave of hamtramck by running its single 
shift on overtime adding 4700 cars between feb 20 and june 1 
cadillac general manager john grettenberger said the increased 
production was necessary because dealers need more of the restyled 
eldorado coupe and seville sedans whose popularity has been 
boosted by availability of a new 45liter v8 engine

united mine workers president richard trumka said 
wednesday he considers the unions failed merger with the oil 
chemical and atomic workers union a closed deal that wont be 
reconsidered 
ocaws executive board on tuesday voted 62 to reject a merger 
that would have created the united mine energy and chemical 
workers of america from the two powerful unions trumka said the 
ocaw board had left open the possibility of reconsidering the 
merger but the umws board voted wednesday to rescind the approval 
it gave on sunday 
i consider it a closed deal trumka told a news conference 
their board was willing to let it go to their constitutional 
convention without a recommendation i flatly rejected that 
ocaw spokesman rod rogers said the unions executive board was 
still involved wednesday in its regular meeting and ocaw president 
joseph misbrener was not immediately available for comment rogers 
said the issue is not necessarily dead 
its always possible there could be a resurrection of the 
idea he said 
there were compelling reasons why this merger was a good idea 
and those reasons havent gone away rogers said this 
particular merger proposal is dead yes but we could take action 
to reinitiate things 
trumka said he was ready to move on however 
ill come back at the next umw board meeting and say that 
didnt work lets try something else trumka said were 
going to pursue a policy of growth for our organization 
trumka said the ocaw board rejected the merger agreement because 
it wanted assurances there would be no dues increase in 1990 
when the first constitutional convention of the combined union 
would have taken place 
there was no way possible i could guarantee that because 
delegates at that convention determine what will happen trumka 
said 
the umw president said he then convened a meeting of his unions 
board which rescinded its earlier approval of the merger 
agreement which contained no provisions for amendment 
trumka said both unions would continue to work together 
especially on negotiations with employers that the two unions have 
in common 
while he plans to look for other ways to expand the umws 
influence trumka said he does not consider it good policy to 
merge just for the sake of merging

dart group corp will continue its billiondollar 
hostile takeover bid for stop amp shop cos inc which is 
negotiating with several other potential buyers a dart spokesman 
said wednesday 
stop amp shop confirmed wednesday it had begun talks with several 
parties considering a buyout of the supermarket and discount store 
chain raising the possibility it might find a white knight 
friendly suitor to thwart dart 
sandy bouzoukis a stop amp shop spokeswoman declined to name the 
parties interested in the braintreebased company 
dart spokesman stanley rubenstein said the landover mdbased 
retailing concern would continue its hostile 37 a share 103 
billion tender offer launched last month dart controls about 27 
percent of stop amp shops 279 million common shares outstanding 
darts position is unchanged it is premature to respond to 
stop amp shop until we know the details of any alternative 
proposal said rubenstein 
stop amp shop rose 237 to 4150 a share wednesday on the new 
york stock exchange 
boston businessman thomas lee reportedly is a possible suitor 
but neither lee nor stop amp shop officials would confirm they were 
in negotiations 
stop amp shop directors rejected darts 37 a share offer earlier 
this month and filed a federal court suit to block the bid 
claiming dart did not fully disclose details of past takeover 
attempts and had failed to register as an investment company with 
the securities and exchange commission 
dart countersued claiming stop amp shop illegally withheld 
corporate information 
us district judge rya zobel ruled tuesday that dart must file 
its claim in norfolk superior court in massachusetts where eight 
separate shareholder suits challenging stop amp shops antitakeover 
measures are awaiting a hearing 
dart has mounted several unsuccessful but profitable hostile 
takeover attempts since selling its washingtonbased drug store 
chain in 1985 
the bid for stop amp shop was darts first since it abandoned a 6 
billion takeover proposal for minneapolisbased dayton hudson corp 
following the oct 19 stock market crash 
dart which owns crown books and trak auto parts stores 
nationwide also has made unsuccessful but profitable attempts to 
gain control of safeway co and supermarkets general 
since 1986 stop amp shop has sold several unprofitable divisions 
including medi mart drug stores and almys department stores and 
laid off about 450 middlelevel workers 
the company operates 113 stop amp shop supermarkets and 169 
bradlees discount department stores

honda motor co ltd posted a 381 percent rise in 
profits in the latest threemonth period even though operating 
income fell the company said tuesday 
net income rose to 2368 billion japanese yen or about 193 
million from 171 billion yen in a corresponding reporting period 
in 1986 
honda is shifting to a new fiscal year so results for the three 
months ended dec 31 1987 were compared with results for the 
period ended nov 30 1986 dollar equivalents were based on an 
exchange rate of 123 yen to the dollar prevailing at the end of 
1987 
revenue rose 205 percent to 7895 billion yen or about 642 
billion from 6553 billion yen a year earlier 
hondas income from operations fell 314 percent to 324 billion 
yen or 263 million in the quarter mainly because of the falling 
value of the dollar which decreases the value of us sales when 
measured in yen 
however hondas net profit rose because of successful 
foreignexchange trading and decreased income taxes among other 
factors the company said

the federal trade commission asked a federal 
appeals court tuesday to stop the merger of two of the nations 
largest manufacturers of glass containers while it appeals a lower 
courts refusal to halt the deal 
the ftc asked the us circuit court of appeals for a 
preliminary injunction to prevent owensillinois inc the nations 
secondlargest glass container manufacturer from acquiring 
brockway inc for 750 million during the appeal 
the ftc which obtained a provisional stay from the appellate 
court on friday contended that us district judge joyce hens 
green erred both factually and legally in holding that the 
merger is not likely to have anticompetitive effects 
the ftc contends that the merger which would create the 
nations largest glass container manufacturer would reduce 
competition and raise the price of bottles jars and other 
containers the companies make for food soft drinks and liquor 
green who last week denied the ftcs bid to stop the merger 
pending administrative proceedings within the agency accepted the 
companies argument that competition from plastic and paper 
packaging would keep down the prices of glass containers 
but the ftc said she disregarded extensive testimony by 
customers accounting for more than 450 million in annual glass 
container purchases that they will not or cannot economically 
switch from glass containers to other package forms 
the agency said greens opinion disregards without 
explanation longestablished legal standards for assessing the 
potential anticompetitive effects of horizontal mergers including 
the significance of market concentration and entry barriers as 
well as extensive customer testimony that prices are likely to rise 
as a result of the merger 
the ftc has stalled the merger since owensillinois based in 
toledo ohio made its tender offer last september to buy brockway 
stock for 60 a share green had granted a temporary restraining 
order halting the merger while she reviewed the case but she 
refused to grant a preliminary injunction 
owensillinois controls 227 percent of the market while 
brockway based in jacksonville fla controls 15 percent of sales

gold futures prices plunged to the lowest level in 11 months 
wednesday possibly reflecting a change in attitude among investors 
who had been expecting a surge in inflation analysts said 
on other markets grain and soybean futures settled mostly 
higher livestock and meat futures were mixed energy futures 
retreated and stockindex futures declined 
wednesday marked the second consecutive day of sharp declines in 
futures prices for gold and other precious metals which had traded 
listlessly in narrow ranges for nearly a month 
tuesdays drop in prices was widely attributed to federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspans prediction that the 1988 us 
inflation rate would average 325 percent to 375 percent a rate 
lower than many market experts had projected 
demand and prices for precious metals typically rise during 
inflationary periods because they tend to hold their value better 
than other investments 
greenspans forecast along a general weakening of commodity 
prices recently may have prompted a shift in attitude among 
investors who feared the worst after the october stock market 
collapse said craig sloane an analyst in new york for smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
it seems to me that the market is getting more encouraged in 
terms of inflation that things are not going to get worse 
sloane said 
he said the confidence greenspan displayed in his testimony 
tuesday before a house banking subcommittee seemed to enhance his 
credibility which in turn may have given the markets more 
confidence 
citibank analyst sharon ziemian said wednesdays selloff of gold 
futures appeared to spread from european markets to the us 
markets including new yorks commodity exchange the countrys 
major market for precious metals futures 
the selling was substantial enough that with only a limited 
amount of buying it pushed the market down dramatically ms 
ziemian said 
on the commodity exchange gold settled 990 to 1390 lower 
with the contract for delivery in april at 43410 a troy ounce 
the contracts lowest price since march 20 1987 silver was 105 
cents to 134 cents lower with march at 6195 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures ended mostly higher in fairly light 
trading on the chicago board of trade 
corn was the most consistent performer showing strength 
throughout the session on rumors that the soviet union had 
purchased as much as 2 million metric tons of us corn overnight 
said dale gustafson an analyst in chicago for drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
the agriculture department announced after the close that the 
soviets had bought 350000 metric tons of us corn 
soybeans lagged for the most of the day but ended mixed on a 
late surge of buying led by campd commodities a major player in the 
soybean pit analysts said 
wheat ended slightly higher on talk of expected new export sales 
to european nations gustafson said 
wheat settled cent to 2 cents higher with march at 317 a 
bushel corn was cent to 2 cents higher with march at 199 a 
bushel oats were unchanged to cent lower with march at 190 a 
bushel soybeans were 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with march at 
624 a bushel 
cattle futures settled mostly higher while pork futures ended 
mixed on the chicago mercantile exchange 
cattle futures were supported by higher cash values but limited 
by sluggish wholesale demand for beef said charlie richardson an 
analyst in denver for lindwaldock amp co 
lower cash prices pressured pork he said 
live cattle settled 20 cent to 43 cent higher with april at 
7220 a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent lower to 45 cent higher 
with march at 8092 cents a pound hogs were 62 cent lower to 45 
cent higher with april at 4412 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 12 cent lower to 47 cent higher with march at 5227 cents a 
pound 
oil prices slipped lower on the new york mercantile exchange on 
technical factors after an early attempt to rally fizzled analysts 
said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 14 cents 
lower with february at 1576 a barrel heating oil was 06 cent to 
52 cent lower with march at 4640 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 15 cent to 55 cent lower with march at 4635 cents a 
gallon 
stockindex futures retreated slightly on the chicago mercantile 
exchange where the contract for march delivery of the standard amp 
poors 500 index settled 30 point lower at 26520 the underlying 
spot index was off 58 point at 26444

gold prices tumbled wednesday as traders 
appeared to take a more optimistic view of chances for continued 
low inflation 
the dollar meanwhile turned in a narrowly mixed performance on 
the worlds foreignexchange markets 
republic national bank of new york quoted a bid price for gold 
of 43280 a troy ounce as of 4 pm est down 870 from tuesdays 
late level 
analysts who follow the precious metals markets said recent 
declines in commodity prices have convinced many traders that 
inflation poses little immediate threat to the economy diminishing 
golds appeal as a hedge against rising prices 
they expect inflation to be moderate to subdued and that gives 
them very little reason to own gold said gary dorsch an analyst 
for lns financial group inc in chicago 
he said some traders have been liquidating tangible assets such 
as gold in anticipation of investing the proceeds in the stock 
market which has shown some strength over the past two weeks 
but jeffrey a nichols president of american precious metals 
advisors inc in new york said the latest decline in gold prices 
simply extends a trend begun late in 1987 reflecting heavier 
supplies in a sluggish market 
he said the soviet union has sold considerable amounts of gold 
and mining companies have become more aggressive about selling 
contracts for what they expect to mine 
at the same time investors have shown little interest in gold 
because of low inflation expectations stable world equity 
markets a strong us bond market and rising confidence in the 
federal reserve board nichols said 
it is not that there has been a massive selloff it is just 
that there is a lack of willingness to buy gold except at lower 
prices he said 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold for current delivery fell 
990 a troy ounce to 43190 
in london gold fell to 43470 a troy ounce from 44250 late 
tuesday in zurich switzerland gold fell to 436 from 442 late 
tuesday 
gold fell to 44420 an ounce in hong kong from 44680 late 
tuesday 
silver bullion fell in london to 626 a troy ounce from 633 
late tuesday latewr on new yorks comex silver for current 
delivery fell 10 cents an ounce to 619 
in the foreignexchange markets the dollar traded in a narrow 
range for most of the day ending mixed against the worlds major 
currencies 
dealers said traders were anxiously awaiting the scheduled 
release on thursday of revised figures on the us gross national 
product for the fourth quarter they said the consensus was that 
the growth rate would be revised upward from earlier estimates 
dorsch said the dollar drew some support from federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspans remarks to a congressional panel that 
he was not in favor of driving the dollar lower to increase 
exports 
but the dollar wound up lower in new york against the japanese 
canadian italian and british currencies while it edged up against 
those of west germany france and switzerland 
in tokyo the dollar rose to 12875 japanese yen from 12850 yen 
late tuesday later in london the dollar traded at 12857 yen the 
dollar slipped to 12882 yen in new york from 12900 yen late

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on 
wednesday criticized what he said was administration pressure for 
lower interest rates but president reagan denied knowledge of such 
an effort and voiced support for the fed chairman 
in congressional testiony greenspan had cautioned that further 
white house efforts to influence the central bank could boomerang 
he referred in particular to a letter written by a treasury 
department official pleading for easier credit 
asked at his wednesday night news conference about greenspans 
complaint and whether he still had confidence in greenspan reagan 
replied yes i do and im going to have to find out what this is 
all about that youre talking about because nothing of that kind 
had been directed to me 
greenspan who was appointed to the fed post by reagan last 
summer issued his warning as the administration sought to dampen 
its dispute with the central bank 
beryl sprinkel the presidents chief economic adviser said the 
administration currently is delighted with monetary policy 
greenspan in testimony before the senate banking committee was 
highly critical of a letter sent by assistant treasury secretary 
michael darby to top fed policymakers 10 days before they were to 
meet to set monetary growth targets for 1988 
the fed tries to supply enough money to the economy to support 
sustained growth while guarding against overdoing money creation 
and thus reigniting inflation both darby and srinkel have 
complained that the money supply grew so sluggishly in 1987 that it 
raised concerns about a possible recession during this election 
year 
the darby letter was brought up in questioning by sen william 
proxmire dwis who cited it as just one of numerous examples of 
administration pressure on the fed while proxmire did not release 
the text of darbys letter the senator said the clear implication 
was that the administration was pressuring the fed to ease up on 
the money 
he said darbys letter to each member of the federal open market 
committee was the most overt effort he had ever seen on the part of 
the administration to influence fed decisionmaking 
i think it is both deplorable and counterproductive for the 
reagan administration to pressure you as much as they have in 
recent months proxmire said 
greenspan said while the central bank was not being unduly 
influenced by the administration he was worried about the 
perceptions in financial markets 
the only thing that i hope does not happen is that the concern 
of our responding to political pressures gets so extraordinary that 
we will feel the necessity to do precisely the opposite 
greenspan said 
greenspan said when i heard about dr darbys letter i 
objected quite strongly as best i can judge he was not aware of 
the implications of doing this just prior to an fomc meeting 
greenspan indicated he had received assurances that there would 
be no repeat of the darby letter 
greenspan and the other four members of the federal reserve 
board were all appointed by president reagan the first time one 
president has named all members of the board since franklin 
roosevelt there is one vacancy 
the normal fed term is 14 years a tenure designed to insulate 
the board from political pressures and also make it harder for one 
president to name all the board members 
proxmire said the current situation was raising concerns that 
the central bank would bend to administration pressure and boost 
money growth so much during this election year that the country 
would suffer another round of debilitating inflation in 1989 
greenspan did not say which administration official he contacted 
concerning the darby letter but it has been reported that treasury 
secretary james a baker iii was instrumental in toning down 
criticism of the fed in the economic report of the president issued 
last week 
sprinkel in a separate appearance wednesday before the house 
budget committee said that while he believed the fed had been too 
stingy in supplying money to the economy last year things have 
improved in the past six weeks 
since that time weve been delighted with monetary policy 
sprinkel said theyre dedicated to a policy of moderate 
expansion they have the power to do it and im confident they 
will do it

slightly a few weeks ago in an effort to keep the economic
