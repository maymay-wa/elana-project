a federal judge dismissed new charges against 
a figure in the defense industry probe friday saying a second 
indictment was an act of revenge because the man was appealing his 
conviction on earlier charges 
thomas e muldoon a former consultant to norden systems 
already had been convicted on eight felonies including conspiracy 
and bribery of a public official soon after his attorney filed an 
appeal on that conviction muldoon was indicted on charges of 
trafficking in secret defense information 
us district judge albert v bryan jr in alexandria va 
wrote that there was a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness on 
the part of the united states in causing the return of the present 
indictment in retaliation for the defendant thomas e muldoons 
going to trial or noting an appeal for his prior conviction or 
both 
muldoon 60 was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined 
10000 for his conviction arising from the investigation of fraud 
in defense procurement code named ill wind 
muldoons lawyer albert j ahern jr told the washington post 
that the second indictment against his client was to send a message 
to other defendants in the case to take the plea agreement as 
tendered or face a splitting of the charges and multicount 
indictments as the certain consequence

a mistrial was declared friday in the bank 
fraud trial of us rep harold ford after the jury said it was 
hopelessly deadlocked 
the congressman was accused of taking political favors in the 
form of loans that prosecutors said he was never expected to repay 
to tennessee banking brothers jake and ch butcher jr 
jury foreman ho robinson reported the deadlock after us 
district judge odell horton removed one of the 12 panel members for 
failing to disclose a past felony conviction that development did 
not figure in the mistrial 
ford a 44yearold memphis democrat had been on trial since 
feb 12 on charges of conspiracy bank and mail fraud a conviction 
could have brought a sentence of up to 95 years 
the congressman said he regarded the mistrial as a victory 
though he had hoped for acquittal 
im hopeful now that i can put this episode behind me ford 
said 
but us attorney john gill in knoxville said there would be 
another trial 
the only thing i can say is we had a case we felt we were 
obligated to bring based on the evidence we had gill said 
ford stood trial with former butcher accountant david crabtree 
and former butcher lawyers karl schledwitz and douglas beaty 
ford the states only black member of congress has complained 
often since his indictment that he is the victim of racist 
prosecutors an allegation the government has denied 
the government called 29 witnesses in the case the defense did 
not call any and ford said he decided not to testify because he 
regarded the governments case as weak 
on wednesday after their first two days of deliberations 
jurors returned to the courtroom to report they were deadlocked 
horton told them it was too early to give up work 
before the mistrial was declared friday assistant us attorney 
dan clancy asked horton to question juror juanita ruffin because 
the government believed she had a criminal record that she did not 
disclose during jury selection 
every juror picked for the trial signed a form on which they 
answered a variety of questions including whether they had ever 
been convicted of a crime 
horton confronted mrs ruffin in the courtroom about her record 
and she acknowledged she had been convicted in 1970 in connection 
with the theft of 160 she said she was placed on probation for 
that felony offense 
mrs ruffin also said she was convicted twice for shoplifting in 
the 1970s 
horton asked her why she didnt disclose the felony conviction 
during jury selection she said she thought she didnt have to 
because the offenses occurred more than 10 years earlier 
while being questioned mrs ruffin said the jury was split on 
reaching a verdict by a vote of 93 she did not say if that vote 
was in favor of acquittal or conviction 
the jury was down to 11 members when the mistrial was declared 
but lawyers said the judge could have allowed the deliberations to 
continue 
first elected to congress in 1974 ford has faced little 
opposition since then for his 9th congressional district seat 
he was charged with 19 criminal counts in an indictment handed 
down by a grand jury in knoxville in 1987 
his codefendants accused of helping him get and hde butcher 
money faced charges of conspiracy and mail fraud five counts for 
crabtree and 16 each for beaty and schledwitz 
ch butcher jr was brought to a nearby jail in wynne ark 
but was never asked to testify he and jake a twotime candidate 
for tennessee governor are serving 20year prison terms for bank 
fraud 
the 1983 collapse of their banking chain was one of the worst in 
us financial history 
the government said ford and his family drew butcher loans 
totaling more than 1 million between 1976 and 1982 but ford put 
the total at 650000 he said those debts were settled

abcs twin peaks is continuing its downward 
slide in the ratings despite being one of tvs most writtenabout 
new shows this year nielsen audience estimates showed friday 
ratings for thursdays episode showed that it was seen in nine 
million fewer homes than the twohour april 8 premiere of the david 
lynch series the premiere was seen in more than 194 million homes 
and ranked fifth nationally in ratings for that week 
although its 113 rating made the show second in ratings in its 
onehour time period thursday it only drew 18 percent of the

nbcs cheers and wings easily beat twin peaks on 
thursday averaging a 194 rating cbs falcon crest was a 
distant third with an 81 average each ratings point represents 
921000 homes 
twin peaks a surreal soap opera set in the pacific 
northwest has been acclaimed by most critics but it also has 
steadily lost audiences each week since its muchpublicized 
premiere 
i think whats happening is that the show is solidifying 
around its core audience of young adults said alan wurtzel 
senior vice president for research at abc he said he thought its 
ratings will stabilize now 
the show has lost most of its viewers in two categories women 
over 50 and men over 35 he said 
but it also has lost occasional viewers of television who may 
have watched the show becase of all the hype and word of mouth 
about the series he said i think what youre seeing is the 
inevitable shakeout 
although the twin peaks premiere did much better than abc 
had expected to a certain extent im disappointed that it didnt 
hold the higher numbers in episodes shown afterwards he said

a 15yearold girl who said she was 
kidnapped chained to a tree and raped repeatedly for three weeks 
told police she escaped and killed her captor with his own shotgun 
while he slept 
her escape prompted a search friday for remains of two other 
missing girls after police found a crudely drawn map suggesting two 
girls had been killed and dismembered 
the map was discovered at the larue county campsite of phillip 
e clopton 39 of louisville who was found dead thursday after 
the louisville girl called the state police from a store several 
miles away 
kentucky state police detective robert foster said the girl who 
shot clopton initially had left louisville with him willingly 
but there obviously came time when she wanted to get away 
foster said 
the girls 18yearold sister however told the courierjournal 
of louisville that her sister was abducted 
she didnt run away her sister said everybody thought 
she ran away but she didnt 
another man 41yearold james r cable was arrested thursday 
night in louisville and charged with firstdegree rape and sodomy 
in connection with the case cable was being held in the larue 
county jail under 250000 bond on each count 
edlin said cable wasnt suspected in the killings but may have 
distributed the body parts his relationship with clopton who had 
been previously imprisoned for sodomy and rape was not immediately 
clear 
a journal found at the campsite chronicled at least three 
homicides in jefferson county located about 50 miles 
northeast of the search area said state police lt wayne edwards 
it contained some names of missing juveniles he said 
the louisville girl who was returned to her father told police 
she had been held against her will for three weeks chained to a 
tree and raped repeatedly 
the girl said she took a shotgun while the man slept in a tent 
and killed him with a single shot to the head 
a police report didnt indicate how she freed herself said 
larue county sheriff merle edlin 
apparently he didnt keep her chained at all times edlin 
said i think she stayed there under threats under fear for her 
life 
authorities unsuccessfully searched a threecounty area in 
central kentucky on friday for the bodies of the two other missing 
girls 
they tried to follow a map roughly sketched in pen on a piece of 
typing paper with the girls names and the spots in which various 
body parts supposedly were buried 
the task was difficult because the map was not too detailed 
and covered areas in larue nelson and hardin counties edlin said 
at the campsite friday police found two footlockers full of 
canned goods and other supplies and a makeshift toilet a nearby 
creek served as a cooler there were also cooking supplies 
sleeping bags clothing and survival books

assassinated colombias government refused friday to put off next 
months election and vowed to keep up the fight against drug 
traffickers 
a telefaxed communique purportedly from the medellin drug 
cartel denied responsibility friday for the assassination of 
presidential candidate carlos pizarro who died in a hail of 
bullets thursday aboard a colombian jetliner carrying 97 people 
but on thursday within hours of pizarros assassination a man 
had called the national radio network station caracol and related 
in detail how the cartel had allegedly ordered the former 
guerrillas killing 
the authenticity of neither claim could be verified that is not 
the first time there have been contradictory communiques verbal 
and faxed claiming and and then denying responsibility for 
assassinations and terrorist acts 
fridays telefax accused police of instigating violence in order 
to force the government to continue its crackdown on traffickers 
and accused the police of putting out false communiques purported 
to be from the cartel 
the august assassination of another candidate sen luis carlos 
galan of the governing liberal party prompted the government to 
launch a usbacked crackdown on colombias cocaine cartels 
since then drug traffickers have killed more than 230 people 
including judges politicians policemen soldiers newspaper 
employees and two other presidential candidates 
leaders of the leftist patriotic union party whose candidate 
was slain last month urged the government to cancel the may 27 
vote 
but interior minister horacio serpa told reporters friday that 
the elections will not be postponed or canceled in a televised 
speech late thursday serpa said the government will fight 
terrorists without rest 
on friday thousands of men women and children filed past 
pizarros coffin displayed in an open patio in the congress 
building supporters of pizarros m19 movement burned buses and 
threw rocks at police in clashes in several cities 
hundreds of leftist guerrillas belonging to the m19 rebel group 
laid down their arms last month and formed a political party with 
pizarro as its presidential candidate government officials had 
said pizarro could have helped mediate peace agreements with other 
leftist insurgents 
governing party candidate cesar gaviria the presidential 
frontrunner suspended campaign activities following the pizarro 
killing in a radio interview he condemned the killing as another 
act by powerful organizations trying to impose an empire of 
evil and crime 
the other candidates are alvaro gomez hurtado and rodrigo 
lloreda both of the conservative party 
gomez suggesting that barco does not have the confidence of 
colombias military urged the president friday to name a threeman 
council to run colombias security forces he said such a move 
would help ensure peace in the last month of the presidential 
campaign 
barco through a spokesman rejected the proposal 
the patriotic unions presidential candidate bernardo 
jaramillo was fatally wounded march 22 at the bogota airport by an 
assassin with a machine gun 
pizarros killer 25yearold alvaro rodriguez was sitting two 
rows behind pizarro on the flight and apparently retrieved the 
machine gun from an airplane bathroom before returning to his seat 
capt fabio munevar told caracol 
minutes later he stood up pulled the weapon from his black 
leather jacket leaned forward and fired at pizarros head from 
about a foot away munevar said pizarros bodyguards immediately 
killed the assassin 
the plane en route to the caribbean coastal city of 
barranquilla returned immediately to bogota pizarro died about an 
hour later at a hospital the bogota morgue said he was struck by 
13 bullets 
two men with machine guns were arrested at barranquilla airport 
a police spokesman there said they apparently were part of an 
assassination squad with orders to kill pizarro if he survived the 
flight police said 
in another development church officials in medellin said they 
had foiled a plan to kill colombias roman catholic prelate 
cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo

education officials approved a plan for 
rewriting new yorks elementary and highschool history lessons to 
include more about the contributions of minority americans 
the plan calls for appointment of a 20member committee of 
academics and others to decide on such matters as teacher 
retraining and selection of textbooks for the nations 
thirdlargest public school system 
it was approved friday by the state board of regents at the 
request of education commissioner thomas sobol who said his staff 
has already held talks with educators in other states about 
approaching textbook publishers 
the board approved the idea of rewriting the history curriculum 
in february and on friday endorsed sobols blueprint for getting 
the job done by 1992 
the vote followed more of the acrimonious debate that erupted 
following release last summer of a report by another 
sobolappointed committee which charged the states textbooks were 
filled with hidden assumptions of white supremacy 
that report said new yorks history courses minimize the 
contributions of minorities and largely ignore the wrongs committed 
against nonwhites by whites one of the reasons minority children 
do poorly in school is because they dont read about their 
ancestors in history texts the report said 
without naming the review committee sobol set strict guidelines 
on who it would include elementary middle and high school 
teachers school administrators department heads college 
professors and scholars in social studies 
committee members will be appointed on the basis of racial and 
ethnic diversity sobol said the 17member committee that 
delivered the original critique of states curriculum included one 
white member 
one regent former teacher adelaide sanford of new york city 
worried that the new committee would water down recommendations 
made by last summers task force she accused the regents of 
retreating from a commitment to wipe bias from schools because of 
concern about inflammatory language in the report 
a representative of new york states largest teachers union 
urged a careful approach to the rewrite 
i have grave concerns that we maintain the theory that we as 
americans share a common culture said antonia cortese first 
vice president of new york state united teachers our very basis 
for a democracy is tolerance for other people its not 
separatism 
the regents approved the plan on a unanimous voice vote sanford 
sat silent 
sobol said in february that he had begun discussions with 
educators in other states including california about presenting a 
common front in requesting changes from textbook publishers ahead 
of new york texas has the nations largest school system and

some members of congress upset over president 
bushs removal of japan from a hit list of unfair traders are 
introducing legislation to take away the presidents discretion in 
the matter 
the bill is just one example of the firestorm created by the 
administrations decision friday to remove japan from a list of 
countries deemed to have erected the most offensive barriers to the 
sale of us products 
sen robert byrd dwva took to the senate floor to declare 
that he was thunderstruck by the action 
excuse me mr president but this boggles the mind he 
said letting japan off the hook is a serious mistake and i think 
congress ought to take a look at it 
the dispute involves the toughest section of the 1988 trade law 
known as super 301 it required the administration to target 
countries in 1989 and 1990 for intensive negotiations aimed at 
removing trade barriers 
if the negotiations were unsuccessful then the administration 
had the power to retaliate with higher us tariffs on imports from 
the offending country 
last year the administration named japan brazil and india but 
this year bush said he was retaining only india because of that 
countrys refusal to remove its barriers to foreign investment and 
foreign insurance companies 
the administration dropped japan and brazil from the list 
because of marketopening moves they have made 
while the super 301 provision was due to expire after this year 
several members of congress said they planned to push for it to be 
extended indefinitely thus forcing the administration to face the 
question of targeting japan in future years 
two senators democrat carl levin of michigan and republican 
arlen specter of pennsylvania said they planned to introduce a 
bill taking away the administrations discretion over whether to 
target japan 
their measure would require the president to target any country 
for negotiations if its trade surplus accounted for 15 percent or 
more of americas overall trade deficit 
last year that provision would have only applied to japan 
americas 49 billion deficit with japan accounted for 45 percent 
of the total us trade deficit of 109 billion 
owen bieber president of the united auto workers supported a 
move to limit the presidents discretion saying that the 
administrations decision friday added insult to injury by 
reaching the preposterous conclusion that japan suddenly deserves a 
clean bill of trade health 
but the administration defended its action saying that 
targeting tokyo again would have undermined the efforts of japanese 
prime minister toshiki kaifu to reform his countrys trade 
practices 
we believe that the most effective way to achieve results is 
through cooperation not confrontation said us trade 
representative carla hills 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said the message to japan 
was congratulations on a job well done to date 
the administration pledged to keep pressure on japan to live up 
to its commitments including insisting that monitoring provisions 
be placed in an agreement reached april 5 to attack a broad array 
of structural barriers blocking american and other foreign 
companies from doing business in japan 
but many members of congress accused the administration of 
making a serious tactical error they said removing japan from the 
target list took pressure off kaifus government 
when we have a persistent 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
and that nation will not abide by a variety of agreements freeing 
them from the threat of trade sanctions makes no objective sense 
said house majority leader richard gephardt 
a year ago japan was cited for barriers to sales of usmade 
supercomputers satellites and wood products in the past month 
us and japanese negotiators have reached marketopening 
agreements in all three areas 
brazil was targeted for restrictive import licensing practices 
hills said recently enacted legislation in that country should meet 
us concerns in this area 
but india which was cited last year for a ban on operations of 
foreign private insurance companies and for controls on foreign 
investment that distort trade has refused to make concessions the 
1990 target list names those barriers again 
the indian government issued a statement saying it would 
continue to refuse to negotiate bilaterally under threat of 
sanctions 
members of congress said it made no sense to target india with 
its modest 850 million trade surplus with the united states and 
neglect japan whose trade surplus is more than 50 times higher 
in a separate action friday the administration said it was not 
targeting any country for possible sanctions relating to violations 
of us copyright and patent protections 
however it placed four countries brazil india china and 
thailand on a priority watch list as countries deserving 
special attention 
another 19 countries with lesser problems were placed on a watch 
list they were argentina canada chile colombia egypt greece 
indonesia italy japan south korea malaysia pakistan 
philippines saudi arabia spain taiwan turkey venezuela and 
yugoslavia

the chairman of a soviet parliamentary 
delegation says he will try to find out which soviet official 
rejected offers of international aid after the 1986 explosion at 
the chernobyl nuclear reactor 
with the full dimensions of the chernobyl disaster now becoming 
clear the supreme soviet has reversed course and is urgently 
seeking scientific medical and material aid from the world 
community 
at a news conference at the soviet embassy on friday five 
soviet parliamentary deputies said the official secrecy that 
shrouded the aftermath of the april 26 1986 fire and explosion at 
the chernobyl reactor was a damaging mistake because it masked the 
scope and scale of the disaster 
in addition they said efforts to clean up radiation 
contamination and deal with the medical effects of the accident 
might have been far more advanced by now if most foreign assistance 
had not been rejected 
the radiation that spewed from the plant poisoned millions of 
acres of farmland and forests in the ukraine alone it is now 
believed to pose a potential health threat to at least 4 million 
soviets especially children pregnant women and the elderly 
delegation members said cases of leukemia and thyroid cancer are 
appearing 
and scores of thousands of homes and apartments will have to be 
found and new jobs as well for those evacuated from 
contaminated regions 
i know there were offers of help from foreign organizations 
but they were turned down said kakimbek s salykov the 
delegation leader and chairman of the supreme soviets committee on 
ecology and rational use of natural resources 
we are going to investigate who was the person who ruled that 
such offers be turned down he said 
salykov contrasted the aftermath of chernobyl to the earthquake 
that devastated large sections of soviet armenia on dec 7 1988 
and triggered an outpouring of aid from around the world 
he said he believes the difference in the official attitude was 
caused by the fact that chernobyl occurred at the beginning of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness 
the earthquake occurred when the policies of openness and 
reform were quite well developed he said so all offers were 
accepted 
lev a kuznetsov a member of the delegation said it is now 
clear that in the case of chernobyl the assistance required from 
the world community will be required for a long period of time 
it is very sad for us that it is four years after the 
catastrophe that we parliamentarians have to talk to you like 
that he said 
as to the chernobyl reactor it is considered obsolete and 
accident prone and will be shut down permanently either this 
year or in 1991 said yuri n shcherbak another deputy from the 
supreme soviet 
but it will not be closed today or tomorrow he said very 
great preparatory work is needed

managers of the savannah river nuclear weapons 
plant in south carolina put some of its workers at an unnecessarily 
high risk of gross contamination by plutonium according to an 
energy department audit report 
plutonium a key ingredient in nuclear warheads is one of the 
most toxic elements known lethal lung doses of plutonium are 
measured in the billionths of a gram 
the defense contractor that runs the plant westinghouse 
electric corp said friday it was taking action to correct the 
problem it was discovered during a twomonth probe of health 
safety and environmental conditions at savannah river which makes 
plutonium and other special materials for nuclear weapons 
the audit ended march 23 and results were made available friday 
at the energy department which owns savannah river and 16 other 
major nuclear arms plants and laboratories 
the audit team of federal officials and private contractors said 
they found a potentially dangerous combination of problems at a 
building called the sed facility which is on the grounds of 
savannah rivers research laboratory near aiken sc 
dean hoffman a westinghouse spokesman said the sed facility 
performs classified work and that he could not comment on it beyond 
saying the problems were being fixed 
the auditors said they were concerned about conditions in an 
area of the facility that contained glove boxes or work stations 
that allowed workers to handle plutonium with leadlined gloves 
inserted through the side of the box 
they said the gloves were severely deteriorated this was 
particularly troubling because the gloves were contaminated with 
plutonium and were in the vicinity of combustible objects 
including plastic plywood cardboard and plexiglass the report 
said 
making matters worse was a lack of adequate fire protection in 
the building the auditors said 
the combination results in a high potential for the spread 
of plutonium contamination to surrounding areas and their 
occupants the report said at another point the report said the 
result could be gross contamination of the sed facility and the 
unspecified number of people working in it 
the nuclear weapons makers learned a painful lesson about the 
dangers of plutonium processing 33 years ago in september 1957 at 
the rocky flats weapons plant in colorado plutonium shavings 
ignited spontaneously in a plexiglass glove box creating a huge 
fire that quickly went out of control and spewed unknown amounts of 
plutonium into the atmosphere just 16 miles from denver 
the problems at the sed facility were rated at category 2 
which the energy department defines as a significant risk but 
not presenting a clear and present danger to workers or the public 
problems of this type are serious enough to require considering 
whether to shut down the facility until corrections are made 
the auditors also said the problems had the potential for 
causing a severe occupational injury illness or fatality or 
destruction of the building 
in all the audit found 11 sets of problems at savannah river in 
the category 2 level besides the sed facility they included 
inadequate procedures for evacuating workers from a highlevel 
nuclear waste storage area in the event of accidental releases of 
radioactivity from nearby processing buildings 
the auditors also gave a category 2 rating to their finding 
that operators and supervisors at savannah rivers waste management 
facilities which are among the largest in the nation have not 
been properly trained to operate the facilities 
hoffman said all 11 of the category 2 concerns are being 
addressed and that most of them already have been corrected

numbness in his hands as a complication of his diabetes he said 
the exhostage had told other physicians that his captors supplied 
him with insulin to treat his condition

western hostages sometimes bring in doctors from iranianfunded 
hospitals to care for ailing captives 
the hostages have common health problems such as diabetes 
high blood pressure or high levels of uric acid said the 
physician medicines for such health problems are not a problem 
they can be obtained anywhere in lebanon

considering the ordeal he has undergone 
there is no evidence that he was beaten the army doctor 
said he said polhill had indicated to other physicians that he was 
not 
polhill was released sunday and flown to washington on thursday

unable to thank you more directly and personally but my voice 
decided to go on vacation before i did however i do want you to 
know how very much i appreciate the warmth and sincerity of your 
welcome and the support youve given my wife and family who join 
me in hoping that this is the beginning of the end to the hostage 
situation 
i am happily now free to join you in your continued support 
for the loved ones of those who remain in captivity and in 
welcoming the hostages home in the very near future polhill 
said lets show the world that we the american people want to 
leave the past behind us look positively to the future and once 
and for all close the file on the hostage issue 
polhill was abducted with two other american educators on jan 
24 1987 from the campus of the usaffiliated beirut university

american university will survive the 
resignation of its president amid an investigation of obscene phone 
calls because no institution is dependent on one person the 
university provost says 
au president richard berendzen resigned earlier this month 
citing exhaustion however authorities said later that berendzen 
was being investigated for allegedly making obscene telephone calls 
no charges have been filed against berendzen 
provost milton greenberg who has assumed the duties of the 
president said friday the school had undergone an unbelievably 
extraordinary turn of events filled with human tragedy legal 
complications media interest and the blessed but complicated 
expectations of openness 
we wont pretend now that we are not sad baffled and 
worried he said 
no institution is dependent on one person greenberg said at 
a meeting in the campus athletic building 
berendzen who is being treated at johns hopkins university 
hospital in baltimore issued an apology thursday through his 
lawyer berendzen did not describe the nature of his treatment 
i cannot begin to convey my embarrassment or my torment he 
said in the threeparagraph statement 
berendzen a former astronomy professor with degrees from mit 
and harvard came to american university in 1974 as dean of the 
college of arts and sciences he became provost three years later 
and president in 1980 
we are affected we are hurt by what has happened staff 
member haimdat sawah 28 said after greenbergs speech 
but i dont think the integrity of the university has been 
diminished that much or the quality of the degree has diminished 
that much 
several students said they were disappointed greenberg didnt 
discuss specifics of the allegations against berendzen 
i just feel that a lot of things werent cleared up about what 
happened said sophomore susan demel a native of puerto rico 
i think he greenberg was very vague 
andrew bloom a sophomore from chicago said the university was 
withholding facts 
they are trying to protect the universitys reputation and 
they are going about it all wrong bloom said 
officials said berendzen resigned after he became the subject of 
an investigation based on complaints to police in suburban fairfax 
county va 
fairfax commonwealth attorney robert horan is expected to 
complete the investigation in a few days but he refuses to detail

senate leaders hope to send an aid package for 
central america to president bush next week but lawmakers first 
must resolve disputes over abortion and the death penalty that are 
slowing the bill 
the senate was unable to make much progress with the 34 
billion spending bill on friday 
the measures centerpieces are 300 million for nicaragua and 
420 million for panama which both have new democratic 
governments but unrelated provisions and dozens of potential 
amendments have slowed work on the bill 
much of fridays session was spent debating language permitting 
the district of columbia to use local funds to pay for abortions 
for poor women the bill survived two attempts by conservatives to 
remove the language 5145 and 5442 
work on the bill bogged down again after senators gave 
preliminary approval 6027 to an amendment allowing the death 
penalty for drugrelated murders in the district of columbia 
when the vote ended capital punishment foe sen mark hatfield 
rore pulled out a 1000page study entitled the case against 
the death penalty he announced that he was prepared to debate at 
length on the issue 
after 40 minutes the senate agreed to postpone debate on the 
bill until monday 
the delays provoked expressions of frustration from senate 
leaders who had hoped to send the legislation to bush for his 
signature earlier this week 
this is supposed to be an urgent supplemental bill for panama 
and nicaragua lamented minority leader bob dole rkan 
weve forgotten that because we want to debate abortion all 
day we have a responsibility to the president to expedite aid to 
the two fledgling democratic governments he said 
surveying a list of dozens of amendments proposed by both 
democrats and republicans majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine added i dont think either side has displayed any 
restraint 
when passed the measure still must go to a conference with the 
house to work out differences with that chambers 24 billion 
version the money is for the rest of this fiscal year which ends 
sept 30 
the aid to panama and nicaragua as well as money for a number 
of domestic programs added by members of congress is being paid 
for largely through cuts in the pentagon budget 
from bushs original request for 870 million house and senate 
addons pushed the total price tag of the bill to roughly 34 
billion domestic spending initiatives ranged from 8 million to 
wage war on grasshoppers in the upper midwest to 185 million for a 
west virginia fbi fingerprint lab 
also included by congress was hundreds of millions of dollars to 
make up shortfalls this year in a variety of programs including 
veterans benefits food stamps forest service firefighting and 
disaster relief 
among amendments adopted friday was a requirement that the 
government study how foreign aid can be used to promote the 
fortunes of american businesses overseas proposed by sen robert

the environmental protection agency is under 
orders from a federal appeals court to explain why it has not 
written regulations to reduce acid rain 
in a separate but related decision the us circuit court of 
appeals for the district of columbia rejected friday an industry 
challenge to current standards for smoke dust and soot 
the court gave epa 60 days to explain its acid rain position 
the issue could become moot since revisions to clean air 
legislation now before congress are expected to include new 
controls on acid rain precursors such as sulfur dioxide the 
pollutant at issue before the court 
longstanding epa primary regulations aimed at protecting 
public health govern the permissible concentration of sulfur 
dioxide in the groundlevel atmosphere around pollution sources 
such as power plant smokestacks 
the agency also may issue socalled secondary standards 
aimed at protecting economic and other assets without regard to 
health 
sulfur dioxide may be transformed chemically in the atmosphere 
into sulfuric acid which may fall in rain hundreds of miles from 
the pollution source the acid may form a haze in the atmosphere 
that reduces visibility 
the national resources defense council an environmental group 
and several northeastern states argued that the agency must issue a 
secondary sulfur dioxide standard aimed at acid rain one asset to 
be protected was visibility the plaintiffs argued 
epa has taken no formal action indicating that it is moving in 
the direction of making a decision whether or not to establish a 
secondary standard on acid rain wrote judge patricia wald 
while the ruling implies no conclusion as to the merits of 
epas lack of movement the court directed the agency to 
provide us with clear and cogent reasons why it has taken no 
action 
were very pleased that the court agreed with us that the epa 
had not satisfactorily explained why it was continuing to refuse to 
address acid rain said james sevinsky a lawyer in the office of 
new york state attorney general robert abrams 
david doniger a lawyer at the natural resources defense 
council said in one sense this is vindication in another 
sense its a sad commentary on how the legal process works 
in the reagan administration epa argued that more study was 
needed before acid rain could be addressed the bush administration 
favors action and is supporting a farreaching provision in 
congress to require a 10 million ton reduction in annual sulfur 
dioxide emissions almost half the current annual total 
the american iron and steel institute challenged as arbitrary 
and capricious epa air quality standards for particulate matter 
smoke dust and soot on the grounds that they were based on 
inadequate scientific data the court found the federal agencys 
standards conclusions reasonable based on the available data 
the industry group had asked the court to delay its decision 
saying that the national institutes of health is investigating 
allegations that an author of some studies relied on by the epa had 
suppressed evidence of errors 
but those studies were only part of the evidence the epa used 
said the appeals court the significance of the opening of the 
investigation is too speculative to provide grounds for 
delaying its decision said the court

a federal court jury ended the bank fraud 
trial of us rep harold ford in deadlock but a prosecutor says 
the government will try again for a conviction 
a mistrial was declared friday after nearly two months of 
testimony over political favors ford was accused of performing in 
exchange for loans from two fallen banking brothers 
the democrat said he considered the mistrial a victory but had 
expected an innocent verdict 
im hopeful now that i can put this episode behind me ford 
said 
us attorney john gill had a different idea 
there will be a retrial gill said from his knoxville 
office the only thing i can say is we had a case we felt we were 
obligated to bring based on the evidence we had 
ford tennessees only black congressman has complained often 
since his 1987 indictment that he is the victim of racist 
prosecutors the government has denied the allegation 
ford 44 was accused of taking political payoffs disguised as 
loans from former bankers jake butcher and his brother ch 
butcher jr 
the butcher brothers in 1983 set off one of the worst banking 
collapses in us financial history both brothers are serving 
20year prison terms on guilty pleas stemming from their banking 
empires collapse 
ford was indicted in knoxville on conspiracy bank and mail 
fraud charges the trial was moved to memphis at his request he 
was charged with 19 counts and faced up to 95 years in prison if 
convicted 
federal rules require a retrial within 70 days but gill said 
pretrial motions could push back the date 
ford stood trial with former ch butcher jr accountant david 
crabtree and former lawyers for both brothers karl schledwitz and 
douglas beaty 
crabtree schledwitz and beaty were accused of helping ford get 
and hide butcher money and faced charges of conspiracy and mail 
fraud five counts for crabtree and 16 each for beaty and 
schledwitz 
the governments trial witnesses outlined a complicated string 
of loans to ford and said few if any payments were made on them 
prior to the butchers financial collapse 
the government said ford and his family drew butcher loans 
totaling more than 1 million between 1976 and 1982 but ford put 
the total at 650000 he said those debts were settled 
the trial began feb 12 testimony began march 1 and the 
government called 29 witnesses the defense did not call any 
witnesses and ford said he decided not to testify because he 
regarded the governments case as weak 
us district judge odell horton removed one of 12 jurors 
earlier friday for failing to disclose a past felony conviction 
but lawyers said the trial could have continued with 11 jury 
members

movie mogul raymond chow recalls his initial 
response to a suggestion he produce a film called teenage mutant 
ninja turtles 
its quite impossible what is this chow responded 
when you hear the title it is difficult to relate the four 
words to each other to make sure i heard it right i really had to 
ask the guy to spell it out for me he said during a recent 
interview at his studios in hong kong 
but chow 62 refused to dismiss the movie out of hand when the 
suggestion was made two years ago 
he agreed to produce the movie based on four crimefighting 
humansized turtles who devour pizza speak surfer lingo 
cowabunga and are named after the renaissance artists raphael 
leonardo michelangelo and donatello 
my gut feeling told me we should give it a try said chow 
whose golden harvest group first landed on the international 
moviemaking map with martial arts idol bruce lee 
its very weird very unique and very interesting you 
have to be unique these days to be a big success he said 
the rest is hollywood history the idea that was rejected by 
us studios eventually became teenage mutant ninja turtles 
and smashed box office records to become the topgrossing 
independent film in the united states 
the movies box office should reach 100 million this weekend 
and could hit 150 million in the united states alone with much of 
the receipts coming from children buying halfpriced tickets 
tens of millions more will be earned as the radioactive 
reptillian warriors head to other countries later this year 
the movie which cost 15 million stands to earn golden harvest 
at least 25 million 
it isnt the first time movies about martial arts heroes have 
been kind to chows studio 
in the early 1970s golden harvest made five bruce lee movies 
including enter the dragon which was coproduced by warner 
bros and grossed nearly 50 million in the united states 
according to one studio executive 
chow a former voice of america reporter has many smaller 
successes among the more than 300 films he has made since 1970 
most lowbudget films made for the asian market popular kung fu 
sagas action comedies and ghost stories are market staples 
that formula for success has made chows studio a target of 
critics who say he is only concerned with making money not quality 
films 
but chow rejects the arguments and says both the bruce lee and 
ninja turtles movies carry social messages 
most of our films have a general good message sort of the 
buddhist belief that good guys will be rewarded and bad guys will 
be punished so everybody should be a good guy he said 
another company in this british colony is joining in the golden 
harvest from the terrapins playmates holdings ltd has seen its 
sales and profits rise dramatically as the licensed manufacturer of 
ninja turtle toys 
we are amazed at this tremendous response its finance 
director bf chu said from the companys showroom 
also in the showroom was retromutagen ooze the turtles mutated 
after contact with radioactive sewer slime a turtle blimp and 
many more of the dozens of turtlerelated toys made at factories in 
china and the nearby portuguese territory of macao 
after suffering a loss of 48 million in 1987 playmates 
turtle toys went on the market and helped the company earn 23 
million in 1988 and 214 million last year 
more than 70 percent of the companys sales came from the turtle 
line last year and chu said orders have further jumped since the 
movie came out a month ago playmates expects sales to increase 
again this year 
the good fortune may just be starting for the company a new 
line of licensed dick tracy toys is about to be released in 
conjunction with the warren beatty movie on the famed comic cop 
scheduled for release in june

judge erwin alderson offers petty 
offenders who are illiterate a choice crack the books or pay the 
price 
the municipal court judge will reduce or suspend fines if 
offenders take part in a 20week literacy program at oil belt 
votech 
alderson whose rulings range from fines of 85 for violation of 
a local leash law to hundreds of dollars for driving while 
intoxicated got his idea last year when he attended the kickoff of 
a program at a local school that uses computers to help teach 
illiterate adults to read 
i believe in trying innovative things he said and the 
criminal justice system particularly municipal court is a good 
place to locate people with literacy problems he added 
theres no question that people who are involved in lives of 
petty crime a lot of the reason for that is because they dont 
have anything to do a lack of alternatives lack of selfesteem 
hopelessness he said 
but it has been hard he said because of the natural 
reluctance of a person to admit in front of others that they cannot 
read plus the fact that were learning we dont have many 
precedents to follow 
one defendant who declined aldersons offer is otis king a 
60year pulpwood cutter from louann in union county who never 
learned to read or write 
king decided in november to pay a 9025 fine for public 
drunkenness because he said i dont have no transportation no 
way of getting back and forth up there 
from an early age king went to work to support his mother and 
acknowledges that poring over books would be frightening 
ive worked all my life around sawmills and in the woods ever 
since i was big enough he said at the time it would have 
been nice if i could have learned to read i wanted to but a man 
at my age no i just cant see it 
authorities in some other states also have been trying to get 
offenders to better themselves 
in virginia a new no readno release learning incentive 
program requires state prison inmates to read above sixthgrade 
level to be eligible for parole and offers programs at 52 
department of corrections schools 
the prosecutors office in new yorks bronx borough began 
offering jail inmates a range of educational services about four 
years ago 
those who appear in aldersons court are read their rights and 
must sign a waiver saying they understand them 
i use that as kind of a primitive way of screening alderson 
said its real easy when i see an x signature more often than 
not though its someone who cannot read and struggles signing 
their name 
alderson recommends participation in the learning program 
based on instinct 
wanda sturdivant an assistant municipal clerk said everyone 
hes sent through has needed the program at oil belt but none 
has completed the course 
one man fined for having a dog at large wanted to attend but had 
no transportation she said another man who attended for a while 
and quit may be getting help on his own she said 
still alderson said he was convinced the program eventually 
will succeed 
each and every one of gods creatures is terribly important 
and if one person can learn to read because of something we might 
have done here i think its a success he said

the shuttle that put the hubble space 
telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s 
by astronomer edwin hubble the eyepiece from what once was the 
worlds most powerful telescope 
its a great pleasure to have something of such historical 
significance and something that so directly symbolizes edwin 
hubbles fundamental contributions to astronomy astronaut kathy 
sullivan said friday as she circled the earth in space shuttle 
discovery 
the eyepiece from the mount wilson observatorys 100inch hooker 
telescope was carried into orbit by sullivan after she brings the 
eyepiece back to earth it will be placed on display at the 
observatory 
its basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy 
to the future of astronomy said lyn mcafee spokeswoman for the 
mount wilson institute the pasadenabased group runs the 
observatory located in the san gabriel mountains outside los 
angeles 
the discoveries made by hubble on the 100inch telescope at 
mount wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of 
the universe mcafee said we believe the hubble space 
telescope will do the same thing 
the hooker telescope was the worlds most powerful telescope 
from its construction in 1918 until 1948 when the 200inch hale 
telescope was placed in operation at mount palomar observatory 
northeast of san diego 
using the hooker telescope hubble was the first to determine 
the distance to a galaxy outside the milky way the institute said 
in a statement 
this crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that 
other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local 
galaxy the institute said 
during the 1920s and 1930s hubble and an assistant used the 
hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint 
galaxies showing that most of them were moving away from each 
other very quickly 
this provided observational evidence for the concept 
suggested by einsteins theory of relativity that the universe is 
expanding the institute said 
hubbles work helped convince scientists the universe was 
created in a giant explosion called the big bang an estimated 
15 billion years ago 
the hooker telescope was mothballed in 1985 by the carnegie 
institution former operator of the observatory in a moneysaving 
move the institute hopes to obtain funds to reopen it

federal charges against a figure in the

thomas e muldoons going to trial or noting an appeal for his 
prior conviction or both

caring for the sick and homebound in 
americas inner cities has become increasingly hazardous and many 
visiting nurses wont venture into crimetorn neighborhoods without 
a security escort 
but some nursing organizations say theyre having a tough enough 
time collecting adequate healthcare insurance reimbursements 
without having to worry about forking out money for security guards 
in providence the visiting nurse association of rhode island 
has threatened to stop taking on new patients in areas of the city 
it considers dangerous 
the need for security escorts has grown dramatically but the 
city cannot be persuaded to kick in money for protection services 
said its president jane a mackenzie the threat may be drastic 
but no choice exists she said 
several weeks ago one nurse mary seccareccia was making her 
rounds at a housing complex in the city when someone fired a shot 
as she got out of her car shattering the rear window mrs 
mackenzie said 
i have never seen the same degree of personal threat in my 
whole time in public health nursing said mrs mackenzie who has 
worked in nursing for 40 years i think weve avoided a lot of 
problems by having the escort with the nurses 
val halamandarias president of the washingtonbased national 
association of home care said violence is rife in some drugridden 
neighborhoods and nurses are increasingly getting caught in the 
crossfire 
its a huge problem nationwide particularly in the big urban 
centers she said i cant think of a city over a million 
population that doesnt have a problem 
in providence security escorts have helped no nurses have 
reported being physically assaulted since the visiting nurse 
association began using unarmed security escorts almost a decade 
ago said vna spokeswoman cheryl lisi 
but as the violence has escalated so has the need for security 
and for money to pay for guards mrs mackenzie said 
insurance once paid for health care to patients while support 
from philanthropists and charitable organizations covered 
administrative costs for interpreters and security escorts she 
said 
now insurance companies dont always cover all of the 
healthcare costs and the vna has to dip into its pot of 
administrative money for patient care 
last year she said medicaid and medicare payments to the vna 
fell short of covering the actual costs of the services provided by 
460779 
the association has turned to the city for help if it doesnt 
get 156000 it will stop taking clients in dangerous 
neighborhoods mrs mackenzie said providence is the only 
community in rhode island that does not help fund the association 
she charged 
but the citys administration director john simmons said 
providence gave the association 22000 from a federal grant this 
year and he also questioned whether its financial or security 
concerns were as bad as the nurses claim 
were not sure at this time that the vna needs money he 
said there are other agencies that go into the city and do not 
need escort services 
simmons said city officials would be happy to work with the vna 
to find new approaches in how you provide services 
providence is not alone in its funding difficulties and home 
health services around the country have had to try to tap other 
sources to stay afloat halamandarias said 
the visiting nurse society of new york turned to broadway 
earlier this month sponsoring a benefit performance of cat on a 
hot tin roof to raise money she said

the kremlin has again rejected lithuanias 
attempts to open formal talks with the soviet government about the 
crisis over the republics independence drive according to 
lithuanias vilnius radio 
the radio monitored by the bbc in london on friday night 
quoted bronius kuzmickas the deputy chairman of lithuanias 
supreme council legislature as saying that a parliamentary 
delegation had met with some highranking officials in moscow 
but the officials reiterated president mikhail s gorbachevs 
position that no talks with the government would take place unless 
lithuania rescinded its march 11 declaration of independence the 
radio said 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene said her 
government still hopes to begin talks without rolling back on 
independence decisions but it is considering a proposed temporary 
freeze on secessionist actions as the maximum concession it might 
offer moscow 
this is a compromise which should be viewed as the maximum 
this is the limit she told a friday night news conference 
according to the soviet news agency tass 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis has said the 
republics legislature the supreme council will consider the 
freeze proposal which came from the leaders of france and germany 
the legislature is scheduled to reconvene wednesday 
a soviet foreign ministry spokesman in moscow vadim perfiliev 
said friday he had no official reaction to the french and german 
suggestion 
lithuania wants an immediate dialogue landsbergis said friday 
and a termination of the soviet economic blockade against 
lithuania would be beneficial to the atmosphere of this dialogue 
the kremlin has imposed a blockade on gas oil and other 
supplies to lithuania to pressure its leaders to rescind their 
march 11 declaration of independence 
tass reported today that coal had been added to the embargo 
list much of the coal lithuania consumes is imported from poland 
and the republic owes about 16 million for coal supplies so they 
have been stopped the news agency said 
vilnius radio reported that medicines including antibiotics were 
in short supply but that the situation was not believed to be 
critical 
on friday in washington state department spokesman richard 
boucher said mrs prunskiene had been granted a us visa for 
unofficial business travel and said she was expected to visit 
sometime next week 
the united states and other western countries have refused to 
impose sanctions on the soviet union for its efforts to stop 
lithuanias independence drive 
on thursday 52yearold stanislovas jamaitis died of burns 
suffered when he doused his clothes with gasoline and set himself 
ablaze in front of the bolshoi theater in central moscow to protest 
the kremlin pressure 
jamaitis left suicide notes to his wife stasala and to 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis the supreme council 
released the texts on friday said spokeswoman rita radzavicius 
she translated them from lithuanian to russian and read them by 
telephone 
tass also reported the existence of the note to jamaitis wife 
saying it spoke of an impossible family life and a desire to 
commit suicide 
the version released by lithuanian authorities apologized for 
something bad in his marriage but stressed political motives 
i went to moscow to set myself on fire in red square he 
said in both notes the bolshoi is a few blocks from red square 
where security is heavier 
the occupiers have cut off energy supplies and people are 
being thrown out of work jamaitis wrote 
he would kill himself to let gorbachev know that lithuanians 
will not live in a lithuania that is not independent said the 
note read by the spokeswoman 
kremlin officials have said lithuania may become independent 
but at a slower pace and within the framework of the soviet 
constitution a new law calls for a referendum and a maximum 
fiveyear period to negotiate specifics of secession 
many nonlithuanian residents of the republic oppose 
independence and on friday they staged a truck blockade during rush 
hour in vilnius the capital 
supporters of the lithuanian popular front sajudis dragged the 
trucks from the streets with tractors tass said 
the blockade was organized by members of a lithuanian communist 
party splinter still loyal to the kremlin and by members of 
yedinstvo consisting mostly of russian residents of lithuania ms 
radzevicius said 
just over 80 percent of the republics population is lithuanian 
and some russian polish and other minority residents fear their 
rights will be violated after independence

factional fighting 
between mohawk bands who disagree over whether gambling should be 
allowed here sent hundreds of residents fleeing the reservation 
straddling the uscanada border 
the st regis mohawk reservation had the look of a war zone 
friday burned cars lined the roads many buildings had bullet 
holes or broken windows and residents including children were 
armed with guns or baseball bats 
gov mario cuomo so far has refused to send new york state 
police or national guardsmen to restore order despite pleas from 
one indian leader and some outsiders 
we want this situation resolved cuomo said were working 
very hard to figure out how to do it i think what weve done so 
far what the state police have done so far has been appropriate 
residents of the reservation just south of the st lawrence 
river have been divided for months over the presence of gambling 
casinos and bingo halls on the american side that draw thousands of 
nonindian visitors 
the us government has declared the gambling halls illegal but 
the mohawks dont recognize federal or state jurisdiction on the 
reservation 
in recent weeks the feud has exploded into violence with 
gambling opponents setting up armed blockades of roads leading to 
the reservation and sounds of gunfire nightly 
progambling mohawks tore down the blockades in a bloody battle 
tuesday night on thursday night four opponents of gambling were 
injured one seriously when they were beaten with baseball bats 
authorities said another person an observer invited by 
antigambling forces was missing 
amid further violence about 400 evacuees were taken on barges 
friday to cornwall ontario where they were housed overnight in an 
army transport center 
about 5000 mohawks live in the canadian sector of the 
reservation and authorities estimated that at least 2000 will be 
evacuated the reservations total population is about 14000 
police said the reservation was quiet friday night 
but this weekend the casinos are to reopen for the first time 
since the roadblocks were removed and authorities feared violence 
would flare anew 
mike mitchell chief of the canadian mohawk council said he 
decided to evacuate women children and the elderly from the 
reservation friday because of the previous trouble 
everybody was in a state of fear mitchell said i 
couldnt see another night of putting people through that 
violence all night machine gunfire every five minutes gunfire 
all over the village 
security was tight on a bridge across the canadian border 
leading to cornwall local police armed with shotguns stopped cars 
leaving and entering the bridge asking for identification and 
searching suspicious vehicles for weapons 
cornwall constable scott hanton said police had heard reports 
that weapons might be smuggled into the evacuation center 
were in a heck of a situation he said we dont have any 
jurisdiction on the reservation and were stuck in the middle of 
it 
on the american side of the bridge state police and us 
customs officials also stopped cars and checked for weapons 
barbara barnes an opponent of gambling said some of the 
residents of the american side of the reservation were also scared 
i think anybody who has bullets coming at them should be 
scared she said its been a very harrowing experience 
barnes said some people had voluntarily left their homes and 
gone to live with friends or relatives off the reservation 
barnes criticized the governor for refusing to get involved 
we have to have law enforcement here she said we cant 
continue with this lawlessness any nonindian community you 
wouldnt have whats happened here 
the canadian embassy in washington has contacted the us state 
department thursday to underline concerns about the violence and 
the lack of us policing on the reserve 
we made no specific suggestions but our government finds the 
situation alarming and we are concerned that something needs to be 
done said patricia lowbedard a spokeswoman for the canadian 
department of external affairs 
on thursday us sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the 
select committee on indian affairs wrote cuomo expressing his 
concern about the most grave situation at st regis

president virgilio barco pledged to 
double the size of an antiterrorist police force following the 
assassination of a presidential candidate that authorities blame on 
drug traffickers 
carlos pizarro a former guerrilla leader turned politician was 
shot to death thursday aboard a jetliner carrying 97 people his 
bodyguards then gunned down the assassin 
the slaying was the latest of many blamed on the countrys 
leading cocaine cartel in the city of medellin and it prompted two 
political leaders on friday to call for a reorganization of the 
military to help keep order before the may 27 elections 
in a nationally televised speech friday night barco said he 
will double the size of the antiterrorist police force which now 
has about 3000 members 
acknowledging that political candidates are afraid to appear in 
public he said the government will order more free television time 
for them and also provide free radio time 
governmentcontrolled television now allows each candidate a 
halfhour of air time during the entire campaign barco didnt say 
how much more time they would get 
pizarro was the third presidential candidate assassinated in the 
past eight months he was a former leader of the m19 guerrilla 
movement hundreds of leftist guerrillas belonging the group laid 
down their arms last month and formed a political party with 
pizarro as its presidential candidate 
other assassinations in the last six years have included a 
justice minister an attorney general several judges journalists 
students professors and union leaders 
a man called the bogota radio station caracol within hours of 
pizarros death and said the medellin cartel had ordered his 
killing 
however a faxed communique friday supposedly from the cartel 
denied reponsibility it accused police of making phony statements 
purporting to represent the cartel 
presidential candidate alvaro gomez suggesting barco lacks the 
confidence of the military said the president should name a 
threeman council to run the army to avoid a military coup 
in a written statement gomez said never has there been such 
a great and pathetic image of anarchy 
former president alfonso lopez michelsen said the entire armed 
forces must be reorganized 
the credibility of the authorities is on trial and the 
successive display of inefficiency shown by the deaths of three 
presidential candidates forces us to consider reogranization of the 
army and other security forces he said 
lopez of the governing liberal party was president from 1974 
to 1978 
a barco spokesman minister of government horacio serpa flatly 
rejected gomezs suggestion of a triumvirate to run the military 
as for lopezs idea serpa said barco would reorganize the armed 
forces if it becomes necessary 
the august assassination of another candidate sen luis carlos 
galan of the liberal party prompted the government to step up its 
crackdown on the cocaine cartels since then drug traffickers have 
killed more than 230 people 
about 100 ticketed passengers friday refused to board a domestic 
avianca flight in the coastal city of barranquilla when they 
learned that a leftist congresswoman and her heavily armed security 
contingent would be traveling with them radio reports said 
it was on a flight to barranquilla from bogota that pizarro was 
shot to death 
the radio chains caracol and rcn said that in fridays incident 
the plane stayed on the ground for 2 hours until about 50 
passengers finally decided to board the plane then departed

nicaraguan tempers are flaring over 
the new governments devaluation of the national currency which 
has caused prices to shoot up in an economy already plagued by 
soaring inflation 
this new government will be good for nothing everything is 
more expensive a housewife with two children in tow said friday 
to nobody in particular as she walked among the stalls at a managua 
market 
she was one of only a handful of customers at the sprawling 
market which is usually packed with shoppers 
francisca guevara a vendor said she had raised only the price 
of cooking oil because it was imported from guatemala and she 
needed to buy dollars to obtain it 
but ill have to raise the price of everything else too this 
afternoon she said i first have to figure out my costs 
other vendors already had raised their prices 
the 2dayold usbacked government of president violeta 
barrios de chamorro slashed the value of the cordoba in half 
prices for many items increased while the wages of most 
nicaraguans stayed the same many earned just 30 a month before 
the devaluation 
at the new prices a pound of rice one of beans and one of beef 
would cost a total of 205000 cordobas or 146 
mrs chamorro inherited an economy damaged by more than a decade 
of mismanagement by her leftist sandinista precedessors war with 
the usbacked contra rebels and a us trade embargo that has now 
been lifted 
inflation was a worldrecord 36000 percent in 1988 the 
sandinistas managed to bring it down to 1800 percent in 1989 with 
their own austerity program 
the exchange rate of the cordoba went from 70800 to 140000 per 
us dollar in the socalled parallel market thus anyone buying 
dollars at the legal exchange houses that constitute nicaraguas 
parallel market had to pay twice as much friday as thursday 
the official exchange rate had been 53800 cordobas to the 
dollar since the last devaluation april 17 the official market 
sells a limited amount of dollars set aside for importing only 
crucial goods such as medicines oil and fertilizer 
the parallel market provides a greater but still limited amount 
of dollars for less crucial imports but at a higher price 
the black market meets the rest of nicaraguas demand for 
dollars 
the devaluation was a blow to nicaraguans who buy dollars to 
import goods but that was the idea to make it more expensive to 
import goods and cheaper to export nicaraguan items 
the government hopes the move will help cut the countrys trade 
deficit which was 413 million in 1989

connecticut is set to become the first 
state to guarantee a womans right to choose abortion under state 
law even if the 1973 roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion is 
struck down by the supreme court 
the state senate on friday overwhelmingly approved a bill that 
effectively codifies into state law much of roe vs wade it also 
repeals the states unenforced criminal antiabortion statutes 
the bill now goes to democratic gov william a oneill who has 
said he will sign it 
dawn johnsen legal director for the national abortion rights 
action league called the bill an important victory for 
abortionrights forces 
this is the first state law that says a woman has a right to 
choose an abortion not just under the constitution but under 
state law she told the new york times the new hampshire 
legislature recently passed similar legislation but gov judd 
gregg vetoed it 
the prolife council of connecticut also claimed victory 
however because the bill requires girls under 16 to get counseling 
before getting an abortion and encourages them to tell their 
parents 
the connecticut right to life corp firmly opposed the measure 
in a slight variation on the roe vs wade decision the bill 
allows abortions late in pregnancy when the fetus is capable of 
living outside the womb only when the life or health of the mother 
is in danger 
the senate approved the bill by a 323 vote after about 45 
minutes of debate the house endured five hours of debate on the 
bill last week 
states have taken a more prominent role in the abortion issue 
since the supreem court last summer decided in a missouri case to 
let pass more restrictive abortion laws the court indicated it 
might modify or reverse roe vs wade 
even if the supreme court were to reverse roe v wade this 
statute would be the governing standard for the state of 
connecticut said sen richard blumenthal the democratic 
vicechairman of the judiciary committee and a cosponsor of the 
bill 
i think what the supreme court is saying in effect to the 
states is were going to turn this issue over to you 
connecticut has taken the gauntlet and said were ready to face 
that issue and were going to be prochoice he said 
the senate easily rejected three republican amendments one 
would have restored criminal sanctions against anyone performing an 
abortion and permitted the father or grandparent of the fetus to 
sue for 10000 in damages another would have required minors to 
notify parents before an abortion could be performed 
its a sad day in the state of connecticut when we would 
intervene to deny parents fundamental rights said republican 
sen thomas scott a sponsor of the parental notification 
amendment allowing a child to make such a decision on her own 
scott added is unconscionable 
but some republicans criticized scott for the amendment 
i dont think we can mandate morals or conscience or anything 
else and thats what were trying to do with such amendments 
said republican sen m adela eads

fleeting moment have income to offset his debt hohmann said so 
he wound up owing tax on a jackpot he never saw

producer joseph papp has received pledges of 
more than 60000 after rejecting a 50000 federal arts grant 
because he doesnt like the jesse helmsinspired strings attached 
to it 
donations to papp director of the new york shakespeare 
festival ranged from a 50000 pledge from television producer 
mark goodson to much smaller pledges the new york times reported 
today 
papp rejected a 50000 national endowment for the arts grant 
because nea recipients now must sign a form saying they agree to 
abide by federal antiobscenity legislation 
the legislation was sponsored last fall by helms the republican 
senator from north carolina who objected to government funding for 
exhibits by robert mappelthorpe and andres serrano 
i cannot in all good conscience accept any money from the nea 
as long as the helmsinspired amendment on obscenity is part of our 
agreement papp wrote in a letter to the nea on thursday 
papp said that while he was happy with the private pledges an 
institution like mine needs the continuity of support that the nea 
provides but maybe this will create a climate in which this 
obscenity issue can be dealt with in a different way 
the nea money was supposed to be used for papps annual festival 
latino a monthlong showing of theater movies and music from 
latin american cultures papp said the festival would be sponsored 
from private foundations 
papp said his organization has applied for 550000 in grants 
for the 1990 season but he told the nea we are prepared not to 
accept this money should it be awarded while the helms restriction 
remains in force 
the law says nea grants cannot be used to fund works that depict 
sadomasochism homoeroticism the sexual exploitation of children 
or individuals engaged in sex acts and which when taken as a 
whole do not have serious literary artistic political or 
scientific merit

the governor of the nations no 1 dairy 
state signed into law a 14month restriction on the use of a 
synthetic hormone that increases milk production when injected into 
cows 
the moratorium the nations first prohibition of a product of 
genetic engineering forbids commercial use of bovine somatotropin 
bst until june 1 1991 allowing it only for research 
republican gov tommy g thompson who signed the legislation 
friday vetoed an alternative bill that would have forbidden use of 
the protein until six months after its commercial use is approved 
by the us food and drug administration 
thompson said he did not want the moratorium to extend later 
than 1991 because bst use by farmers in other states could put 
wisconsins dairy industry at a market disadvantage 
the minnesota legislature approved a bill thursday establishing 
a oneyear moratorium if the wisconsin legislation became law 
supporters of the hormone warned that wisconsin dairy farmers 
could be hurt if the state became an island surrounded by 
states that permitted its use opponents contended increased 
production could push milk prices down thus driving smaller dairy 
farmers out of business 
democratic sen russell d feingold a leader of the 
legislatures campaign against bst or bovine growth hormone bgh 
called the bill the first moratorium ever on bgh in the nation 
its more than a victory its a start of what will be a 
national movement feingold said 
democratic rep barbara gronemus said that although the new law 
temporarily prevents farmers from buying the drug the republican 
governors vetoes may not prevent marketing of milk from test 
animals 
it appears that the milk from these test herds could be 
used she said im really disappointed about that aspect of 
it to allow the byproducts to go into the food chain is really 
unacceptable to me 
the moratorium stems from concern by the legislature that 
consumers will be leery of milk from treated cows reducing sales 
of cheese and other dairy products important to wisconsins economy 
some farm organizations argued the drugs ability to increase 
milk production as much as 20 percent would help corporate farms 
with large herds to dominate the market putting smaller family 
farms out of business 
its not feasible for ourselves to build a wall around this 
state and prevent new technology from coming in here the 
governor said its going to be a sad day in wisconsin when we 
stop research 
the diet given treated cattle contains more fat than usual 
critics say the process means added production expense that only 
big farms can afford 
jeffrey remsik a spokesman for the animal health institute 
said chemical companies that are developing bst are disappointed 
with the moratorium 
the new law damages the dairy states chances of attracting 
biotechnology research remsik said the governors action tends 
to undermine the traditional federal regulatory system and sends a 
strong message that wisconsin is not interested in new 
technologies he said 
remsik said a court may have to decide whether the measure 
thompson signed actually triggers the minnesota moratorium

a sharp earthquake jolted the 
eastern san francisco bay area rattling windows and sending 
merchandise tumbling from the shelves of stores 
the quake which measured 46 on the richter scale occurred at 
941 pm friday and was centered in walnut creek about 25 miles 
east of san francisco according to the us geological survey in 
menlo park 
the quake and two aftershocks one at 947 pm measuring 43 
and another at 959 measuring 25 occurred on the concord fault 
and were part of a swarm of mild quakes that shook the normally 
placid fault earlier this month said usgs spokeswoman lou page 
there were no reports of injuries or serious damage but the 
quake spilled items into store aisles in several communities 
susanne desser a waitress at the dennys restaurant in 
danville said that while some customers kind of get a kick out 
of earthquakes others lose their appetites 
a lot of people ordered the quake hit and they didnt want to 
eat she said 
in concord the sixstory mt diablo hospital really shook 
said nursing supervisor mary bacon 
there was a sudden crack and then a rolling that goes on and 
on she said some of the patients and some of the employees 
were shook up and were sick to their stomachs 
the quake knocked out power to 1300 customers in concord east 
of walnut creek and scattered outages were reported in nearby 
alamo said pacific gas amp electric spokesman brad thomas the bay 
area rapid transit district stopped service to check the tracks 
but trains resumed running at 1005 pm 
mild shaking also was felt at the press box at candlestick park 
where the san francisco giants were in the sixth inning of a game 
with the st louis cardinals 
tremors of up to 55 on the richter scale were felt in the bay 
area on april 6 and april 18 none caused any major damage 
the 71magnitude quake that hit the region oct 17 claimed 67 
lives and caused about 71 billion in damage 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake of 4 on the richter scale can cause moderate 
damage in the local area a 5 considerable damage a 7 reading is a 
major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage

a paralyzed woman stricken with an incurable 
disease died within an hour of being taken off a respirator after 
she convinced a judge she wanted to be allowed to die 
albert stussy said his 51yearold wife thelma was 
disconnected from a respirator at 420 pm friday and died between 
505 and 510 pm he and their teenage son and daughter were at 
her bedside at neumann medical center 
we made sure she knew we loved her stussy said friday 
night she was sedated very well with valium they gave her a 
shot every 10 minutes and made sure she wasnt in any pain 
mrs stussy had suffered from lou gehrigs disease or 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for two years and was admitted to 
the hospital in late december the degenerative disease destroys 
the nervous system and paralyzes its victims 
mrs stussy was paralyzed from the neck down and had been in 
constant pain she could not speak but communicated by blinking to 
answer yes and moving her head slightly from side to side to 
answer no 
in an emotional bedside hearing wednesday mrs stussy blinked 
once to tell common pleas court judge nicholas m dalessandro that 
she wanted to be taken off the respirator in a twopage ruling the 
next day the judge granted her wish giving the hospital one week 
to comply 
the ventilator was turned off by hospital staff not by her 
regular physician dr leonard m popowich 
he had some emotional hang up stussy said i didnt 
realize it until today 
popowich testified wednesday that he had no objection to taking 
mrs stussy off the respirator but said he did not want to do it 
personally 
she and her family had asked to have the respirator removed but 
hospital officials fearful of a lawsuit on criminal charges asked 
the judge to decide 
hospital attorney claire obade added that the hospital also was 
forced to go to court because pennsylvania has no statutes and only 
a handful of legal precedents to guide it in righttodie cases 
in asking the court for permission to remove mrs stussy from 
the respirator obade cited a 1987 case in philadelphia involving a 
woman in a similar situation the woman known only as jane 
doe was granted her request

shields in handtohand combat near the shipyard in ulsan a port 
city about 200 miles southeast of seoul 
some estimates said as many as 20000 workers were involved in 
the street protests including many from affiliated hyundai 
companies in the area as evening approached the numbers of 
protesters dwindled to several thousand 
the riot police stormed the closed shipyard to rout about 2000 
workers holed up there 
authorities fired hundreds of teargas shells from at least 10 
armored vans as bulldozers tore down 9foothigh barricades erected 
by the workers an estimated 10000 riot police rushed in wearing 
gas masks and helmets and carrying clubs and shields 
hundreds of workers retaliated by throwing firebombs steel 
bars rocks and pieces of metal strikers fired several rounds from 
at least one of about a dozen homemade canons but it was not known 
if anyone was injured from the blasts 
about 600 combat police arrived in two patrol boats and 
surrounded buildings along the shipyards fourmile seafront three 
police helicopters hovered overhead urging workers to give up 
peacefully 
about 100 workers climbed up a crane to throw firebombs and 
metal pipes at police below some strikers ran into buildings and 
threw debris firebombs and rocks from windows 
columns of black smoke small fires and clouds of tear gas 
filled the shipyard and surrounding area for several hours

vehicles including two buses and five fire engines police and 
news reports said

threatened to spread to other industries negotiations broke down 
just hours before the raid 
the strike was not over wage issues but involved workers 
demands for the release from jail of four union leaders charged 
with starting earlier protests 
the company said the matter was a judicial issue and out of its 
domain 
the government issued a statement defending the shipyard raid 
saying the survival of the national economy was at stake 
opposition politicians demanded a special session of the 
national assembly to investigate labor unrest 
it is extremely regrettable the government carried out a 
militarystyle operation to suppress the workers strike said

the government today applauded a us decision to 
drop japan from a list of unfair trade partners but it said the 
bush administration was wrong to single out india as a violator 
president bush announced friday he would cite only one country 
india as a priority nation under a provision of a us trade 
law that provides for mandatory economic retaliation if foreign 
trade barriers are not removed within a fixed period 
a leading group of private businesses in india today called 
bushs action an unfortunate and an avoidable development the 
group the associated chamber of commerce and industries said both 
the united states and india could have shown greater flexibility in 
dealing with the trade issue 
in a statement in tokyo foreign minister taro nakayama said 
the government of japan welcomes the decision by the us 
government not to name japan a priority foreign country and 
regards this as the proper one 
it has been the policy of the government of japan that 
economic issues between japan and the united states should be 
resolved through dialogue in the spirit of cooperation and joint 
efforts he said 
kabun muto minister of international trade and industry also 
welcomed bushs announcement but he expressed concern about the 
naming of india 
the united states onesidedly cited india as a priority 
nation and i must say this may impair the framework of the 
multilateral freetrade system he said 
the dropping of japan from the list however came as a relief 
to japanese business leaders 
tokumasa yoshida president of mazda motor co told the 
nationally circulated asahi shimbun newspaper that it was 
reasonable for the united states to appreciate recent japanese 
efforts to lessen trade barriers 
but many commentators said the relationship could turn hostile 
unless the japanese continue efforts to open their markets to us 
products 
in todays editorial the asahi shimbun said us retaliation 
may still come if japan cannot show significant improvement in 
allowing foreign competition 
india has steadfastly refused to modify its restrictive trade 
policies which are designed to protect domestic industries by 
limiting foreign investment and imposing high import duties 
india has an 850 million trade surplus with the united states 
compared to japans surplus of 49 billion the japanese surplus 
represents 45 percent of the total us trade deficit of 109 
billion 
the united states is indias largest trading partner indias 
exports consist primarily of clothing diamonds crude oil and 
cashew nuts its chief american imports are fertilizers chemicals 
electronic parts and industrial materials 
under the 1988 us omnibus trade act washington can levy 
tariffs of up to 100 percent on goods imported from a nation judged 
as an unfair trader

the discovery astronauts breathed 
a little sigh of relief after they finished the tricky task of 
putting the hubble space telescope in orbit 
during a news conference this morning from space the five crew 
members said there was little time for talk or celebration 
wednesday when the telescope was released from the shuttles 
50foot robot arm 
you have to realize that had we just spent a pretty tense time 
with a 15 billion telescope and we have a couple billiondollar 
orbiter and we just separated the two and were still within inches 
of each other discovery commander loren shriver said saying 
something was the last thing on my mind 
mission specialist steve hawley who gently guided the robot arm 
as it hoisted the hubble out of the cargo bay said he didnt 
really think about the accomplishment until after it was all over 
only later in the day when we got a chance to take a breath 
and maybe give out a little sigh of relief and think gee we 
actually got it done and at that moment i think we were all very 
pleased and satisfied to be part of the team that did this he 
said 
hawley added that there was really only one tense moment during 
the telescopes deployment just the part from beginning to the 
end 
the crew members took time out today to answer questions radioed 
to them from reporters at the johnson space center in houston and 
goddard space flight center in greenbelt md they were spending 
most of the day stowing their gear and experiments and testing the 
shuttles control systems in preparation for sundays landing at 
edwards air force base calif 
mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were 
prepared to perform an emergency space walk wednesday if there had 
been trouble deploying the telescope they had trained for such a 
procedure for years but one wasnt necessary 
either one of us was trained and ready to work sullivan 
said 
both astronauts already have walked in space on previous 
missions but mccandless admitted to being a little disappointed 
not to have an eva for extravehicular activity or spacewalk 
the astronauts agreed that the mission was a special one since 
hubble will enable astronomers to search the heavens for new worlds 
and clues to creation itself 
almost everybody seems to be familiar with what the telescope 
is and what it was designed to do shriver said 
its hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard 
of the hubble space telescope added pilot charles bolden it 
makes little kids eyes light up it makes little kids want to 
learn how to add and subtract and study science 
and thats extremely gratifying to know that youre part of a 
mission that seems to have excited the nation as well as the world 
about something

a soviet pilot suffering radiation poisoning from 
his efforts to stem the chernobyl nuclear disaster was stable early 
today after undergoing a potentially lifesaving bonemarrow 
transplant 
anatoly grishchenko 53 who has been hailed as a hero in the 
soviet union for his work to put a cement cap on the chernobyl 
reactor suffers from a preleukemia condition 
the lifegiving marrow from a donor in besancon france was 
carried in an ice cooler and rushed to fred hutchinson cancer 
center after arriving at seattletacoma international airport on a 
commercial flight at 5 pm friday bone marrow can lose its 
effectiveness after 24 hours 
the relatively simple transplant began at 653 pm and ended at 
240 am center spokeswoman susan edmonds said 
he is stable he handled the transfusion very well and there 
are no problems she said the next step is to see if the 
marrow will grow 
doctors should know in about three weeks whether the new marrow 
will save grishchenkos life edmonds said 
the procedure follows two weeks of treatment for grishchenko at 
the cancer center including radiation therapy 
edmonds said starting the procedure was as simple as hanging the 
bag of about one quart of marrow and connecting it to a catheter 
leading to grishchenkos heart 
she said a sterile environment was being maintained in his 
hospital room where he would be expected to stay the next 35 to 40 
days 
the marrow donated by a 42yearold woman arrived one day 
after the fourth anniversary of the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 
the ukraine 
grishchenko was honored as a hero for making five flights over 
chernobyl in the four days following an explosion and fire at the 
reactor on april 26 1986 
he flew through the hot intensely radioactive gases spewing 
from the plant to survey the damage and to dump tons of sand and 
wet concrete onto the wreckage 
according to official figures 31 people were killed unofficial 
reports said at least 250 died the blast scattered radioactive 
cesium strontium and plutonium isotopes across much of the 
ukraine byelorussia and russia and sent a cloud of radioactive gas 
around the world 
in september 1988 grishchenko was found to have the medical 
condition typified by low counts of blood platelets needed for 
clotting and of white blood cells to fight infection and disease 
grishchenko is the first chernobyl victim to receive medical 
care in the united states he has up to a 75 percent chance of 
survival without a recurrence of the condition for five years said 
edmonds 
the transplant was arranged by cap parlier light helicopter 
testing and evaluation director for mcdonnell douglas corp who 
said he had spoken to grishchenko a few times by telephone since 
the soviet civilian helicopter test pilot arrived at hutchinson on 
april 11 
the transfusion culminated a drama that began shortly after 
daybreak friday at the jeanminjoz hospital in besancon in 
eastcentral france 
dr patricia stewart of the hutchinson center arrived by 
helicopter at the french hospitals transfusion center and watched 
two french doctors extract nearly a quart of marrow from the donor 
a woman who wanted anonymity in a twohour procedure similar to 
drawing blood 
after the liquid was filtered and packaged for travel stewart 
and the container were rushed by helicopter to geneva for a 
commercial jet flight to seattle via london 
in seattle stewart was met at the door of fred hutchinson 
center by grishchenkos wife galina 
the french donor was located in a search of bone marrow 
registries in the united states france and seven other countries 
her marrow was found to be a near perfect match 
grishchenko who has two sons and a granddaughter was issued 
leadlined clothing and the copters were equipped with extra lead 
shielding he was treated soon after the chernobyl flights for 
radiation sickness

the hubble space telescope was 
awakened from its selfinduced sleep today but it was still without 
the use of its highspeed antennas and its science instruments 
were on hold unable to begin any observations 
we are out of the safemode right now said steve terry a 
supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope he said the 
telescope was running on a normal controlall mode where its 
own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing 
discoverys astronauts meanwhile packed their gear for a 
return to earth sunday made some lastminute observations of earth 
and talked with groundbased reporters about their flight 
pilot charles bolden said he was especially upbeat about the 
widespread public awareness of the telescope which is expected 
eventually to look back 14 billion light years nearly to the 
birth of the universe 
its hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard 
of the hubble space telescope said bolden it makes little 
kids eyes light up it makes little kids want to learn how to add 
and subtract and study science 
the telescopes big eye has remained open but hubble had been 
in a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlier 
problems in linking the highspeed dish antennas with a relay 
satellite the antennas are the primary links for relaying 
scientific data to the ground 
terry said that even in the safe mode one of the tape recorders 
in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and 
that these would be played to earth and analyzed when the antennas 
are working properly 
we expect to use that data to investigate what happened he 
said engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its 
secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for 
scientific data which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed 
were putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode in 
effect a standby mode he said 
shortly after 6 am edt controllers at the goddard space 
flight center in greenbelt md completed a series of commands 
that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run 
a 12hour computer program to monitor hubbles health 
it will take another day before the 15 billion telescope is 
operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup 
process said hubble deputy project manager jean olivier 
were backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful 
approach to these problems olivier said friday this is not 
the time to do anything dumb 
the telescope problems have put the flight center several days 
behind but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week 
were sticking to their schedule 
landing is scheduled for 948 am edt sunday at edwards air 
force base calif but flight controllers were keeping a close 
watch on the weather 
winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph 
mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at 
touchdown 
the shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days 
beyond sunday if necessary nasa said 
mission control awakened the crew members at about 130 am edt 
today by playing the song cosmos 
thanks for the wakeup music its pretty appropriate for 
today said commander loren shriver 
the song was selected in honor of hubble space telescope 
which is now open for business said mission control commentator 
james hartsfield 
the astronauts were to finish up their experiments and 
photography today and pack for the trip home they also planned to 
hold a news conference from space with reporters at the johnson 
space center 
shriver and pilot charles bolden were to run through a series of 
tests to make certain the shuttles computers and control jets were 
ready for return to earth 
the crew deployed hubble on wednesday but they had stayed close 
to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture 
door mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan 
were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in 
orbit 380 miles above earth 
but that proved unnecessary when the door was opened friday 
morning exposing the telescopes finely polished 945inch eye to 
starlight for the first time 
two of hubbles four positionstabilizing gyroscopes stopped 
working when the door opened but engineers later got them back on 
line the gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that too 
kept the telescope in the safe mode said dave drachlis director 
of orbital verifications at goddard 
a colleague steve terry said hubbles systems were set at 
conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many 
malfunctions there also were two communications outages totaling 
several hours 
hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of 
its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications 
system is lost for extended periods terry said 
nasa had planned to release its first test image from the 
telescope on tuesday showing an open star cluster in the 
constellation carina but terry said that would be delayed because 
of the antenna problems scientific data will follow in a month or 
two 
the telescope named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble 
will enable astronomers over its 15year working lifetime to look 
back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the 
universe 
the universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion 
years ago in a cosmic explosion 
hubble provided the basis for the bigbang theory of creation 
he discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and 
that the farther the galaxy is from earth the faster it is moving 
away

serving 27 years for sabotage 
police set up roadblocks at entrances to the township turning 
away some vehicles and questioning people headed to the funeral 
panafricanist congress leaders said more mourners would have come 
if not for the police action 
the panafricanist congress broke away from the african national 
congress in the 1950s and disagrees with the ancs policies of 
negotiating with the white government and recognizing white 
ownership of land 
cunningham noxukwana general secretary of a pacaffiliated 
union organization spoke at the funeral criticizing the ancs 
plans to hold talks next week with president fw de klerk our 
choice is to fight on said noxukwana a sellout is very thick 
in the air

some of it is hype some of it is genuine 
commitment and some is begrudging acceptance of reality whatever 
american corporations are becoming environmentalists or at least 
environmentally conscious 
this years crop of glossy annual reports sent by corporations 
to stockholders every spring is green with environmentalism firms 
are eager to tell about their good citizenship on planet earth 
texaco brags that mussels taken from its offshore oil rigs are 
served in the finest california restaurants 
dow chemical touts the environmental awards it has won 
carolina power amp light tells how conservation has saved 175 
million kilowatts 
even the tiny central vermont public service corp wants 
stockholders to know that it has invested in a power generating 
plant that burns waste wood 
not so long ago business was hostile to environmentalism it 
saw the movement as an advocate of restrictions that would impede 
operations require big nonrevenue generating outlays undermine 
competitiveness 
environmentalists were looked on in corporate boardrooms as 
pointy headed liberals that really didnt know business says 
bruce smart former commerce department official in the reagan 
administration 
we had a lot of namecalling a lot of rhetoric on both 
sides says alexander trowbridge former president of the 
national association of manufacturers and former oil executive but 
as it turned out he says environmental improvement has been a 
corollary to economic growth 
still theres some grumbling 
marco inc in the business of producing coal and natural gas 
and transporting natural gas complains in its annual report 
each of our business segments has the potential to be impacted 
adversely by the environment issues being debated both in 
washington dc and in states throughout the country 
we believe that many of these issues are being addressed 
politically rather than with a more deliberate approach based on a 
sound rational review of scientific data 
and inland steel industries in its annual report says a 
democratic clean air bill in the senate would have imposed 
standards unscientific and unattainable for steel and other 
affected industries 
but they are exceptions most companies which make a potentially 
polluting product or use a polluting process have become 
environmentally prideful 
mussels are especially sensitive to pollutants yet they 
thrive on the legs of texacos habitat platform off the coast of 
california says texacos annual report 
when a marine firm discovered that the water around the 
platform exceeds stronger state water quality requirements for 
growing mussels it arranged with texaco to gather the mussels from 
the platform and sell them to gourmet restaurants from los angeles 
to san francisco texaco says 
phelps dodge corp which produces one billion tons of copper a 
year tells of plans to cover a 60yearold pile of tailings with a 
golf course 
simply complying with environmental regulations is not 
enough the company says 
papermaking is a waterintensive process it takes thousands 
of gallons to make a ton of coated paperboard says the mead 
corp so how much extra water will be pumped from the river for use 
in meads new 1000tonaday coated board expansion in alabama 
none thanks to the fact that water once used only for cooling 
will be recycled and used in the manufacturing process 
dow chemical tells one of its secrets dow gives plant 
managers a direct incentive to reduce waste by charging each plant 
for all waste management costs 
dow brags it has reduced its plants air emissions by 85 percent 
since 1974 and seeks to cut them another 50 percent in five years 
nearly 75 million pounds of polyethylene milk bottles became 
drain pipes lumber replacements and recycling containers in 
1989 says dow nearly all the scrap from dows plastic foam 
production is recycled or sold rather than being disposed of in 
landfills 
mcdonalds corp which had been taking a public relations 
beating because of all that greasy waste paper and polystyrene it 
generates fills its annual report with conservation messages 
inside mcdonalds reprints a letter received from dan getty 
11 if we stop wasting resources our land will be clean if we 
dont stop we wont have anything left 
perhaps in response mcdonalds came up with a mcsolution 
mcrecycle a 100 million plan to buy high chairs 
wastebaskets insulation from recycled materials and to use paper 
bags made from recycled newspapers its first step was to ballyhoo 
the program in fullpage newspaper ads

european community leaders today opened 
talks to consider french and german appeals for faster movement 
toward a political merger of their 12 nations 
french president francois mitterrand prime minister margaret 
thatcher of britain and west german chancellor helmut kohl joined a 
stream of prime ministers and their aides at the medieval dublin 
castle on an overcast day in dublin the irish capital 
the western european nations who already plan to form a single 
open market by the end of 1992 are now beginning to discuss ways 
of bringing their political systems into closer alignment 
reacting to the profound political changes in eastern europe 
mitterrand and kohl are urging faster movement toward a political 
union 
mrs thatcher was expected to oppose their calls for a political 
union of the economic community trading bloc by 1993 
ec officials were also expected to discuss plans for 
reunification of the two germanys the original reason for todays 
meeting before the french and german appeals for political unity 
surfaced 
also on the agenda is a plan to forge closer relations with the 
emerging democracies in eastern europe and draw them closer to the 
west 
before discussing political union the leaders endorsed a 
threestage plan for bringing east germany into the european 
community the agreement would benefit east germanys backward 
economy by bringing it into a trade bloc of 320 million people 
west germany is already an influential ec member 
the first stage calls for an interim adjustment period starting 
july 2 when the two germanys merge their currencies the second 
stage begins with formal unification of the two germanys which is 
planed for late next year from then on community laws will apply 
to what is now east german territory but it will be allowed 
certain exemptions for example on rules about state subsidies and 
environmental regulations in the final stage for which no 
deadline has been set all european community rules would apply 
security was tight in the citys center for the gathering 
authorities banned aircraft from flying over the 13thcentury 
castle and deployed the rangers an elite antiterrorist unit 
mrs thatcher is a prime target of the irish republican army 
which tried to assassinate her with a bomb in 1984 the ira is 
fighting to rid northern ireland of british rule and unite the 
province with the irish republic 
the officials talks could be heated at the oneday summit 
we hear a great deal about political union a british 
government spokesman said on condition of anonymity today but he 
told reporters mrs thatcher will try to get behind the words and 
get their meaning 
mrs thatcher has resisted radical plans for the economic and 
monetary unity 
analysts say a political merger of the ec countries probably 
would include a common foreign and security policy some predict 
the ec countries eventually will become a kind of united states of 
europe but still maintain their distinct languages and cultures 
some leaders in the trading bloc like the mitterrandkohl 
proposal 
irelands prime minister charles haughey told reporters 
friday look at the speed of change in europe in the last few 
months are we to be stranded on the beach of inactivity 
i am keen on moving to political union and i want to take the 
summit as far forward as it can he said 
haughey said mrs thatcher was not alone in her concerns 
however 
not just the british but other member states have perhaps 
reservations or at least questions that they want to ask he 
told rte the irish state television 
the community already is pressing to remove by late 1992 the 
many barriers preventing the free flow of money goods services 
and people among the countries 
moreover it has begun a drive for an economic and monetary 
union which would lead to a single currency and system of central 
banks a special conference will open in december to change the 
ecs founding treaty to permit the creation of new institutions 
the european community members are belgium britain denmark 
france germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the 
netherlands portugal and spain

business and organized labor say 
brazils economic shock plan is driving the nation toward 
recession but the poor think president fernando collor de mello 
has the right idea 
i hadnt eaten meat in so long id forgotten what it tasted 
like said derly rosa perreira dos santos 25 who works as a 
maid and lives in a shantytown of rios poor north zone now i 
can afford it twice a week 
record annualized inflation of 4854 percent has fallen 
dramatically since collor announced his new brazil plan march 
16 one day after taking office as the countrys first 
democratically elected president in 29 years 
it put an 18month freeze on savings deposits of more than 
1200 and limited withdrawals from money market funds to 600 or 
20 percent of the value whichever was greater 
about 115 billion was frozen 80 percent of all bank deposits 
in latin americas largest economy 
collor also cut spending imposed new taxes and promised to sell 
many of the 188 stateowned companies to eliminate the 31 billion 
federal budget deficit 
there is disagreement over the inflation rate for april the 
government says zero and several independent institutions estimate 
25 percent but all agree the threat of hyperinflation is gone 
food and medicine are cheaper and the bus fare has stopped 
rising every week said mrs dos santos who has two children and 
rides the bus to work ive even been able to save a little money 
the past month 
spending on cheap housewares and appliances has surged 
our stores in poor areas are selling about 10 to 15 percent 
more said fernando martinho of the telerio chain of appliance 
stores our outlets in middle class and wealthy areas report 
stagnant sales or even a small drop 
mrs dos santos said that if inflation remained low she hoped 
to buy a mattress for her children who sleep on blankets on the 
floor of the familys concrete hut 
poor brazilians have little sympathy for wealthy people with 
frozen bank accounts now referred to in the press as nouveau 
poor 
more than half the workers in brazil earn 150 a month or less 
while the richest 10 percent of the countrys 150 million people 
live in luxury 
nilda modena da silva praised collor for freezing the accounts 
and said while i had no money to buy bread the rich threw food 
in the trash 
she is not happy about zero inflation however because that 
means pay will not go up and how can he collor freeze a 
mothers salary 
mrs da silva works as a janitor and supports her two children 
on the minimum wage of about 75 a month 
opinion about the economic plan seems evenly divided in the 
middle class but collor gets low marks from the rich 
a survey by the respected firm research international found a 
sense among the upper 10 percent of reduced social standing loss 
and humiliation 
antonio ermirio de moraes president of the votorantin group 
brazils biggest private company said on a television talk show he 
considered emigrating after having 500 million caught in the 
freeze 
many businessmen feel betrayed because they supported collor 
against socialist luis inacio lula da silva in the december 
election they accuse the president of reneging on promises of 
freemarket reform 
we are living in an economic dictatorship said business 
consultant alexandre barros never in the history of this country 
has there been so little economic freedom 
the name of the game is no longer to be an effcient 
entrepeneur but to be a political operator who can pressure the 
government into releasing your money there are no market criteria 
at all 
organized labor agrees with management in this case 
official figures say unemployment has grown from 35 percent to 
more than 9 percent since march 15 
the huge foreignowned auto plants that ring sao paulo 
brazils largest city have put 80 percent of their employees on 
furlough and about 300000 construction workers have been laid off 
this plan will lead to a depression far worse than the 
hyperinflationary spiral which it was supposedly going to save us 
from said jose olivio miranda of the central workers union the 
largest labor federation which represents about 12 million workers 
layoffs have led thousands of people who migrated to the 
industrialized south to return home in midapril buses from sao 
paulo to the poor northeast carried 1700 passengers a day twice 
the usual number 
gustavo franco an economist at rios pontifical catholic 
university said a downturn was necessary to curb inflation 
once the cost of living comes down it is relatively simple to 
restart growth he said we have a very strong economy with a 
solid industrial base 
luiz carlos bresser pereira a former finance minister said 
the government has taken necessary steps to permanently bring 
down inflation first we need to stabilize the economy then the 
government should implement policies to help the poor 
herbert de souza director of the brazilian institute of social 
and economic analysis is less sanguine 
with the poverty weve got brazil cant take a deep 
recession he said 
the first impact of the plan may have helped the poor but 
that is temporary and will be erased with a recession the measures 
are now popular because people are looking at the immediate impact 
and not consequences

enter maria a doctor in havana who was a 28yearold widow in 
1985 
a cousin of mustelier who lived in miami was marias close 
friend the cousin asked her to write mustelier because no one 
else did and to mail him reading material and money for 
incidentals 
she agreed never thinking the relationship would develop 
he never thought about love she said he had had two 
marriages that did not work out he had this idea of dedication to 
the fatherland and he did not think about romance 
i would write every week he would say he looked at the world 
through my eyes i would tell him how things were on the street 
about fashion what i saw on tv 
the affection that developed between us was first a great and 
powerful friendship and later a love developed i didnt think 
he would fall in love with me through letters and of course when 
he told me i was in shock 
for much of their correspondence he had never even seen her 
photograph 
mustelier who is white did not know she was black maria said 
racial issues intrude on personal relationships in cuba although 
not nearly so much as in the united states 
she tried twice to visit him in the prison at santiago 600 
miles from havana but was turned away because she was not a close 
relative 
in the spring of 1987 mustelier and some other inmates were 
moved to a prison in the capital 
she will never forget the day they met june 12 1987 
three months later they were married in a twohour prison 
ceremony with about 20 people in attendance the wedding banquet 
was ice cream soda and snacks 
after that she could see him every 21 days 
each time she said since early morning my heart was 
pounding because i knew i was going to see him 
her husband knew she had no time to eat before the visits so he 
sometimes saved his meager lunch for her 
he would bring me his lunch his piece of chicken his piece 
of meat she said 
on one visit two years ago the male guards stripsearched 
maria and sexually abused her mustelier was enraged and refused to 
eat for 19 days 
in addition to the consequences of hunger strikes mustelier 
said he suffers from the results of cruel treatment 
castro has claimed there never has been an instance of torture 
in more than 31 years of the cuban revolution but here are some of 
musteliers complaints 
for two years he was held in a white cell with nothing but a 
500watt electric bulb the constant glare made him nearsighted 
and the condition is becoming progressively worse 
loud horns blown by guards to keep him from sleeping cost him 
40 percent of his hearing 
his arms and legs bear the scars of bayonet attacks by guards 
and his jaw was broken once musteliers legs still are inflamed 
from the last hunger strike 
he once was handcuffed to two other inmates and placed in a cell 
six feet high six long and three wide if two of them lay 
sidebyside the third had to lie on top because of the handcuffs 
after 24 hours mustelier managed to remove the handcuffs the 
guards threatened to put them back on but he said for you to 
put the chains back on youll have to kill us 
an officer sided with the inmates and although the three were 
kept in the cell several more days they were not handcuffed 
despite his prison ordeal mustelier looks surprisingly healthy 
perhaps younger than his 47 years seven weeks after ending his 
last hunger strike he has gained 40 pounds and worries about 
becoming fat 
if he is embittered he doesnt show it laughter often 
punctuates his stories of life in prison even his description of 
being overrun by roaches and mosquitos 
we used to say they were the big allies of our jailers he 
said 
did he ever count the days during his 105day hunger strike 
no because after counting them you worry and this weighs on 
you he said and laughed again 
yoga and an hour of physical exercise every day helped mustelier 
endure the long confinement like maria he found comfort in 
religion 
in his last hunger strike his rosary was always with him 
he showed a visitor a book of religious verses he had since 
1988 despite daily use it was nearly in mint condition 
he opened the book with great care not touching the pages 
beyond the margins 
every verse filled me with peace and tranquillity he said 
mustelier wrote love poems to maria whom he calls caruca and 
gave her a collection of them in september for their second wedding 
anniversary 
one translated from the spanish reads 
your appearance produces not only happiness but joy 
happiness is a momentary state of emotion joy is a state of 
satisfaction and deep feeling with that i will look upon you as a 
gift of spring

corp in london on friday night quoted bronius kuzmickas the 
deputy chairman of lithuanias supreme council legislature as 
saying that a parliamentary delegation had met with some 
highranking officials in moscow 
but the officials reiterated gorbachevs position that no talks 
with the government would take place unless lithuania halts its 
drive for independence the radio said 
in moscow today the national supreme soviet heard a formal 
resignation by lithuanian deputies and a declaration by estonian 
deputies that they would suspend their membership until moscow 
began formal talks with their republic on independence soviet 
television reported 
estonian deputies hold 13 places in the 542member supreme 
soviet lithuanian deputies who have attended only as observers 
since their republic declared independence on march 11 held 15 
places 
the soviet union annexed lithuania estonia and latvia in 1940 
the parliament of estonia has voted to become independent at an 
unspecified later date and latvia is scheduled to vote on the 
issue next week 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene said her 
government still hopes to begin talks without backing off 
independence decisions but it is considering a proposed temporary 
freeze on secessionist actions as the maximum concession it might 
offer moscow 
this is a compromise which should be viewed as the maximum 
this is the limit she told a friday night news conference 
according to the soviet news agency tass 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis has said the 
republics legislature the supreme council will consider the 
freeze proposal which came from the leaders of france and germany 
the legislature is scheduled to reconvene wednesday 
gorbachevs spokesman arkady maslennikov called the proposal 
for lithuania to temporarily suspend its secessionist actions a 
constructive signal reflecting growing sentiment in lithuania 
and abroad that the republic must return to the road of reason 
lithuania wants an immediate dialogue landsbergis said friday 
and a termination of the soviet economic blockade against 
lithuania would be beneficial to the atmosphere of this dialogue 
the kremlin has imposed a blockade on gas oil and other 
supplies to lithuania as part of the effort to force the republic 
to stop its independence movement 
tass reported today that coal had been added to the embargo 
list much of the coal lithuania consumes is imported from poland 
and the republic owes about 16 million for coal supplies so they 
have been stopped the news agency said 
vilnius radio reported that medicines including antibiotics were 
in short supply but that the situation was not believed to be 
critical 
on friday in washington state department spokesman richard 
boucher said mrs prunskiene had been granted a us visa for 
unofficial business travel he said she was expected to visit 
sometime next week 
the united states and other western countries have refused to 
impose sanctions on the soviet union for its efforts to stop 
lithuanias independence drive 
on thursday 52yearold stanislovas jamaitis died of burns 
suffered when he doused his clothes with gasoline and set himself 
ablaze in front of the bolshoi theater in central moscow to protest

lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis the supreme council 
released the texts on friday said spokeswoman rita radzavicius

saying it spoke of an impossible family life and a desire to 
commit suicide 
the version released by lithuanian authorities apologized for 
something bad in his marriage but stressed political motives 
i went to moscow to set myself on fire he said in both 
notes 
the occupiers have cut off energy supplies and people are 
being thrown out of work jamaitis wrote 
he would kill himself to let gorbachev know that lithuanians 
will not live in a lithuania that is not independent said the 
note read by the spokeswoman

thousands of abortion opponents gathered in 
washington today trying to impress the nation with their strength 
at a rally for life on the grassy mall by the washington 
monument 
president bush was addressing the group by a remote telephone 
hookup vice president dan quayle was appearing in person along 
with catholic cardinals country and gospel singers and 
antiabortion leaders 
sponsors declined to predict the size of the crowd but hoped to 
rival the police estimate of 300000 people who attended a rally by 
supporters of abortion rights a year ago 
the first the more than 2000 bus loads of people that sponsors 
expected began arriving friday evening rallygoers walked 
washington streets and crowded the citys metro subway system as 
they began assembling this morning 
a small group of counterprotesters carried keep abortion 
legal signs drawing honks from sympathetic drivers passing by 
and exchanging waves with abortion opponents 
catholic cardinal james hickey conducted a mass for the abortion 
protesters on the eve of the rally and new york cardinal john 
oconnor head of the churchs prolife committee planned a mass 
at the conclusion 
the event was aimed at trying to reverse the impression that 
antiabortion forces have been in political decline it comes at a 
time when their side has sustained a series of losses in elections 
and in state capitals 
at least part of the motive is to try to reverse what we feel 
is a misperception about the strength of the right to life movement 
and also to give some politicians who might be wavering a little 
bit of backbone said gary l bauer president of the family 
research council and a white house aide in the reagan 
administration 
we hope to impress the congress we hope to impress the 
nation said dr jc willke president of the national right to 
life committee the lobbying group sponsoring the rally 
since the supreme courts socalled webster decision last 
summer in which states were given more leeway to restrict 
abortions candidates who support legal abortions have won 
elections for governor of virginia and new jersey and lieutenant 
governor of virginia and they have succeeded in blocking abortion 
restrictions in many state legislatures 
in addition a number of candidates for office this year have 
switched positions to support abortion rights and despite a 
strongly antiabortion plank in the republican partys platform 
party officials have made clear they do not want the issue to be a 
litmus test for the partys candidates or supporters 
they have a public perception problem eddie mahe a 
political consultant to republican candidates on both sides of the 
issue said of the antiabortion forces there is clearly the 
perception the movement is on the prochoice side 
abortion opponents acknowledge they have been frustrated by the 
other sides success in framing public debate on the issue as a 
question of a womans right to make her own reproductive decisions 
our first goal is to keep up front in the public eye the 
unborn child said father john gouldrick executive director of 
the national conference of bishops secretariat for prolife 
activities that seems to have been lost in the debate since 
webster 
the rally for life is being billed as a celebration rather than 
a protest or march among those scheduled to appear were christian 
singer sandi patti and country singer terri gibbs 
nancy myers spokeswoman for the right to life group said more 
than 2000 buses were arriving for the rally from as far away as 
california including 425 from pennsylvania 
kate michelman head of the national abortion rights action 
league called the event an attempt by the antichoice minority 
to recoup some of their strength because theyve been losing 
she criticized bush and quayle for supporting the rally 
as long as this small vocal minority of americans has the 
support of the two most powerful politicians in america the threat 
to choice is very real and a fundamental freedom hangs by a 
thread michelman said

police raided two homes and found nearly 
100 antiquities dating from the stone age to the byzantine period 
police said saturday 
the treasures discovered friday include jewelery weapons 
coins glassware earthenware statuettes and parts of urns the 
official said on condition of anonymity 
police would not say what prompted the raid in krania 12 miles 
northwest of this central greek town 
this is certainly the greatest haul in the area and possibly 
in the whole of greece considering the uniqueness of two or three 
of the finds and the rarity of the rest there was a spearhead from 
4000 bc which an archaeologist here says is unique he said by 
telephone 
the finds were hidden in the homes of a 26yearold laborer and 
a 32yearold miner who were detained the official said 
according to the official the objects date from the stone age 
to the fall of the byzantine empire in 1453

a 15yearold girl killed a man who she 
said had chained her to a tree and raped her repeatedly for three 
weeks and police used the mans handdrawn map to search for the 
remains of two other missing girls 
the girl told police she was abducted by phillip e clopton 39 
of louisville and that she got free and killed him thursday with 
his own shotgun while he slept 
federal and state police began a search in three central 
kentucky counties after a map and a journal found friday at 
cloptons backwoods campsite in la rue county indicated two girls 
had been killed and dismembered divers also scoured the rolling 
fork river but nothing was found police said 
larue county sheriff merle edlin said the map was not too 
detailed but all of the burial plots except one were close to 
or in water 
although edlin said earlier that officials would resume the 
search today if rain held off a state police dispatcher in 
elizabethtown said late this morning that officials decided not to 
continue the search at this point and would pursue other aspects of 
the case 
they are going to follow up some leads theyve got said the 
dispatcher charles mattingly he said some people would be 
interviewed but he had no other details 
kentucky state police lt wayne edwards said the girl killed 
clopton rather than running away because she feared he would wake 
up and track her down 
shes 15 years old and she was petrified he said 
the girl had several bruises but did not appear to be 
malnourished edwards said she was treated at hardin memorial 
hospital in elizabethtown and released to her father 
another man 41yearold james r cable was arrested in the 
case thursday night in louisville and charged with firstdegree 
rape and sodomy cable was being held in the larue county jail 
under 250000 bond on each count 
edlin said cable was not suspected in the killings but may have 
distributed the body parts his relationship with clopton who had 
been previously imprisoned for sodomy and rape was not immediately 
clear 
the fbi and police had been searching for clopton in the 
disappearance of all three girls who authorities and family 
friends said were acquainted 
officials had identified the missing girls as bridgett allen and 
sherry wilson two 14yearolds from louisville who left home in 
january edlin said 
kentucky state police detective robert foster said the 
15yearold girl initially left louisville willingly with clopton 
but there obviously came time when she wanted to get away 
the girls 18yearold sister however told the courierjournal 
of louisville that her sister was kidnapped she didnt run away 
everybody thought she ran away but she didnt the sister was 
quoted as saying 
the girl said she took a shotgun while the man slept in a tent 
and killed him with a single shot to the head she said she walked 
several miles from the campsite half a mile deep in the woods off 
a gravel road about 15 miles east of hodgenville and called the 
state police from a store 
a police report did not reveal how she freed herself edlin said 
state police said they found a map and a spiralbound notebook 
in which clopton described killing at least two people 
dismembering them and scattering their parts in rural areas of 
larue hardin and nelson counties 
the map roughly sketched in pen on a piece of notebook paper 
included the missing girls names and the spots in which various 
body parts supposedly were buried edlin said 
bridgett allens mother cathy told the lexington heraldleader 
that she went to clopton in late february or early march looking 
for her daughter but he wouldnt tell her anything 
ms allen said police had told her that cloptons diary said the 
bodies of the two girls were in his louisville apartment at the 
time 
at the campsite police found two footlockers full of canned 
goods and other supplies and a makeshift toilet a nearby creek 
served as a cooler there were also cooking supplies sleeping 
bags clothing and survival books 
neighbors said the campsite was on land once owned by cloptons

mongolian opposition groups on saturday protested 
for a second straight day in their capital of ulan bator despite a 
stern warning from the communist government that they were breaking 
the law 
about 4000 people mostly young gathered for two hours across 
the street from the government palace according to sources in the 
mongolian capital interviewed by telephone 
one of their banners demanded the resignation of president 
punsalmaagiin ochirbat whom it nicknamed iron mask ochirbat 
and depicted in a tank with missiles flying from his face 
the reference was to a speech tuesday in which ochirbat rejected 
opposition demands for the communistdominated legislature to 
resign and said the state is empowered to and will show an iron 
mask in the face of opposition activity 
mongolian television warned friday night that illegal 
demonstrators faced 30 days in jail and fines of about 90 more 
than the average monthly wage ochirbat issued a regulation this 
month requiring advance permission for all demonstrations 
the official newspaper unen published a government statement 
saturday accusing the protesters of trying to usurp power and 
jeopardize the state the statement was reported by chinas 
official xinhua news agency 
the hardline response to the latest series of protests seems to 
indicate the government is losing patience after five months of 
prodemocracy demonstrations that have won major concessions 
the ruling mongolian communists gave up their constitutional 
right to power last month and agreed to the first multiparty 
elections in the countrys history 
but the opposition groups made up largely of young urban 
professionals have accused the communists of writing the election 
law to guarantee their own victory 
when they tried to form a picket line friday around the 
government palace to demand the legislatures resignation soldiers 
and police got there first and formed a protective cordon around 
the building 
the security forces were unarmed and the protesters left 
peacefully after several hours it was the first such confrontation 
between protesters and security forces since the democracy movement 
began in december inspired by political reforms elsewhere in the 
soviet bloc 
the sources said speeches at saturdays protest criticized the 
governments use of troops only a few uniformed police stood by 
saturday and by evening security forces removed some of the 
barriers they had erected around the government palace 
in a brief speech over television and radio friday night one of 
the key opposition leaders zorig said they would continue 
struggling for change through peaceful means 
government and communist party officials have pledged repeatedly 
not to use force they apparently believe that some reforms are 
inevitable and that they can best stay in power by leading reforms 
rather than resisting 
xinhua has rarely reported on mongolias demonstrations but has 
carried reports whenever the government there issues warnings that 
coincide with chinese leaders view that popular demonstrations are 
dangerous it reported ochirbats decree restricting 
demonstrations for example

india on saturday warned pakistan it 
would not tolerate infringement of its sovereignty in the border 
state of kashmir and a government spokesman refused to rule out 
raids on guerrilla camps in pakistan 
there will be no compromise on the measures necessary to 
protect our integrity the government said in a prepared 
statement read by foreign ministry spokesman aftab seth 
asked whether india was prepared to send its troops across the 
frontier to eliminate guerrilla training camps in 
pakistanicontrolled territory seth said we rule nothing out 
he said indianpakistani relations would not improve until 
there is credible evidence on the ground that pakistan is 
desisting from its abetment of terror and violence 
an escalation of violence by moslem militants in kashmir and the 
ensuing crackdown by indian government troops have brought india 
and pakistan to one of their worst crises since their 1971 war the 
third one between the two countries since they became independent 
from britain in 1947 
both countries have reinforced their troops along the border and 
the contested kashmir frontier each side has said it does not want 
war but has accused the other of fomenting a climate that could 
lead to one 
the latest indian statement was issued in response to remarks by 
pakistans foreign minister sahabzada yaqubkhan at a news 
conference thursday at un headquarters in new york yaqubkhan 
called the kashmir situation extremely grim and said it would 
be accurate to say that within the last two weeks a war psychosis 
has been created 
saturdays indian statement said yaqubkhan omitted to 
mention perhaps deliberately that this situation was the direct 
and inevitable outcome of pakistans attempts to train arm aid 
and abet terrorism directed against india 
pakistan has repeatedly denied it trains or harbors kashmiri 
militants who want to secede from india 
the indian statement also accused pakistan governments both 
central and provincial of trying to raise funds to support the 
separatist movement 
the internal situation in kashmir is the creation of 
pakistansupported and assisted terrorists these guntoting 
religious fundamentalists have indulged in arson kidnappings 
terrorizing the civilian population killings of innocent citizens 
murder of officials discharging their duties the statement said 
at least 308 people have been killed in kashmir since jan 20 
when indian troops launched a crackdown on the separatists most of 
those slain were moslem militants or supporters shot by indian 
troops during antiindia demonstrations or while defying curfews 
kashmir was a princely state when indian and pakistan were 
partitioned along religious lines into separate nations pakistan 
moved into the northern third of kashmir while the rest came under 
indian control as part of the state of jammukashmir 
today jammukashmir is the only moslemmajority state in 
predominantly hindu india sixtyfour percent of jammukashmirs 6 
million people are moslems but nationwide only 12 percent of the 
880 million indians are moslems

richard gephardt thinks maybe he was a little 
ahead of the curve on japan 
during the 1988 presidential campaign people accused him of 
bashing japan on its trade policies they called him protectionist 
today however he says a lot more people are in his camp 
particularly democrats who sense a good issue for 1992 
there is a greater understanding on the part of a lot of 
people especially about our problems with japan and a few of the 
other countries where there are really significant trade access 
problems the missouri democratic congressman said 
while president bush is receiving nearrecord high job 
performance ratings in opinion polls some analysts believe us 
trade problems with japan could emerge as an issue against the 
republican president in 1992 
its the biggest longterm danger to the bush 
administration said democratic pollster stanley greenberg 
when bush announced friday that he was removing japan from the 
hit list of countries judged by the administration to have the 
most offensive trade barriers against us products members of 
congress were quick to protest 
it is clear that japan should be on the list said sen don 
riegle dmich our government is not using the tools that are 
available to correct this continuing hemorrhage of us capital and 
jobs 
trade access problems thats the polite term used by people 
upset by the 49 billion deficit in the us trade balance with 
japan some americans feeling the heat of competition with japan 
are apt to be less polite 
for example try the radio ad run by a suburban washington auto 
dealer 
in an accent distinctly japanese a man is heard admiring an 
american car at a fictitious tokyo auto show 
an incredulous american voice asks havent you ever seen a 
safford lincoln continental before 
only in magazines is the reply japanese have too many 
import restrictions and taxes to see one in person 
i wouldnt phrase it as japan bashing obviously said sen 
john breaux of louisiana chairman of the senate democratic 
campaign committee but i think it is a very legitimate issue 
people in the hinterlands and middle america are feeling we are 
giving away our technology 
there is a frustration americans feel over not controlling 
their own destiny said michael mccurry communications director 
of the democratic national committee 
but mccurry and other politicians questioned the longterm value 
of japan bashing 
bashing japan gets you the audience said the dnc official 
but you have to make a pretty sophisticated argument about what 
you would do 
ohio is one of the states where people feel hardest hit by 
competition from japan jim ruvolo the states democratic party 
chairman recalled that during the 1988 presidential campaign the 
ohio party produced and ran a television spot that directly 
attacked japanese trade practices 
when that ad ran democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis gained six points in the state 
frank greer a democratic political consultant said that among 
many americans there is anxiety we are slipping behind but he 
said people are as likely to blame american management practices as 
they are to point to japanese trade policies 
the japan bashing i dont think you can tell yet said bob 
teeter a republican pollster and adviser to bush i think its 
one of those things that has the potential on the surface to work 
for you and under the surface to backfire 
i dont think outandout bashing works anymore said 
greenberg who has examined public attitudes toward japan you 
can run on putting our own house in order putting america first 
about watching out for our interests and not being taken advantage 
of and with japan as the primary example of a country that is 
taking advantage of our good will 
he said japan could become an issue against bush if there were 
an economic downturn 
i think the bush administration seen as standing by while 
the japanese became more and more dominant would become a major 
political problem said greenberg 
attitudes toward japan differ 
in the midwest where the automobile industry has been hit hard 
politicians can attack japanese trade practices with impunity 
in california feelings are more complex 
i think theres a great concern about becoming too 
jingoistic said former california gov edmund g brown jr now 
the states democratic party chairman 
it may look good in a primary or a given state race but when 
you look at how imbedded we are in a world economy its going to be 
very difficult for somebody to get very far by bashing key elements 
of our own stability

the montana council for international visitors on monday 
canceled the groups two appearances in the state scheduled for 
may 69 saying the controversy had destroyed the chance for 
meaningful dialogue 
the us information agency the tours sponsor defends it as a 
means of exposing the soviet writers to democracy in action 
usia spokesman frank s johnson jr has said i dont know 
that they are antisemitic i dont know that they are not either 
we feel very strongly that pluralism in this country is worth 
talking about and observing

sent in census forms

senators are giving up efforts to reach a 
bipartisan compromise on campaign finance reform and instead 
putting the finishing touches this week on rival republican and 
democratic bills 
although lawmakers are still uncertain of precisely what they 
are being asked to support majority leader george mitchell wants 
to bring the issue to the senate floor by the end of the week 
the debate should send off sparks and occupy the senate for 
quite a while as the parties jockey for position 
democrats already are trying to pin the obstructionist label on 
republicans while gop lawmakers are countering with a bill of their 
own to be unveiled early this week 
mitchell a maine democrat and minority leader bob dole 
rkan each met with their followers last week to explain the 
workings of the bills but lawmakers were still flyspecking the 
proposals for clues as to how they might affect their political 
futures 
everybody wants campaign finance reform but they dont quite 
agree on what that is sen james sasser dtenn said as he 
emerged from a caucus 
dole and mitchell named a task force of academic and 
professional campaign experts in january to come up with bipartisan 
recommendations 
last month the panel proposed changes that called for painful 
sacrifices from both parties the two leaders cautiously embraced 
the chief recommendation socalled flexible ceilings on campaign 
spending but their followers balked at the notion 
unfortunately the parties dont have much common ground 
said senate democratic whip alan cranston of california i think 
well pass a bill how strong it will be remains to be seen 
by a 2to1 margin republicans last week rejected the flexible 
ceilings which would abolish specific limits on how much 
candidates could raise from outside their states they called for 
an end to political action committees pacs which provide funds 
to candidates often on behalf of lobbies 
dole acknowledged that abolishing pacs would most likely be held 
an unconstituional infringment on the freedom of speech but 
republicans have prepared a fallback position calling for the 
abolition of only corporate and unionaffiliated pacs as president 
bush advocated last year 
democrats embraced flexible ceilings but said they should not be 
as flexible as the experts recommended specifically they opposed 
the idea of no limit on small homestate contributions 
sen mitch mcconnell rky a drafter of the republican 
counterproposal 
said 85 percent of republicans oppose any limit 
an even larger number of democratic senators feel that there 
has to be a limit that it isnt reform without some type of 
limit said mitchell thats going to be the most difficult 
area 
the democratic bill would establish ceilings for senate 
campaigns ranging from 15 million for the smallest states such as 
alaska idaho new hampshire and west virginia up to 825 million 
for the largest state california it also would limit pac 
contributions to 20 percent of the total 
democratic leaders earlier had abandoned hopes of winning 
public taxpayer financing of congressional campaigns 
however a proposal by sen john kerry dmass to provide 
candidates 20 percent of their spending ceiling through government 
vouchers for buying tv time has been gaining momentum one idea on 
how to pay for it is raising the current voluntary 1 checkoff on 
income tax returns for presidential campaigns 
meanwhile house leaders have put off any action on campaign 
finance reform until after they see how the senate handles it 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said last week he wants 
to bring the issue to the floor in june despite a similar lack of 
progress toward a compromise there between the two parties 
there are some things we can agree on but i think it is fair 
to say that overall there will be more significant elements in 
which we will be in disagreement he said 
house republican leader robert michel of illinois said he 
envisons the two parties going at the issue hammer and tong

saying british justice stinks an 
irishwoman flew home to freedom saturday her conviction for 
terrorist conspiracy quashed in a sensational british court ruling 
martina shanahan who arrived in dublin on her 25th birthday 
was released with fellow prisoners john mccann and finbar cullen 
who flew to ireland separately each had served 2 years of a 
25year sentence 
a british appeals court ruled friday that the 1988 trial of the 
socalled winchester three could have been prejudiced by a 
british cabinet ministers remarks 
the three were jailed for allegedly conspiring to murder tom 
king then the governments secretary of state for northern ireland 
during their trial in the western england city of winchester 
the government changed the law to allow juries to draw negative 
inferences from a suspects silence under police questioning 
king now defense secretary was prominent in defending the 
change he said on television that defendants should not have the 
right to remain silent 
the appeal court agreed kings remarks could have prejudiced the 
trial and ordered the three freed the government immediately 
ordered them deported 
the case of the winchester three was the latest in a series of 
embarrassments for britain over the justice it metes out to irish 
suspects 
in october the guildford four were released having served 
14 years of a life sentence for bombings that killed five people 
an appeals judge ruled that police lied about some of the evidence 
then there are the birmingham six jailed for life in 1975 
for bombings that killed 19 people their supporters insist they 
are victims of a miscarriage of justice and the government has 
agreed to have certain aspects of the case reviewed 
for the irish the case of the winchester three struck 
particularly close to home 
unlike the guildford and birmingham convicts most of whom come 
from northern ireland where the irish republican army wages its war 
against britain the winchester three come from the irish republic 
none seemed to fit the stereotype of the hardened fighter for 
the ira which wants to unite protestantdominated northern ireland 
with the overwhelmingly roman catholic republic of ireland 
cullen 29 is from a prominent middle class family mccann 26 
is the son of an oil company executive 
even as they returned to rapturous welcome from family and 
friends question marks remained 
they were arrested in 1987 after cullen and ms shanahan were 
spotted near the king family home in county wiltshire western 
england mccann was arrested at a nearby campground 
police said papers were found containing the names of 19 british 
national figures some with their car license numbers 
police said the groups possessions included a woollen mask 
binoculars forged drivers licenses 7200 a radio and a 
magazine article on how to become an expert sniper 
the defense argued in court that the possessions did not connect 
them with an assassination plot but no explanation of their 
activities was forthcoming 
the appeal court rejected the plea of insufficient evidence and 
the irish times dublins leading newspaper editorialized that no 
one could deny something murky was afoot when the three were 
arrested 
said ms shanahan at dublin airport british justice stinks 
there is no such thing as british justice the birmingham six 
should be home as well 
but most newspapers and politicians in dublin praised the 
british court for acknowledging a mistake 
what is important about this appeal judgment in the broader 
context of angloirish relations the irish independent said 
is that it will have gone a long way toward reassuring irish 
people about the administration of justice in cases involving irish 
accused

two congressional committees are challenging a 
veterans affairs department decision to award back payment of 
previously denied claims to vietnam vets suffering from a rare form 
of cancer linked to agent orange 
the democratic and republican leaders of the house and senate 
veterans committees wrote a letter to the va earlier this month 
challenging the authority of the department to award retroactive 
benefits 
but the legal issue is caught up in the emotional and complex 
issue of compensating veterans who claim they have a variety of 
ailments due to exposure to the defoliant agent orange 
the letter which was first disclosed in saturdays editions of 
the washington post said benefits may be awarded only 
prospectively from the date of the new regulation and not 
retroactively 
it said the vas decision to set a retroactive effective date 
for awarding benefits was unprecedented 
we question whether you have such authority under current law 
with respect to a claim after its denial has become final the 
april 18 letter to va secretary edward j derwinski said 
the issue arose march 29 when the va announced it would award 
benefits to anyone who served in vietnam and later developed 
nonhodgkins lymphoma the announcement came the same day the 
federal centers for disease control in atlanta said vietnam vets 
had a 50 percent higher risk of developing the disease than did men 
who hadnt served 
but the va in its attempt to defuse the lingering agent orange 
issue used its file of past agent orange claims to come up with 
the number of lymphoma victims who should be compensated 
the government consistently denies a connection between exposure 
to the defoliant and a host of ailments despite claims of veterans 
groups a classaction lawsuit that was settled and a number of 
independent scientists 
derwinski asserted that the benefits were for not for agent 
orange exposure but for anyone who served in vietnam who has the 
cancer va was thus able to give some relief without conceding an 
association between exposure and disease 
the same cdc study ruled out an increase in several other 
cancers among vietnam veterans that have been linked to agent 
orange exposure the cdc has acknowledged that the study does not 
disprove a connection 
the va estimated it would have to pay up to 25 million a year 
in death and disability benefits to the 1800 afflicted veterans or 
their survivors it is drafting new regulations to award the claims 
should the va reverse its march 29 decision those who were 
previously denied claims could refile for benefits the benefits 
would become payable from the date of the new regulations or the 
date of the cdc study said charles peckarsky an adviser to the 
house committee 
the letter which originated in the house va committee is 
signed by rep gv sonny montgomery the mississippi democrat 
who chairs the committee rep bob stump rariz the ranking 
minority member sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the 
senate va committee and sen frank h murkowski ralaska the 
ranking republican member 
va spokesman dennis r boxx defended derwinskis action saying 
he believes that the decision was a legal decision but just as 
importantly a fair and humane decision that was appropriate given 
all the complex questions and issues 
he said the development is ironic because the va is often 
accused of not trying to do things that are humane and fair and 
compassionate 
the committee leaders views are not necessarily shared by all 
the members 
i dont think it behooves veterans advocates to be working 
against veterans benefits said rep lane evans dill a member 
of the committee and a leader of the vietnamera veterans caucus in 
congress

jimmy carter says hes gratified by his 
popularity and the respect hes getting for his global mediation 
efforts but he says hes not foolish enough to think about 
winning the presidency again 
he also has no aspirations to be the worlds most prominent 
election observer 
carter played a prominent role in certifying that nicaraguas 
recent presidential election was fair he was invited to oversee 
elections in hungary and romania and he has agreed to help monitor 
elections in the dominican republic next month 
but he said its not a niche i want to fulfill permanently 
if i see that my presence can be the deciding factor in the 
integrity of an election i would do it but i dont need to go 
just to say weve got a former us president here im not 
looking for ceremonial roles 
in an interview last week in his carter presidential center 
office the 65yearold former president warned of tougher times 
ahead for soviet president mikhail gorbachev said its a mistake 
to assume that communism is crumbling universally and explained 
how and why he was willing to go to beirut lebanon 
carter attributed the collapse of communism in eastern europe 
mainly to gorbachev 
its a change that gorbachev has brought carter said it 
would be a mistake to think its a worldwide inevitability 
we dont see it happening in north korea we dont see it 
happening in vietnam we dont see it happening in albania we 
dont see it happening in china and we havent seen it happen in 
cuba 
gorbachevs biggest threat much worse than ethnic 
independence moves or anything else is his countrys economic 
ruin carter said adding 
when i meet privately with soviet leaders they make it clear 
to me that the west has underestimated the economic deterioration 
in the soviet union 
how gorbachev will deal with it i dont know the fact is 
hes been in office now for about five years and the situations 
gotten worse 
in the middle east carter sees a general consensus now 
that the time for hostagetaking has passed and that these hostages 
ought to be released 
he complimented president bush for opening up new avenues of 
at least discussion and exploration on how the hostages might be 
released 
in the wake of last weeks release of hostage robert polhill 
carter said the administration should not be too effusive in 
your thanks when only one hostage is released but you can 
acknowledge the fact that this is leading toward reconciliation 
after spending 10 days in the middle east last month carter was 
criticized for charging israel with violations of palestinian 
rights 
i know that when any statement is made that is critical of 
israel its going to be condemned he said i understand 
their concerns 
he reiterated that he had simply condemned one israeli policy 
deporting mothers and children from their own homes in the west 
bank and gaza to jordan which i thought was a terrible crime 
following his criticism the policy was changed 
i dont have any apology to make i am concerned about any 
genuine belief that i am biased but a lot of the accusations about 
bias are deliberately designed to prevent further criticism of 
israels policies and i dont choose to be intimidated 
during his trip carter sought to meet with lebanese president 
elias hrawi to understand firsthand lebanons position in the 
volatile region 
he considered just going to beirut but i knew the state 
department would not approve so my thought was to meet with 
president hrawi at a military base inside lebanon 
but bush administration officials urged him to stay away from 
the terrorismracked country i felt perfectly secure but i can 
understand the concerns of others about me he said 
while carter has been seen as a success on the global stage 
former president reagan has been criticized for taking lucrative 
speaking engagements and stumbling badly in his testimony during 
the irancontra trial of john poindexter 
the result carters approval rating in us public opinion 
polls is higher now than that of the man who defeated him so 
overwhelmingly 10 years ago 
you find that surprising carter joked 
during his administration from 1977 to 1981 carter was was 
widely criticized for the state of the economy and his handling of 
foreign affairs including the iranian hostage crisis 
carter conceded he finds his new popularity flattering although 
thats not the goal of my life to get favorable public opinion 
polls 
part of it is what weve done since weve left the white 
house part of it is a growing historical assessment of our 
administrations and i think part of it is the quite dramatic 
changes in reagans policies by george bush 
i think it would embarrass him my saying this but i think 
his policies are much more comparable to those of kennedy and 
johnson and nixon and ford and me than they are comparable with 
reagans policies 
still carter insists he never even daydreams about running 
again for anything never im not foolish enough to think that i 
would win an election for president that would be out of the 
question and secondly im perfectly satisfied with what im doing 
here 
i can say what i like i can meet whom i want i can take on 
the projects that please me and reject the ones that dont

lithuanias president and a soviet government 
spokesman on saturday praised a frenchwest german proposal to 
defuse tensions raising the possibility it could lead to a 
compromise between moscow and vilnius 
the kremlin has shut down shipments of oil restricted natural 
gas and cut supplies of manufactured goods and food supplies to 
lithuania on saturday a soviet government official said coal 
supplies had been cut as well 
a letter from french president francois mitterrand and west 
german chancellor helmut kohl proposed lithuania suspend some laws 
backing up its march 11 declaration of independence but did not 
suggest repealing the declaration itself 
we consider that this is not far from the line that the soviet 
leadership has been pursuing from the very beginning arkady 
maslennikov a spokesman for soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
told a kremlin briefing we consider this a constructive signal 
lithuanian leaders also are showing the understanding that 
there must be a return to the road of reason maslennikov said 
in the lithuanian capital of vilnius president vytautas 
landsbergis told a news conference he considered the proposal a 
positive step said lithuanian journalist eduardas potashinskas 
some may interpret this letter as a concession to the 
categorical position of the soviet union he quoted landsbergis 
as saying we see it differently 
we will suggest that the initiative of these leaders not end 
with this letter he said 
on friday lithuanian premier kazimiera prunskiene said the 
frenchwest german proposal was the limit to compromise that 
lithuania could accept the lithuanian leadership said it will 
bring the proposal before the baltic republics legislature this 
week for debate 
in order to begin talks on the basis of the kohlmitterrand 
letter the two sides must find a formula that takes into account 
their opposing views of the independence declaration 
lithuania has sent several delegations to moscow in hopes of 
arranging toplevel meetings but there have been few such contacts 
gorbachev says lithuania must renounce the declaration 
landsbergis and the lithuanian leadership say they cannot back down 
on the declaration but the laws implementing it and the schedule 
are negotiable 
the republic says the declaration only recognizes the legal 
status lithuania held before its forcible annexation along with 
that of neighboring latvia and estonia by the soviet union in 
1940 
western countries including the united states never recognized 
the incorporation of the baltic states but also have not recognized 
lithuanias declaration 
the issue is a test for gorbachev who faces several nationalist 
and ethnic crises the parliament of estonia has voted to become 
independent at an unspecified later date and latvia is scheduled 
to vote on the issue this week 
gorbachev and soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov have demanded 
that lithuania reverse its opposition to its youths being drafted 
into the soviet army return communist party buildings being used 
by lithuanias independent communists and repeal a law on 
citizenship they regarded as discriminatory 
the soviet military has seized some buildings in vilnius and 
conducted a series of military maneuvers an effort to pressure the 
republic of 38 million people 
officials say about 10000 lithuanians already are out of work 
because of the economic blockade from moscow and the soviet news 
agency tass said experts believe the figure will grow to 35000 by 
tuesday 
the republics only oil refinery shut down last week and it is 
receiving only a small share of its normal allotment of natural gas 
supplies of gasoline to private car owners has been restricted 
to about 7 gallons a month and long lines have formed at gas 
stations many people are walking 
official vilnius radio reported late friday that publication of 
newspapers in the republic would be severely restricted this week 
but it said lithuania had enough newsprint to continue publishing 
the papers 
soviet authorities have restricted western reporters from 
traveling to lithuania except by invitation on trips organized by 
the foreign ministry the associated press was not invited on one 
trip currently under way 
vladimir kosyunin deputy chairman of the soviet state supply 
committee told tass that coal supplies had been curtailed as well 
much of that coal comes from poland and lithuania already owes 
about 1 million rubles for coal supplies he said 
kosyunin told tass it would take only a matter of days to 
restore normal shipments to lithuania if a political settlement is 
reached the situation is not yet irreversible but it will be 
much more difficult to resolve the problem later

workers on saturday began tearing down the 
thickest and perhaps most famous part of the berlin wall a stretch 
of graffiticovered concrete in front of the historic brandenburg 
gate 
crowds of tourists and souvenir peddlers watched as east german 
soldiers and west german construction workers with heavy tools 
began knocking away at the section ofwall that curves around the 
18thcentury gate 
the huge colonnaded gate represents the grandeur of old berlin 
just as the section of wall in front of it symbolized its division 
the wall provided some of the most memorable images of the 
revolution last autumn that ended four decades of communist 
oppression opened the wall and began the process of reunifying 
the two germanys with the giant gate as a backdrop protesters 
with chisels climbed on the wall last year to demonstrate their new 
freedom when east germanys borders were finally opened 
much of the surrounding sections of the 100mile wall already 
have been removed but the section in front of the gate is 
considered the sturdiest it is 10 feet high and equally as thick 
the area around the brandenburg gate has become a heavily 
visited tourist area makeshift souvenir stands hawk everything 
from postcards depicting the revolt to key chains made of wall 
fragments 
the work saturday was part of an ongoing process of removing 
certain sections of the wall the east german government says the 
entire wall will eventually be removed except for one section that 
will stand as a monument 
the east german news agency adn reported saturday that 70 
segments of the berlin wall will be auctioned off on june 23 in the 
principality of monaco

about the religious rantings of media mogul ted turner the man who 
rewrote the ten commandments to suit his tastes 
but turner said friday he isnt exactly crazy about 
fundamentalists either 
in a speech before the american humanist association turner

turner said while he was growing up religion was pounded into 
us so much that i was saved seven or eight times 
turner said he pondered a career as a missionary then his 
sister died after a lengthy illness despite his prayers 
if god is love and allpowerful why does he allow these 
things to happen turner asked the more he strayed from his 
christian upbringing turner said the better i felt 
turner said he believes were all basically good and that 
all people are kindred souls

president bush an avid fisherman who has 
pursued the sport in wyoming the florida keys and the gulf of 
mexico since taking office may have found a new lucky spot 
saturday just a few miles from the white house 
what do you think bush said grinning broadly as he held up 
one of the 15 or so largemouth bass his fishing party caught during 
a sixhour excursion on the potomac river just south of washington 
it was bushs first try as president at fishing on the potomac 
not bad at all thats better than last week bush said 
referring to the fishing trip in the florida keys he took following 
a meeting at key largo with french president francois mitterrand 
bush declined to answer reporters questions about lithuania 
saying he would probably hold a news conference next week 
the president sidestepped a question about whether the potomac 
fishing was better than maine he has fished extensively from his 
powerboat in the atlantic and in a river near his vacation home in 
kennebunkport 
depends on what youre trying to do youre not going to 
get me into that he said 
the potomac runs past the washington mall where bush later 
spoke by telephone hookup to more than 60000 antiabortion 
demonstrators 
the presidents fishing party included wrctv news anchorman jim

congressional irancontra investigators 
discovered but kept secret a diversion to israeli intelligence of 
more than 1 million in proceeds from the reagan administrations 
sale of arms to iran the new york times magazine reports 
the magazine in an article by investigative journalist seymour 
hersh also reports that senators decided before the 
muchpublicized irancontra hearings that they would not go 
after president reagan they agreed they would avoid seeking 
impeachment unless it seemed reagan had been fully aware of the 
diversion of arms sale money to the nicaraguan contra rebels the 
article said 
the decisions were governed by a desire to avoid jeopardizing 
the release of us hostages held in lebanon and to protect the 
emerging strategicarms negotiations with the soviet union as well 
as reagans age and immense public popularity hersh writes 
according to the article senate and house committees learned 
that former gen richard secord and his partner albert hakim who 
worked for white house aide oliver north in the affair had 
diverted iranian armssale profits to the israelis for the covert 
actions 
the committees obtained documents that showed four cash 
transfers between hakims swiss bank account and an account 
controlled by amiram nir an israeli counterterror official hersh 
writes 
this transfer was not mentioned in the panels joint report in 
november 1987 the report devotes only three paragraphs to the 
subject and describes the efforts by codenames th1 th2 and so 
on it says north testified that the efforts had not progressed 
beyond the planning stage and that he 
therefore did not seek presidential authorization 
but hersh says highly placed american intelligence 
officials whom he did not identify by name told him that 
several of the northnir operations did take place in 1985 and 1986 
these included covert electronic monitoring of the highway 
between damascus and beirut a series of attempts to penetrate the 
shiite amal militia and the druse sect inside lebanon and a 
continuing effort to locate arab terrorists suspected of blowing up 
the marine barracks in lebanon in 1983 hersh reports 
hersh adds that secord acknowledged in an interview he was aware 
of the payments to nir and said of them this is black money 
israeli black money a term used to describe the financing of 
covert operations 
senate committee chief counsel arthur liman is quoted by hersh 
as saying there were limits on what he could publish from the 
investigation other sources told hersh that both house and senate 
chairmen told liman not to make anything public that might disrupt 
continuing efforts to gain the release of us hostages in lebanon 
liman told hersh that the question of whether the diversion to 
the israelis was legal without written presidential authority a 
finding was referred to the senate and house intelligence 
committees neither has made any public report on the matter 
the desire to protect both reagan and the strategicarms 
negotiations motivated senators hersh says 
according to one participant hersh writes at an early caucus 
in january 1987 the senators reached one easy consensus we 
dont want to go after the president the participant said he 
was too old 
the witness also told hersh that senators believed reagan could 
not understand what had happened 
hersh quotes new hampshire republican sen warren b rudman 
vice chairman of the committee as saying we decided to follow 
the evidence but agreed that if there was an impeachable 
offense it could only be the diversion the point we talked about 
was that if there is a conscious diversion we have no choice but 
to seek impeachment 
if its nonfeasance and negligence theres too much at 
risk hersh quotes rudman as saying we could go on for four 
years

east germanys new noncommunist leaders arrived 
saturday for meetings aimed at easing the concerns of president 
mikhail s gorbachev as his onceloyal ally spins away from the 
soviet orbit 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere planned to meet 
with gorbachev on sunday to discuss the effects of german 
unification on soviet military and economic interests 
in an interview with the soviet news agency tass before leaving 
east berlin de maiziere emphasized close ties with moscow he said 
east germany could accept neither a neutral germany nor nato 
soldiers on east german territory before an alleurope security 
system is put into place 
a neutral germany would be contrary to the spirit of the 
times corresponding instead to the old mentality of blocs tass 
quoted de maiziere as saying it would only conserve military 
blocs existing as a formally neutral state between them 
we need a paneuropean system of security he was quoted as 
saying before this system is in place nato military presence on 
the territory of east germany should not be allowed 
de maiziere accompanied by his foreign defense and econimics 
ministers was greeted upon arrival in moscow by soviet premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov 
east germany has been a key component in the warsaw pact 
military alliance and an important trading partner with the 
soviets the soviets are seeking to preserve their current trade 
agreements with east germany which were made under the german 
nations former communist government 
the talks are a prelude to formal negotiations between the 
germanys and the four world war ii allies that divided them the 
soviet union united states britain and france 
foreign ministers from the six nations are to begin unification 
negotiations may 5 in bonn west germany 
de maiziere has said east germany would protect the security 
interests of the soviet union he has disagreed with west germanys 
insistence that a unified germany be a part of the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
de maiziere was quoted in a newspaper interview on saturday as 
saying that he and the soviets disagree with west germany on the 
alliance question 
but this is not a stumbling block there must be further 
negotiations about nato and the question of security i will make 
that clear in moscow de maiziere said according to the 
hamburgbased bild newspaper 
in dublin ireland soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
said in a newspaper interview saturday that a united germany should 
be militarily nonaligned and could belong to both nato and 
the warsaw pact 
shevardnadze told the irish times that a formula was needed for 
german unification which would not radically tip the balance of 
military power 
shevardnadze insisted membership of a united germany in nato 
is unacceptable to us since it would mean a radical disruption of 
the current balance of forces in europe 
soviet and east german leaders also are likely to discuss 
polands demand that it be protected from any claim a united 
germany may make on former german lands ceded to poland after world 
war ii 
poland late friday gave a copy of a proposal to diplomats from 
both german states that it wants to be the framework for such a 
guarantee east germanys adn news service and polands pap news 
service said 
in bonn a west german government spokesman confirmed officials 
there have received the proposal kohl has been reluctant to make a 
commitment to polands current borders saying the question must be 
dealt with after unification

smart cars that give drivers the latest 
traffic information on a computer screen will soon take to the 
roads in florida and california in an experiment aimed at heading 
off gridlock on overburdened highways 
test programs in los angeles and orlando over the next three 
years will feature cars equipped with computer screens using 
satellitedelivered traffic information from sensorequipped 
smart highways 
they are the start of a combined federalstate 
privateandpublic effort to avoid future shock on american roads 
gridlock caused by evergrowing numbers of motorists on too few 
highways that are aging more quickly than they can be repaired 
rebuilt or replaced 
the application of electronic and communications technology 
can add efficiency and capacity without adding pavement 
contends the highway users federation one of the groups behind the 
project 
experts say the technology is available only the money and 
direction for its application are needed the two test programs and 
an orlandoarea conference this week are intended to better define 
the problems and solutions 
the national leadership conference on implementing intelligent 
vehiclehighway systems starting thursday is expected to set 
forth a plan for action and maybe get some startup of a national 
organization to carry this forward said mark norman of the 
highway users federation a lobbying group 
transportation secretary samuel skinner who will speak at the 
conference is calling for a transportation revolution because the 
nations airports highways bridges waterways and mass transit 
systems are simply wearing out 
experts say that since no new systems are in the works the 
existing infrastructure must be made safer and more efficient 
to get the new technologies on the road skinner wants a 
national research project supported by federal state and local 
governments and by corporate and private groups 
the smart car concept involves the driver the vehicle and a 
traffic management team much as air travel involves the pilot 
the aircraft and air traffic control 
in californias pathfinder program expected to get rolling in a 
month or two 25 smart cars will operate on the santa monica 
freeway and parallel arteries they will receive traffic 
information on dashboardmounted electronic displays that are 
constantly updated 
the screens tell drivers of congestion and outline alternate 
routes in return the cars feed information about road conditions 
to a central computer 
the 2 million cost of the twoyear test is being paid by the 
federal highway administration general motors and the california 
transportation department 
in the larger and more sophisticated orlando trial called 
travtek 100 cars will be rented and leased to tourists and 
residents who drive frequently said jack butler of the state 
department of transportation 
the computer screens will be able to suggest the shortest 
leastcongested routes and how to avoid construction areas and 
accidents 
the oneyear evaluation is to begin in early 1992 the 
approximately 8 million cost will be borne by the federal and 
state transportation departments general motors and the american 
automobile association 
surveillance cameras are being installed along a portion of 
interstate 4 in the orlando area to monitor traffic flow and 
problems like accidents the data will be fed via satellite to the 
smart cars dashboard computers along with information from 
traffic spotters in helicopters 
orlando like other cities already has the start of smart 
highways in the form of computerized traffic signals that monitor 
tieups at intersections the computer changes traffic lights 
accordingly 
in europe an 800 millionplus project called prometheus is 
aimed at improving highway and traffic safety and relieving 
congestion through smart cars smart highways and computers 
in japan three similar programs are under way 
people in this country feel that we are behind not because of 
technology but in the institutional framework establishing 
public and private partnerships said norman thats what this 
conference is aiming at

outright ban on wednesday over the schools public address system 
after consulting with teachers 
at issue is a shirt that boasts underachiever and proud of

teaches the wrong thing to students 
the response from the shows makers dont have a cow man as

senseless 
theyre blowing it way out of proportion its only a 
cartoon she said to me its comical 
she said her daughter holly has several simpson shirts

krumnow isnt the first school official to discipline bart 
coffman told the blade of toledo

in a sign of growing black 
divisions a militant group on saturday accused the african 
national congress of appeasement for agreeing to negotiate with 
the whiteled government 
in other developments police said a black policeman and his 
father were killed by gunmen and a police general said the 
nations crime rate has reached alarming proportions 
some 3000 supporters of the radical pan africanist congress a 
rival of the larger anc gathered in the atteridgeville township 
outside pretoria on saturday for the funeral of pan africanist 
leader jeff masemola 
masemola who died in a car crash two weeks ago was freed in 
october from a life prison term after serving 27 years for sabotage 
the pan africanists chanted one settler one bullet a 
reference to whites whom they regard as colonialists and believe 
should be ousted from power by violence if necessary 
the vice president of the pan africanists m makwetu in a 
reference to anc policies said masemola had no time for 
compromise and appeasement 
it is very sad for the anc to have taken that decision to 
talk to the government makwetu said 
the anc the largest black opposition group is to hold 
groundbreaking talks on wednesday through friday with president 
fw de klerks government the discussions are designed to clear 
the way for negotiations on a new constitution that would include 
blacks 
our choice is to fight on said cunningham noxukwana 
general secreatary of a pan africanistaffiliated union 
organization 
a sellout is very thick in the air he said of the talks 
the pan africanist congress broke away from the african national 
congress in the 1950s and disagrees with the anc on several 
tactical issues the pan africanists believe blacks should be 
selfreliant in their struggle for political rights while the anc 
embraces a multiracial approach 
both groups favor a oneman onevote system and wage largely 
ineffective guerrilla campaigns 
the anc also is engaged in a power struggle in the southeastern 
province of natal with inkatha a relatively conservative zulu 
organization fighting between the two sides has claimed 4000 
black lives in the past four years 
meanwhile police said five gunmen broke into the house of 
24yearold constable jf zuma in mpumalanga outside durban on 
friday night demanded ammunition then shot him twice in the chest 
police said zumas father in another room heard the attack and 
tried to flee from the house but was also shot and killed 
also gen jaap joubert head of the police criminal 
investigations division said crime has reached alarming 
proportions with almost 15 million serious crimes committed last 
year 
on an average day in south africa joubert said there were 32 
murders 56 rapes 199 robberies 160 car thefts and more than 500 
cases of housebreaking 
the national police force is also experiencing a drain of 
officers with an average of 22 a day resigning during the first 
three months of this year the government recently announced a pay 
raise for police in a bid to halt the resignations

the government plans a second bank fraud 
trial for rep harold ford and a prosecutor said saturday he may 
try to move the case out of the popular congressmans home district 
ford 44 went on trial feb 12 in us district court in 
memphis and a mistrial was declared friday when jurors said they 
were hopelessly deadlocked 
us attorney hickman ewing jr of memphis said prosecutors are 
considering a request for a chance of venue so the government can 
get a fair trial 
the democratic congressman was indicted in knoxville in 1987 and 
the case was moved to memphis at his request 
tennessees only black member of congress ford claimed he was 
judicially kidnapped when prosecutors sought his indictment in 
eastern tennessee which is heavily white and republican 
fords district in memphis is 58 percent black and he has 
avoided any serious challenge for reelection since first elected 
to congress in 1974 
one of the strongest black politicians in memphis ford was 
preparing to run for mayor when his indictment sidetracked those 
plans he declined to say what effect his continuing legal woes 
will have on his future political plans 
memphis is 50 percent black but has never elected a black mayor 
the city will hold municipal elections next year 
ford is accused of taking political payoffs from former 
tennessee bankers jake and ch butcher jr who set off the 
largest banking collapse in the states history in 1983 
the butchers are serving 20year prison sentences for bank fraud 
a mistrial was also declared for his fords codefendants 
accountant david crabtree and lawyers douglas beaty and karl 
schledwitz all three are former butcher aides 
ewing said prosecutors may ask for a new site for fords second 
trial because of extensive news media coverage surrounding the 
first one 
the congressman held what amounted to daily news conferences 
throughout the trial ewing said while prosecutors were barred by 
district court rules from talking about the case 
ford claims his indictment is the work of racist prosecutors who 
dislike him personally an allegation the government denies 
shortly after fords indictment a federal judge in knoxville 
issued orders telling the defendants not to talk about the case in 
public ford complained that a member of congress could not be 
barred from addressing his constituents and an appeals court 
removed the gag order as it applied to him 
ford was indicted in knoxville the government says because the 
bank fraud conspiracy he is accused of taking part in was centered 
there 
after the mistrial was declared ford said he hoped the 
government would decide to drop the case 
what we will do is go now to the justice department and let 
them review this case to see whether or not the government has had 
its day in court he said 
ford said he regarded the mistrial as a victory 
this is certainly a big defeat for the government he said

about 40 homes in the city of alamo were 
damaged and a few homes were declared unfit for habitation after 
two earthquakes rumbled through northern california officials said 
saturday 
damage included broken glass toilets knocked off foundations 
ruptured water and gas lines and broken furniture according to san 
ramon valley fire department spokesman mary raymond 
several homes were deemed uninhabitable by inspectors with the 
contra costa county building department after the temblors friday 
night raymond added 
she said followup inspections would determine the severity of 
the damage 
two jolts in contra costa county on the concord fault produced 
preliminary richter scale readings of 46 and 39 according to the 
university of california seismographic station in berkeley the 
us geological survey measured the temblors at magnitudes 46 and 
43 
the quakes were centered some 30 miles east of san francisco 
four miles east of walnut creek seismologists reported 
the shocks swept cans and bottles off supermarket shelves and 
knocked out power to thousands of homes in concord danville 
walnut creek and alamo jostling the nerves of residents 
the first hit at 941 pm and another shock hit six minutes 
later several quakes measuring 25 and smaller shivered through 
the area after that 
the largest jolts were felt from vacaville to marin county to 
san francisco 
a spokeswoman for the state office of emergency services said 
the shocks were part of the continuing series shaking the region 
this month tremors of up to 55 on the richter scale were felt in 
the bay area on april 6 and april 18 none caused any major damage 
the 71magnitude quake that hit the region oct 17 claimed 67 
lives and caused some 71 billion in damage 
at the alamo safeway employees closed the store and filled 
carts with bottled water and batteries to sell at the front door 
their floors were a mess with broken bottles and scattered cans 
karen allen walnut creek police dispatcher reported from her 
post that things fell off the shelves behind the console 
the bay area rapid transit system was shut down for 24 minutes 
while crews conducted inspections to ensure the safety of 
passengers said spokesman mike healy were in good shape he 
reported 
brad thomas a spokesman for pacific gas amp electric co 
reported that the quakes left 1300 homes in the concord area 
without power and scattered outages in other areas 
mild shaking took place at the press box at candlestick park 
where the san francisco giants were playing the st louis 
cardinals said sportswriter brian martin 
people who have been through them knew what it was it was 
business as usual martin said 
at sixstory mount diablo hospital in concord nursing 
supervisor mary bacon said there was a sudden crack and then a 
rolling that goes on and on some of the patients and some of the 
employees were shook up and were sick to their stomachs 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake of 4 on the richter scale can cause moderate 
damage in the local area a 5 considerable damage a 7 reading is a 
major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage

faced with a flood of phone calls and 
facsimile messages claiming responsibility for terrorist attacks 
colombias news media are beginning to ignore the messages 
the reason is simple it is impossible to tell who is really on 
the other end of the line drug traffickers police posing as drug 
traffickers leftist guerrillas pranskters 
until a few weeks ago virtually all of colombias radio 
stations and newspapers used the statements without question no 
one pointed out the information came from anonymous people and 
could not be verified 
recently the countrys two leading newspapers bogotas el 
espectador and el tiempo chose not to publish news about some of 
the anonymous messages 
an example of the confusion came after leftist presidential 
candidate carlos pizarro was killed thursday by an assassin on a 
colombian airliner 
within two hours the anonymous telephone calls started 
it was the medellin cartel one man said another president 
would be assassinated he said 
on friday came another facsimile message also supposedly from 
the medellin cartel to a bogota radio station caracol 
it wasnt us the supposed cartel communique said it accused 
the police of killing people and setting off bombs so that the 
cartel would be blamed 
another example came after a truck bomb in medellin killed 20 
people on april 11 
facsimile statements under the letterhead of the extraditables 
a name assumed by leaders of the medellin cartel said the cartel 
was not responsibile 
recently there have been facsimile and telephone messages from 
anonymous people claiming to speak for the cartel saying those 
statements directly after the april 11 bombing were fakes 
somebody has been using us as their public relations office

at a separate news conference french president francois 
mitterrand also said a unified germany must stay in nato 
in an interview with the irish times of dublin soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze suggested a nonaligned status for 
the joined german state 
shevardnadze will meet with us secretary of state james a 
baker iii and counterparts from france britain and the two 
germanys in bonn next saturday to discuss the international 
questions of german unification 
kohl expressed his appreciation for the overwhelming support he 
received from the other leaders for the german unification process 
klein said 
british prime minister margaret thatcher originally uneasy 
about the implications of german unification welcomed kohls 
entire approach her officials said 
the prime objective of this council summit has been 
fulfilled said a british government spokesman speaking on 
condition of anonymity the european community has a clear plan 
and a scheme for handling it 
poorer community members had been uneasy as well spain and 
portugal for example are heavily dependent on ec programs for 
redistributing western european wealth 
on thursday ec commission president jacques delors raised 
eyebrows among the british by suggesting a small ec fund to help 
prop up east germanys nearly collapsed economy 
the british were quick to say they were not interested in any 
such contribution to east germany 
klein said kohl made it clear that west germany was not 
pushing for such extra help for the troubled nation 
enormous amounts of money are at stake in unification which has 
received the blessing of the ec leaders 
experts estimate it could cost 130 billion to clean up east 
germanys polluted environment about 300 billion will be needed 
to revamp computers telecommunications and other forms of 
electronic information systems 
kohls government has agreed to exchange east german wages 
pensions and small savings into west german marks at a 1to1 rate 
as of july 2 triggering unease in financial markets 
many businessmen and bankers say the planned exchange rate could 
lead to massive inflation they think the entire economic venture 
is taking west germany into uncharted and potentially dangerous 
waters 
west germanys finance minister on saturday reassured west 
germans that they will not have to pay higher taxes to finance 
unification of the germanys 
kohl is counting on the private businesses already setting up in 
east germany to aid in economic unification and he says other 
countries should become involved economically as well 
he urgently called on other ec partners to invest in east 
germany klein said 
however the huge headstart enjoyed by the west germans has 
already raised concerns they will reap most of the advantages of 
unification 
belgian prime minister wilfried martens warned the other leaders 
that west germany shouldnt be allowed to have advantages in east 
germany that others dont have 
i believe that everyone will agree there shouldnt be any 
unreasonable advantages and that for that reason the usual 
supervisory mechanisms have to apply martens said according to 
a written version of his remarks

a few years ago town selectmen took up the 
task of repairing the sagging centuryold covered wooden bridge 
over the ottauquechee river the result complete with greenish 
plastic glass windows in the roof has townspeople and 
preservationists aghast 
purists say there was something magical about the darkness in 
the lincoln bridge built in 1877 
one old farmer told me he liked the darkness of the bridge 
because hed kiss his wife every time they drove through it 
recalls harry francis owner of the neighboring lincoln inn now 
im cheek to jowl with this tragic atrocity 
when they assigned the repair task to state engineers the 
selectmen suggested that a few skylights might be included 
it was a safety issue not just for drivers but for the 
pedestrians milling about on the bridge said woodstock town 
manager phillip swanson we had tourists from all across the 
country walking around in the dark 
but when the bridge reopened last month after the long 
renovation there were six peagreen plastic glass skylights 
installed in a corrugated bakedenamel roof 
what bothers me is if you are going to put all of this money 
into restoring it why does it have to look like a mcdonalds 
hamburger stand one resident william mcdonald said at a recent 
town meeting 
there is nothing historical about the bridge anymore its 
just a wooden bridge in the same location said frank teagle a 
woodstock preservationist 
even town officials concede the plastic skylights arent quite 
what they had in mind 
there are greens and there are greens says selectman thomas 
debevoise iii 
the controversy has prompted plenty of fingerpointing 
it would have made things a lot easier if mr gilbertson had 
said no when the plans came in said debevoise a reference to 
the director of the state division of historic preservation 
eric gilbertson said he wishes his office had caught the 
skylights but they somehow slipped by 
engineer peter gratiot of nearby pomfret who has had an office 
in woodstock for 35 years has fought for an allwood restoration 
since 1986 he said he mistakenly overlooked the skylights while 
concentrating on what he called the real battle the fight to 
keep the bridge authentic from a pure engineering standpoint 
gratiot and members of the national society for the preservation 
of covered bridges wanted restoration as the original planner t 
willis pratt would have designed it free of steel girders and 
using mostly wood 
but state engineers are not trained in wood said gratiot 
now the bridge has both steel supports and the skylights 
swanson who drives over the bridge every day to work dismisses 
the charge that the historical value of the bridge has been 
damaged its just as old as it ever was 
woodstock a town of about 3500 is one of vermonts leading 
resort communities thanks in large part to the efforts of the 
rockefeller family which bought and restored several historic 
buildings in the village paid to bury utility lines and took other 
measures aimed at recreating a 19thcentury new england village 
the bridge is one of three covered wooden structures in 
woodstock the other two bridges are illuminated by either lattice 
work or window notches in the walls 
in addition to the skylights the nonwood roof is another sore 
point officials say it is easier to maintain 
francis mcdonald and others are petitioning for another roof 
the board of selectmen will decide by may 1 whether to allow a 
group of private citizens to raise enough money 20000 by some 
estimates to install traditional cedar shingles 
if the selectmen reject the wood shingle idea resident dennis 
depaul said he will petition again 
the quality of life is high in woodstock because the 
forbearers of the town had the intelligence and generosity to 
create beauty he said we are the stewards of that beauty and 
history its important that we hang on to it

a commercial tree grower who allegedly 
imprisoned migrant workers forced them to work 16hour days and 
shaved their heads has surrendered to authorities 
edwin ives 53 turned himself in friday in los angeles after 
three of his foremen and an alleged alien smuggler were arrested 
earlier in the day at his 49acre ventura county ranch 
a federal complaint charges ives with keeping about 150 
undocumented workers some for as long as nine months during a 
threeyear period at the ranch where eucalyptus trees and other 
ornamental plants are grown among the accusations that the 
workers even had to pay for the haircuts when their heads were 
shaved 
ives denied the allegations through his lawyer 
the defendants and ives company griffithives co are charged 
with conspiracy to deprive people of their civil rights assistant 
us attorney crol gillam said 
they could also be indicted under the fair labor standards act 
and for alleged violations of the migrant and seasonal agricultural 
worker protection act a federal prosecutor said 
according to the complaint the aliens were smuggled from mexico 
and promised good wages but when they arrived they found they 
could not leave the ranch which is surrounded by a 7foot 
chainlink and plastic glass fence 
as many as 150 aliens may have been held as long as nine months 
ms gillam said they were forced to work 16hour days six days a 
week they were paid wages but had to pay for food clothing 
toilet paper tools and bedding she said they were also charged a 
smuggling fee according to prosecutors 
the allegations were reported to authorities by a worker who 
said he escaped the ranch earlier this month by crawling under a 
fence 
it was slave labor said fernando maldonado 49 we could 
not leave we realized we had entered the mouth of the wolf 
ives was freed on 150000 bail ms gillam said ives 
attorney robert talcott said the charges were unfounded 
as the proceedings unfold the facts will reveal that none of 
the allegations of peonage and involuntary servitude and the like 
have an iota of support talcott said

christian leaders reopened shrines and churches 
in the holy land saturday after a 24hour closure but threatened to 
shut their doors again if jewish settlers remain in the christian 
quarter of the old city 
the 150 jewish settlers moved into a fourbuilding complex owned 
by the greek orthodox church in the christian quarter on april 11 
the move interrupted easter celebrations and provoked 
demonstrations by angry clerics and palestinians both christian 
and moslem 
last week after repeated denials the israeli government 
admitted it had contributed 18 million to help establish the 
settlement provoking outrage in israel and abroad 
israels supreme court has ordered the settlers to leave by 
tuesday but said 20 settler guards and maintenance staff could 
remain pending a final ruling on the tenancy dispute 
on friday leaders of nine major christian sects closed their 
churches for a day after the greek orthodox church locked the gates 
to the church of the holy sepulcher where catholics say jesus was 
crucified and buried it was believed to be the first time the 
church of the holy sepulcher closed its doors in 800 years 
church leaders plan more protests unless all of the settlers 
leave 
if the situation continues to be critical we will have to 
close churches again hold more special prayers and appeal to the 
international community to pressure israel to evict the settlers 
said lufti laham the melchite catholic bishop 
they did not say when they might hold more protests 
the closure of churches and houses of worship in jerusalem 
bethlehem nazereth and the galilee was never done not even in the 
darkest conditions this shows how serious we are said george 
hintilian secretary to armenian patriarch torkum manoogian 
latin patriarch michel sabbah said on vatican radio that the 
church protest aimed was aimed at showing the world that in 
jerusalem the nonjewish population is in danger 
the palestinian population has been left without any 
protection sabbah said and among the palestinians are also 
christians 
palestinians see the jewish presence in the predominantly arab 
neighborhood as part of a campaign to push them out 
the old city captured from jordan during the 1967 middle east 
war is divided into jealously guarded sectors the christian 
quarter the jewish quarter the armenian quarter and the moslem 
quarter 
the jewish settlers say they intend to leave peacefully but only 
after the israeli independence day which begins sunday night and 
ends monday night 
on friday jerusalem mayor teddy kollek accused caretaker prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs government of acting in an 
underhanded manner 
kollek mayor of jerusalem since 1965 predicted that if the 
rightwing premier stays in power tensions will increase in the 
holy city instead of leading israel to peace talks with the arabs 
shamir is trying to form a coalition government following labor 
leader shimon peres failure to do so the last laborlikud 
coalition collapsed march 15 over differences toward usbacked 
peace proposals with the palestinians

european community leaders adopted a plan 
saturday to achieve political union by january 1993 but britain 
warned they will run into trouble when they get to the details 
i think the community today firmly and decisively and 
categorically committed itself to political union declared irish 
prime minister charles haughey host of the 12nation summit at the 
medieval dublin castle 
i think the whole process is now inevitable hee said 
west german chancellor helmut kohl backed by french president 
francois mitterrand pressed for a speedy merger arguing it went 
handinhand with rapidly approaching german unification 
francois mitterand and i and others want to see the european 
community strengthened kohl told a news conference that in 
plain words means abandoning certain national competencies 
but british prime minister margaret thatcher in 
characteristically blunt language predicted the process of 
european union would founder as soon as the member states faced the 
prospect of having to cede national sovereignty and accept 
collective decisionmaking 
there is quite a lot of rhetoric and far too little 
nittygritty mrs thatcher told reporters at the end of the 
oneday summit clearly they do not quite know what political 
union means it astounds me 
the leaders agreed to instruct their foreign ministers to draw 
up a draft for political union by the next summit in june with the 
aim of calling an intergovernmental conference on the subject in 
december 
it will parallel a conference already scheduled at which 
governments are to discuss a single currency and central banking 
system for europe a summit declaration said both conferences 
should finish their work before the end of 1992 
again mrs thatcher was skeptical while she thought the 
leaders could come up with an agreed formula for political union by 
the end of 1992 she predicted that the work on economic and 
monetary union would run into much fiercer debate 
asked why she endorsed the summits call for political economic 
and monetary union she replied that she was confident it would all 
come to much less than her european partners now imagined 
i would have thought two years should be enough to know 
certainly on political union which way you should go economic and 
monetary union is a much much more complicated thing and will give 
rise to much longer consideration and much fiercer debate she 
said 
mrs thatcher was not alone in her stance toward political 
union community officials said several other countries including 
denmark luxembourg and portugal also had reservations 
german unification was what prompted ireland as current 
president of the community to set up a summit ahead of schedule 
but a francogerman call on april 15 for political union by 1992 
shifted the focus of saturdays gathering toward european merger 
kohl and mitterrand believe union is urgently needed to preserve 
european stability in the face of upheaval in eastern europe 
kohl assured his partners that germany had no intention of 
sticking its hand into the moneybag of the european community 
to finance the huge cost of unifying germany 
the summit endorsed a plan to incorporate east germany into the 
community when it is united with west germany the program will 
temporarily exempt the economically backward former communist 
country from the communitys stringent enviromental standards and 
restrictions on state subsidies to industry 
it also promises that moves to incorporate east germany will 
begin july 2 when the two german currencies merge 
the summit agreed to reach association agreements with the other 
new democracies of eastern europe but there was no question of 
them joining the wealthy trading bloc soon 
the summit taking place in neutral ireland did not go into 
defense questions in detail but kohl repeatedly assured the other 
leaders that a united germany wanted to remain in the 16nation 
north atlantic treaty organization 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in an interview 
with the irish times published saturday reiterated that a united 
germany in nato was unacceptable to moscow he called for a 
militariliy nonaligned germany and suggested it could belong 
to both nato and the sovietled warsaw pact 
although western officials have rejected the idea shevardnadze 
said it was food for thought 
analysts say a political merger of the ec countries probably 
would include a common foreign and security policy some predict 
the ec countries eventually will become a kind of united states of 
europe but still maintain their distinct languages and cultures 
the european community members are belgium britain denmark 
france germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the 
netherlands portugal and spain

india cited by the united states for 
unfair trade practices said saturday it would never negotiate 
trade treaties under threat united news of india reported 
the news agency quoted prime minister vp singh as saying india 
was trying to strengthen its economy and could not ignore its 
social priorities because of the american action friday 
singh commented at a news conference during a visit to the 
northern indian city of lucknow 
senior businessmen in new delhi sharply criticized the united 
states for keeping india on the hit list of countries targeted 
for unfair trade practices 
president bush left india as the only country still cited under 
the 1988 us omnibus trade act which allows us tariffs of up to 
100 percent on goods imported from a nation judged an unfair 
trader bush removed japan and brazil from the list 
the decision is unfortunate and an avoidable development 
said viren j shah president of the associated chamber of commerce 
and industries 
hari shankar singhania chairman of the indian section of the 
indous joint business council said any attempt to force 
india to change its economic policies under threat of retaliatory 
action was against all tenets of multilateralism 
india has steadfastly refused to modify its restrictive trade 
policies designed to protect domestic industries by limiting 
foreign investment and imposing high import duties 
ever since india first was targeted the government has 
maintained the us trade law unfairly penalized developing nations 
shah said the united states and india could have shown greater 
flexibility in dealing with the problem he encouraged india to 
continue its economic liberalization and urged washington to look 
sympathetically on india 
under former prime minister rajiv gandhi india began a program 
of relative economic liberalization opening up to limited foreign 
investment but singhs government has shown few signs of 
continuing those policies 
relatively few foreign products are seen in the worlds second 
most populous nation last year foreign firms invested only 200 
million in india 
indias 880 million people have a per capita annual income of 
only 290 but there is a growing consumer market among the 25 
percent of the population reckoned as middleclass 
americas trade deficit with india is only a fraction of the one 
it has with japan 
india has a trade surplus of about 850 million with the united 
states for the fiscal year that ended in march japans surplus 
with the united states was 428 billion down 127 percent from 
49 billion in the previous fiscal year 
the united states is indias largest trading partner indias 
exports consist primarily of clothing diamonds crude oil and 
cashew nuts its chief american imports are fertilizers chemicals 
electronic parts and industrial materials

a soviet pilot who got radiation poisoning from 
his efforts to stem the chernobyl nuclear disaster was described as 
happy and relieved saturday as the wait began to see if new bone 
marrow will save his life 
anatoly grishchenko 53 who suffers from a preleukemia 
condition has been honored in the soviet union for his work to put 
a cement cap on the reactor in the ukraine 
he received the marrow in a relatively simple eighthour 
procedure completed at 240 am saturday said susan edmonds 
spokeswoman for the fred hutchinson cancer center 
he is stable he handled the transfusion very well and there 
are no problems she said the next step is to see if the 
marrow will grow 
grishchenko will remain in a sterile hospital room for 35 to 40 
days as the new marrow slowly reestablishes his immune system 
edmonds said doctors should know in about three weeks whether the 
transplant was a success 
his condition will probably stay the same for another week 
two weeks edmonds said meanwhile he will rest undergo some 
mild physical therapy get transfusions of blood or blood 
components and be monitored closely for signs of infection or 
marrow rejection 
the marrow about one quart was taken from the hip of a 
42yearold frenchwoman in a procedure similar to drawing blood 
early friday in besancon france the donor asked to remain 
anonymous hospital officials said 
hutchinsons dr patricia stewart rushed the marrow which can 
lose its effectiveness after 24 hours to seattle aboard a 
commercial flight within two hours doctors began transfusing it 
through a catheter into grishchenkos chest one day after the 
fourth anniversary of the chernobyl disaster 
marrow is a substance inside the bones which produces blood 
cells in transplants like grishchenkos marrow transfused into 
the bloodstream makes its way to the interior of the bones 
grishchenko a very warm nice man chatted with his wife 
galina and physicians during the procedure edmonds said 
it was very clear there was a lot of happiness and relief the 
marrow was here she said 
in september 1988 grishchenko was found to have the 
preleukemia condition typified by low counts of blood platelets 
needed for clotting and of white blood cells that fight infection 
and disease he arrived in seattle april 11 and has undergone 
radiation treatment and chemotherapy to prepare for the marrow 
transplant such treatment often leaves a patient too weak for 
doctors to try a second transplant if the first one doesnt take 
edmonds said 
grishchenko who has two sons and a granddaughter has up to a 
75 percent chance of survival without a recurrence of the condition 
for five years edmonds said 
the hutchinson center which pioneered bonemarrow transplants 
has done about 5000 over the past decade and now averages about 
one a day she said 
grishchenko is the first chernobyl victim to receive medical 
care in the united states the transplant was arranged by his 
friend cap parlier light helicopter testing and evaluation 
director for mcdonnell douglas corp 
the donor was found in a ninecountry search 
grishchenko made five flights over chernobyl in the four days 
following the april 26 1986 explosion and fire 
he flew through hot intensely radioactive gases spewing from 
the plant to survey the damage and to dump tons of sand and wet 
concrete onto the wreckage 
he was issued leadlined clothing and his copters were equipped 
with extra lead shielding but he was treated soon after for 
radiation sickness 
according to official figures 31 people were killed in the 
chernobyl disaster unofficial reports said at least 250 died and 
recent estimates are that at least 4 million people were endangered 
by the radiation 
the blast scattered radioactive cesium strontium and plutonium 
isotopes across much of the ukraine byelorussia and russia and 
sent a cloud of radioactive gas around the world

seeking to protect itself from a huge new 
neighbor poland has drafted a border treaty that it wants a 
unified germany to sign officials said saturday 
the proposal is the latest effort by poland to obtain guarantees 
that a united germany will not seek to reclaim former german lands 
now part of poland 
polish officials late friday gave copies of the draft to 
diplomats from both germanys polands government news service pap 
said pap said the draft treaty confirms the present polishgerman 
border and states that the frontier has an international legally 
binding character 
in bonn government spokesman martin erdmann confirmed saturday 
that west germany received a copy of the proposal but he declined 
to comment 
part of nazi germany was ceded to poland after world war ii to 
make up for an even larger part of poland absorbed by the soviet 
union 
polands borders are expected to be a key part of superpower 
talks on the future of a unified germany 
foreign ministers from the four world war ii allies that divided 
germany the soviet union the united states france and britain 
are to meet may 5 in bonn to discuss unification with envoys from 
the two germanys 
at the insistence of polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
the six nations have agreed to allow poland to participate when the 
negotiations address its borders 
although west germany in 1972 signed an agreement recognizing 
polands present borders that agreement would not necessarily be 
legally binding on a united germany west german ultraconservatives 
have seized on unification as an opportunity to scrap the agreement 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who faces elections in 
december caused an international uproar earlier this year by 
hedging on the border issue opponents accused him of courting the 
ultraconservative vote 
but in march the west german parliament with kohls backing 
passed a resolution unequivocally confirming polands borders it 
also said that a united germany should sign a border treaty 
accepting the borders 
east germanys new democratic government already has said it 
would press for full recognition of polands present boundaries 
the issue probably will be discussed when east german prime 
minister lothar de maiziere meets in moscow on sunday with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev the soviets also have demanded that 
polands present borders be guaranteed 
in another development west germanys finance minister on 
saturday reassured west germans that they will not have to pay 
higher taxes to finance the costly unification of the germanys 
theo waigel also urged east germans to be more realistic in 
their demands on west germany 
what we need now is an effective economy in west germany that 
can shoulder things without false recipes such as tax increases 
and supplementary payments waigel said in an interview with the 
hamburgbased welt am sonntag newspaper 
the newspaper provided news media with an advance copy of the 
interview which will appear in its sunday edition 
both germanys have agreed to merge their economies and social 
institutions by july 2 but they have differed on the best way to 
finance it 
west germany has agreed to east germanys demand that the nearly 
worthless east german mark be traded at a 11 rate for the powerful 
west german mark 
the west germans are proposing that the rate apply to salaries 
and pensions but only to savings accounts of 4000 marks 2300 
or less personal savings above 4000 marks would be traded at a 
21 rate 
east germany is pressing for a higher ceiling on personal 
savings and wants to retain subsidies for rent energy and public 
services 
in the interview however waigel said that the bonn offer 
represented the limits of what the west german government could 
afford east german politicians must become more aware of 
realities he said

a judge sentenced a man to 24 years in 
prison for the rape of a yale university student in her dormitory 
room in 1988 but first blasted the man for calling himself the 
victim 
jesse r reed 37 of new york city was defiant friday as judge 
richard damiani sentenced him on two counts of firstdegree sexual

president bush told a rally for life 
saturday that the widespread prevalence of abortion in america is 
a tragedy but omitted any mention of his onceoutspoken support 
for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion 
the president who spent the morning fishing on the potomac 
river spoke by telephone hookup to tens of thousands of people who 
gathered on the mall by the washington monument just a few blocks 
from the white house 
bush spoke for just two and a half minutes he offered 
encouragement to abortion opponents without referring to proposals 
to amend the constitution or to the possibility the supreme court 
would one day reverse its 1973 decision upholding abortion 
like you i realize that the widespread prevalence of abortion 
in america is a tragedy not only in terms of lives destroyed but 
because it so fundamentally contradicts the values we as americans 
hold dear bush said 
the rally was designed to demonstrate strength by an 
antiabortion movement that has suffered recent political setbacks 
and to reverse the impression that antiabortion forces have been 
in political decline 
us park police estimated the crowd at 200000 people at 4 
pm up from an earlier estimate of 60000 before the really 
began speakers at the rally claimed larger numbers 
the national right to life committee the rallys sponsors had 
hoped for a crowd that rivaled in size an abortionrights gathering 
here that was attended by an estimated 300000 people a year ago 
and outstrip the 75000 who attended a january antiabortion march 
in washington 
the crowd mostly filled the grassy area surrounding the 
washington monument as springtime heat sent temperatures 
approaching 90 degrees some sought shade from surrounding trees 
and others made their own out of antiabortion placards lines to 
refreshment stands stretched 80 yards and the line to a water 
fountain ran 30 yards 
kate michelman head of the national abortion rights action 
league said her sides political and election successes in a 
number of states and not saturdays crowd are the accurate 
measure of public opinion on abortion 
in his remarks bush also made no direct reference to political 
divisions within his own republican party over abortion or to 
efforts by abortion opponents to win abortion restrictions in state 
legislatures 
a year ago bush emphasized to a similar gathering that he 
supported a constitutional amendment to reverse the supreme courts 
landmark roe vs wade decision that effectively gave women the 
right to abortion on demand 
bush pointed to adoption as the appropriate alternative to 
abortion 
our mission must be to help more and more americans make the 
right choice the choice for life bush said 
one day your lifesaving message will have reached and 
influenced every american and until then continue to work for the 
day when respect for human life is sacrosanct and beyond question 
i know from your devotion and selflessness that this day cannot be 
far away bush said 
vice president dan quayle appeared before the group and called 
legal abortion a terrible wound which for almost two decades has 
torn at our countrys heart 
quayle also did not directly refer to efforts to reverse the 
supreme court decision or to amend the constitution but he 
asserted that a great majority stands together against the 
terrible reality of unlimited abortion on demand 
the prolife movement is the humanitarian movement of our 
time quayle said 
entertainment began early in the day long before the afternoon 
program of catholic cardinals television evangelists country and 
gospel singers and antiabortion leaders 
im here because i feel real strongly that babies have a right 
to live said country singer terri gibbs who brought her 
6monthold son david 
rep henry hyde rill known for his sponsorship of 
antiabortion riders to government appropriations bills called the 
other sides prochoice slogan a fraud he said the answer 
to that is madam if youre pregnant you have a baby you have a 
baby nobody should have the choice to kill an innocent human life 
once its begun 
the rally was held at a time when their side has sustained a 
series of losses in elections and in state capitals in the wake of 
the supreme courts webster decision last summer while permitting 
greater state limits on abortions the decision gave new political 
vitality to supporters of abortion rights who depicted the debate 
as an attempt to take away a womans right to make her own 
reproductive decisions 
at least part of the motive is to try to reverse what we feel 
is a misperception about the strength of the right to life movement 
and also to give some politicians who might be wavering a little 
bit of backbone said gary l bauer president of the family 
research council and a white house aide to former president reagan 
it looks as though the court is going to ultimately reverse 
roe said dr jc willke president of the national right to 
life committee referring to the supreme courts 17yearold roe 
vs wade decision that legalized abortions our job now is to go 
to the 50 states and convince them to pass laws to protect 
unborn babies 
bushs remarks were his second by telephone hookup to 
antiabortion crowds in little more than three months 
on the jan 22 anniversary of the 1973 decision upholding 
abortions bush pledged this president stands with you on this 
issue of life 
but in a demonstration of the political conflict republicans 
feel over abortion bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater on that 
same day made clear there is room within the party for varying 
points of view on this issue

less than a month before elections the 
assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed colombia 
to the brink of political chaos 
after the shooting of candidate carlos pizarro in a jetliner 
thursday the countrys largest newspaper implored the government 
to do something for the love of god 
addressing president virgilio barco the el tiempo editorial 
said in your hands and only in your hands is the power to 
avoid the countrys dissolution 
the gravest aspect of colombias bloodletting is that the 
government has no idea how to even slow it said a member of a 
regional human rights committee based in medellin the cocaine 
capital 
he declined to be identified because he was afraid someone might 
be angered by his statements and kill him four of his predecessors 
have been assassinated 
in recent interviews pizarro the candidate for the leftist 
april 19 movement or m19 admitted he was afraid but he said his 
desire to lead colombia was greater than his fear of assassins 
bullets 
a gunman on a suicide mission shot pizarro aboard a colombian 
jetliner after it took off from bogotas airport pizarros 
bodyguards shot and killed the assassin 
two other presidential candidates had already been assassinated 
during the campaign for may 27 elections sen luis carlos galan of 
the ruling liberal party was gunned down last august at a political 
rally in bogota and bernardo jaramillo of the leftist patriotic 
union party was killed last month at the bogota airport 
authorities blamed the assassinations on drug traffickers 
the media citing security sources reported that traffickers 
were the main suspects in pizarros killing as well but the 
medellin cartel denied involvement and no government official has 
yet said who was responsible for pizarros assassination 
on saturday antonio navarro a longtime guerrilla leader of the 
april 19 movement announced he would take pizarros place as 
candidate for president 
traffickers have carried out a terrorist campaign that has 
killed nearly 300 colombians in the past nine months in an effort 
to halt the governments campaign to capture and extradite drug 
barons to the united states 
bombings by the medellin cartel have caused millions of dollars 
in property damage led to the militarization of medellin and other 
cities and shattered the nerves of citizens 
pizarros death appears to have pushed the country to its limit 
for the first time leading politicians suggested the government 
itself might be compromised by the killing 
several politicians and analysts said an armed assassin could 
not have been aboard a jetliner without the complicity of 
government and airport security personnel 
former president alfonso lopez said the assassinations of three 
candidates indicated that colombias armed forces must be 
reorganized 
lopez of the liberal party was president from 1974 to 1978 
official investigations have shown that certain members of the 
armed forces are allied with drug traffickers and the countrys 
rightwing death squads 
one of the countrys presidential candidates alvaro gomez said 
friday that barco should name a threeman council to run colombias 
security forces to avoid a military coup 
he suggested that barco had lost control over the armed forces 
gomez made the proposal in a written statement given to the press 
never has there been such a great and pathetic image of 
anarchy said gomez a presidential candidate of the conservative 
party 
barco of the liberal party rejected gomezs suggestion of a 
triumvirate saying the armed forces would be reorganized only if 
necessary 
continuing to focus on a military solution to colombias 
problems barco said late friday he would double the size of a 
3000man antiterrorist police unit 
the unit achieved its greatest success against drug traffickers 
when it killed a medellin cartel leader gonzalo rodriguez gacha 
in a gunfight last december 
both barco and his partys presidential candidate cesar 
gaviria have linked colombias salvation to constitutional reform 
through such reforms they hope to reform the corrupted congress 
strengthen the judicial system and provide more political 
representation for minority parties 
according to recent polls gaviria is heavily favored to win the 
presidential elections

attorney general dick thornburgh has withdrawn 
justice department recommendations for strict sentencing guidelines 
for white collar criminals a department spokesman said saturday 
the spokesman david runkel said the decision to take back the 
departments comments to the us sentencing commission came after 
white house counsel c boyden gray told the department the white 
house wanted to give the proposals further study 
the commission last fall had unveiled proposals that would 
require federal judges to impose stiff mandatory fines on companies 
convicted of polluting bilking the government and other socalled 
white collar crimes 
the washington post in its saturday editions said that in a 
feb 26 letter to the sentencing commission deputy attorney 
general donald ayer expressed the departments strong support 
for the guidelines 
but thornburgh who according to the newspaper was unaware of 
ayers letter told him to withdraw his letter which ayer did on 
march 16 thornburghs decision followed an intense lobbying 
campaign at the white house by defense contractors oil companies 
and other major businesses who claimed the sentencing guidelines 
could mean a corporate death penalty for some firms the post 
said 
however runkel said the departments criminal division had 
given the sentencing commission its view of the proposals before 
the justice recommendations went through the entire review 
process 
i think boyden said hey we havent had a chance to take a 
look at these and wanted to be part of the process runkel said 
they were later withdrawn so that the attorney general and 
white house could take a look at them that is being done in the 
attorney generals office now the spokesman said 
the department would file new recommendations in the near 
future runkel said 
i cant say at this time what the review is going to come up 
with whether the recommendations that go back will be the same or 
stronger or not he added 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said saturday that he was 
concerned that the department of justice has surrendered so 
easily to pressure from the white house and big business to go soft 
on white collar crime 
the departments withdrawal is undermining the battle against 
corporate crime at the very time when stronger law enforcement is 
most needed to deal with the multibilliondollar corporate scandals 
plaguing our economy and country kennedy said in a statement 
the commission created by congress in 1984 last fall proposed 
an escalating range of financial penalties with the severity 
becoming progressively steeper depending on the extent of 
highlevel management involvement prior convictions bribery of 
public officials defrauding of charitable organizations and risks 
to national security 
runkel said the withdrawal will not hurt the commissions 
deliberations since it does not have a quorum of members yet to 
make final decisions 
he said the review does not represent a change of heart on 
thornburghs part 
the attorney general has a record of going after white collar 
crime has decried weak sentences and applauded strong sentences 
runkel said

police have arrested a man they believe is the 
ski mask rapist responsible for up to 30 rapes in dallas since 
early 1985 
gilbert h escobedo a 38yearold coowner of an auto detail 
shop was arrested tuesday night as he allegedly tried to break 
into a womans apartment in north dallas police said friday 
we believe the intent was to break in and rape her 
detective sk hatchel said we think it was an attempted sexual 
assault 
escobedo was being held on four charges of investigation of 
aggravated sexual assault a burglary charge and an attempted 
burglary charge 
police said escobedo is a convicted burglar who has served time 
in texas prisons off and on since 1972 new evidence has linked him 
to 17 rapes and police said they believe he committed more than a 
dozen more 
we had circumstantial evidence in the past but up until this 
week we were unable to make a good case said detective re 
rommel he had been to the penitentiary for burglary and he knew 
what he was doing weve been watching him for several years 
rommel said escobedo is also a suspect in a rape case in 
suburban richardson and police in a southern california city where 
escobedo recently visited want to talk to him 
the rapist who wore a ski mask or hood was known for his 
burglary skills he began drawing public attention several years 
ago as police realized one man seemed to be responsible for a 
string of rapes 
most victims police said were women in their early 20s who 
were awakened and raped by a man who had broken in through a door 
or window 
the series of rapes began in 1985 soon after escobedo was 
released from prison where he was serving a term for a burglary 
conviction officers said 
the last attack attributed to the serial rapist was march 10

rival christian forces skirmished 
saturday with automatic rifles in east beirut but observed a 
21hour ceasefire in the christian hinterland to the north 
in east beirut two boys playing in an empty lot were killed 
when a mine exploded the victims were 8 and 10 years old said a 
police spokesman speaking anonymously in line with standing rules 
the incident occurred in the district of ein rummaneh held by 
rebellious christian gen michel aoun 
police said a man was killed and another was wounded in an 
exchange of sniper fire across east beirut between aouns troops 
and militiamen of samir geageas lebanese forces 
the battle for control of the christian enclave has killed 919 
people and wounded 2442 since it broke out jan 30 
aoun former interim prime minister does not recognize 
christian president elias hrawi whose government was set up last 
november under a peace plan aimed at ending a 15yearold civil 
war aoun has said he opposes the plan because it lacks a fixed 
timetable for the withdrawal of syrias estimated 40000 troops 
meanwhile a truce was reported holding on the eastern flank of 
the kesrouan province civilians flooded the contested resorts of 
kleiat and daraya to check on their damaged houses 
kleiat once a posh spot known for its restaurants and night 
clubs has been turned into a nomans land in savage fighting 
between aouns 19000 troops and geageas 6000strong militia 
geageas fighters control the western half of the village while 
aouns men control its northern edges and direct their fire onto 
its main square 
geageas militiamen also control a nearby hill overlooking the 
adjacent resort of daraya in aouns area of influence 
nearly all of darayas 12000 residents have fled hardly 200 of 
kleiats 20000 residents remain living in basements and 
underground shelters 
the police spokesman said most of the villagers who had stayed 
in the region up until now were taking advantage of the ceasefire 
to flee 
they appear convinced that allout clashes will break out 
again the spokesman said 
the ceasefire which went into effect at midmorning was 
mediated by maronite catholic monk bulos naaman he is a member of 
a threeman independent mediation committee that sponsored at least 
20 ceasefire calls during the threemonth confrontation 
both aoun and geagea are members of the maronite sect the 
largest christian community it has dominated political life the 
army command and the judiciary since lebanons independence from 
france in 1943 
the power struggle the worst intrachristian confrontation in 
the civil war has inflicted damage estimated at 1 billion it has 
forced 40 percent of the enclaves original population of 1 million 
to seek refuge in safer areas in lebanon and abroad

from the dust and desperation of a 
dump occupied by squatters to the cool white elegance of a rich 
mans home hope glimmered in the first days of nicaraguas new 
government 
the optimism seemed almost improbable given the rocky start of 
violeta barrios de chamorros conservative administration and the 
dire straits of this battered nation 
the 60yearold widow took office wednesday confronting deep 
divisions in her united national opposition coalition and thousands 
of contra rebels who refused to lay down their arms 
government ministries and agencies were in disarray some barely 
functioning and most under only nominal control of her coalition 
known as uno no one in uno would say whether the outgoing 
sandinistas had left enough money in the treasury to meet mondays 
state payroll 
in addition the value of the national currency was slashed in 
half friday and the prices of staples such as rice meat and oil 
soared 
but nicaraguans voted for change for peace and a measure of 
prosperity when they voted against the leftist sandinistas in the 
feb 25 elections and their expectations were not so quickly dashed 
in the bustling eastern market a bastion of freeenterprise 
spirit merchants shrugged off the latest plunge in the cordoba as 
a necessary evil 
they had to do something to stabilize things said appliance 
salesman carlos brinones the value was unrealistic if they can 
just keep it stable for six months 
the cordoba has ridden a roller coaster for years propelled by 
inflation that hit a staggering 36000 percent in 1988 
business is business candida salgado a sandinista said 
from the shade of her clothing shop it keeps going somehow it 
has its own magnetic force 
mrs salgado believes the sandinistas were good for nicaragua 
because they freed it from dictatorship now she says it is up to 
mrs chamorro to repair the damage inflicted by war with the 
usbacked contras and years of us economic sanctions 
from market to mansions nicaraguans expect the new government 
to reap millions in foreign aid and trade 
dona violeta could open a new path she could take us another 
step forward mrs salgado said as she sat chatting with her 
sister from miami 
nellie campos 52 ventured back for a visit after 10 years of 
exile because of mrs chamorros election she is thinking of 
staying for good 
business is always business she said echoing her sister 
there are always possibilities 
for mrs campos the decision to return hinges on whether she 
can reclaim her shop and house they were taken over under a law 
of absence that discouraged sandinista critics from returning 
from abroad 
the property of thousands of others was confiscated outright 
for them mrs chamorros election means a shot at recuperating 
some of their losses 
mariano valle for example lost 11 radio stations he and other 
prerevolutionary broadcasters expect the new government to follow 
through on its promise to review the confiscations 
the confiscated stations became part of a governmentrun network 
which the sandinistas handed over to party faithful after losing 
the election 
it was supposedly privatization valle scoffed during an 
interview at his elegant home 
the dismantling of the radio network was part of a postelection 
rush aimed at ensuring that sandinista loyalists wouldnt leave 
power emptyhanded 
thousands got homes occupied under the law of absence or 
confiscated by the government car dealers say their inventories 
were cleaned out for sandinista going away gifts at government 
expense 
we have sold 60 cars since the election said idalia 
gonzalez a saleswoman at the hyundai dealership we normally 
sell six a month 
the greedy scramble sparked a land rush among the leftout poor 
who have been squatting on vacant lots since the election 
expectations are basic in the ruined economy 
we hope the new government will help us get building 
materials rosalina garcia calero 52 said as fellow squatters 
at the dump burned trash and marked off 30footby45foot plots 
with rocks bits of debris and crooked sticks the old one never 
did 
mrs garcia was one of more than 150 homehungry people who have

portuguese news agency lusa said confusion arose after the june 
truce when the two sides announced differing interpretations of the 
pact 
durao barroso said the two sides still had many differences to 
resolve 
frankly their positions are still very far apart he said 
the path to peace is angola is still a long one

aids researcher robert gallo is set to testify 
monday before a house panel investigating payments made by his 
government laboratory to a firm with ties to a fellow national 
institutes of health scientist a congressional source said 
saturday 
gallo a leading aids researcher will appear before the house 
energy and commerce committee along with officials of the general 
accounting office which has conducted an 18month investigation 
into hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to the firm pandata 
systems 
a committee source who spoke only on condition of anonymity said 
there is evidence that shareholders in pandata a contracting firm 
based in a maryland suburb of washington have included a close nih 
associate of gallo indianborn research scientist syed zaki 
salhuddin and his wife firoza 
published reports of ties to the company on the part of the 
salhuddins first appeared last year and gallo was quoted at the 
time in the washington post as saying he did not know of any 
relationship until 1988 
the chicago tribune in its sunday editions said the 
congressional inquiry has found evidence that rare and valuable 
viruses including the one that causes aids have found there way 
from gallos laboratory and been sold to universities private 
companies and other government agencies 
some numbered vials of virus that had belonged to the laboratory 
appear to have been sold but the committee is still attempting to 
establish conclusively who did the selling and under what 
circumstances according to the committee source 
syed zaki salhuddins brother sm salhuddin said the 
researcher was in belgium attending a scientific conference 
mrs salhuddin reached by telephone saturday declined to say 
whether she was a part owner of the contracting firm 
the committee source said evidence that the salhuddins have been 
shareholders in the company include small business administration 
records the source said committee investigators and the general 
accounting office an investigative arm of congress had found 
payments of as much as 800000 a year to pandata by gallos 
laboratory 
records show the firm was paid for a variety of reasons ranging 
from research assistance to providing office supplies to the 
laboratory according to the committee source 
energy and commerce committee chairman john dingell dmich is 
seeking to determine why nih did not inquire more deeply into the 
relationship between the laboratory and pandata the source said 
gallo has coauthored more than 60 scientific articles with 
salhuddin and has described him as the worlds leading researcher 
in the area of blood cell cultures

the hubble space telescopes 
electronic system was back in operation saturday but despite 
daylong efforts its highspeed antennas remained down and its 
science instruments on hold 
meanwhile discoverys five astronauts prepared to land at 949 
am edt sunday at edwards air force base calif amid some 
concern that high wind might force postponement the landing until 
monday or tuesday air force forecasters said winds at the desert 
base were expected to be close to the limit for a safe shuttle 
landing sunday 
its time to pack up our camping gear and get ready to come 
home said flight director wayne hale 
early saturday the 15 billion telescope was sent health and 
safety instructions to operate on its own a day earlier the 
electronic instruments had automatically shut down when they sensed 
trouble with one of two highgain antennas and when opening the 
lens cover made the telescope move 
the highgain antennas send data back to earth at high speed 
we are continuing to remain in good communication with the 
telescope said dave drachlis of the goddard space flight center 
in greenbelt md he said systems other than the antenna were 
running properly 
ground controllers at goddard tried moving the good highgain 
antenna but noticed the other antenna also was turning 
they basically stopped the process and scratched their 
heads for a bit drachlis said 
jean olivier a deputy project manager for hubble said various 
options are being considered to aim the good antenna without moving 
the bad one if computer programs must be adapted to get data from 
just one antenna it will be somewhat of a hit 
neither olivier nor mike harrington director of orbital 
verification ventured to say how much that might affect scientific 
returns 
the problems with the antennas have delayed calibration tests 
that ground controllers must conduct on the telescopes five 
scientific instruments 
drachlis said delaying those tests was not a major problem 
the overnight commands put the instruments on hold the state in 
which they will spend much of their time awaiting signals to wake 
up and study the heavens 
engineers can send commands to the telescope via its secondary 
lowgain antennas but that system which is considerably slower 
isnt useful for scientific data 
in a news conference from discovery astronaut bruce mccandless 
said hes not surprised a very complex system like this may have 
a few minor bugs to be worked out 
but neither the bugs nor the complexity seemed to have dampened 
the astronauts enthusiasm 
its hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard 
of the hubble space telescope said pilot charles bolden it 
makes little kids eyes light up it makes little kids want to 
learn how to add and subtract and study science 
and thats extremely gratifying to know that youre part of a 
mission that seems to have excited the nation as well as the world 
about something 
the astronauts made some lastminute observations of earth 
about 380 miles below the recordhigh shuttle altitude was needed 
to put the telescope in its proper orbit far above earths 
distorting atmosphere 
from what weve seen so far compared to some of our previous 
flights it looks a little bit better than we remember maybe a 
little less smoke in some places said discovery commander loren 
j shriver 
nasa expects to release its first test image from the telescope 
late this week at the earliest later than planned because of the 
antenna problems scientific data will follow in a month or two 
astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant their 
light has been traveling to earth for 14 billion years the 
universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion years 
ago

federal regulators cleaning up bankrupt 
savings and loans are finding theyve inherited another unexpected 
and expensive mess real estate contaminated by hazardous waste 
officials at the resolution trust corp which has taken over 
more than 400 insolvent sampls say some of the failed financial 
institutions had foreclosed on polluted property 
recent court rulings have found that financial institutions are 
potentially liable for cleaning up such property under the 1980 
superfund law by extension that could put the rtc on the hook 
the rtc doesnt know yet how many of its more than 30000 real 
estate parcels are contaminated but agency spokesman stephen j 
katsanos says im confident there are sites in our inventory 
that need some cleanup 
the rtc already faced with an estimated 325 billion price tag 
for its sampl bailout thinks the environmental protection agencys 
superfund should foot the bill on any failed sampl property cleanups 
the taxpayer is going to be paying for it one way or another 
but if it comes out of the rtc then it reduces the amount of 
money available to protect deposits katsanos said 
a bigger problem than the actual cleanup cost is the cloud of 
uncertainty cast over the rtcs portfolio 
pollution problems aside the agency has had great difficulty 
selling sampl assets when it turns over a failed institution to a new 
owner and the potential for an environmental expense is just one 
more risk discouraging the purchase of assets in large blocks 
not only do buyers have to worry about evaluating real estate 
owned by an sampl they have to worry about environmental problems at 
properties pledged as collateral for loans that may later turn sour 
other agencies including the small business administration and 
the farmers home administration also are wrestling with polluted 
properties 
sally narey sba general counsel estimated the agency has wound 
up with about 150 cases of contamination and there could be more 
not only does the sba face a possible problem when it forecloses 
on a delinquent loan it has guaranteed it could face liability 
from other programs in which it provides operating advice to 
businesses 
we just dont know whats out there that we havent uncovered 
yet she said 
a bank or sampl as private enterprises can simply steer clear of 
making loans to highrisk businesses but the sba as a government 
agency is caught in the middle 
its a difficult situation our mission is to make loans to 
small businesses that cant get loans elsewhere narey said 
a variety of legislation introduced in congress aims to address 
the problem both for the agencies and for financial institutions 
sen jake garn rutah the senior republican on the senate banking 
committee would provide immunity to federal banking agencies as 
well as lenders for environmental problems they only inherited not 
created 
my sense is this is a much bigger problem than a lot of people 
think it is there are more examples all the time garn said 
rep silvio conte rmass has offered a bill applying only to 
government agencies while earlier this month rep john j lafalce 
dny chairman of the house small business committee introduced 
legislation that would exempt only lenders 
another proposal by rep curt weldon rpa would exempt 
lenders only if they paid for an environmental audit to determine 
before taking over a property if it is contaminated 
the epa and private environmental groups are opposing the bills 
as unnecessary the superfund law already provides some protection 
to lenders who only have a security interest in a property and no 
role in its management 
the problem from banks perspective is that they often in 
effect become managers of a property after they foreclose even 
before foreclosure a lender will sometimes participate in 
management in an effort to steer a borrower out of trouble 
epa enforcement attorney glenn unterberger said cases of 
potential lender liability vary so widely that it is better to let 
the courts judge each on the facts rather than trying to write a 
blanket rule to cover all situations 
moreover he added epa is making some reasoned decisions 
about when its reasonable to pursue lending institutions 
attorney donald strait of the natural resources defense council 
said he fears providing greater protection for lenders could result 
in windfall profits at the taxpayers expense 
all of a sudden a bank which took over a site which was worth 
very little would have a much more valuable site because it was 
cleaned up with taxpayers money i dont think banks should get 
that windfall strait said 
sponsors of the bills say they are willing to write them to 
prevent such profit and they argue that without the legislation 
businesses face a credit crunch particularly highrisk businesses 
such as gasoline stations and dry cleaners 
forcing banks to pay for environmental studies before they 
accept property as collateral is no solution either said thomas 
greco of the american bankers association 
the lowest level of investigation will probably cost 2000 or 
3000 these things can rapidly escalate to 10000 20000 or 
25000 and even then theres no assurance the bank will be 
protected greco said

federal agents have arrested a captain 
and two crew members for allegedly violating federal law after they 
were caught with an endangered kemps ridley sea turtle 
the turtle was tethered to the mens boat when the coast guard 
made a routine inspection in the gulf of mexico authorities said 
inspectors also caught the three men trawling for shrimp on 
tuesday with no turtle excluder devices attached to their nets the 
coast guard said 
the fishermen were arrested friday at a dock in the clear lake 
area officials said 
hung van tran 37 master of the shrimp boat capt paul le and 
crewmen quang duc nguyen 34 and binh van nguyen 33 are charged 
with illegal possession of a sea turtle and aiding and abetting in 
the illegal possession of a sea turtle violations of the federal 
endangered species act 
each carries a penalty of up to a year in prison and a 100000 
fine 
investigators said charges of failure to use excluder devices 
may be filed next week against the three they were released on 
their own recognizance 
shrimpers last fall protested the requirement they use the 
devices saying up to 30 percent of their catch was lost because of 
the devices since the law went into effect several shrimpers have 
been fined for not using them

onethird of the projects in a 16 billion 
elderly housing program are in or near financial ruin with bloated 
loans and lousy management to blame according to auditors who say 
the government will have little choice but to foot the bill 
on at least two occasions prominent republican political 
consultants swayed senior department of housing and urban 
development officials to overrule field deputies and approve loans 
for projects in the troubled retirement service center program the 
internal audit says 
the study details anew favoritism and myriad management problems 
at hud during the reagan administration tenure of secretary samuel 
r pierce jr 
it also suggests the pricetag for that mismanagement is rising 
with no end in sight as millions of dollars in loans insured by 
the government go sour 
there is a high probability that as more recently approved 
retirement centers proceed through their processing stages 
additional projects will become troubled or go into default the 
auditors concluded in the new report obtained by the associated 
press through the freedom of information act 
and the money lost and wasted in many cases went to projects 
that catered not to low and moderateincome people but for 
developments featuring fountainfilled lobbies plush dining rooms 
swimming pools and rents in excess of 2000 a month 
it would take an income of at least 25000 a year to live in 
many of the centers while the median annual income for the over65 
population is roughly 15000 
as in other hud programs in which private lenders were allowed 
to underwrite hudinsured mortgages the audit found lenders were 
too generous in their appraisals and thus approved excessive 
mortgages 
such bloated loans bring lenders higher fees they also result 
in higher rents because of the cash flow needed to pay the 
mortgage and the high rents in turn contribute to the unusually 
high vacancy rate in such projects the auditors said ultimately 
causing cash crunches that trigger defaults 
hud secretary jack kemp suspended the program last july after a 
limited audit in the chicago area first touched on its problems 
finding bad or shaky loans totaling 119 million 
kemp has yet to decide whether to revive the program the 
auditors said it would need a total overhaul and cited ample 
justification to kill it 
in the reports nationwide review of the program auditors said 
62 of 190 retirement service centers or nearly 33 percent 
either had defaulted or were financially troubled the mortgages 
for the 62 facilities total 599 million nearly 40 percent of the 
16 billion spent on the program 
hud is liable for at least 85 percent and in some cases 100 
percent of the loans should they default 
the 599 million figure was from loan data through last october 
preliminary results of a followup review that includes more recent 
data paint an even bleaker picture a hud official said friday the 
auditors told kemp he needs to develop a program to sell the 
centers that are coming under huds control because of defaults 
the report said that in at least 17 cases hud field offices and 
the private lenders ignored reports in which hud economists said 
local housing markets would not sustain the projects fifteen of 
those projects are now in default or severe financial trouble 
the auditors also questioned 10 cases in which officials at hud 
headquarters overruled field office rejections of project 
proposals in most cases no documentation could be found to 
support the reversals the report said 
at least two of those involved political favoritism the audit 
said 
in one case the developer of a project rejected by hud 
officials in san francisco because of a saturated market paid 
30000 to gop consultant lou kitchin who worked for both the 
reagan and bush presidential campaigns 
kitchin met with senior hud officials in washington including 
top pierce deputy deborah gore dean and won approval for the 132 
million project that project the woodcrest retirement service 
center in escondido is surviving because of the default of a 
nearby hudinsured center the audit said 
in the second case robert weinberger a republican consultant 
and the nephew of former defense secretary caspar weinberger 
persuaded hud headquarters officials to overrule local officials 
and approve a 37 million hudinsured mortgage for the rosewood 
estate development in roseville minn 
the audit refers to the consultants but does not name them but 
the role of kitchin and weinberger in the projects surfaced last 
year during investigations of influencepeddling at the agency 
many of the management shortfalls cited by the auditors included 
seemingly routine tasks the report said hud failed to require 
status reports from the private lenders had few written guidelines 
for program management did not coordinate headquarters decisions 
with appropriate field offices and never bothered to assess the 
potential risks of the program or whether it would result in 
affordable housing

basking in the adulation of anticommunist exiles 
former president reagan on saturday called for free elections and 
democratic reforms in cuba in a speech fidel castro could have 
heard in his living room 
test yourself in a vote mr castro let the voices of the 
cuban people be heard reagan said in an address broadcast live 
to cuba on the usfunded radio marti network 
in the sanctity of the secret polling both the voice of 
freedom triumphs he added 
reagans 30minute speech to a predominantly cuban audience of 
about 10000 in miamis orange bowl capped a 3hour rally attended 
by dozens of other officials among them were cubanborn us rep 
ileana roslehtinen rfla and president bushs son jeb 
many cuban leaders credit reagan with beginning a prodemocracy 
avalanche that may eventually bury castro and allow the return of 
thousands of exiles 
i believe we will soon be singing to liberty and independence 
in cuba said jorge mas canosa chairman of the cuban american 
national foundation and an early supporter of the 5yearold radio 
marti program 
canosa said the rally and speech was the first event broadcast 
live to cuba via radio marti 
foundation spokeswoman marilyn kalusin said reagan spoke free of 
charge 
reagan praised both radio marti and the new tv marti network as 
instrumental in building grassroots opposition to castro 
this is an authentic breakthrough in us information programs 
because it is television that hold such promise and potential the 
power of pictures the visual images of freedom that are sweeping 
the world said reagan 
they will see the berlin wall coming down the last speech of 
romanias dictator the soviet citizens massing by the thousands in 
front of the kremlin in support of broader democracy in the soviet 
union 
the cuban government has jammed the tv marti signal since its 
first broadcast march 27 earlier this month radio marti was also 
jammed for first time since it went on the air both the radio and 
television stations are named after 19th century cuban independence 
hero jose marti 
we can understand why fidel castro is so hysterical in his 
denunications of tv marti said reagan who wore a traditional 
cuban guayabera an opencollared shirt what is he afraid of he 
is afraid of the truth 
the crowd interrupted reagan several times with applause and 
waved cuban flags 
cuban and us flags were marched into the stadium by the 
brigade 2506 a group of cuban exiles who launched the unsuccessful 
bay of pigs invasion of their homeland in 1961 
i look forward to the day that this gathering will be held in 
free cuba and i know that day will come and soon said reagan 
he also called on the soviet union to cut off its massive aid to 
cuba 
i hope it wont be too much longer before the soviet union 
joins eastern europe in redefining its relationship with cuba he 
said maintaining their economic umbilical cord to castro the 
worlds most vehement critic of sovietstyle reforms is 
anachronistic behavior in todays world

a member of prime minister margaret thatchers 
cabinet on saturday defended the unpopular tax that set off a riot 
last month but reports said the government was thinking about 
amending it 
the local per capita tax which went into effect april 1 and 
replaced a property tax seriously undermined support for mrs 
thatchers conservative party 
the conservatives are expected to fare badly in local council 
elections across the country thursday because of hostility toward 
the tax 
the times of london which often backs the conservatives quoted 
unidentified sources at the prime ministers office as saying 
legislation to amend the new tax could be introduced later this 
year 
on saturday however trade secretary nicholas ridley defended 
the tax whose revenues are to help fund local councils spending 
ridleys comments were described by the sunday correspondent 
newspaper as an indication of disarray in the thatcher government 
over the attempt to repackage the poll tax 
the government calls the tax a community charge but the 
opposition socialist labor party and others have dubbed it the poll 
tax after a similar per capita tax that sparked a peasants revolt 
in 1381 
under the measure local services are paid for not by a property 
tax as in the past but by a per capita tax on everyone over 18 the 
rate is set by each local district and varies widely 
ridley said if the labor party took power they would keep the 
charge because they would have to face up to the reality of the 
need to restrain local government spending in the interests of 
overall economic management 
critics however say the new tax is unfair because unlike 
income tax it takes no account of an individuals ability to pay 
and poorer people must pay the same as wealthier people lowincome 
families and some other groups can get rebates of up to 80 percent 
under the new system 
violence broke out at antitax demonstrations around the country 
last month a demonstration by 40000 people in london on march 31 
turned into a sixhour riot with 86 civilians and 374 police 
injured and 339 people arrested 
mrs thatcher came to power in 1979 and is now in her third 
term the next general election is due by mid1992

state police warned 
gamblers to stay away saturday night as indian casinos reopened for 
the first time since gambling opponents blockaded this strifetorn 
mohawk reservation in march 
fearing further violence after nearly a week of nightly gunfire 
and vandalism more than 500 women children and elderly people 
fled friday from the canadian side of the st regis mohawk 
reservation the reservation home to some 14000 straddles the 
uscanada border 
the reservation was quiet friday and saturday authorities said 
authorities and mohawks had feared renewed violence when workers 
returned home for the weekend and casinos reopened although some 
casinos were open many of their employees stayed home and the 
usual busloads of customers were expected to be absent saturday 
night 
state police put up informational roadblocks at entrances to the 
mohawk land warning people to stay off the reservation because of 
violence customs agents along the border searched cars for weapons 
residents are divided over casinos and bingo halls on the 
american side of the reservation 
the feud also touches on the question of indian sovereignty 
whether state and federal officials have the authority to intervene 
in a dispute between indian factions 
in late march gambling opponents blockaded roads leading to the 
reservation progambling mohawks tore down the blockades in a 
fierce fight tuesday night and for several nights there were 
violent confrontations between the factions 
buildings on the reservation are spraypainted with pro and 
antigambling slogans and areas where fighting has occurred are 
littered with broken glass burnt car parts and spent shells 
mike mitchell chief of the canadian mohawk council said he 
ordered the evacuation because residents were in danger evacuees 
were housed in dormitory rooms at a training center for air traffic 
controllers in cornwall ontario 
evacuees decided to return home monday if they dont get a 
commitment of support from the american or canadian governments 
mitchell said 
he said he believed both sides in the gambling dispute should 
surrender their arms but he doesnt think that will happen 
voluntarily 
if no outside government gives us assistance putting those 
weapons away were going to have to do it ourselves he said 
mohawk chief harold tarbell a gambling opponent has called on 
new york gov mario cuomo to send in the national guard to restore 
order 
cuomo said saturday that so far there is no necessity for 
military involvement he said some mohawks were exaggerating the 
seriousness of the violence to advance their own political 
cause 
one mohawk chief david jacobs agreed that some indians were 
making the violence sound worse than it was 
it is my profound hope that chief tarbells alarmist calls for 
intervention do not result in the revival of unrest on the 
reservation said jacobs a gambling supporter

in a handful of cities on the 
mexican border american men still throng to the brothels of boys 
towns legal prostitution zones little changed by fears of sexual 
disease or campaigns for more wholesome tourism 
at least five mexican border cities have flourishing boys towns 
and though some have been moved away from central tourist 
districts they remain popular attractions for businessmen hunters 
and teenagers 
theyre accepted with little controversy although texas 
republican gubernatorial candidate clayton williams drew heat 
after admitting recently that he frequented border brothels during 
his college years more than 30 years ago because they were the only 
place to get serviced 
visiting the prostitutes williams said was just part of 
growing up in west texas 
on a thursday night in acuna across the border from the texas 
town of del rio about 50 american men mingled with mexican women 
at the hunters saloon beneath a glittering banner that proclaims in 
english welcome hunters 
while nude dancers perform on stage prostitutes lead customers 
toward the bars back rooms 
were just here to check it out said one texas man gazing 
around the bar this is really mild compared to a lot of places 
outside along the dusty streets of boys town also known as la 
zona de tolerancia or zone of tolerance scattered groups of men 
from nearby air force installations teenagers and other americans 
wander to bars like the rio club and la camelia 
the halfdozen bars most only a few years old and 
wellappointed are clustered on a small hill along a gravel road 
south of town smaller and older brothels cater to mexican clients 
a del rio businessman in his 40s who has frequented the brothels 
for more than 20 years says theres little fear of aids or other 
sexual diseases 
i believe there are more problems with diseases in the big 
cities said the man who declined to be identified these 
ladies go to medical checkups every week a doctor checks them 
dr herbert h ortega of el paso executive director of the 
usmexico border health association said aids is almost 
nonexistent among the prostitutes he credits education efforts 
by the association and other groups such as the panamerican 
health organization that he leads 
acuna health officials last week cited some prostitutes for not 
having health certificates and checked them for disease 
men visiting boys towns say many prostitutes require condoms 
some say the threat of disease limits them to looking 
its too much of a chance going home with something you dont 
want said a brownwood texas man who made a side trip to acuna 
from a seminar for undercover narcotics agents in del rio the 
agent who did not want to be identified said he was there only to 
drink and look 
until the early 1980s boys town was near the center of acuna a 
city of about 120000 after residents complained about the noise 
the district was moved out of town and the party atmosphere 
subsided 
boys towns also flourish in the border towns of reynosa juarez 
neuvo laredo and piedras negras 
prostitutes come from all over mexico to earn money at the 
brothels 
clients say the women charge 40 to 100 for their services the 
prostitutes wont discuss profits 
they say they have no pimps and keep all the money they get 
except for about 5 per customer they pay the bar for use of a room 
by contrast the legal minimum wage in mexico for unskilled 
workers is 390 a day mexican workers in some american factories 
along the border generally are considered wellpaid at about 100 a 
week 
the prostitutes shy away from discussing their personal lives 
rosalinda 26 said in her six months in acuna she has had sex 
with thousands of men 
her only complaints are slow nights early in the week and the 
american youths who come not for sex but to take advantage of 
mexicos lower drinking age 
you dont need them around rosalinda said in spanish 
what do you need them for

seabrook nuclear power plant officials 
ordered the reactor shut down for four to six weeks of 
modifications saturday shortly before the longdelayed plant was 
to produce its first commercial electricity 
seabrook officials decided saturday morning that electrical 
feedback from the new england power grid could cause a section of 
the plants turbine to vibrate beyond specifications plant 
spokesman david scanzoni said 
its a delay but thats the purpose of the test scanzoni 
said well take all the time thats necessary 
he said plant engineers have yet to determine what modifications 
are needed on the turbine a 200footlong shaft that drives an 
electrical generator the problem didnt involve the reactor 
the reactor which has operated at up to 10 percent of full 
power since winning its commercial license from the nuclear 
regulatory commission on march 1 was at 6 percent power before the 
shutdown scanzoni said 
plant officials had hoped the reactor would begin commercial 
operation by early this week and reach 100 percent power within two 
to three months scanzoni said seabrook now wont be able to start 
commercial operation before late may 
saturdays shutdown was the third shut down since the reactor 
since the current phase of testing began march 20 the reactor was 
shut march 22 for adjustments and again a week later because of 
questionable readings from sensors on the turbine scanzoni said 
the 65 billion 1150megawatt reactor initially planned to 
operate commercially in 1979 at a fraction of the cost wasnt 
completed until 1986 because of repeated regulatory delays and cost 
overruns concerns about evacuation planning for crowded beach 
communities less than two miles from the plant held up a commercial 
license until this year 
the delays forced lead seabrook owner public service company of 
new hampshire to seek bankruptcy protection in 1988 the plant also 
has been the site of antinuclear demonstrations that have resulted 
in more than 3000 arrests since 1976

berkshire west of london said thames valley police 
three other people in the car were injured including fullers 
wife stephanie and his son laurence 3 said police speaking on 
condition of anonymity in line with british custom 
fuller was appointed art critic last year of the sunday 
telegraph which carried his final review in its sunday edition 
trevor grove editor of the weekly said peter fuller was one of 
the most perceptive passionate and fluent art critics of our 
time 
his defense of traditional artistic values and vigorous 
skepticism of what was and is bogus in the modernist movement made 
his writing both controversial and stimulating but this never 
blinded him to the merits of good contemporary work grove said 
in 1987 fuller founded and edited the quarterly modern painters 
principally to bring to attention british artists whom he 
considered were too often underrated in britain where sales of 
art magazines and books are traditionally modest the magazine had 
an astonishing successs and attracted several thousand 
subscriptions 
fuller wrote in what was to be his final newspaper reviewin 
britain right now painting seems to be in a more robust state than 
anywhere else in the world

a radical iranian newspaper on saturday 
attacked irans vice president for suggesting direct talks with the 
united states the official islamic republic news agency reported 
vice president ataollah mohajerani in a column in the 
farsilanguage newspaper ettelaat on thursday had argued that iran 
has much to gain by agreeing to direct talks with the united states

stirred a feeling of disgust among the people and the 
officials according to irna monitored in cyprus

tehran university students has called for a demonstration sunday to 
protest against mohajeranis comments 
president hashemi rafsanjani has spoken in favor of normalizing 
ties with the west especially the west european countries but 
until the mohajerani article no highranking iranian official had 
argued publicly that tehran should reestablish ties with 
washington 
rafsanjanis radical opponents are unwilling to consider the 
possibility of renewed relations with the united states iran has 
been implacably antiamerican since its 1979 islamic revolution 
in his article mohajerani argued that the united states could 
pressure iraq into withdrawing troops from iranian territory seized 
in the eightyear persian gulf war 
mohajerani also said that talks could result in the freeing of 
billions of dollars in frozen iranian assets the united states 
froze the assets and severed ties after iranian militants stormed

the justice department is conducting an 
internal inquiry into allegations of misconduct by the acting us 
attorney in miami whose office is prosecuting manuel noriega 
according to sources 
the investigation of dexter lehtinen comes as the senate 
judiciary committee considers his nomination by president bush to a 
full term as the chief federal prosecutor in south florida 
the sources familiar with the inquiry and who asked not to be 
identified by name said the justice department office of 
professional responsibility recently sent investigators to miami to 
conduct interviews into allegations including 
that lehtinen pressured his staff to inflate overtime reports 
to prompt washington to boost the size of his office now one of 
the justice departments largest 
that lehtinen tried to participate in a public corruption 
investigation after recusing himself from a case which involved a 
potential political rival of his wife rep ileana roslehtinen 
rfla 
that a letter written by lehtinens spokeswoman diane cossin 
to the miami herald may have violated federal privacy law the 
letter said lehtinen once almost fired a former prosecutor for 
egregious misconduct 
the herald obtained a copy of the personnel file of the 
prosecutor who resigned last month and reported that its contents 
did not support the statements in ms cossins letter 
lehtinen did not immediately return a telephone call seeking 
comment friday 
ms cossin declined to comment on the reported inquiry saying 
we dont respond to speculation and we dont confirm or deny 
investigations 
lehtinen has been in the headlines before 
in january attorney general dick thornburgh eased lehtinen off 
the noriega trial team government sources said at the time that 
the attorney general took the action because of concern that 
lehtinens volatile temper and his relatively modest trial 
experience could hamper the governments drugtrafficking case 
against the deposed panamanian leader 
the internal justice department investigation comes at a 
politically sensitive time lehtinens nomination to a full term as 
us attorney in miami is pending in the senate 
the review also could prove ticklish for the bush administration 
because of lehtinens political ties to the white house 
the presidents son jeb supported ms roslehtinens 
successful campaign last summer to win the seat of the late rep 
claude pepper dfla president bush personally campaigned for ms 
roslehtinen who is popular in miamis cubanamerican community 
one of the items under review involves an alleged attempt by 
lehtinen to involve himself in the corruption investigation of 
hialeah mayor raul martinez after publicly recusing himself from 
the case according to sources familiar with the probe 
in announcing his recusal lehtinen explained that martinez who 
was indicted this month on racketeering charges was a possible 
political rival of his wife 
the false overtime report allegation stems from a staff meeting 
during which lehtinen told prosecutors they should take more credit 
for the long hours they put in the sources said 
lehtinen told the staff that he wanted the us attorneys 
office for the southern district of florida to replace the southern 
district of new york in the eyes of the nations lawyers as the 
premier branch of the justice department the sources added 
lehtinen told staff attorneys that federal prosecutors in the 
departments new york office worked 65 hours of overtime a month 
and expressed confidence that miami prosecutors did so as well the 
sources said 
federal prosecutors do not receive additional pay for overtime 
work but the figures collected by the justice department in 
monthly statistical reports from the nations 93 us attorneys 
offices are used to determine whether to add more prosecutors to a 
particular office 
the number of federal prosecutors in the office increased from 
88 in november 1988 to 154 currently and the justice department 
has authorized as many as 200 this year officials said 
the possible privacy act violation involves a march 12 letter 
ms cossin wrote to the herald in reply to a letter the newspaper 
had published from david demaio who resigned to join a private 
miami firm 
the departure of demaio and four others from the office was 
cited by the herald as evidence of staff dissatisfaction with 
lehtinen 
the herald article quoted ms cossin as saying the fact the 
prosecutors stayed long after lehtinen took over indicates some 
sort of happiness with the office 
demaio wrote a letter published by the herald saying her views 
do not necessarily reflect my own and she was not authorized to 
speak for me 
by way of reply ms cossin wrote that lehtinen had authorized 
her to state that he had once almost fired demaio for egregious 
misconduct and was counseled for failure to pursue important 
investigations properly and denied a pay raise

500 to 2500 establish their identities and have jobs 
residences and lawyers or other accredited representatives

return to detention or leave the country if ordered the newspaper

the ins said there are 5000 to 6000 aliens in its detention 
centers not including cubans from the mariel boatlift who are 
considered criminals 
the director of the refugee project for the lawyers committee

talks he had with the new ins commissioner gene mcnary 
we hope that this release project will demonstrate that many 
refugees are being unnecessarily incarcerated in the united

former black panther johnny spain 
whose double murder conviction in a 1971 san quentin prison 
uprising was overturned because he was shackled during his trial 
will not be retried authorities said friday 
marin county district attorney jerry herman called the reversal 
of spains conviction a travesty and a gross miscarriage of 
justice but said in a statement that a retrial would serve no 
practical purpose 
since this case is now 19 years old and since the defendant 
spain has now been out of custody and led a crimefree life for 
three years it is impossible to believe that a conviction secured 
after a retrial would result in the defendant spain being 
resentenced to prison herman said 
spain 40 has been out of prison for just over two years he 
was freed in march 1988 after a judge ordered the state parole 
board not to consider the san quentin incident in deciding whether 
spain was suitable for parole from a 1967 murder conviction 
herman said the widows and families of three prison guards who 
were killed in the incident and three other guards who survived 
after their throats were cut support our decision not to retry 
the case 
spains lawyer dennis riordan said he was relieved not only 
that the case was over but also that that era is being laid to 
rest 
it was a time of tremendous racial and political violence 
when decent people on both sides of the line were killed riordan 
said you have to put it behind you at some point and go on or 
the cycle continues 
three guards and three prisoners including militant leader 
george jackson author of the book soledad brother were killed 
in the august 1971 melee authorities said it started when jackson 
pulled a smuggled gun from beneath a hairpiece and tried to escape 
from the prisons isolation unit 
spain then serving a life sentence for a los angeles murder 
committed when he was 17 was seen running with jackson out of the 
maximumsecurity unit and was accused of aiding jackson in the 
escape attempt and the murders 
us district judge thelton henderson overturned spains 
convictions in 1982 ruling that marin county superior court judge 
henry broderick had improperly left on the jury a woman who had 
said she thought a friend had been murdered by a black panther 
the supreme court reversed hendersons ruling in 1983 but left 
other issues unresolved henderson again overturned the convictions 
in 1986 this time citing the 25 pounds of shackles jackson was 
forced to wear throughout the court proceedings from 1971 to 1976 
the chains sometimes attached for 10 to 12 hours a day 
hampered spains ability to communicate with his lawyer may have 
affected his decision not to testify and may have prejudiced the 
jury against him spain said

some 2000 mohawk 
indians began evacuating their reservation friday to escape 
factional violence that has left roadways lined with burned cars 
and caused residents including children to brandish arms 
gov mario cuomo meanwhile stood firm on his refusal to send 
new york state police or national guardsmen to restore order on the 
st regis mohawk reservation despite pleas from one indian leader 
and some outsiders 
one man was critically injured in the violence and another was 
missing 
the reservation straddles new york and canada but the violence 
so far has taken place on the united states side 
after a week of nightly confrontations between indians who 
support casino gambling and bingo on the us side and those who 
oppose it canadian mohawk leaders on friday evacuated women 
children and the elderly from the village of st regis in quebec 
which is near the violence on the new york state border they were 
sent to nearby cornwall ontario just outside the reservation 
it has become a very tense situation and we can no longer 
guarantee safety for our people said lloyd benedict chief of 
the canadian band council 
about 5000 mohawks live in the canadian sector of the 
reservation and its expected the evacuation will affect at least 
2000 of them he said the reservations total population is about 
14000 
the recent violence began march 23 when indians who oppose 
gambling set up roadblocks to keep outsiders off the reservation 
they demanded tribe leaders address the gambling dispute and the 
presence of the warrior society a heavily armed faction that has 
appointed itself the protector of mohawk sovereignty 
progambling mohawks tore down the blockades in a hailstorm of 
gunfire tuesday night but gambling has largely stopped since the 
barricades went up 
on friday the reservation straddling the canadian border had 
the look of a war zone 
burned cars lined the roads most buildings had bullet holes or 
broken windows and residents including children were armed with 
guns or baseball bats 
state police warn outsiders to stay off the reservation 
the latest casualty of the longrunning dispute was brian cole 
one of the leaders of the blockades he was in critical condition 
in ottawa general hospital friday after his skull and jaw were 
fractured in a confrontation thursday 
relatives said cole was helping search for horace cook 50 who 
came as a representative of the onondaga nation near syracuse to 
help monitor the barricades at the request of the antigambling 
faction cook a diabetic who doesnt see well has been missing 
since thursday 
among those calling for intervention has been st regis tribal 
council head chief harold tarbell who has asked for national 
guardsmen to serve as peacekeepers on the reservation 
on thursday us sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the 
select committee on indian affairs wrote cuomo expressing his 
concern about the most grave situation at st regis 
canada urged cuomo to take action in a complaint made by the its 
embassy in washington dc to the state department said patricia 
lowbedard a spokeswoman for the canadian department of external 
affairs 
we made no specific suggestions but our government finds the 
situation alarming and we are concerned that something needs to be 
done lowbedard said friday 
state troopers entered the reservation thursday to help search 
for cook on sunday to investigate a fire and last week to make 
their first arrests since last summer of five people involved in 
the violence 
we want this situation resolved cuomo said friday at a news 
conference in albany were working very hard to figure out how 
to do it i think what weve done so far what the state police 
have done so far has been appropriate

nazi hunter serge klarsfeld on friday hailed a 
magazine report as the first french media account of frances role 
in the roundup and deportation of 3500 jewish children who later 
died at auschwitz 
the episode in wellknown to historians klarsfeld said in 
an interview but this is the first time a journalist has ever 
gone to the scene of the crime to interview people who lived 
there 
the cover story in this weeks lexpress magazine published 
thursday details the role of the french police in the roundup 
klarsfeld who tracked down the lyon gestapo chief klaus barbie 
said he hoped the article would help speed court action against 
rene bousquet 80 charged with crimes against humanity 
bousquet was chief of the national police during the 
deportations which klarsfeld said were conducted by the 
collaborationist vichy government to curry favor with the nazi 
occupiers 
eric conan a reporter for lexpress visited the towns of 
pithiviers and beaunelarolande sites of two french concentration 
camps where the children spent their last days before being shipped 
to the nazis auschwitz death camp 
in pithiviers nothing absolutely nothing officially 
commemorates the agony experienced by the children before their 
deaths he wrote 
a collective gravestone in beaunelarolande shows three small 
children died at that time the stone reads simply victims of 
hitlers barbarism 
this is false they were under the auspices of the french 
government until the moment they died conan wrote 
the children were arrested in paris with their families july 
1617 1942 in the infamous vel dhiv roundup named for their 
destination a large cycling stadium 
the families were kept kept at the stadium for days without 
food water or sanitary facilities they were transferred to 
pithiviers and beaunelarolande the adults were sent directly on 
to auschwitz but the children including babies and toddlers 
remained for weeks in the camps where many died of starvation and 
disease 
they were later shipped to auschwitz and sent to the gas 
chambers on arrival 
klarsfeld said french authorities ordered the deportations of 
the children the nazis he said had issued orders for the roundup 
of only jews over age 16 for fear of inciting the occupied 
population 
they never would have taken the risk of arresting and dragging 
children into the streets of paris klarsfeld said

the chairman of a soviet parliamentary 
delegation says he will try to find out which soviet official 
rejected offers of international aid after the 1986 explosion at 
the chernobyl nuclear reactor 
with the full dimensions of the chernobyl disaster now becoming 
clear the supreme soviet has reversed course and is urgently 
seeking scientific medical and material aid from the world 
community 
at a news conference at the soviet embassy on friday five 
soviet parliamentary deputies said the official secrecy that 
shrouded the aftermath of the april 26 1986 fire and explosion at 
the chernobyl reactor was a damaging mistake because it masked the 
scope and scale of the disaster 
in addition they said efforts to clean up radiation 
contamination and deal with the medical effects of the accident 
might have been far more advanced by now if most foreign assistance 
had not been rejected

while the performance of all major us stock 
markets has been uninspired so far in 1990 the going has been 
particularly tough in the overthecounter market 
from new years through the middle of last week the dow jones 
average of 30 blue chips listed on the new york stock exchange 
posted a net decline of 315 percent 
over the same span the nasdaq composite index of issues that are 
traded overthecounter more than doubled that decline with a 753 
percent drop 
for the 12month period through april 25 the story is much the 
same with a gain of 1161 percent for the dow and a 067 percent 
decline for the nasdaq index the acronym stands for national 
association of securities dealers automated quotations 
all this is not very cheery news for individual investors who 
have a bigger proportional stake in overthecounter trading than 
they do at the nyse the primary hunting ground of investing 
institutions such as pension funds 
nor is it any great source of elation to joseph hardiman 
president of the nasd which serves as the industry overseer and 
regulatory organization for overthecounter activity 
but whatever ails the otc market can be largely attributed to 
investment vogues that tend to run in cycles hardiman suggested in 
an interview on a visit here from his washington headquarters 
the small growth companies that make up a big part of the nasdaq 
system he noted have suffered through an unusually long period of 
disfavor which most analysts trace as far back as 1983 
over that stretch both domestic institutions and foreign 
investors have gravitated to the big bluechip names i think the 
cycle may be about to reverse itself he said 
otc price indexes also have been dragged down hardiman added 
by the large number of bank and other financial stocks traded in 
the market 
beset by realestate debt woes and a new stringency in lending 
practices overthecounter bank stocks tumbled 2340 percent in 
the past year none of the many nyselisted bank holding companies 
by contrast is represented in the dow 
the image of the overthecounter market suffered a severe blow 
in the crash of 1987 as a flood of orders ran into bottlenecks and 
other problems 
hardiman says the system has been greatly strengthened since 
that time by new rules and procedures intended among other things 
to put greater reliance on automation 
in the current sluggish environment he observes weve got 
excess capacity at the moment 
how to restore the enthusiasm of investors for the kind of small 
and mediumsized stocks that make up such a large part of the 
nasdaq system hardiman sees no single wonder drug to prescribe 
but he maintains that both individual investors and the economy 
would benefit from a restoration of some form of favorable tax 
treatment for capital gains skewed to encourage longterm 
investment 
the longer you hold an asset the lower the tax rate should 
be he says 
i think individuals who think they can speculate by trying to 
trade the market are fooling themselves he adds they should 
be longterm investors buy stocks put them away and grow with 
the company 
some of the people who did the best in the october 1987 market 
break were individual investors who didnt sell

slim harrisons appalachian mountain music 
recently fell on deaf ears but those who were there had a 
kneeslappin good time 
students at the maryland school for the deaf who all wore 
hearing aids strummed his guitar plucked a wash tub bass picked 
the strings of his banjo and tapped spoons on their thighs a few 
of the youngsters could hear various tones from harrisons jug band 
instruments but most experienced the sounds through vibration 
the idea is to expose the kids to some different instruments 
that they probably have never seen said harrison whose program 
is one of a rising number of attempts across the country to 
introduce music to the hearing impaired theyve probably seen a 
guitar on tv but have not actually played it and felt the 
vibration 
if they have never felt the instrument with their hands and 
felt the vibrations they really cant understand what this music 
stuff is all about 
one group made such a racket that vibrations could be felt 
through tiles on the classroom floor teachers were holding their 
ears but the children were oblivious to the noise they were making 
it sounds that way with hearing children too harrison 
shouted as fourchildren played his banjo guitar dulcimer and 
autoharp all at the same time thats about par for the 
course 
harrison a oneman band is doing a fiveday residency at the 
122yearold school which provides free education to deaf students 
in maryland 
his work with 47 severely to profoundly deaf children is being 
sponsored by very special arts in maryland an organization that 
works to enrich the lives of disabled people through art and the 
maryland state arts council 
harrison has introduced the world of music to physically 
emotionally and mentally handicapped children during programs in 
rutland vt portland ore boston washington upland hills 
mich and across maryland this was the first time he had worked 
with a whole school of deaf students 
some of them can hear high tones but not low tones he 
said they can enjoy music on a different level than we do with 
loud rock n roll they can feel the vibrations shake their 
bodies 
the sound of harrisons autoharp apparently rattled the hearing 
aid of 8yearold robin oswald who cupped her hands over her ears 
and squinted her eyes the three other children in her class 
expressed no discomfort at the sound 
at one point in his program harrison lost charge of the 
children who in their excitement began chatting with their hands 
and doing impromptu solo performances 
how do you get deaf students attention he asked their 
teacher who quickly commanded their attention through eye contact 
and a series of hand signs 
harrison then launched into a tune on his dulcimer with the 
teacher signing the students a message about how the name of the 
instrument came from a latin word meaning sweet song or sweet 
love 
robert mowers music consultant to the national technical 
institute for the deaf in rochester ny said harrisons jug band 
program was one of a rising number of music programs being offered 
to the deaf 
most of them are very small said mowers who launched a 
music program at the institute 14 years ago despite comments from 
his colleagues who thought he was crazy 
there are many hearing impaired persons who enjoy music they 
just dont hear it like we do mowers said 
music heard by a deaf person might be like early radio 
broadcasts full of static or early records that played at 78 
revolutions per minute he said 
those 78 recordings were terrible full of distortions and 
scratches yet millions of people enjoyed them mowers said 
music could be better utilized by deaf educators nationwide 
according to deborah p clark an assistant principal at the 
maryland school for the deaf where music is a required course for 
primary students 
most deaf schools use it as an adjunct or motivator but not 
very many have a whole course on it she said 
it gives them a chance to work with the language in a musical 
and rhythmic way were trying to get them to practice the feel of 
a loud sound and the feel of a soft sound in their throats 
carol bean the schools music aide said she regularly teaches 
students about high and low notes on an organ equipped with large 
amplifiers 
they all cant hear but they can all feel the vibrations of 
the organ bean said the more exposure you can get the better 
it is otherwise the deaf world can be very narrow

glenda jackson the academy awardwinning actress 
and socialist is within reach of a dream abandoning the stage for 
politics 
jackson still has her choice of stage and screen roles but 
shes also a liberal who has chosen to tie her future to the labor 
party the socialist opposition 
if elected she faces the comparative obscurity of being a 
backbencher a rankandfile lawmaker in the 650member house of 
commons 
that means latenight sittings and looking after a constituency 
which can entail everything from fighting road expansions in the 
district to unsnarling hitches in the supply of hot meals to the 
elderly 
it also raises the fascinating prospect of that distinctively 
low richly textured jackson voice doing verbal battle with prime 
minister margaret thatcher at twiceweekly question time 
this spring after doing a los angeles production of whos 
afraid of virginia woolf jackson won the labor party nomination 
for hampstead and highgate home turf of londons smart literary 
and theatrical set 
thatchers troubled conservatives hold the district by a narrow 
2200vote margin making it a prime labor target at the next 
general election the election must be held by mid1992 but could 
well come sooner 
in british politics a candidate for parliament must go before 
the party constituency branch and explain why he or she would be a 
good candidate 
jackson was up against three finalists and she says her 
ultimate triumph was to write her own script 
i mean you dont win an oscar someone else wins it for 
you she said in an interview but this i did 
the actress won her first oscar for women in love in 1970 
followed by another for a touch of class in 1973 
but for her political career she chooses to look almost 
determinedly unglamorous making no attempt to hide her 53 years 
she is spurred by a hatred for thatcherism 
i hope shes hanging herself with her own hubris she said 
i am genuinely appalled by the state of my country and the plight 
of many thousands of people under a government that seems to govern 
only for the top people 
jackson has been a labor activist for most of the 11 years since 
thatcher won power she appears in party television ads and has 
lined up alongside leader neil kinnock at the big preelection 
rallies 
shes not the only actor involved in politics vanessa redgrave 
turns out for the ultraleft socialist workers party and john 
cleese for the centrist social democratic party but they have 
never run for office 
the late laurence olivier had a seat in the unelected house of 
lords after he was ennobled but actors who become fulltime 
politicians are a rarity in britain 
jacksons socialism springs from her workingclass roots in 
northern england the eldest of four daughters of a bricklayer she 
dropped out of high school at 16 to become a drugstore clerk she 
got into amateur dramatics smoothed out her northern accent won a 
state scholarship to drama school and went on to the front rank of 
british theater 
roy hodges from whom she was divorced in 1976 once said of 
her if glenda had gone into politics she would have been prime 
minister 
but jackson a committed feminist disclaims any such goals 
my political ambitions would be fulfilled by seeing the return 
of a labor government i plan to be a very loyal backbencher she 
said 
being famous guarantees jackson the kind of media attention 
other political beginners can only dream about 
the same goes for the only other celebrity among the firsttime 
nominees so far announced olympic gold medalist runner sebastian 
coe he has the conservative party nomination in a different 
district

the antiinflation austerity plan that has 
slowed brazils economy to a near standstill is reaching into the 
balance sheets of us companies thousands of miles away 
this past week whirlpool corp reported its firstquarter 
profit fell 275 percent due to the impact of the economic plan on 
its brazilian affiliates 
whirlpool chairman david r whitwam predicted the brazilian 
problems would hurt the appliance makers operating results into 
the second quarter before things gradually improve 
ford motor co also warned this past week that its earnings 
could be hurt if current conditions continue in brazil where it 
makes cars through a joint venture with volkswagen ag 
earlier caterpillar inc blamed lower firstquarter earnings in 
part on slower sales in the south american nation also jp 
morgan amp co bankamerica corp and chemical banking corp said 
they received lower interest payments or no interest payments at 
all on brazilian loans in recent months 
some of the revenue softness felt by us companies cant be 
traced directly to the brazilian austerity plan since it only was 
launched last month but economists warn that many foreign 
companies operating in brazil soon will feel the crimp unless they 
take steps to export products they make in the nation 
brazilian president fernando collor de mello initiated his 
inflationfighting plan a day after taking office march 15 its 
main feature is an 18month freeze on bank accounts with more than 
the equivalent of 1200 and a limit on money market withdrawals 
to 600 or 20 percent of the account whichever is greater 
the plan took an an estimated 115 billion out of circulation 
overnight it has cut inflation sharply but also sent the 
brazilian economy into a tailspin with the automobile 
construction and other industries virtually paralyzed 
many amercian companies have extensive operations in brazil the 
most industrialized nation in south america and eighthlargest 
economy in the world among them are ford caterpillar general 
motors corp johnson amp johnson union carbide corp champion 
international corp philip morris cos alcoa and quaker oats co 
javier murcio an economist with the economic research firm 
drimcgrawhill said the shortterm impact of the antiinflation 
plan could be severe on brazilian operations of these companies 
it will take lots of strong nerves in the short term its 
going to be very bumpy he said 
but over a longer period us companies may decide to export 
more goods from their brazilian operations avoiding the troubled 
domestic market as much as possible he said 
using brazil as an export launching pad is something companies 
have discovered in the past few years and will continue to do he 
said 
however mike sherman chief investment strategist for shearson 
lehman hutton inc said it may not be so easy to export 
manufactured goods that are made specifically for the brazilian 
market 
johnson amp johnson for one says it doesnt have the option of 
exporting its brazilian goods because we tend to manufacture in 
individual countries for sale in that country said spokesman 
robert kniffin 
johnson amp johnson makes the same array of hospital and consumer 
products in brazil as it does in the united states and elsewhere 
he said 
our plants are operating but there has been a noticeable 
decline in sales of products he said 
johnson amp johnson said thursday its firstquarter earnings 
dropped 23 percent due mainly to a 125 million charge the charge 
primarily was due to paying off an argentinian subsidiarys loan 
but part of it came from problems in brazil kniffin said 
murcio said the brazilian operations of foreign companies have 
been a bright spot and should continue to do well once the 
shortterm trouble from the economic plan eases in the long run 
he said all companies operating in brazil should benefit from 
lower inflation 
even despite the economic problems in brazil in the recent 
past the brazilian operations tended to be the ones that have been 
the fastest growing and most profitable he said 
in other business and economic news this past week 
junk bond pioneer michael milken pleaded guilty to six felony 
charges and agreed to pay 600 million in fines and penalties 
stemming from the biggest securities fraud case ever against an 
individual 
financier james goldsmith scrapped his 22 billion takeover 
attempt of bat industries plc which would have been one of the 
largest acquisitions in history in addition the british 
conglomerate agreed to sell its saks fifth avenue upscale fashion 
store chain to investcorp international inc a multinational 
investment group for about 15 billion 
ames department stores an eastern discount chain filed for 
protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws 
president bush removed japan from a hit list of countries 
judged to have erected the most offensive trade barriers against 
american products rewarding japanese efforts to ease trade 
tensions between the two economic superpowers 
donald trump said he is considering selling or refinancing 
virtually every major asset he owns including the trump shuttle 
his northeastern airline

in the mathematics of wall street a 9 percent 
interest rate equals a distinct minus for the stock market 
at least thats the way the numbers crunched in the past week as 
yields on longterm treasury bonds surpassed the 9 percent level 
for the first time in nearly a year 
there was a time a decade or so ago when stock and bond 
traders might have exulted to see interest rates at anywhere near 9 
percent in those inflationwracked days yields all along the 
creditmarket spectrum held persistently in two digits 
but now things are different or at least they were supposed to 
be as the 1990s dawned amid hopes for slow but steady growth in 
business activity and corporate profits without much interference 
from inflationary pressures 
at the start of the year longterm government bonds yielded 
slightly less than 8 percent and many forecasters voiced 
confidence that they were headed lower still 
lower rates figured to stimulate spending by both businesses and 
consumers and to benefit the stock market by reducing the 
comparative allure of interestbearing investments 
such visions quickly began to fade however when rates jumped 
in japan west germany and other important us trading partners 
dragging domestic rates higher as well 
optimism in the bond market has been dealt a second blow of late 
by data for the first quarter of the year showing inflation rates 
at their highest levels since the early 1980s 
now talk is spreading in the financial world that the federal 
reserve once again finds itself facing a choice between two 
notveryhappy alternatives 
the classic dilemma of higher inflation amidst pockets of 
economic weakness is confronting the fed said anthony vignola 
an analyst at kidder peabody amp co 
if the fed tightens policy and raises rates it will incur the 
displeasure of the administration and risk upsetting a delicate 
but deteriorating international framework 
more important the fed risks stifling economic growth which 
has suffered from continued weakness in manufacturing and housing 
as longterm rates rose to 9 percent the stock market averages 
headed down the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5090 
this past week to 264505 on top of a 5585point loss the week 
before 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 192 to 18074 
the american stock exchange market value index lost 532 to 34264 
and the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market was 
down 781 at 41798 
volume on the big board averaged 13559 million shares a day 
against 14902 million the week before 
whatever other negative possibilities it presents the 
combination of slow growth and high interest rates makes for gloom 
among stockmarket investors as they contemplate the outlook for 
corporate earnings 
unfortunately the economys slowmotion performance probably 
wont do much to bring inflation down any time soon says the 
current edition of the merrill lynch market letter 
thats because increases in labor costs show no signs of 
slowing and recent gains in productivity have been meager 
corporate profits are likely to remain under pressure for the 
foreseeable future as the economy plods along and inflation stays 
high 
a good many optimists still hold out hope that todays high 
rates by acting as a drag on business activity might improve the 
chance for lower borrowing costs at some point later in the year 
talk of at least a return to 8 percent government bond yields by 
the fall is still prevalent on wall street 
but upbeat interestrate forecasts tend to meet with a lot of 
skepticism these days if only because of the way the batch 
produced last winter turned out

by some of the more conventional measurements 
there is still plenty of credit available for american consumers 
and businesses especially those most creditworthy 
as one economist edward yardeni puts it lowquality 
borrowers who need to finance very risky activities are being 
turned away by the bankers but that leaves more lendable funds for 
highquality borrowers 
by another less conventional definition consumers businesses 
and governmental units at all levels are snared in a credit trap 
many of them destined for a long painful experience and perhaps 
bankruptcy 
by the conventional definitions the economy should avoid 
recession in 1990 and conceivably grow faster than in 1989 by the 
other it is already in the midst of a dangerous destructive 
creditrestraint recession 
the more optimistic scenario comes from a revue of national 
statistics including gross national product incomes shortterm 
loan data money in circulation and other figures used by 
government economists 
the negative conclusion comes from discussions with heads of 
households with folks who must meet the weektoweek bills if 
they cant it is assumed that the impact will spread with sales 
profits tax receipts falling 
the most common conventional definition of recession is two 
successive quarters of shrinking gross national product it hasnt 
occurred officially since the last recession ended in 1982 the 
longest gap of the century 
albert sindlingers definition is the unconventional one 
arrived at by talking directly to heads of households and asking 
them how their personal finances are holding up they arent he 
says families are in trouble 
how does he know from wallingford penn his staff telephones 
heads of households in the 48 contiguous states 1000 different 
ones each week a practice now approaching 13000 consecutive days 
the heads of households are asked these questions 
is your total combined household annual income up or the same 
as it was six months ago 
will the total combined household annual income for the next 
six months remain the same or be higher than now 
in the next six months will there be more or the same number 
of jobs where you work 
in the next six months do you anticipate better or the same 
business conditions in your community 
if the respondent answers any of the four questions with a 
negative response that household is said to have negative 
household liquidity roughly stated as inability or unwillingness 
to maintain current standards 
sindlinger tells his business clients that a state is declared 
to be in recession if household liquidity falls below 50 percent 
two states were in recession in january 1989 29 by december 34 in 
january and 41 in march 
the only states solidly beyond recession in march were illinois 
ohio and michigan four others washington wisconsin minnesota 
and indiana registered less than 55 percent meaning they have 
avoided recession by a lesser margin 
new england says sindlinger is in the deepest recession with 
a reading of only 384 percent five rocky mountain states and 12 
southeastern states are also listed in poor shape 
the rest except for the midwest states and washington are in 
shallower recessions sindlinger says 
using more conventional yardsticks yardeni sees no sign of a 
credit crunch in the shortterm loan data clearly he says 
shortterm credit continues to expand 
if there is a credit crunch out there we should see it he 
says it would show up in the statistics so far we dont see 
it 
but using information from another source sindlinger finds the 
credit crunch already is here that households are severely 
pinched and that as far as hes concerned most of the nation is 
in a recession

a trade association of futures fund managers has stepped into 
the turf battle for jurisdiction over stockindex futures with a 
simple plea if there has to be a change in regulators at least 
dont change the rules 
the request made to members of congress by the managed futures 
trade association may be a further indication that the futures 
industry is moving grudgingly toward acceptance of a change in the 
federal agency with authority over index futures 
the securities and exchange commission which regulates stock 
trading has long sought jurisdiction over index futures financial 
instruments that are derived from stock prices but regulated like 
all futures contracts by the commodity futures trading commission 
critics say the cftc is too lax and too cozy with the futures 
industry to properly safeguard the public interest 
the managed futures trading association is a pittsburghbased 
group representing 150 professional futures traders who manage an 
estimated 8 billion in public investment funds said jane martin 
executive director 
in a letter sent earlier this month to key members of congress 
the groups chairman kenneth tropin said the associations first 
choice would be to leave index futures under the jurisdiction of 
the cftc because it has expertise that the sec lacks in the area of 
futures trading 
but should congress decide to transfer authority over index 
futures to the sec tropin said the sec should not be allowed to 
change existing regulations that have been developed by the cftc 
stockindex futures contracts should continue to be regulated 
as futures contracts and not as equity instruments regardless of 
which regulatory agency is granted the responsibility to enforce 
such laws tropin said in his letter 
maintaining futurestrading rules as they currently exist he 
said will provide for a smooth regulatory transition and avoid 
the application of potentially duplicative disruptive and 
inconsistent regulations 
the next congressional hearing on the issue is a scheduled may 8 
session before the senate agriculture committee according to cftc 
spokesman david gary 
the jurisdictional issue has heated up since the 1987 stock 
market crash which some experts believe was exacerbated by 
computerdriven program trading strategies involving rapid 
simultaneous trades of huge amounts of both stocks and stockindex 
futures 
futures industry leaders contend index futures markets actually 
prevented an even steeper drop in stock prices on oct 19 1987 
when the dow jones industrial average fell 508 points 
sec chairman richard breeden and treasury secretary nicholas 
brady are urging congress to give the sec jurisdiction over 
stockindex futures which are contracts to buy and sell baskets of 
stocks such as those represented by the standard amp poors 500 index 
chicagos worldleading futures exchanges the chicago board of 
trade and the chicago mercantile exchange oppose the proposed 
regulatory change but earlier this month top officials of the 
chicago exchanges indicated that if any change in jurisdiction 
occurs they would prefer a proposal by rep dan glickman dkan 
and rep dennis eckart dohio for a superregulator that would 
have authority over all stock and futures trading

the history unfolding in eastern europe could 
have farreaching consequences for years to come and speculation 
about the impact has preoccupied investors in the worlds financial 
centers 
currencies have been bought and sold based on theories about 
what will happen to various economies particularly west germanys 
stocks have gained and lost as traders assess which companies will 
benefit from business opportunities 
the melding of the two germanies however might not mean all 
that much outside their joined borders a new study suggests 
the impact of german economic unification on other countries 
is relatively modest as the additional investment demand is not 
large relative to global investment and a disproportionate share of 
that investment demand is met by domestic german savings says 
the study by two members of the federal reserve boards staff in 
washington 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and prime minister lothar de 
maiziere of east germany confirmed at a meeting last week that the 
two nations soon will share an economy 
although many details must still be worked out there likely 
will be one german economy by july 2 west germanys agreement to 
swap most east german marks for its own marks at a 1to1 rate 
cleared the way for the process to begin a new currency is 
expected to go into circulation next autumn 
the fed analysts say the link ultimately will lead to an 
acceleration of investment and growth in a united germany a real 
appreciation of the deutschmark and a reduction in germanys 
current account surplus 
the boost in consumer demand expected to occur as the german 
economies blend is one of the outgrowths of unification that will 
directly affect the rest of the world 
after plugging various assumptions into a statistical model the 
study projects that the us trade deficit will contract but 
joseph e gagnon one of the authors said the shrinkage will be 
small considering the magnitude of us world trade 
the annual improvement in the us current account balance will 
peak at 15 billion a year after three years the current account 
is the countrys broadest measure of foreign trade and includes the 
exchange of goods and services as well as certain financial 
transactions it ran a deficit of 1059 billion in 1989 
the marks increased value in terms of other major currencies 
particularly the dollar also will affect germanys trading 
partners a stronger mark will lower the bill for the foreign goods 
that will be imported into germany to satisfy the bigger consumer 
appetite 
the dismantling of barriers to trade and investment and the 
enhanced efficiency of the east german economy will spur an 
economic boom as the integration proceeds domestic west german 
savings though are expected to be sufficient to support most of 
this investment surge 
changes elsewhere in eastern europe might have greater potential 
to influence economic variables in the united states 
the study says the ongoing liberalization of eastern europe 
can be expected to have additional consequences for the united 
states and other countries 
but it added while the potential demands for investment are 
much larger in the other eastern european countries as a group the 
reduction in barriers and improvement in efficiency will proceed 
more slowly in those countries than the pace assumed for east 
germany in this paper thus the immediate and mediumterm impact 
of liberalization in eastern europe remains uncertain 
the study the global economic implications of german 
unification is part of the feds international finance 
discussion series it represents the opinions of the authors only 
and is not an official fed view
