giant hurricane gabrielle its tail winds swamping 
homes and businesses as far south as barbados may have reached peak 
force as its swirling clouds spread further over the atlantic 
forecasters said late tuesday 
experts however said it was too early to draw conclusions from 
us air force reconnaissance plane readings of rising barometric 
pressure and a slightly expanding eye in the hurricane which 
brushed by the us caribbean islands before turning its 135 mph 
winds northward 
hurricane forecasters said gabrielle appeared to be heading 
toward the british island of bermuda in the atlantic but was still 
at least three days away and on an uncertain course that seemed to 
be moving from a northwesterly course to northward 
the biggest threat now is for bermuda anybody on the east 
coast should watch this storm said bob sheets director of the 
national hurricane center in suburban coral gables 
gabrielle already this seasons biggest hurricane was upgraded 
tuesday evening to a category 4 hurricane with 5 the strongest 
forecasters said it rivaled last years recordsetting hurricane 
gilbert at the same stage but was on a path more like 1985s 
powerful hurricane gloria which did 900 million in damage as it 
raced up the east coast and into new england 
sheets said gabrielle was unlikely to come near south florida 
gabrielle with storm winds in a 500milelong band caused storm 
swells as far as 1000 miles from its center forecasters said 
sheets compared gabrielle to gilbert of 1988 saying gabrielles 
size was similar to gilbert which became the storm of the 
century and devastated the island of jamaica both were the 
seventh named storms of their atlantic season as was gloria 
while gilbert stayed on a westerly course across the upper 
caribbean and made landfall in mexico gabrielle was moving out of 
the caribbean and headed up into the atlantic 
as of 1030 pm edt gabrielle was centered near 226 north 
latitude and 585 west longitude about 775 miles southsoutheast of 
bermuda it was moving northwest at 12 mph 
the governments of the leeward islands countries urged small 
craft to stay in port and issued heavy surf warnings as gabrielle 
pushed 74 mph hurricaneforce winds as far as 100 miles away from 
its center 
henry laskosky a national weather service forecaster in san 
juan predicted rough seas for the island 
it should not bother us at all except for seas theyll be a 
little rough tonight and wednesday laskosky said 
in barbados the easternmost caribbean island 550 miles southeast 
of puerto rico gabrielles tail caused 10foot waves and rough seas 
on the islands east coast monday some beachfront homes and 
businesses in the capital of bridgetown were flooded tuesday 
no injuries or serious damages were reported 
the weather in barbados and leeward islands on tuesday was sunny 
and clear 
forecaster john toohey said the hurricane would have no effect on 
the virgin islands 
gloria the last major hurricane on the us east coast in sept 
16oct 1 1985 started on a track similar to gabrielle the 
hurricane which moved up the atlantic at an unusually fast 30 to 50 
mph panicked thousands of coastal residents but turned out not to 
be the massive killer hurricane predicted it was a category 3 storm 
when it hit the coast but had earlier had winds of 150 mph 
people were very fortunate with gloria hurricane center 
spokesman martin nelson said the tides were in our favor and it 
stayed offshore we can take all the chastising about crying wolf 
but were not going to downplay this one because of gloria 
meanwhile far to the north hurricane felix was back to 85 mph 
winds after falling to 39 mph over the weekend 
little additional strengthening was expected for felix which was 
no threat to land at 1030 pm edt its center was located near 
365 north latitude and 485 west longitude or about 950 miles west 
of the westernmost azores and it was barely moving

two gunmen killed an army colonels wife 
outside a supermarket tuesday and washington delivered five 
helicopters to help the government break the drug lords violent 
grip on the country 
president bush outlining a 79 billion war on narcotics warned 
latin american drug traffickers tuesday night that the rules have 
changed 
the speech was broadcast live on colombian television within a 
halfhour two bombs exploded at banks in the cocaine center of 
medellin injuring seven people the radio network caracol reported 
a police source said the governments 2weekold crackdown on 
traffickers has virtually paralyzed the nations cocaineproducing 
laboratories 
bush proposed a fourfold increase in the amount of military and 
law enforcement aid for colombia bolivia and peru to 2612 
million in 1990 he called it the downpayment on a 2 billion 
fiveyear antidrug program in the andean region 
bush also said he and colombian president virgilio barco hoped to 
convene a drug summit to coordinate an interamerican strategy 
against the cartels 
he singled out barco for praise for his war on drug barons we 
have a responsibility not to leave our brave friends in colombia to 
fight alone said bush who had already pledged 65 million in aid 
in bogota the international editor of the newspaper el 
espectador camilo cano said bush has a clear intention of 
fighting drug traffickers 
the most interesting thing would be to know what is going to be 
the specific destination of the 2 billion he promised cano said 
after the speech canos newspaper office was damaged saturday by a 
bomb that wounded more than 80 people 
also tuesday the mayor of bogota banned outdoor marches and 
demonstrations for an indefinite period as a precautionary measure 
in response to terrorist attacks by drug traffickers colombian 
radio reported 
the private national radio network rcn said bogota mayor andres 
pastrana arango ordered the ban to maintain normal public order 
in medellin where a nighttime curfew has been in effect since 
last week an armed gang forced everyone out of a restaurant then 
set it afire with gasoline police said it was not immediately 
clear if the attack was related to the cocaine barons fighting the 
government crackdown 
the wave of attacks in medellin continued tuesday evening with 
the bank bombings a police spokesman said by telephone he said he 
had no details caracol said two girls 7 and 11 were among seven 
people suffering cuts from flying glass and other minor injuries 
police patrolled the streets of medellin 150 miles northwest of 
bogota which was the site of four bomb attacks monday night 
police gave no motive for the slaying of angela de guerrero 32 
she was shot four times as she sat in her small sedan outside a 
supermarket in bogotas northern suburbs by two gunmen who fled in a 
white car 
television footage showed a carton of eggs beside the slain woman 
and hysterical shoppers near the scene 
the victim was identified as the wife of col carlos guerrero a 
logistics planning officer for the joint military forces 
police have blamed previous instances of random violence on drug 
traffickers retaliating for the government crackdown 
the united states delivered five uh1h huey transport 
helicopters modified versions of the combat choppers that gained 
prominence during the vietnam war 
they arrived in a huge c5 transport plane at bogotas el dorado 
airport the last of the bigticket items in president bushs 65 
million package to help the government fight its drug war 
in recent days the united states has sent colombia five c130 
transport planes and eight a37 reconnaissance and attack jets the 
aid also includes machine guns bulletproof vests grenades boats 
and trucks 
drug lords have waged a campaign of bombings assassinations and 
threats largely to intimidate the government into refusing to 
extradite drug traffickers wanted in the united states colombias 
powerful cartels are believed to supply the united states with 80 
percent of its cocaine 
the drug war began in earnest aug 18 when an assassination 
squad believed hired by drug czars killed leading presidential 
candidate luis carlos galan 
shortly after the helicopters were unloaded an apparent bomb 
threat caused airport security agents to remove passengers and 
luggage from a jet of colombias avianca airlines about to take off 
for miami soldiers cleared the airport and brought in bombsniffing 
dogs 
a suspicious suitcase shown on tv newscasts turned out to be 
full of rocks 
the national police said tuesday that since the crackdown began 
cocaine production in colombia has practically stopped and that 
prices should go up as a result colombian authorities say they have 
destroyed 252 cocaine labs this year 
the bogota newspaper el tiempo citing unidentified police 
sources on tuesday forecast a cocaine shortage in the united 
states it also said 22 pounds of cocaine which now costs 1500 
in colombia and 10000 wholesale in miami will go up in price 
considerably in coming months 
meanwhile eduardo martinez romero indicted by a federal court 
in atlanta on trafficking charges was believed to be facing the 
last day wednesday on which he could appeal his extradition to the 
united states 
martinez 35 an economist was arrested aug 20 and is accused 
in connection with the laundering of 12 billion in cocaine money 
the government acting under emergency antidrug measures ordered 
his extradition aug 30 
until now colombia has been unable or unwilling to extradite 
drug traffickers fear pervades the colombian legal system since 
1980 more than 200 judges and court officials trying to prosecute 
drug dealers here have been assassinated

once they bought out a new york real estate 
company once they pretended to be developers in virginia as the 
folks at the nature conservancy have shown time and again theres 
more than one way to preserve wild lands this is the last part of a 
series american wilderness 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
while environmental groups have 
battled government and development interests during the 25 years of 
the wilderness act a littleknown private group has quietly put 
aside nearly 4 million acres of ecologically important lands 
in its 38 years the nature conservancy has saved threatened 
lands ranging from 343 square miles of rare new mexican desert 
grassland to a heron feeding ground on ninetenths of an acre of 
connecticut marsh 
and with a wellendowed war chest and a proven track record the 
arlington vabased nonprofit group now saves land at an average 
of a thousand acres a day 
the conservancys success is due in part to an organizational 
credo it will not fight developers in court nor seek a public forum 
to save private land it remains neutral in skirmishes involving 
government environmentalists and business interests using a 
checkbook and persuasion rather than lawyers and protests 
we used to describe ourselves as the real estate arm of the 
conservation movement said bill weeks the conservancys chief 
operating officer that role has been changing but we still will 
look to marketbased solutions rather than regulatory solutions 
the conservancys proven techniques and changing role are evident 
here in the carrizo plain 180000 acres of beautifully empty 
grasslands 150 miles north of los angeles 
home to endangered species like the kit fox and bluntnosed 
lizard the carrizo was purchased after the conservancy put together 
such unlikely partners as state and federal agencies the oil 
industry ranching interests and conservation groups 
the conservancy is involved in a new ambitious project to 
reintroduce native grasses elk and antelope lost to farming and 
cattle grazing 
grazing ended this april and the native grass is already coming 
up preserve manager chuck warner said standing in an emerald 
green island of native rye grass surrounded by the dusty brown 
lunar landscape 
nearly half the land acquired by the nature conservancy comes 
through standard real estate deals while much including the 
carrizo is turned over to state or federal stewardship the 
conservancy owns and manages the worlds largest private nature 
preserve system with nearly 1000 preserves 
other land targeted by the conservancy is protected through 
conservation easements and other agreements with landowners around 
the country 
they have done a superb job over the years said charles 
miller a national wildlife federation spokesman there is 
sometimes a lot of controversy within the conservation community 
over which way to proceed in an issue but the nature conservancy 
just goes in its own direction and does something that is a 
fantastic service 
the organization began in 1946 when a special committee of the 
ecological society of america split off to form the ecologists 
union renamed the nature conservancy in 1951 
in the early days the groups main goal was to take undisturbed 
lands out of circulation its first purchases were financed by 
mortgages on the homes of members 
since then the group has parlayed donations grants and business 
acumen into an 85 million fund and a national organization with 
540000 members staffed by more than 1000 partand fulltime 
organizers and naturalists 
the conservancy finds land to protect through its natural 
heritage program a joint venture with state governments to 
inventory and save the habitats of endangered plants and animals 
we look for habitats or ecosystems that are particularly 
threatened said steve mccormick director of the california 
nature conservancy if you wait until a species is on the 
endangered list that usually means its habitat is gone 
deals can be complicated to save a long island osprey nesting 
ground the new york chapter had to purchase an entire real estate 
company complete with manhattan brownstones and florida warehouses 
when the owner of a virginia barrier island wanted his land 
developed instead of conserved the conservancy purchased it through 
a dummy development company 
it created some publicrelations problems with the people here 
because they felt we were sneaky said barry truitt manager of 
the conservancys virginia coast preserve we didnt use any 
tactics that arent used by developers but i guess because were 
conservationists they expect our standards to be higher 
some land is donated bob butler a kennebunk maine furniture 
store owner gave the conservancy a 12acre parcel along the 
kennebuck river 
i didnt want it ever to be developed but then someone offered 
me a deal i could barely refuse he said i gave it up so i 
wouldnt be tempted again 
butler was so impressed with the conservancy that he went on to 
serve as a chairman its maine board of trustees 
the conservancy offers other deals it will take land in exchange 
for low interest loans other properties and lifetime annuities it 
will pay for conservation easements to keep land out of development 
it also sponsors a landowner notification program to tell people 
how to protect endangered species on their property 
landowners usually are surprised and delighted that they have 
something rare on their land and they become advocates said 
mccormick 
the conservancys nonconfrontational stance has put it 
increasingly in the role of mediator as when local officials and 
developers battled conservationists and government agencies over the 
habitat of the coachella fringetoed lizard a tiny reptile that 
only survives in the special sands of the coachella valley in the 
hot real estate market around palm springs 
after months of negotiations and 2 million in conservancy seed 
money the parties agreed to a 13000acre preserve developers will 
pay a 600 mitigation fee for each acre of lizard habitat that is 
developed outside the preserve 
paul selzer a attorney for some developers said the conservancy 
was able to show that setting the land aside served everyones 
interest 
another environmental group in the process could have made it 
more difficult he said 
mccormick said the bitter controversy was eased when developers 
saw their holdings would be enhanced by the preserve 
attitudes change he said the developers thought of 
environmentalists as people with a weird interest in a strange 
animal now they see it as a question of quality of life 
in addition to the role as mediator the conservancy has become 
more involved in restoration at its blowing rocks preserve on 
floridas jupiter island exotics nonnative trees like the 
australian pine and brazilian pepper have been cut to halt their 
encroachment on indigenous species and the fragile dune ecology 
its become clearer that not only species but whole biological 
systems are threatened weeks said 
the conservancy is taking greater steps to protect those systems 
through agreements that limit the use of adjacent lands at the 
virginia coast preserve the conservancy has negotiated with 
neighboring landowners to control development pressures on the 
fringes of the preserve 
we once thought we were going to be establishing nature 
preserves that would exist apart from society said weeks now 
weve come to feel the integration of these nature preserves with 
the fabric of the society around them is critical

an independent counsel decided not to prosecute 
one of president bushs aides who was investigated for a 5000 
loan from a baltimore brokerage company that required no repayment 
according to a report published wednesday 
former us attorney dan k webb of chicago who served as the 
independent counsel in the case determined there was no evidence to 
support prosecuting james w cicconi under the ethics in government 
act the washington post reported 
cicconi is in charge of the white house appointment office 
cicconi reached at home tuesday night said he had no comment on 
the report 
cicconi received the loan in 1984 from first american mortgage 
co to cover moving expenses to austin texas where he planned to 
enter private law practice after leaving the reagan white house 
michael clott chairman of first american told invstigators that 
the loan was to be a sham loan and probably would not be repaid 
clott is serving a 12 year prison term for fraud and racketeering 
cicconi repaid the loan with interest according to unnamed 
sources cited by the post

for sale 29000 home lots two 18hole 
golf courses a 1700seat auditorium a building supply store a 
121room hotel with restaurant and a weekly newspaper 
federal bank regulators are looking for a buyer for the 
development company that owns more than 10 percent of this onelight 
towns land and nearly all of the major recreation and public 
facilities 
land resources corp which came under federal control in may is 
among the more curious jetsam of the nations savings and loan 
crisis which has coughed up other odd thrift holdings from llamas 
to a desert bordello 
land resources was acquired in 1984 by security savings and loan 
of scottsdale ariz when the thrift was declared insolvent this 
year regulators seized its assets 
its strange for sure said william crocker appointed by the 
federal deposit insurance corp to oversee security savings which 
had about 1 billion in assets many sampls had real estate but to 
own part of a town is really unusual 
crocker said 60 to 80 information packets were being sent to 
potential bidders around the world and a deal should be completed 
before christmas he said only that the property is valued in the 
eight figures 
meanwhile residents of this 25yearold community are looking 
for assurances that life will continue as always amid the 
sprinklerfed lawns and bicycles leaning unlocked against evenly 
spaced palms on the edge of the everglades 
the one thing i keep repeating is dont worry nothing is 
going to change but as soon as they hear the federal government is 
involved they panic said carl strunk president of land resources 
corp 
although land resources has sold many of its former holdings 
including two shopping centers and a bowling alley it remains the 
largest employer of the towns 25000 residents 
strunk predicts land resources will be purchased by an 
development company interested in maintaining operations im 
convinced the whole of this company is worth more than the sum of 
its parts he said 
lehigh acres was ranch land before the postwar development boom 
land resources acquired the property in 1968 
original plans were for a retirement haven for northerners in 
one section targeted for retired telephone employees streets bear 
names such as switchboard and long lines 
other sections are typical smalltown america churches banks a 
small hospital two chinese restaurants and an industrial park 
strunk said lehigh acres has the potential for about 400000 
residents 
lehigh acres is growing by about 1000 residents annually and 
land resources brings families down for subsidized vacations to tour 
the community and timeshare units 
less than half the residents are retirees with the others mostly 
commuting to fort myers 12 miles away said strunk were just 
like any small town anywhere he said it just happens that a 
failed sampl owned part of it 
but word of the federal takeover is a tender subject 
in july strunk wrote a frontpage article in the companyowned 
lehigh times newspaper to allay concern about the sale strunk also 
has discouraged the nearly 500 land resources employees from 
discussing the sale with reporters 
this place is mr and mrs middle america its dayton ohio 
and detroit mich they are going to spend a lot of time worrying 
about this if people keep sounding alarmed said strunk i keep 
saying its not a big deal 
at the k mart lunch counter residents seemed more concerned with 
gossip than speculation on the fate of land resources 
this town will survive said joseph ferrante a retired new 
york police officer at worst maybe a new owner over there will 
be good it could be a change for the better

more than 6000 jews left the soviet union last 
month the highest monthly figure in at least a decade a 
resettlement agency says 
the 6008 arrivals at a vienna transit center were the biggest 
outflow since the intergovernmental committee on migration began 
keeping monthly figures in 1979 icm spokeswoman regina boucault 
said monday 
the latest exodus which was more than three times the august 
1988 rate brought the 1989 total to 30141 
only 127 of the jews traveling through vienna went on directly to 
israel in august boucault said most are going to the united states 
the committees latest monthly figures were lower than those 
announced friday in washington by the national conference on soviet 
jewry the us group said 6756 soviet jews emigrated last month 
and 793 went to israel 
boucault said the total figure apparently reflects the number of 
soviet jews arriving in the united states which could include 
migrants who were counted when they arrived in western europe in 
previous months 
those reported as settling in israel may include jews who went 
there via bucharest rather than vienna and are not monitored by the 
intergovernmental committee on migration she said 
some 300000 soviet jews have emigrated since the resettlement 
program began in 1971 the largest official exodus 51328 was 
recorded in 1979 before the soviet intervention in afghanistan 
chilled eastwest relations

world war ii hasnt quite ended for thousands of 
koreans who were brought by the japanese to work the coal mines of 
the pacific island of sakhalin more than 40 years ago 
refused exit by their new soviet overlords after the war the 
koreans have been forced to live in exile 
but their homecoming may finally be near with warming relations 
between the soviet union and capitalist south korea 
in the last month the soviets have begun talks with south korea 
through the red cross and other channels to solve the longfestering 
problem 
for many it could be too late of the 43000 koreans in sakhalin 
at the end of the war only 4000 to 5000 are thought to be alive 
om cholyoung is one of them 
conscripted by japan in 1943 to work as a coal miner while 
japans own workers were fighting the war om and his wife were 
taken to the japanesecontrolled southern half of sakhalin 
when the war ended om put his wife and infant son on a ship to 
korea thinking he soon would follow 
but in august 1945 the soviets extended their control to all of 
the north pacific island and om could not leave 
although korea also had been wrested from japanese colonial 
control it had been divided between the communist north and the 
south 
the soviets terminated contact between sakhalin and the south in 
effect extending the exile of om and others like him with families 
in the south 
exiles with families in north korea were apparently allowed to 
return but neither the soviet union nor north korea has confirmed 
it 
during his exile om later married another korean woman in 
sakhalin and had two children 
nevertheless he persisted in his goal of returning to his first 
wife and child in june he received permission to resettle in korea 
returning to korea was the only thing i asked from life om 
said in a recent interview in tokyo being in the soviet union was 
really hard its not that i didnt like it there but my wife and 
child were in korea 
now 74yearold om is back in south korea living with both his 
families in the southern port of pusan 
efforts to repatriate the koreans have long been thwarted by 
japanese indifference and tension between the soviet union and 
rigidly anticommunist south korea 
but the recent warming of relations between seoul and moscow 
reflecting eastwest detente and soviet recognition of south koreas 
growing economic power has given hope to sakhalin exiles 
before 1986 only a handful were allowed to meet with their 
families each year the number has increased dramatically 
this year 500 to 600 may ultimately be reunited with loved ones 
says kenichi takagi a tokyo lawyer and leader of a volunteer group 
that has sponsored most of the visits 
the reunions which previously were held in japan can now take 
place in korea moreover more than 10 koreans including om have 
received permission to move back to their homeland permanently 
under a sovietsouth korean agreement reached in the talks a 
chartered south korean plane may be allowed to take several hundred 
koreans from sakhalin before the end of the year sources from south 
koreas governing party said recently 
japan has also begun to take more interest in the fate of the 
exiles 
two years ago 170 members of the japanese parliament formed a 
nonpartisan group to promote a quick resolution of the issue at 
the groups urging the government this year set aside 405000 
toward repatriation efforts 
japanese leaders also have raised the issue in talks with the 
soviets 
takagi maintains japan should do more 
japan must take care of all the costs for the families to 
reunite it also must pay compensation for the 45 years that these 
people lost he said 
postwar germans have paid reparations to the jews and to 
israel they have conquered their past but japans debt to the 
korean people still remains repaying it is the responsibility of 
the japanese people

when drug traffickers are going to kill a 
colombian judge they send the target a copy of his own obituary a 
funeral wreath or a copy of what is known as the book of the 
dead 
the book with a prayer inside is sold in gift shops to 
relatives who have recently lost a loved one 
when a judge receives it or a wreath or an obituary it is 
considered a kiss of death two colombia jurists recently told the 
associated press 
this year we have been burying one judge every 15 days 
judge antonio suarez said he said 220 judges and court employes 
have been killed since 1980 
despite the threats suarez and judge helmut romero say they are 
going to stick with their jobs because they are proud of their 
professions 
we judges are fundamental pillars for constitutional law 
suarez said 
an estimated 1600 of colombias 4600 judges have received 
threats mostly from drug traffickers who have powerful influence in 
this country which supplies the united states with most of its 
cocaine 
we are frightened nobody can deny it but we have learned to 
live with it romero said 
like judges in other underdeveloped nations colombian jurists 
receive low pay and work in poor conditions the average salary is 
350 a month and many store court records in bathrooms and kitchens 
because there is not enough space elsewhere 
in august the nations judges went on strike but they were not 
seeking better pay or working conditions they wanted better 
protection 
the judges ended the strike when war broke out between government 
security forces and drug traffickers following the aug 18 
assassination of sen luis carlos galan a leading presidential 
candidate 
president virgilio barcos government said it would resume 
extraditing colombians to the united states the traffickers 
threatened to kill 10 judges for each colombian extradited 
the extraditions have not begun the supreme court is expected to 
rule this month on whether to allow them 
more than 500 estates and hundreds of cars planes and 33 yachts 
believed to belong to drug traffickers have been confiscated in the 
past two weeks 
suarez and romero believe the crackdown has created more dangers 
for judges since the judges must decide if properties remain 
confiscated and rule on the legality of the government measures 
the latest judge to fall victim to drug traffickers was carlos 
ernesto valencia he was investigating the slaying in 1987 of jaime 
pardo leal a member of a federal appeals court in bogota a former 
president of the colombian justice officials association and former 
presidential candidate for the leftist patriotic union party 
pardo leal apparently was murdered by a drug traffickers death 
squad 
because valencia was handling the case he was threatened 
frequently he moved often to elude his persecutors 
he was assassinated aug 17 at the onset of the bloody weekend 
that led to the current war with drug traffickers 
looking for help from the united states to protect colombian 
judges justice minister monica de greiff rushed to washington in 
late august her 19 million request would cover bulletproof vests 
guards and pistol training for the judges 
according to press reports her trip to washington was actually 
prompted by an anonymous phone caller who told her you will be 
next 
judges suarez and romero dont believe personal protection alone 
will solve the problem 
they said real solutions should come from radical changes in 
colombian society 
for judges they say living under threats means a disruption of 
family life 
judges are known to change their routine switching routes to the 
office shopping in different supermarkets and not leaving home or 
returning at the same time 
changing routes to the office isnt easy because most judges go 
to work on buses a salary of 350 a month is not enough to afford a 
car

the whoosh and boom of exploding 
rockets terrorizes kabul at all hours of the day and night creating 
a climate of fear not known before in the 11yearold afghan civil 
war 
periods of intense rocketing occurred in the past especially 
last fall but longtime observers say the barrage that began in june 
has been more deadly 
between june 25 and aug 26 united nations sources said 577 
rockets pounded kabul killing 366 people and injuring 999 nearly 
all were civilians struck at random in homes or offices at bus 
stops bazaars movie houses 
we are very very afraid that rockets will kill all the 
people said mohammad aqbar who gave up teaching to earn more 
money selling potatoes and onions in the bazaar when we hear the 
rockets we try to hide with our families but sometimes there is no 
place to go 
un sources say many kabul residents in recent weeks have 
migrated north where fewer rockets and cheaper and more plentiful 
food await them 
most of the rockets hitting kabul have been egyptian or 
chinesemade sakr20s or sakr30s with a range of about 12 or 20 
miles though usbacked guerrillas fighting to overthrow the 
sovietbacked government of president najib say they have sakrs 
with a range up to 38 miles 
in midaugust afghanistan accused the united states and pakistan 
of supplying the guerrillas with new more lethal longdistance 
rockets armed with clusterbomb warheads 
the rebels deny firing them pakistan calls the allegations 
unfounded and the united states refuses to comment 
the new rockets remain unidentified reporters were first taken 
to see two rockets bearing the numbers e320mii1344 and 
e320mii138 and no other markings except a tag saying in arabic 
and english before loading take out safety plug days later 
they were taken to see the contents of the warhead 98 bombs that 
stack into each other 
late last month foreign minister abdul wakil wrote un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar saying these longrange 
missiles scattered cluster bombs with delayed time fuses and 
antipersonnel mines which were aimed at mass murder and wreaking 
havoc and terror in the cities 
the first cluster rocket hit kabul aug 15 killing five 
civilians and wounding 23 in the former sovietoccupied mikrorayan 
housing complex near kabul airport now home to many government 
workers the government said a second struck a dozen children 
playing in the calaishada district aug 19 killing seven and 
wounding five 
they are shaped like lightbulb sockets said asmatullah an 
18yearold student who lives in the mikrorayan complex one small 
boy took one home and it exploded he lost his arm 
military experts say the government can defend this milehigh 
capital ringed by parched treeless hills that are a great strategic 
advantage experts say a conventional guerrilla assault would be 
suicidal given the governments powerful air and land defenses 
while insignificant in military terms the rocketing has been a 
major psychological weapon 
many kabul residents blame the rocketing on the guerrillas who 
call themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors and their 
american backers 
every time theres a rocket my cook watches and says thats 
america said one foreign relief worker speaking anonymously 
the american government shouldnt help the mujahedeen with 
these rockets our people dont want war said noor karga a 
cleaner at avecinna chest hospital he had just watched 22 victims 
of rocket attacks being brought in and eight die 
but more and more kabulis blame the government and their soviet 
suppliers as well 
please tell the russians and the americans dont help with 
such sort of weapons said mohammad hussein 32 who was 
hospitalized with shrapnel wounds from a rocket attack 
both sides buy rockets and we hate both of them the soviet 
union and the united states said sayed salahuddin an 18yearold 
student as he walked through the rubble of a neighbors house that 
took a direct hit 
before soviet troops withdrew on feb 15 soviet and afghan 
forces would retaliate immediately against rocket attacks on kabul 
with heavy artillery fire and helicopter gunships hitting suspected 
rocketlaunching positions now very little counteraction by the 
afghan air force is seen military observers said 
the government announced in midaugust it was extending the 
security belt around kabul from 30 kilometers 19 miles to between 
40 and 60 kilometers 25 and 38 miles to prevent longrange rockets 
from hitting the city 
abdul kabir of younis khalis fundamentalist hezbiislami 
guerrilla group told the associated press in pakistan that 
sovietsupplied government rockets not rebel ones were hitting 
civilian targets in kabul 
we know that the kabul government is firing from their own 
positions to kabul city for propaganda purposes to turn civilians 
against the guerrillas he said the enemy government is hitting 
the hospitals and bazaars and even the mosques after this they 
show it on tv and blame the mujahedeen 
the government strongly denied firing any rockets at kabul

when a new yorkbased magazine for apartment 
builders wrote in july 1988 of influencepeddling in the department 
of housing and urban development agency officials braced themselves 
for a scandal 
but the scandal didnt materialize until the following april when 
huds inspector general reported that developers and consultants 
were reaping millions of dollars and that there was a widespread 
perception of favoritism and abuse in the section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program 
the allegations of fraud and influencepeddling at hud are 
frontpage news now samuel pierce jr housing secretary during all 
eight years of president reagans term will be the lead witness 
when a house subcommittee resumes its hud hearings on sept 15 
a senate subcommittee also will resume hearings this fall but no 
date has been set meanwhile the congressional taxwriting 
committees are working on ways to tighten the lowincome housing tax 
credit that attracted many developers to hud projects 
the moderate rehabilitation program began in 1979 as a lever to 
induce landlords to make modest improvements to bring lowincome 
housing up to standards 
but hud inspector general paul adams april 26 report said there 
was little to indicate help was going to those who needed it most 
and that rents on hudfinanced rehabilitation projects were mostly 
at the maximum allowable 
among the reports about hud 
adams testified last month that at least 57 million was paid 
to 20 wellconnected consultants who helped their employers win big 
hud contracts on housing for the poor the consultants included 
former officials of the agency and politically influential 
republicans 
two hud audits said rent subsidies were improperly inflated by 
6 million for a housing project in tulsa okla owned by a 
partnership that includes four former hud officials there were 
similar reports elsewhere 
government records showed that hud issued a waiver of 
regulations that allowed developers represented by pierces former 
law firm to keep lucrative hud subsidies 
thomas t demery assistant secretary of housing in the reagan 
administration attended fundraisers at which developers seeking 
hud projects contributed to demerys pet charity food for africa 
the justice department said it found no evidence demery had 
criminally misused his office 
routing slips showed that deborah gore dean former executive 
secretary to pierce routinely authorized use of a signature machine 
to stamp projects with pierces approval 
there were danger signals along the way in the housing 
rehabilitation program but they went largely unnoticed 
in his semiannual report for the period ending sept 30 1985 
adams said audits by his office had confirmed serious problems 
in the program showing that rents for 78 percent of the units 
examined were excessive 
in january 1986 rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the 
house government operations subcommittee on housing alerted by 
reports of irregularities in buffalo asked adams to review the way 
hud distributed funds 
pressed on the question at a subcommittee hearing the next month 
adams replied in writing that he had found that headquarters 
officials of hud did not document their discretionary allocation 
decisions 
the democratcontrolled house banking committee held nine 
oversight hearings on hud programs during the first six years of the 
reagan administration while the republicancontrolled senate 
banking committee held four yet the hearings failed to uncover the 
scope of the problem 
multihousing news a new yorkbased magazine for apartment 
townhouse and condominium builders got wind of what was going on 
and published an eightpage article in july 1988 headed 
influencepeddling probed in sec 8 mod rehab it named many of 
the same names that have surfaced since adams april 26 report 
adams and robert e nipp director of press relations for hud 
braced themselves for a major news organization to pick up the 
story none did 
nobody felt there was a pulitzer prize lurking at hud said 
bill monroe editor of the washington journalism review 
against this background there is a series of stories from the 
boston heraldamerican which examined 175000 in presidential 
campaign contributions by massachusetts developers and found that 
all of the contributors had received approval from hud for section 8 
projects the newspaper also reported that rents in such projects 
were excessive and the needs of poor families were not being met 
the series appeared june 2225 1980 the president whose 
campaign received the contributions was jimmy carter

the government is cracking down on fraternal 
groups taverns convenience store owners and other small businesses 
that are behind one by 50 years on paying a federal tax on 
liquor retailers 
the tax was increased by 463 percent last year from 54 to 250 
for each establishment accompanying the increase was a vigorous 
enforcement effort by the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms 
the elks lodge 109 in wilkesbarre pa was stunned to get a 
bill 10 months ago for 977698 from atf representing unpaid taxes 
and penalties back to 1940 when the lodge got its liquor license 
the lodge which is celebrating its 100th anniversary said it 
had never heard of the tax 
our attitude quite frankly was that if you had notified us 
we would have been more than happy to pay said lodge attorney 
peter paul olszewski how could you possibly have a tax that goes 
back ad infinitum without a statute of limitations 
olszewski said the elks recently settled with atf for less than 
onetenth the amount of the original demand 
about 600000 beer wine and distilled spirits dealers that sell 
directly to the public must pay the special occupational tax 
the tax has been around for 123 years but the government admits 
that a lot of retailers have never heard of it responsibility for 
collections shifted to atf in 1986 from the internal revenue service 
sixty percent of the retailers have known about it and paid 
it said atf spokesman jack killorin 
killorin said it was uncertain how many deadbeats there are he 
said the government expects to collect between 25 million and 30 
million from the program this year in current and back taxes and 
penalties 
the difficulty arises in identifying and notifying those 
parties for whom retail liquor sales is an ancillary or secondary 
part of their operation a lodge or country club a bait or tackle 
shop operator killorin said 
since the crackdown began atf has been exchanging taxpayer 
information with the states with the idea of making retailers aware 
of their obligations before their liability mounts 
we knew that when it went to 250 we had to pull out all the 
stops because the accumulation was going to be dramatic killorin 
said 
we know by the calls were getting that the tax is upsetting 
people it is not our desire to move in and foreclose and put 
someone out of business but its very important that people get in 
touch with atf so they can work something out maybe a payment plan 
and get them up to speed he said 
rep paul kanjorski dpa said the crackdown was having a 
dramatic unfair impact 
across pennsylvania and indeed the nation fraternal lodges 
nonprofit organizations and small businesses are being blindsided 
with fines and bills for a tax they never knew existed kanjorski 
said 
he has been seeking colleagues support for a bill permitting atf 
to go only as far back as 1985 to collect the tax 
backing kanjorskis bill is the national licensed beverage 
association which represents up to 300000 bars and taverns and is 
focusing its lobbying efforts more on last years tax increase than 
on the enforcement crackdown 
association lobbyist john chwat said most members pay the tax 
but believe the increase was based on a false assumption in congress 
that tavern owners can afford it 
terry richman of the national association of convenience stores 
said she was uncertain how many of the groups members knew about 
the tax its certainly more than half but i dont know how much 
more she said 
the problem richman said is that atf is not really a revenue 
agent and they havent done a lot of outreach her group 
represents about 60000 stores

president bushs war on illegal drugs which he 
launches tonight with a speech to the nation will pit him against 
the powerful forces of history and nature both have caused his 
predecessors efforts to fizzle in failure 
but the presidents aides say that somehow this time will be 
different 
nevertheless psychopharmacologist ronald k siegel at the 
university of california at los angeles says wars against drugs are 
hopeless and misguided because the desire for mindaltering 
substances is healthy and natural and animals do it as well as 
people 
while animals in the wild seek out plants containing psychoactive 
chemicals and go to great lengths to continue getting them some 
animals in his laboratory studies including cats craved morphine 
siegel writes in a new book intoxication 
when cats were used as subjects it was often necessary for the 
handlers to use trickery and force to avoid being bitten or 
scratched during the initial injections siegel writes 
resistance vanished after a few injections and the cats would run 
to the experimenter jump on his lap and even lick his hand while 
waiting for the morphine 
however william j bennett the director of national drug 
control policy says real progress is already being made in the 
battle to get casual users of drugs to stop doing so as reflected 
by the 1988 national household survey on drug abuse 
the survey found a 37 percent decrease from a 1985 survey in the 
number of people who said they had used marijuana cocaine or other 
illicit drugs in the previous month the survey also indicated that 
the number of people who said they had used an illegal drug in the 
previous year fell by 25 percent over the three years 
people who have been saying all is lost we cant win lets 
legalize have never been more wrong said bennett who developed 
the national drug strategy for bush 
since the early years of this century the united states has 
struggled to control the distribution and use of mindaltering drugs 
cocaine and heroin were legal and widely available until 1914 
when they were outlawed by the harrison narcotic act just eight 
years before concern over widespread use of the substances had 
inspired the pure food and drug act that required patent medicines 
to list their ingredients said eric sterling president of the 
criminal justice policy foundation 
marijuana was outlawed in 1937 just four years after alcohol 
came back on the market with the end of prohibition 
hysteria over heroin broke out again in the 1950s and two 
versions of the boggs act passed in 1952 and 1954 called for 
severe prison sentences for drug traffickers 
in 1963 president john f kennedy convened a white house 
conference on drug abuse 
little more than a halfdecade later president richard nixon 
declared war on drugs launching an aggressive law enforcement 
attack on the widespread use of illegal drugs during the heady 
marijuana smokefilled days of antivietnam war protests when 
turnon tunein and dropout were the watchwords at least 
temporarily for a generation 
in the last two decades millions have been arrested on drug 
charges billions of dollars worth of illegal drugs have been 
seized rock n roll stars and honored athletes have died of 
overdoses and some inner cities whose problems used to be poverty 
unemployment discrimination and alcohol and heroin abuse have added 
raging and deadly drugrelated gunfights to the list 
billions have been spent on law enforcement less for treatment 
and prevention 
from fiscal year 1981 through 1989 the federal government spent 
165 billion for law enforcement 24 billion for drug abuse 
prevention and 24 billion for treatment for a total expenditure of 
213 billion according to the general accounting office the 
investigative branch of congress which used figures from the office 
of management and budget 
most of that was spent in fiscal years 1986 through 1989 which 
accounted for 136 billion 104 billion for law enforcement 
17 billion for prevention and 15 billion for treatment the gao 
found 
meanwhile cocaine is pouring over the nations borders domestic 
growers produce 25 percent of the nations marijuana supply and the 
heroin problem is growing the price of the three drugs is going 
down and the purity is going up

a smaller cotton crop this year is boosting 
prices and signaling a reduction in us inventories according to 
agriculture department analysts 
the departments monthly report last week on farm prices in 
august showed upland cotton at an average of 643 cents per pound 
up from 606 cents in july and 539 cents in august 1988 
a report by the departments economic research service said us 
cotton production based on aug 1 indications is forecast at 118 
million bales down from 154 million last year 
the cotton acreage planted for 1989 harvest dropped 16 percent to 
105 million acres reflecting a larger acreage reduction required 
under usdas price support program 
average cotton yields are forecast at 595 pounds per acre on the 
average down 4 percent from last year yields in the delta and 
southwest are expected to be down 14 percent and 19 percent 
respectively because of bad weather 
the total 198990 cotton supply is forecast at 19 million bales 
for the marketing year that began aug 1 
allowing for domestic use and exports the us cotton inventory 
by aug 1 1990 could be pulled down to around 39 million bales 
from an aug 1 carryover this year of 75 million bales the report 
said 
although us cotton textile imports are expected to reach 
nearrecord levels and manmade fiber prices have become more 
competitive with cotton domestic mills will likely use 77 million 
bales during 198990 the report said lower textile inventories 
and larger denim production should keep domestic mill consumption 
strong this season 
domestic cotton use may rise to and average of 23 pounds per 
capita up two pounds from last year the report said

mayor marion barry says hell fight new 
allegations that he used drugs with a convicted drug dealer and he 
wants prosecutors to release his grand jury testimony on the case 
barry said monday he will ask us attorney jay stephens to 
release the record of more than five hours of questions barry 
answered about his relationship with charles lewis a former city 
employee facing drug charges in the nations capital lewis has been 
convicted on cocaine charges in the virgin islands 
im prepared to ask the prosecutor to release my testimony 
before the grand jury and mr lewis testimony so therefore the 
public can see what was said barry said at a city hall news 
conference a small group of character assassins have taken it 
upon themselves to take the law into their own hands to do in 
the press what they cant do in court 
barrys move followed news reports that lewis told prosecutors 
that he and barry repeatedly used crack cocaine in washington last 
december and in the virgin islands in early 1988 
stephens who has said he will investigate the news leaks was 
not immediately available to comment monday on whether the mayors 
testimony would be released 
we have nothing to hide regarding the testimony of the mayor or 
mr lewis said barrys attorney r kenneth mundy 
the investigation of lewis continues and mundy said release of 
barrys testimony could be difficult to arrange because barry might 
be called as a witness for the prosecution or defense 
the federal investigation began in january after city police 
inexplicably called off an attempt to make an undercover drug buy 
from lewis when they discovered that barry was in lewis hotel room 
barry has acknowledged making at least six visits to lewis room 
but has said he did not see use or purchase drugs from him 
barry has testified twice before a grand jury on his visits with 
lewis 
the mayor made his remarks with a cadre of supporters at his 
side including his wife effi several cabinet members and the two 
cochairman of his 1990 reelection bid 
nothing in the recent spate of rumors and innuendoes has caused 
the mayors campaign committee to doubt the mayors statements on 
these issues or to alter our dedication said robert johnson one 
of barrys campaign directors we deplore the use of rumors and 
leaks in an attempt to distort the political process in this 
community 
barry also denied a wusatv report that he has been encouraged by 
top aides to step aside because of the recent allegations 
thats a nonissue barry said its not true 
the mayor also lashed out at unethical members of the media 
and suggested that prosecutors are responsible for the news leaks 
however the mayor and johnson both acknowledged they had no proof 
that law enforcement officials are responsible for the leaks

a priest feuding with roman catholic church 
authorities over his formation of an africanamerican congregation 
says a report of a homosexual affair between him and an altar boy is 
an attack on his ministry 
meanwhile cardinal james a hickey the archbishop of 
washington said monday he was sorry to read the allegations 
published in the washington post about the rev george a stallings 
jr 
if it is true then i feel great sorrow and sympathy for 
everyone involved hickey said as he left a city church hickey 
would not answer questions 
stallings denounced the report 
i will not dignify with a response the scurrilous and baseless 
charge reported in todays washington post stallings said i 
believe that this charge and accusation is a concerted effort to 
divert attention from my mission to drive racial insensitivity 
and racism out of the catholic church 
a 28yearold man whom the post agreed not to identify told the 
paper he had oral sex two or three times a week with stallings in a 
washington church rectory for several months in 1977 
the man who was then 16 years old said he never reported the 
relationship to church authorities 
in july stallings 41 formed the imani temple an independent 
africanamerican catholic congregation in defiance of the roman 
catholic hierarchy 
hickey suspended stallings in july after the priest formed the 
separate africanamerican congregation 
diocesan officials did say that parishioners and other catholics 
had become concerned over stallings conduct the newspaper said 
stallings had purchased a turnofthecentury home which he named 
augustus manor and had a number of young boys in his presence the 
paper said 
hickey confronted stallings about alleged homosexual behavior 
three months ago the paper said 
william marshall spokesman for stallings issued a statement 
saying again the news media has launched a negative assault on a 
black leader 
the release said the 12yearold rumors from an unnamed 
source were foolishness 
the man told the post his involvement with the priest was a 
deciding factor in his becoming a homosexual the newspaper said 
the man also signed a sworn statement saying that his story was true 
the man was quoted by the newspaper as saying he became uneasy 
with the relationship and broke it off

five japanese tried to sell 88 pounds of uranium to 
the american embassy in tokyo and have been arrested for illegal 
possesion of nuclear substances police announced today 
the tokyo metropolitan police department said the group brought a 
capsule containing about 35 ounces of uranium to the us embassy 
in tokyo in early august and offered another 88 pounds of the same 
substance for 83 million 
they identified the ringleader as a 43yearold woman toshiko 
nishijima they provided no further details about her 
uranium is a radioactive chemical element used for nuclear power 
generation and nuclear bombs 
the embassy immediately notified the japanese police and handed 
over the substance which was sent to the science and technology 
agency for analysis it concluded the capsule contained refined 
natural uranium of 707 percent purity 
the agency said only 071 percent of the uranium was uranium235 
the element used for power generation and for bombs while 99 
percent of the substance was uranium238 
at this point we have not obtained the remaining uranium and 
we cant say how large the entire scheme is said takaharu 
ushikoshi head of police departments public security section 
but we believe the substance was brought in from abroad and there 
must be collaborators who helped to smuggle it into japan 
ushikoshi also said police do not believe the group is related to 
terrorists or politically motivated it looks like the groups 
intent was purely money he said 
he said police arrested the five last week and have been 
interrogating them to determine where the 88 pounds of remaining 
uranium is kept where the substance came from and whether there are 
other collaborators 
one of them has stated that they bought 4 kilograms 88 
pounds of uranium from an unidentified person for 5 billion yen 
35 million and someone is keeping it at a cost of 3 million yen 
20690 a day said ushikoshi we believe the remaining 
uranium is kept somewhere in japan 
he also said the group offered the uranium to the american 
embassy because they probably thought ordinary people or companies 
wouldnt buy such an outrageous thing 
the american embassy declined to comment saying the case was not 
a diplomatic matter but rather a police matter police declined to 
give details of who was contacted at the embassy and how 
police said the uranium was very dangerous to the public 
nuclear experts said 88 pounds of uranium could make a powerful 
atomic bomb 
whether it can make a atomic bomb or not depends on the purity 
of uranium but what matters is there are people who can obtain 4 
kilograms of 70 percent pure uraninum which undoubtedly can create 
a very powerful explosive said kazuhisa ogawa an prominent 
defense analyst and expert on military technology 
it is very unlikely that the uranium was obtained from japanese 
nuclear facilities because the security system of japans nuclear 
facilities are extremely tight he added but there are many 
ways to smuggle in small amount of uranium from other countries 
where the management of nuclear substance is much looser 
officials of the science and techonology agency said the uranium 
brought by the group was not harmful to human body unless it is 
directly touched or swallowed 
the five could face up to a year in prison or a fine of maximum 
of 3500

deb morse was angry with the us supreme 
courts recent abortion ruling and decided to join her local chapter 
of the national organization for women 
but she found that her community la crosse no longer had one 
that didnt stop her though as she set out to revive the citys 
now chapter 
ms morse said she would have considered the groups first 
meeting a success if 10 people attended 
instead nearly 100 men and women showed up last week to express 
displeasure at the high courts decision to uphold key restrictions 
in a missouri abortion law they also started to devise a plan of 
action 
were really going to have to do something quickly and 
concrete ms morse said we want to let the legislators 
know how we feel and how strong that feeling is 
the now revival is not unique to the western wisconsin city of 
about 50000 on the banks of the mississippi river 
kim gandy nows national secretarytreasurer said the 
organization has grown steadily since its inception in 1966 but 
membership has sharply increased with many younger members since the 
courts july 3 decision the group has about 200000 members around 
the country 
the ruling effectively returned regulation of abortions to state 
legislatures the court also agreed to hear three other abortion 
cases this fall 
the renewed debate also has brought new members to antiabortion 
forces 
marilyn fitterman president of new yorks now chapters said 
membership in her state has increased from to 24000 from 17500 
last year mostly because of concerns about the courts changing 
stance on abortion 
ms fitterman said three new chapters in western new york have 
started since july 
i think the supreme court has garnered the movement themselves 
with their decision because people are quite upset with it she 
said when i listen to my messages i get at least two or three 
people a day who want to join and volunteer their time and 
contribute money and another two who just want to join 
jennifer jackman now president for massachusetts said there are 
about 9000 state members but the boston chapter alone has received 
about 2000 inquiries since july and five new chapters are starting 
elsewhere in the state including two at high schools in lexington 
and cambridge she said 
without question this issue has really galvanized younger 
women ms jackman said more and more young women are getting 
involved they realize that this is a right that should be national 
its that important 
madeline para now coordinator for wisconsin said after the 1973 
roe vs wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide advocates 
of womens rights felt the abortion issue was settled many local 
now chapters disbanded 
but this years missouri abortion law ruling revived the battle 
she said 
now were fighting for what wed already won and its not as 
much fun as fighting for new things she said 
on the other side of the issue the wisconsin right to life has 
enlisted 4100 households in the state since july bringing 
membership to 33000 according to spokeswoman lori clark 
nancy myers media relations director at right to lifes national 
office in washington dc didnt know the groups membership 
around the country but said many have joined since july 
for instance she said kansas chapters increased to 14 from 12 
and virginias chapters have started several small weekend meetings 
to accomodate new members 
now meanwhile is planning a second national rally in 
washington dc the first was in april the next one is planned for 
nov 12 at the lincoln memorial 
the rally isnt going to be a silent scream said ms 
fitterman in a reference to the antiabortion movements trademark 
video of the same name were going to fight on the state and 
national levels to win

a riverside community that would be flooded 
for a denver reservoir if plans go ahead for a 615foothigh dam 
reacted with disbelief when an environmental protection agency 
review blasted the project 
i kind of halfway sat there stunned said fannie roth 70 
who has been battling the two forks project for 17 years 
i was hoping it was true it numbed me that it really really 
was not going to be built roth said in an interview in the home 
she built among the pines above the south fork of the south platte 
river 
if two forks were built her home would be under approximately 
300 feet of water if they ever had the water to fill it roth 
said 
lee dehihns an epa deputy regional administrator from atlanta 
who was assigned to review the project announced aug 29 that the 
agency would press on with a veto process begun last march by epa 
administrator william reilly a twomonth public hearing period is 
the next step followed by a final decision by epa administrators in 
washington dc 
dehihns said his fivemonth review concluded that the denver 
metropolitan areas future water needs did not warrant the 
environmental toll of the proposed 500 million to 1 billion 
project 
the dam would be located 25 miles southwest of denver near the 
confluence of the south platte river and its north fork besides 
flooding deckers the project would inundate scenic canyon lands and 
30 miles of stream known for prized trout and it would damage 
wildlife habitat in nebraska the epa said 
deckers a community of 180 people lies 50 miles southwest of 
denver over winding country roads visitors who brave a 10mile 
stretch of narrow teethchattering washboard road with secondgear 
hairpin turns steep grades and washouts are mostly attracted by the 
south forks legendary trout fishing 
after the denver water board and 42 metropolitanarea water 
providers proposed the dam many homeowners panicked and sold their 
property to the board diminishing the communitys tax resources for 
road maintenance and law enforcement also residents found their 
telephone service was not updated over the years because it was 
assumed the entire exchange would be flooded 
the people that are still landowners here you can rest 
assured didnt want the dam i worked a lifetime for what i own 
here i want to continue living here until i die said roth who 
moved to deckers in 1953 after retiring as a denver public schools 
bus driver and stays busy with carpentry bowling and pitching 
horseshoes 
she and her neighbors say they will attempt to obtain protection 
for the south platte under the wild and scenic rivers act with the 
help of the washingtonbased american rivers organization 
im glad the epa said no said shirley childs a clerk at the 
deckers general store and a 25year resident of the area ill 
pray to god they continue saying no 
the veto decision came as a relief to al barnes who has been 
visiting or living in the area for 35 years 
his wife mary said the epa is finally going to look at things 
like this and protect some of this country 
we are elated the epa stuck to its guns mrs barnes said 
number one this is our home the thing i went through several 
wars for and the dream of a home in the mountains so my great 
grandchildren can come up here and enjoy the clean air and the water 
and the wildlife 
the barnes home looking across the south fork at long scraggy 
peak was a threeroom cabin that they added a second floor to when 
he retired from the air force missile development program six years 
ago 
despite the long battle with the denver water board to stop two 
forks roth and the barnes said the conflict has been amicable in 
recent years 
the big stick time was in the 60s when it was were the 
denver water board and by god barnes recalled 
but the new water board has been in the 80s since mayor 
federico pena came to office since then the whole context of the 
water board has mellowed down said mrs barnes

despite picking up the planes 
emergency signal rescuers were still trying to locate a varig 
jetliner that disappeared over the amazon jungle with 54 people 
aboard an air force spokesman said 
the boeing 737200 was far off course low on fuel and flying on 
one engine with faulty navigational equipment when it vanshed sunday 
while on a domestic flight air force spokesman col ronaldo borges 
said monday 
it was on the last leg of a regularly scheduled flight from the 
southeastern city of sao paulo to belem 
the planes beacon emits an emergency signal that is being 
picked up but it takes time to pinpoint the exact spot where the 
signal is coming from and we have not located the plane yet 
borges said 
he said the search for the plane was suspended monday night 
because of darkness but air force planes private planes and 
helicopters would resume their work early this morning 
the colonel said officials did not rule out the possibility the 
plane was hijacked 
varig airline officials denied various brazilian press accounts 
that said the plane had landed safely with all aboard alive 
joao luis de souza a company spokesman in rio said the reports 
were completely false 
a varig official in belem who asked not to be identified also 
denied the reports 
weve checked two rumors one that the plane landed in amazonas 
state and another that it landed on an indian reservation in 
southern para state but nothing has been confirmed he said 
varig provided a list of 48 passengers and 6 crew members all 
brazilian who were on the plane when it disappeared 
borges said the planes pilot took off from the city of maraba at 
525 pm to make a 40minute flight to belem capital of para 
state 2140 miles northwest of rio at the mouth of the amazon 
river borges said the pilot noted in his flight plan that he had 
fuel for about three hours 
but borges said the planes pilot strayed far from his route and 
radioed the airport at carajas 600 miles from belem at 830 local 
time asking for runway lights to be lit so he could land 
ten minutes later a cruzeiro airline plane received the pilots 
last communication saying he was flying at 8000 feet with only one 
engine working and would try to make an emergency landing in the 
jungle guided by a forest fire borges said 
borges said the planes pilot had been in contact with other 
planes and airports after leaving maraba but never said anything 
about being lost though he had complained of problems with his 
navigational equipment 
based on information provided by other planes in the air at the 
time of the flight and by satellites that monitor brazilian 
airspace officials believe the boeing may have gone down near the 
xingu indian reservation in the southern part of para state borges 
said 
but he said the plane could have covered over 1200 miles during 
its flight of over three hours which made locating the plane 
extremely difficult 
the plane took off early sunday morning from sao paulo brazils 
largest city with 10 million residents and made regular stops in 
uberaba uberlandia goiania brasilia imperatriz and maraba 
the possibilty of a plane having been hijacked could not be 
discarded borges said

despite repeated interventions by the central bank 
the us dollar rose to a 2month high against the japanese yen 
today while stock prices on the tokyo stock exchange declined 
slightly 
the dollar closed at 14665 yen up 052 yen from mondays close 
the currency opened at 14585 yen and moved in a range between 
14580 yen and 14665 yen 
it was the highest close since june 15 when the us unit 
finished at 15030 yen 
currency dealers said the bank of japan continued to intervene at 
levels above 146 yen as finance minister ryutaro hashimoto indicated 
in a tuesday morning press conference that the central bank would 
continue to invervene in the currency market 
the central bank does not confirm or deny its intervention 
activities 
we have no intention of approving a situation that includes 
violent exchange rate swings hashimoto said in a press conference 
following a regular cabinet meeting 
the dollars recent rise which makes japanese products easier to 
sell in the united states raises fears that improvements in japans 
trade surplus may be slowed 
the general sentiment of the market is still toward the bullish 
dollar but the anxiety about the central banks intervention is 
keeping the currency from moving up as high as it wants to go 
said a dealer at daiichi kangyo bank speaking anonymously 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which gained 13556 points monday fell 4183 points or 
012 percent to finish at 3444195 
the main barometer of the market started the day in a bullish 
mood as exchange rates showed signs of stability it declined 
moderately in afternoon trading as the japanese yen lost ground 
against the us dollar 
securities dealer said the relative stability in the currency 
market encouraged the investors to buy new stocks in the morning 
the market participants seem to share the feeling it is about 
time that the market turn bullish said a dealer at nikko 
securities co but trading was still relatively light tuesday 
but dealers said a september rally cannot be expected until 
exchange rates settle down

western hostages in lebanon could be 
released if the united states shows its good will by freeing 
billions of dollars in iranian assets a senior iranian official 
says 
the call was echoed in an interview published today of a shiite 
moslem cleric in lebanon who is believed to be a spiritual leader of 
the kidnappers 
iranian media on monday quoted ali mohammed besharati irans 
deputy foreign minister as saying that as a sign of good will 
the united states should denounce the interference in iranian 
affairs by previous administrations and release the iranian assets 
with no conditions attached 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia also quoted besharati as saying president bush sent several 
letters the latest three weeks ago to the iranian government 
in these letters the us mentioned issues including iranus 
relations and the lebanese situation he said 
iran did not reply in writing he said but an oral response 
was definitely given through messengers besharati did not 
identify the messengers 
in kennebunkport maine where bush has been vacationing white 
house spokesman roman popadiuk responded there has been no 
message sent by the president to the iranian leadership 
besharati said the hostages may be released if the united 
states turns loose the billions of dollars worth of assets 
including military hardware frozen after the storming of the us 
embassy in tehran in 1979 
iranian officials and news media have in recent months sent 
conflicting signals to the united states about whether unfreezing 
the assets would help secure freedom for the hostages 
sixteen western hostages are held in lebanon most by radical 
shiite moslems loyal to iran eight are americans and the one held 
longest is terry a anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press he was abducted march 16 1985 
in its report on an interview with besharati by the 
englishlanguage tehran times irna said he believed bush was making 
greater efforts toward conciliation than did ronald reagan 
we see the bush administration has tried to undo many things of 
the past besharati said 
hopes for a more moderate attitude toward the west have been 
raised by the death june 3 of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini irans 
revolutionary patriarch and the election to the presidency july 28 
of hashemi rafsanjani leader of the pragmatist faction that 
supports closer ties with the west 
because of the closed nature of iranian politics it is difficult 
to assess whether the besharati comments signaled a new willingness 
to negotiate freedom for the hostages 
last month rafsanjani offered to help work for their release if 
the united states adopted a friendlier policy toward iran and he 
cited frozen iranian assets as one sore point 
in an apparent struggle between radical and pragmatist factions 
within the iranian government ayatollah ali khamenei irans 
spiritual leader said aug 14 that there would be no dealings with 
the united states but foreign minister ali akbar velayati on the 
same day left open the possibility 
the day before irna outlined conditions for release of the 
hostages citing the assets 
an iranian newspaper kayhan international said aug 15 that 
unfreezing the assets would not guarantee iranian help in freeing 
the hostages 
the next day it said the united states can only improve its ties 
with iran by releasing the assets 
besharati has made several trips to lebanon in recent years and 
is believed to have influence with hezbollah or party of god the 
proiranian group believed to sponsor shiite kidnap gangs 
in an interview published today in the washington post sheik 
mohammed hussein fadlallah believed to be hezbollahs spiritual 
leader said the bush administration should stop seeing moves for 
unfreezing usheld iranian financial assets as a potential ransom 
iran sees that its relations with america do not revolve around 
assets and hostages but around what it considers hostile american 
policies against iran he was quoted as saying in an interview 
saturday at his villa in southern beirut 
the release of the assets would be an indication of americas 
distancing itself from hostile policies he said 
fadlallah also called on the united states to look for 
opportunities to improve the conditions and suffering in the cirle 
of arab detainees or hostages held by israel or lebanese 
factions the newspaper said

more than 300 east germans hoping 
to flee to the west have taken refuge in bonns embassy in prague 
creating a critical situation inside the mission a diplomat was 
quoted as saying today 
michael steiner of the west german embassy told the communist 
party daily rude pravo of a continuous influx of east germans 
who have camped out on the missions grounds 
the mission housed in the baroque lobkowicz palace in pragues 
mala strana district was closed to the public aug 23 after about 
140 east germans were reported to have taken refuge there seeking 
safe passage to west germany 
scores more have since arrived apparently climbing over an 
unguarded sevenfoot fence that surrounds the welltended embassy 
park giant tents have been erected in the grounds to house the 
refugees 
prague government officials have not said if whether they will 
follow hungarys more reformminded leadership in allowing the east 
germans to go to west germany 
czechoslovakias entrenched communist leadership is close to east 
german leader erich honecker and seems unlikely to offend him by 
allowing the east germans to flee to the west 
bonn was forced to shut its prague embassy in october 1984 when 
about 160 east germans sought refuge there they returned home to 
east germany in january 1985 after a hunger strike failed to win 
them exit visas and it is not known if they ever were allowed to 
leave later for west germany 
rude pravo said the embassy compound is currently only a 
distant reminder of a diplomatic mission 
steiner was said to have praised the attitude of czechoslovakia 
as a host country as entirely correct in the solution of technical 
matters connected with this extraordinary situation 
several temporary west german visa offices have been opened at 
different points around prague to cope with the task of issuing up 
to 6000 visas a day requested by czechoslovaks who are enjoying 
new freedom to travel to the west

president bush says he has to harness his 
tendency to sometimes get emotional 
we bushes cry easily he told british journalist david frost 
in an interview on the lawn of his home in kennebunkport maine 
the interview was taped aug 29 and is scheduled for television 
broadcast tonight on public broadcasting system 
already bush has had to contend with the july 31 claim by 
terrorists that they had hanged marine lt col william higgins and 
the deaths of 47 uss iowa crewmen during the april 19 explosion 
aboard the ship 
and those get me he said im not good at expressing the 
concerns of a nation in matters of national concern like that im 
just not very good at it and so you try not to choke up 
you try to say what you really think but i feel very moved 
when i see those kinds of tragedies you feel a certain 
responsibility you feel a certain frustration particularly in 
terms of these hostages he said 
bush said he recalls turning down several drafts of a speech 
about the iowa because he thought he would become too emotional 
on july 31 a videotape of higgins hanging from a noose was 
released in lebanon and a proiranian shiite faction claimed 
responsibility for the death of the us hostage 
when i saw colonel higgins body displayed in that brutal 
cruel fashion i had this visceral reaction of wanting to do 
something i still want to do something bush said 
if i could find a way to surgically go in and free those 
american hostages i would do it 
asked if he expects to renew diplomatic ties with iran bush 
replied id like to think we could see that day and id welcome 
it 
but there has to be a certain modicum of international 
decency bush said referring to the reported link between iran 
and terrorist groups holding us hostages in lebanon 
from time to time their officials make statements indicating 
they have some control over that situation he said thats got 
to change dramatically before there can be the kind of relations 
that i personally would like to see with iran 
bush also said he will fulfill his campaign pledge to fight for 
no more taxes but added that he cant guarantee congress wont 
act in strange and mysterious fiscal ways 
what im trying to do is fulfill that pledge by going forward 
step by step on the budget without raising taxes he said 
when asked whether he is committed to the tax pledge for his full 
fouryear term the president said were going to succeed this 
first year and then weve gotta see what happens but it is my 
intention to fight every inch of the way for no more taxes

customs officials seized more than 300 
rifles and handguns from a philippine congressman and his companion 
today after they arrived from the united states authorities said 
zafiro respicio chief customs collector at ninoy aquino 
international airport said 314 guns were found in nine bags 
identified as belonging to rep nicanor de guzman and ponciano dato 
the two arrived today on a philippine airlines flight from san 
francisco the guns included 25caliber and 45caliber pistols 
38caliber revolvers and several assault rifles respicio said 
respicio said the shipment was discovered when the baggage passed 
through the airports xray machines he also said de guzman did not 
have necessary documents for importing the weapons 
he said smuggling charges were being prepared against de guzman 
and dato the weapons were estimated to be worth 139000 respicio 
said 
de guzman is a member of the struggle of the democratic filipino 
a political party that supports president corazon aquino 
officials said the bags were being carried by dato and that the 
congressman had left the airport before the shipment was discovered 
in a radio interview de guzman denied the bags containing the 
weapons were his and claimed he did not know dato de guzman said he 
had been in the united states for about two weeks and that he would 
not have had enough time to buy so many weapons under us law 
de guzman said he would resign if officials could prove the 
weapons were his house speaker ramon mitra said he was forming a 
threemember panel to investigate 
mrs aquino said she would order philippine airlines offices in 
the united states to tighten procedures for inspecting baggage 
destined for manila 
weapons smuggling is widespread in the philippines and officials 
estimate there are more than 180000 unregistered firearms in the 
country 
also today customs chief salvador mison said inspectors at the 
port of manila found 23 handguns in six boxes sent by a filipino 
living in the united states 
officials say the proliferation of unlicensed weapons is a major 
cause of the rise of street killings here 
the incident occurred amid a widely publicized dispute between 
mrs aquino and the house of representatives the more 
proadministration of the two chambers of congress 
last year the house tried to import hundreds of pistols uzi 
submachine guns and galil assault rifles because members said they 
needed additional protection 
but the guns were turned over to the military and customs 
officials after defense secretary fidel ramos ruled the weapons were 
illegally imported that led to a public outcry over the deal 
last week mrs aquino ordered the confiscated weapons to be 
burned to show her strong commitment to fighting crime 
but the plan was aborted after mitra and other congressmen 
complained that they had not exhausted all legal appeals for release 
of the weapons

police raided a house in this british colony and 
seized 420 million worth of china white heroin in what is 
believed to be the third largest seizure of the drug authorities 
said today 
officers grabbed 924 pounds of more than 90 percent pure heroin 
along with two automatic pistols and radio scanners used to monitor 
police activity during their raid on the house monday afternoon 
police officials said the drugs were probably bound for the 
united states and australia and were an indication of hong kongs 
growing role as a conduit of heroin from the southeast asias 
golden triangle 
two men a lifeguard and a driver and two women both 
homemakers were arrested at four different locations after the 
raid said tsang yampui chief staff officer of the narcotics 
bureau 
he told a news conference that the unidentified men and women 
were not married and that they would be charged with drugrelated 
offenses later this week police were still looking for three other 
men 
tsang estimated the street value of the drugs at 420 million 
according to us statistics it would be enough to supply one out 
of every five us addicts for a year 
tsang said the seizure capped a 6month probe of the drug ring 
he said the drugs which were wrapped in brown paper and displayed 
at the news conference had been smuggled through thailand and 
arrived in hong kong by boat after passing through both 
international and chinese waters 
the drugs arrived in hong kong several days ago and more than 100 
police officers had been hot on the trail since he said 
the drug raid apparently was the second biggest seizure of 
china white heroin and the third biggest seizure of heroin ever 
in january 1988 authorities seized 11 tons of china white 
packed into bales of rubber on a usbound ship in the gulf of 
thailand in january 1982 authorities in iran grabbed 1411 pounds 
of brown sugar heroin the drugs middle eastern variety 
tsang said the seizure which comes at a time of falling heroin 
use in hong kong was an indication that gangs here are looking for 
international markets for heroin 
the hong kong government today released a report that said new 
reports of drug addiction fell in 1988 by about 11 percent when 
compared to 1987 
for several years us authorities have said chinese gangs 
based in hong kong and thailand with connections in america were 
moving into the heroin racket in the united states 
the most recent case illustrating this trend was the fbis 
operation white mare which resulted in the seizure of 828 
pounds of china white in three locations in new york city in 
february 
arrests were made in the united states singapore and hong kong 
the drugs in both the white mare case and todays case came 
from the golden triangle which comrpises the border areas of 
thailand burma and laos 
tsang said burmas production of opium which is the raw material 
of heroin has apparently doubled this year to 2400 tons

hundreds of thousands of blacks 
went on strike today on the eve of segregated elections and 
archbishop desmond tutu angrily accused police of desecrating his 
church in breaking up rallies 
leading antiapartheid groups and the countrys two largest black 
labor federations have endorsed the planned twoday strike another 
action in a nationwide defiance campaign protesting the exclusion of 
blacks from wednesdays parliamentary balloting 
the campaign has included mass strolls by blacks on 
whitesonly beaches and antigovernment demonstrations by whites 
and blacks that police have broken up with tear gas water cannon 
and batons 
on monday police detained tutu and fellow antiapartheid 
activist the rev allan boesak for 90 minutes after they refusing to 
move away from a cape town church when police blocked its door with 
an armored truck 
they have gone berserk tutu said of police i want to say 
to the world that the terrorists in south africa are the south 
african government 
in the major cities of johannesburg durban and cape town today 
it appeared students and trade union members were striking but most 
other black workers were on the job 
rushhour traffic into cities was only slightly less heavy than 
usual according to several reports 
the national union of mineworkers the countrys largest union 
said 78000 members at 16 mines refused to go underground for their 
morning shifts tens of thousands of miners were expected to join 
the strike later in the day the union said 
employers in heavily unionized industries said they expected the 
strike and most have adopted a no work no pay no punishment 
stance toward the workers 
across the country black mixedrace and indian schools were 
closed youths built burningtire street barricades in the townships 
outside durban and in soweto the huge black city on the outskirts 
of johannesburg 
two bombs exploded overnight in mixedrace areas of cape town 
but there were no injuries and damage was minimal police said 
activists tossed two hand grenades at a police station in soweto 
and gasoline bombs at three homes belonging to black policemen near 
durban no injuries were reported police said 
at the multiracial university of natal in pietermaritzburg 
classes were canceled but about 500 students and administrators 
held an antielection rally 
there is something terribly wrong with those who rule us if 
they cannot understand why such protest is occurring said colin 
webb the white viceprincipal of the university are they so deaf 
that they cannot hear the frustratuion of south africans who are 
deprived of the privileges of citizenship 
in wednesdays election the national party which has ruled 
south africa for 41 years is favored to keep control of the 
dominant white chamber of parliament however it is likely to lose 
seats to both the farright conservative party and the 
antiapartheid democratic party 
analysts predict the nationalists will capture less than 50 
percent of the white vote for the first time since 1953 however 
almost anything above 40 percent will allow them to win enough 
individual districts to hold a majority in the white chamber 
there also are polls for the indian and mixedrace chambers 
blacks who make up 28 million of south africas 37 million people 
are excluded 
under the countrys apartheid policies the 5 million whites 
control the economy and maintain segregated schools neighborhoods 
and hospitals 
acting president fw de klerk said in campaign speech monday 
night that white domination must end but in a way that does not 
lead to whites being dominated 
discrimination must be eliminated there is no other 
alternative he told a supportive national party crowd of about 
600 people in johannesburg but he said oneman onevote on a 
common voters roll would mean black domination of whites 
shortly after de klerk spoke cape town police detained tutu and 
boesak at when they refused to leave the central mission methodist 
church where people were trying to assembly for an antielection 
rally 
tutu said police also desecrated his church nearby st georges 
anglican cathedral when they entered it monday evening police 
ordered the church closed barred people from coming in and 
temporarily kept the cathedral dean outside he held a 
reconsecration service this morning 
the south african police sank to new depths last night when 
they desecrated my cathedral said tutu head of the anglican 
church in southern africa everywhere in the world the church has 
been recognized as a place of sanctuary even by the craziest of 
dictators

a scuba diver said he videotaped a shark 
attacking him and used the camera to beat the animal back until he 
could swim to safety 
all i could see was its snout larry stroup said monday it 
was butting its head against my camera what surprised me was when 
he reached out and grabbed my arm 
the camera captured the entire incident stroup said he said 
another diver who viewed the tape said it showed the shark 
waggling back and forth like they do in the movies as it clung 
to his arm 
the 46yearold real estate developer from albuquerque nm 
displayed his bandaged limbs during a news conference at harborucla 
medical center 
dr annie hollister an orthopedic surgeon said stroup would 
remain at the facility for four or five days so he could be watched 
for signs of infection she said there a possibility of nerve damage 
affecting movement of his thumb 
stroup said he was filming a school of about 10 blue sharks 
which were between seven and 10 feet long about 15 miles off santa 
barbara island on sunday when he swam out of a protective shark cage 
to get a better shot 
if as long as there is no erratic behavior its ok to get out 
of the cage he said her added that the blue shark is not 
terribly aggressive 
but this particular blue shark bumped his camera about four 
times he said i didnt feel him bite i just looked over and his 
mouth was around my arm he said 
using his camera and helped by a fellow diver he warded off the 
shark and stroup swam about 35 feet to their boat a coast guard 
helicopter flew him to the hospital where he underwent surgery to 
repair torn ligaments and muscle 
santa barbara island is about 40 miles southwest of los angeles 
stroup a diver for five years said it was his first expedition 
to observe sharks 
im sure ill go diving again right now im not so sure ill 
go shark diving he said i would say that i have a little more 
respect for sharks

a leftwing kibbutz movement has called on 
israeli soldiers to refuse to carry out illegal or immoral orders 
when serving in the occupied territories 
elisha shapira a reserve lieutenant colonel and head of the 
kibbutz artzi movement a group of 84 collective farms said there 
has been an increase in incidents in which soldiers are ordered to 
beat palestinians until their limbs break or commit other excessive 
acts 
the fact is that in the field many irregular incidents are 
going on and soldiers are carrying out dozens and dozens of illegal 
orders said shapira who did his reserve duty near the west bank 
town of nablus earlier this year 
the armys high command is making great efforts to protect our 
societys norms but to my sorrow we are seeing many deviations 
he said 
shapira said he learned of the excesses from his own reserve 
service and reports from members of the kibbutz artzi movement the 
movement has 40000 members 
traditionally israels collective farms have produced a 
disproportionate number of combat soldiers and pilots including 
several chiefs of staff 
the call to disregard illegal orders first made on israel 
television monday follows defense minister yizhak rabins 
announcement that new orders were being issued to soldiers 
loosening restrictions on when soldiers can use live ammunition 
soldiers will now be allowed to use live rounds day or night 
against any masked suspect who disregards orders to halt in the 
past only plastic bullets could be used and masked activists were 
subject to arrest primarily at night 
shapira said the call was not directly connected to rabins 
directive 
in february 1988 rabin issued an order saying soldiers should 
use force power and blows to quell palestinian violence as an 
alternative to gunfire 
the order was widely interpreted to mean soldiers could beat 
palestinian suspects as punishment and arab hospitals reported 
treating hundreds of broken bones orders were later clarified to 
say soldiers could only use sufficient force to arrest suspects 
an army spokesman asked about shapiras accusation said 
soldiers under the pressures of dealing with violent protests 
sometimes had difficulty in discerning legal from illegal actions 
the problem is it is not defined in any book even the 
government has debated whether it is legal to order soldiers to beat 
arab suspects said the spokesman who cannot be identified by 
name under military regulations 
at least 557 palestinians have been killed and thousands more 
injured during the nearly 21month intefadeh or palestinian 
uprising most have died as a result of gunshot wounds although some 
deaths have been attributed to beatings thirtynine israelis also 
have died in the violence 
in may a military court convicted four soldiers of the elite 
givati infantry brigade of brutality and sentenced them to nine 
months in jail for beating a palestinian refugee in gaza with their 
rifle butts and a broomstick the arab died of later beatings he 
received from other soldiers the court said 
in that case the soldiers said they were following orders and 
could not tell if the orders were illegal or not 
brig gen ehud gross the armys chief education officer was 
quoted as saying earlier this year that illegal use of force was 
widespread because troops hesitated to report on the questionable 
acts of their collegues

a diplomatic standoff delaying an 
exodus of thousands of east german refugees from hungary has left 
the wouldbe emigres in the cold and west german relief workers in 
the dark 
in hungary at least 30 of the thousands of east germans huddling 
in refugee camps in and near budapest said they will begin a hunger 
strike on friday if their crisis is not solved by then 
the situation is desperate a 23yearold east german 
identifying himself only as rene told reporters outside the 
capitals largest refugee camp known as csilleberc 
hungarian officials said they stalled a mass emigration of east 
germans to west germany because of concern that east berlin might 
react angrily to the unauthorized release of its citizens 
the hamburgbased weekly magazine stern quoted hungarian interior 
minister istvan horvath as saying resolution of the refugee crisis 
could take up to 1 months or until west germany and east germany 
reach agreement 
the east german staterun news agency adn reported horvaths 
remarks and also quoted east german foreign ministry spokesman 
wolfgang meyer as repeating assurances that wouldbe emigres will 
not face prosecution if they return 
as recently as sunday west german and hungarian officials had 
suggested the departure was imminent of at least 4700 east germans 
staying in tents and summer cabins at five makeshift refugee camps 
in hungary 
east german refugees began fleeing to the west through hungary 
after the liberal communist regime in budapest in may removed barbed 
wire and other obstacles from its frontier with austria 
an estimated 6000 east germans have since fled to austria their 
final destination is west germany which gives them automatic 
citizenship and generous help in starting new lives 
west german relief workers who toiled roundtheclock over the 
weekend to ready tent cities for the refugees in five border towns 
said monday they still assumed arrivals were imminent 
we still expect the first refugees within the next few days 
said bruno merck president of the bavarian red cross society 
he spoke while touring the tiefenbach camp nestled between an 
alfalfa field and broadroofed bavarian farmhouses 
we were informed just today that the movement would start no 
earlier than tomorrow and that it could be later but the fact of 
the matter is that none of us really knows merck said 
west german austrian and hungarian officials had said last week 
that the unprecedented release of east germans to the west could 
begin as early as last weekend 
huge encampments of 10person tents feeding stations firstaid 
shelters and jobfinding bureaus were thrown together to help east 
germans en route to new lives in the west 
the tent cities in which refugees were to spend their first 
nights are worked into the patchwork of cornfields forest and 
pasture along a nearly 125mile stretch of rolling bavarian farmland 
along the danube and inn rivers 
we were told we were to have the reception camps ready by 
sunday night and we worked through the night and driving rain 
storms to meet that obligation said wolfgang schmidt director of 
the red cross camp in vilshofen across the danube from austria 
asked why he thought the action had been delayed he said 
thats a good question but no one here can answer it 
in budapest a hungarian official said the transfer of refugees 
was stalled because of fears over how hungarys role would be viewed 
by allied east germany 
permission to emigrate is difficult for east germans of working 
age to obtain while travel visas to hungary are relatively easy to 
get 
hungarian premier miklos nemeth estimated last month that as many 
as 20000 other east germans traveling in hungary may seek passage 
to west germany bonn expects more than 100000 east germans to 
arrive after illegal escapes by the end of the year 
about 4700 east germans have formally registered with the 
hungarians for the westward exodus and are huddled in red cross tent 
villages in hungary awaiting transfer to west germany 
many arrived in hungary weeks ago with only light summer clothing 
unseasonable cold has dropped temperatures to near freezing at 
night in both hungary and at the bavarian border camps 
we now have to reckon with a lot of these people arriving with 
weatherrelated illnesses said a nurse stocking a medical tent in 
tiefenbach 
red cross administrators said the influx of east germans would be 
easier if it began soon and was carried out in stages rather than 
transporting thousands at once

a powerful car bomb jolted a bustling 
christian neighborhood today during a lull in fighting between 
christian and syrian forces killing two people and wounding seven 
police said 
also today hundreds of christians demonstrated at the us 
embassy to protest washingtons policy in lebanon organizers said 
the protesters would remain there until us ambassador john 
mccarthy presents his credentials to the christian government 
police said a mercedes sedan rigged with 88 pounds of explosives 
blew up at 920 am near a vegetable market in the mokalles 
district in northeast beirut 
a police spokesman said experts were puzzled by the blast he 
said a fuse and two antitank missiles in the car did not explode 
saving the area from a catastrophe but other explosive material in 
the vehicle apparently went off 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
regulations said a pedestrian and a man in a sedan parked near the 
mercedes were killed all the wounded also were civilians 
the explosion set ablaze seven vehicles including a lebanese 
army jeep knocked down power poles and shattered windows 
voice of lebanon the main radio station in christian east 
beirut at first said the blast was caused by a car bomb then 
reported that an antitank mine went off under a civilian car 
by police count 28 people were killed and 218 wounded in five 
previous car bombings in lebanon this year 
police said 15 people were killed and 150 wounded when a car 
bomb exploded in beiruts christian district of jal eldeeb on march 
17 
syrian and christian gunners skirmished with mortars across 
beiruts dividing green line and in mountain towns east and 
northeast of the capital police said one person was killed and 
three were wounded 
but the exchanges were limited to the frontlines allowing 
beiruts shrunken population to venture out to shop for food or 
check on property the mokalles market was packed with shoppers at 
the time of the blast 
by police count the 6monthold confrontation betwen gen michel 
aouns 20000 troops and syrias 40000strong force has killed 827 
people and wounded 2452 
about 1000 christian youths gathered along a barbedwire 
barricade at the entrance of the us embassy compound and demanded 
that christian army commander gen michel aoun be recognized the 
countrys legitimate prime minister 
sources at the embassy speaking on condition of anonymity said 
mccarthy was not at the compound today 
we declare the beginning of the peaceful siege of the us 
embassy jubran tueini one of the organizers of the march said 
mccarthy go home mccarthy go home the crowd chanted 
the latest round of fighting began march 8 two days after aoun 
imposed a blockade on illegal ports run by syrias militia allies in 
south beirut 
the syrians and allied moslem forces retaliated by shelling and 
besieging the 310squaremile christian enclave northeast of beirut 
aoun then declared a war of liberation against the syrian army 
in lebanon 
damascus moved troops into lebanon in 1976 under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem is competing 
for legitimacy with aouns threeman christian cabinet mccarthy 
who took up his post in septembar 1988 has not submitted his 
credentials to either cabinet 
tueini said the siege would continue until mccarthy submits his 
credentials to the legitimate lebanese authorities represented by 
gen aoun 
tueini publisher of the weekly annahar arab internationa said 
initially that us embassy staff will be allowed to move in an out 
of the compound but if the demands of his group were not met 
well increase the dose of the siege 
aoun has complained about what he said was us indifference 
and tacit support of syria in its war against his army 
the united states a traditional backer of the prowestern 
christians has avoided taking sides in the latest confrontation 
calling repeatedly for a ceasefire but making no accusations 
tueini called on washington to dispatch an official envoy to 
lebanon like the soviets and french french and soviet envoys 
visited lebanon syria and other arab countries last week to discuss 
proposals for a settlement of lebanons 14year civil war

the city of miami donated 22 surplus vehicles to 
haitis military government after us aid was suspended 
infuriating some haitian exiles 
for us that was a slap in the face said jacques despinosse 
president of the haitian american democratic club 
late last year the city sent vehicles that included a frontend 
loader with backhoe five dump trucks and 10 garbage packers to 
haiti the equipment was worth 114800 used but would cost more 
than 1 million new officials said 
the shipment went unnoticed by haitian exile leaders until they 
heard government officials had fought over the equipment in 
portauprince 
mayor xavier suarez said in retrospect city officials should 
have consulted with haitian exile leaders 
the miami herald reported on monday that a haitian exile 
businessman had suggested to city commissioner miller dawkins that 
officials do something to clean up haitis streets dawkins brought 
up the idea in november after visiting haiti he proposed shipping 
the equipment to haiti and won approval 
haiti changed military leaders when lt gen prosper avril 
overthrew lt gen henri namphy in september us direct aid to the 
haitian government was suspended after november 1987 elections were 
canceled by violence 
haitis consul general in miami antonio jeanpoix defended the 
shipment as a humanitarian gesture

the american civil liberties union says it 
will watch closely when the city make any arrests under a new 
ordinance that among other things makes it illegal to be in a park 
where drugs are sold 
its just too broad said elinor alger legal director of the 
ohio aclu i know its getting after crack houses but i think it 
puts enormous responsibility on individuals who may be engaged in 
innocent activity 
last week the city council approved the ordinance after mayor sam 
purses called for police to bump right up against the line 
between legal and illegal methods in the pursuit of drug dealers 
the ordinance forbids people to enter visit or remain in or 
about any place or premises including but not limited to rooms 
apartments buildings motor vehicles yards or parks where illegal 
drugs are manufactured sold dispensed furnished given away 
stored or used with knowledge that such activity is occurring or 
being reckless in that regard 
they might as well shut the parks down said harvey gittler 
executive director of the aclus ohio chapter 
theoretically i couldnt go into a public park if i knew 
another person in the park because that person might be selling 
drugs and that would make me subject to arrest 
ms alger said the aclu will investigate any arrest that seems to 
violate constitutional rights as of monday there had been no 
arrests under the law police said 
city law director tom bernabei said the city is reexamining the 
ordinances language if it needs to be tightened up we will do 
so we dont want to pass an unconstitutional law he said 
but we have a problem in canton with drugs bernabei said 
we also want to be creative in the laws that we adopt in pushing 
the edge of what is or what may be constitutionally prohibited 
in june several gunshots were fired into the house of a city 
councilman who has campaigned against drugs and gangs which he and 
others say have moved into canton from los angeles detroit 
baltimore and jamaica 
no one was injured

sadie miles looked through her living 
room window and pointed out the boardedup crack house across the 
street and the blatant drug deals occurring outside in the afternoon 
this isnt supposed to happen in kalamazoo she said with a 
sigh as she reminisced about life when she moved to the northside 
neighborhood with her parents in 1962 
but residents of this southwestern michigan city are learning 
firsthand that no place is immune to the drug epidemic 
six drugrelated homicides since april are among dozens of 
shootings in miles neighborhood this year on aug 23 a masked 
gunman demanding cash and crack fired randomly into two separate 
crowds wounding six including an 18yearold pregnant woman whose 
fetus did not survive 
its like someone took the worst place in detroit and dropped 
it here the only difference is that this place is so small the 
problem affects everybody said one former crack addict at safe 
house a neighborhood recovery center 
authorities believe kalamazoos location between detroit and 
chicago on interstate 94 has played a large role in the escalating 
problem because detroit is saturated with crack a dealer in 
kalamazoo can charge three or four times as much for that highly 
addictive form of cocaine 
police are fighting back with some gettough approaches that many 
residents applaud but civil libertarians find troublesome 
a new law that has resulted in about 50 arrests since may makes 
it illegal to loiter in any house vacant lot or other place where 
drugs or drug paraphernalia are sold used or stashed 
about 85 percent of those arrested under the ordinance have been 
charged with more serious drug offenses 
the law adopted in various forms in several other cities has 
been criticized by the american civil liberties union on grounds 
that it violates the right to freedom of association a kalamazoo 
judge upheld the law in july 
people here are so fed up with the shootings the deaths they 
are willing to accept almost anything constitutional or 
unconstitutional to bring about relief said tilman cothran 
president of the local chapter of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people 
many residents want even tougher enforcement of the law by police 
the ones who are calling all of this unconstitutional dont 
live here said the rev otha gilyard pastor of mount zion 
baptist church and president of the northside association for 
community development this is a crisis situation this is war 
police also plan to target the assets of suspected drug dealers 
even if they dont have enough evidence for criminal charges 
if we believe youre involved in drug trafficking and we 
see youre living a lifestyle that would be higher than what youd 
have legitimate income for were going to seize your assets and 
youll have to prove how you came across them legally said capt 
scott dolfman who heads the public saftey departments special 
investigations unit 
in canton ohio the american civil liberties union has said it 
will watch closely when the city make any arrests under a new 
ordinance that among other things makes it illegal to be in a park 
where drugs are sold 
i know its getting after crack houses but i think it puts 
enormous responsibility on individuals who may be engaged in 
innocent activity said elinor alger legal director of the ohio 
aclu 
cantons city council approved the ordinance last week after 
mayor sam purses called for police to bump right up against the 
line between legal and illegal methods in the pursuit of drug 
dealers 
in kalamazoo assets seized from suspected pushers will go 
directly into the 3monthold drug asset seizures and forfeiture 
unit 
civil libertarians object to the plan 
assuming someone is guilty and taking their property until they 
are proven innocent sure doesnt sound like the united states 
said john powell aclu national legal director 
this shows the community like the rest of the country is 
frustrated with drugs and is desperate but its important that the 
first casualty of this fight against drugs not be the bill of 
rights the constitution our democratic society 
despite these efforts the police seem to be losing the war 
drug trafficking is worse now than its ever been and its 
going to get worse said dolfman who added that the problem is 
caused in part by a lack of space in county jails 
some residents refuse to accept such dismal predictions 
ive seen plenty of people move away but ive made up my mind 
to stay said miles whose wellmaintained home stands in contrast 
with the weedchoked lots and dilapidated houses on her street 
why should i leave i want the problem to leave

citybased association since lewis began the annual event in 1966 
corporate contributions which have amounted to hundreds of millions 
of dollars are not included in the telethon totals

be to make the difference and win the fight 
wedemeyer of los gatos calif is paralyzed by amyotrophic

former democratic whip tony coelho left 
congress under a cloud of ethical questions but no candidate in the 
campaign for his seat has bad words about him 
abortion highway congestion agriculture problems middle east 
hostages and the candidates experience seem to be getting more 
attention than congressional ethics and coelhos departure from the 
house 
instead of keeping his distance the lone democrat in the race 
assemblyman gary condit has used tv ads and mailings that stress 
his ties to coelho 
whats happened is that both sides have done polling i am very 
positive in the district they decided it would backfire if they 
took me on said coelho who had held the seat since 1978 
the special election is on sept 12 under californias rules 
all candidates will appear on the same ballot if no one gets more 
than 50 percent the top finisher of each party will take part in a 
runoff nov 7 
coelho resigned on june 15 his 47th birthday after failing to 
report a 50000 loan from a savings and loan the money was used 
for a junk bond deal set up by the firms chief executive officer 
the race to succeed coelho is the fourth congressional contest 
this year democrats have won two republican ileana roslehtinen 
last week won the florida seat held for 27 years by democrat claude 
pepper who died may 30 
elections will also be held to fill house seats that belonged to 
speaker jim wright who resigned while under an ethics 
investigation and mickey leland dtexas and larkin smith 
rmiss who died in plane crashes 
in the california race a couple of gop candidates say 
congressional ethics is an issue but the leading republican former 
state agriculture director clare berryhill says the subject hasnt 
caught on with voters 
youd think it would be an issue but the local people 
dont seem to be that upset berryhill said when he came back 
they almost welcomed him like a hero thats why i am saying 
people they talk about ethics but do they really care 
coelho said there was nothing improper about the 50000 loan and 
that it wasnt disclosed because of a clerical error 
his political problems coincided with the wrights downfall 
magnifying them and for a time giving republicans two prominent 
targets something coelho said he wanted to avoid 
coelhos former district and its predecessors have been in 
democratic hands since bf sisk coelhos former boss won the seat 
in 1954 coelho captured the district in 1978 when sisk retired and 
rose through the ranks to become whip the no 3 post in the house 
democratic hierarchy 
the district stretches through the heart of the san joaquin 
valley farm belt then juts east into the sierra nevada to take in a 
portion of yosemite national park 
democrats make up about 55 percent of the districts voters but 
the area tends to be conservative on many issues and berryhill sees 
a tight race 
i think its going to be like every race i have been in i 
think its going to go down to the wire berryhill said 
condit a moderatetoconservative democrat who has spent 6 
years in the state assembly probably is best known in california as 
a member of the gang of five rebel democrats who tried 
unsuccessfully to topple speaker willie brown last year 
eight candidates will be on the ballot condit six republicans 
and roy shimp a libertarian two republicans discontinued 
campaigning after berryhill was endorsed by state and local party 
leaders 
the other gop candidates are cliff burris a contractor who 
stresses family values robert weimer a farmer and farm 
equipment manufacturer and dave williams a food packaging engineer

noncommunist government leader 
in his remarks today walesa called for a strong and united 
europe a europe in which there is a place for everybody and where 
everyone feels that they are free 
we have the chance to work together fruitfully from the

the united states and other nations rejected an 
israeli request for aid to rehabilitate palestinian refugee camps 
because of lack of progress on peace efforts the government said 
today 
also today israel media said the government has begun using 
helicopters to track down wanted palestinians in remote villages and 
mountain hideouts in the occupied west bank 
in a letter this week to prime minister yitzhak shamir president 
bush turned down an israeli request for aid to rehabilitate refugee 
camps in the occupied territories said shamir spokesman yossi 
ahimeir 
he said the united states japan canada and european nations all 
rejected the request and said any additional refugee assistance 
depends on further progress in stalemated peace efforts 
bushs letter came in response to shamirs request about two 
months ago for the united states to take a leading role in aiding 
rehabilitation of the camps ahimeir said 
we consider the refugee problem to be a very important human 
problem ahimier said on israel radio resolving it could help 
advance the entire peace initiative 
the issue arose as deputy foreign minister benjamin netanayahu of 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc headed to washington to drum up more 
american help for peace efforts and to argue against plo chief 
yasser arafat receiving a us visa to address the united nations 
netanyahu blamed the palestinians for holding up the peace 
process saying slayings of 107 residents in the territories by 
fellow arabs were aimed at blocking agreement to israels peace 
intiative most of those killed were accused of collaborating with 
israeli authorities 
maariv quoted bush as saying in his letter to shamir that the 
refugee camps had to be part of a comprehensive plan to resolve 
the conflict between israel and arab states 
bush also reportedly reminded shamir that the united states 
already plays a prominent role in aiding the refugees by 
contributing to the un relief and works agency which administers 
the refugee camps 
the united states is the un agencys top contributor and 
donated more than 60 million of its 223 million budget his year 
agency officials said according to the agency 844708 palestinian 
refugees live in the west bank and gaza strip 
resolving the refugee problem is part of israels fourpoint 
peace plan the ramshackle camps in the west bank and gaza strip 
have been key trouble spots since israel occupied these lands during 
the 1967 middle east war 
the camps also have been at the center of the 20month uprising 
against the occupation of the west bank and gaza strip the central 
point of israel peace initiative is elections in the occupied 
territories to chose palestinian representatives to negotiate with 
israel on interim autonomy for the territories with their final 
status to be settled later 
after criticism of the elections proposal by the plo and other 
palestinians israeli officials called for a worldwide program to 
improve conditions in the camps 
also today israel radio said the army is using helicopters to 
track down wanted palestinians in remote villages and mountain 
hideouts in the occupied west bank 
an army spokesman said the military has used helicopters for 
specific missions in the occupied territories but refused to verify 
the use of the choppers was part of a new policy for arresting 
leaders of the palestinian uprising 
in the gaza strip a 12yearold palestinian boy died of wounds 
suffered in a earlier clash with soldiers arab reports said the 
boy ahmed alabed elbittar from the town of khan yunis died of a 
head wound sustained in a clash with troops last week the reports 
said 
his death raises to 558 the palestinian death toll in the more 
than 20month uprising against israeli occupation thirtynine 
israelis have also died in the violence 
in the gaza strip town of rafah masked palestinian youths 
stabbed to death naeem fakhri afana 27 arab reports said they 
said afana was suspected of collaborating with israel 
the army confirmed both deaths and said in rafah one other arab 
was severely beaten

afghan rebels destroyed part of a 
government air base in western afghanistan and inflicted heavy 
losses on a convoy trying to reach the city of kandahar western 
diplomats and guerrilla sources said today 
omar sheradan a spokesman for the jamiatiislami rebel group 
said a guerrilla rocket attack destroyed about half the air base at 
shindand during an attack last week 
he said the guerrilla factions field commander ismail khan led 
an estimated 500 rebel fighters in the attack on the air base and a 
ring of security posts 
rebels said they overran 12 government positions protecting the 
base killing 160 soldiers and destroying two helicopter gunships 
and two mig fighter bombers 
rebels also claimed they destroyed 80 of an estimated 950 
vehicles in a government convoy that had reportedly originated at 
torghundi near the soviet border and was trying to reach the city 
of kandahar 350 miles to the northwest western diplomats said 
sheradon confirmed the attack and said 150 communist troops died 
in the fighting there was no date of the attack or report of rebel 
casualties 
diplomats speaking on the usual condition of anonymity said the 
attack on shindand airbase crippled air cover for the massive convoy 
the ability of regime forces to protect the convoy may be 
impeded over the next several days because of a major resistance 
rocket attack on shndand air base said a diplomatic report 
sheradon said the base was closed 
afghanistans secondlargest city of kandahar is located in the 
south about 270 miles south of the afghan capital kabul rebel 
sources said in recent months kandahar had been resupplied almost 
exclusively by air 
usbacked guerrillas have been fighting for more than a decade 
to topple the communist government on feb 15 the last of an 
estimated 110000 soviet soldiers who had been fighting along side 
their afghan allies for nine years left afghanistan 
as the summer fighting season draws to a close rebels have 
stepped up their attacks on communist positions throughout the 
country 
heavy fighting is reported around the communist garrison town of 
khost in eastern afghanistan 10 miles from the pakistan border 
a rebel victory at khost would open a direct rebel supply link 
from pakistan to fighters in northern and western afghanistan rebel

the heaviest casualties in recent months sixteen people were killed 
and another 52 were injured when a barrage of rockets battered the

a lawyer for john demjanjuk said he had new 
evidence to show his client is not a nazi war criminal and asked the 
supreme court today to postpone an appeal hearing on his conviction 
and death sentence 
the evidence includes at least four documents recovered from a 
garbage pail at the justice department in washington that contradict 
key testimony given against demjanjuk at his trial laywer yoram 
sheftel said in a telephone interview 
demjanjuk 69 a retired ohio autoworker was found guilty by an 
israeli court in april 1988 of crimes against humanity and crimes 
against the jewish people he was sentenced to death 
he was identified by witnesses as a sadistic guard known as 
ivan the terrible at the treblinka death camp in nazioccupied 
poland where 850000 jews perished in 19421943 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk has claimed to be a victim of 
mistaken identity he appealed the verdict on june 30 1988 and 
after several postponements the appeal was scheduled to be heard 
starting nov 1 
in two petitions filed today sheftel asked for a delay of 
demjanjuks appeal hearing for at least six months citing documents 
found several weeks ago at the justice departments office of 
special investigations which probes suspected nazi war criminals 
sheftel said that in one document a key witness against 
demjanjuk former nazi prison guard otto horn is said to have 
failed to identify him in a photo lineup contradicting claims in 
court that horn recognized demjanjuk 
he accused the justice department of concealing important 
evidence on the one hand and falsifying other evidence in 
proceedings which stripped his client of us citizenship in 1981 
paving the war for his extradition to israel five years later 
we have reports there are other justice department documents 
like these which they have hidden until now sheftel said adding 
that the case was already under investigation in washington 
among the witnesses who identified demjanjuk as the notorious 
guard ivan were several treblinka survivors who gave emotional 
testimony at his trial 
demjanjuks attorneys failed in their attempts to persuade the 
court that too much time had elapsed since the war for positive 
identification and that their client was a prisoner of war during 
the period in question

president bush is prepared to name james 
woolsey jr a conservative democratic and weapons specialist as 
the new american negotiator in 23nation talks to reduce nonnuclear 
forces in europe a us official said today 
security checks have begun on woolsey a lawyer who apparently 
owes his nomination over two other candidates to his close ties to 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the two other candidates were stephen ledogar a foreign service 
officer who now holds the job and phil karber vice president of 
the bdm corp who evidently had the backing of vice president dan 
quayle 
news of woolseys likely selection was first reported in todays 
editions of the washington times 
the negotiations resume thursday in geneva between the 16nation 
north atlantic treaty organization and the sevennation warsaw pact 
led by the soviet union 
bush has raised expectations of an accord by the end of the year 
but that now appears only a longshot possibility 
woolsey whose nomination would require senate approval would 
bring to the job a reputation for political skill as well as weapons 
expertise as a conservative democrat he has close ties with sen 
sam nunn dga the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee while retaining the trust of defenseminded republicans 
woolsey 48 was undersecretary of the navy in the carter 
administration and has served on the staffs of the national security 
council and the senate armed services committee 
as an outside adviser to the reagan administration woolsey 
joined with scowcroft in recommending development of the midgetman 
missile a mobile singlewarhead weapon 
bush in april decided to proceed with a plan to buy and deploy 
300 to 500 new midgetman missiles to be carried on trucks and also 
proposed that 50 mx missiles now housed in fixed underground silos 
be pulled out and put on rail cars 
cost of the two programs if congress provides the funds could 
exceed 40 billion 
the negotiations in geneva known formally as the conventional 
force reduction talks are designed to produce a treaty setting 
equal ceilings on nato and warsaw pact tanks artillery armored 
troop carriers aircraft helicopters and possibly manpower 
bush said in june he wanted to complete the agreement within six 
months to a year but the two alliances have not yet agreed on a 
number of basic issues including measures to verify an agreement 
would be kept 
the nomination of woolsey initially had been expected last 
spring but then was delayed while consideration was given also to 
karber and to retaining ledogar

a promise of confidentiality to news sources 
is an oral contract a state appeals court said today in upholding 
200000 of a 700000 damage award against minnesotas two largest 
newspapers 
a threejudge panel of the court of appeals agreed 21 that the 
star tribune and the st paul pioneer press dispatch must share the 
damages payment to public relations man dan cohen 
but the panel sitting in st paul unanimously rejected cohens 
claim of misrepresentation by the newspapers and said he is not 
entitled to 500000 in punitive damages that had been awarded by a 
hennepin county jury 
news organizations cannot rely on the first amendment to shield 
themselves from criminal or civil liability simply because the acts 
giving rise to such liability were taken while in pursuit of 
newsworthy information said the majority opinion by judge 
marianne short 
surely the newspapers would not suggest they are immune to 
ordinary commercial contracts for goods and services short said 
yet the newspapers maintain that an agreement with a news source 
is exempt from the law of contracts 
judge gary crippen wrote in a partial dissent that the entire 
award should be overturned the case crippen wrote involves the 
exercise of the coercive power of the state to punish the choice of 
the private press to publish 
star tribune executive editor joel r kramer said the paper is 
pleased with the decision on punitive damages and by crippens 
partial dissent 
however he added we are disappointed with the court 
majoritys ruling that contract law applies in this case and 
supersedes first amendment protections he said no decision had 
been made about appealing the ruling to the state supreme court 
mark nadler managing editor of the st paul pioneer press 
dispatch said today the paper is pleased that all three judges 
agreed with our position from the beginning that there was no fraud 
involved that our people did what they did in good faith and that 
there are no grounds for punitive damages 
the paper has not decided whether to appeal he said 
there was no answer at cohens home today his attorney elliot 
c rothenberg did not immediately return a phone call 
the case concerned a revelation during the 1982 gubernatorial 
campaign that marlene johnson a democratic farmer labor candidate 
for lieutenant governor once had been arrested for shoplifting 
cohen who worked for independentrepublican gubernatorial 
candidate wheelock whitney provided the information on the 
condition that he not be identified as the source reporters for the 
newspapers gave that assurance but their editors ordered that 
cohens name be published because they argued the public had the 
right to know that the information came from the whitney campaign 
johnson went on to win the election 
cohen sued claiming he lost his advertising agency job because 
the newspapers breached an oral contract 
the appeals court said any first amendment rights the newspapers 
might have had to publish the sources name were waived when the 
reporters made the confidentiality pledge 
the newspapers argument that the public had the right to 
information about the source was valid but that didnt mean the 
papers had to use cohens name the opinion said 
cohen based his claim of misrepresentation in part on a legal 
inference that editors never intended to keep the reporters 
promises in addition he said the reporters concealed the fact that 
they had no authority to bind the newspapers to their promise 
the appeals court said cohen could not legally infer that the 
editors didnt intend to keep the promise the court also noted that 
no witness could recall a previous instance when a reporters 
confidentiality promise was vetoed by an editor at either paper 
because it was the newspapers practice to honor their 
reporters promises of confidentiality the reporters did not by 
omission misrepresent their authority the majority said in 
throwing out the punitive damages resulting from the 
misrepresentation claim

in the cars trunk along with two mines

cannot be named in line with regulations had the mines exploded 
they would have shattered the whole district 
the blast echoed across east beirut it set seven vehicles 
ablaze including an army jeep uprooted power poles and smashed 
glass in a 500yard radius 
christian radio stations interrupted programming with reports on 
the blast and called on motorists to avoid the area ambulances and 
fire engines rushed to the scene to evacuate casualties and fight

blackened by smoke billowing from gutted cars

the 310squaremile christian enclave home to about 1 million

arrange a ceasefire 
it is not the united states alone which is looking forward to 
lebanons salvation through the committee but france and the 
soviet union also hope for that along with other international 
forces the newspaper said

the poor quality of the air they 
breath and the water they drink will be one of the major concerns of 
dutch voters when they choose a new government wednesday 
premier ruud lubbers the nations charismatic and highly popular 
leader since 1982 is likely to retain his post but preelection 
polls indicate he may need to turn to the opposition labor party to 
form his third government 
lubbers has not ruled out any party as his future coalition 
partner reflecting the mainstream position traditionally taken by 
his christian democrats 
lubbers government fell in may when the rightwing liberals 
junior partners in his centerright coalition government resisted 
his 33 billion plan to clean up the heavily polluted dutch air 
soil and waterways by the year 2010 
the liberals object to a 296 million provision of the plan that 
calls for cutting income tax deductions for people who use their 
cars to get to work 
the liberals say the provision singles out one group while 
lubbers argues that eliminating the deduction would cut exhaust 
emissions and ease highway congestion 
it was the first time a western government had fallen over an 
environmental issue lubbers whose government is now in caretaker 
status called early elections that had been set for may 1990 
the cabinet crisis reflected not only concern for the 
environment but also years of irritation between lubbers and the 
liberals who balked at having to swallow christian democratic 
programs 
the environment is a very fashionable issue at the top of the 
political agenda but as to what the parties are trying to 
achieve i havent discovered all that much difference liberal 
lawmaker jan te veldhuis told the associated press 
te veldhuis added that his party like lubbers would continue 
with the national environmental policy plan engineered in part by 
environment minister ed nijpels himself a liberal but would 
continue to resist eliminating the deduction for cardriving 
commuters 
high unemployment and lubbers economic recovery program also are 
among the top issues facing voters 
according to a poll published last week lubbers christian 
democratic appeal party will lose one of its 54 seats in the 
150seat parliament with the labor party of opposition leader wim 
kok keeping its current 52 seats 
the poll by the interview organization in amsterdam said the 
liberals will lose five of their 27 seats 
most electoral gains are projected to go to smaller groups on 
either side of the political spectrum including green left an 
upstart amalgam of environmentalists and antinato activists that 
could become the nations fourthlargest party 
the telegenic lubbers 50 enjoys wide popularity in the 
netherlands because he is credited with restoring confidence in the 
nations economy and spurring consumer spending 
he has combined a gradual lowering of private and corporate taxes 
with cuts in social programs to slash the 124 billion budget 
deficit which represents 71 percent of net national income 
he has also promised to cut the 113 percent unemployment rate 
and foster economic growth 
in 1985 lubbers proved his skills as a consensus builder by 
engineering the acceptance on dutch soil of 48 us cruise missiles 
in defiance of a large opposition movement the missiles were 
ultimately not placed because of the ussoviet accord on 
eliminating intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
even the leftwing magazine de tijd noted last week that lubbers 
has the aura of a mild wise statesman he speaks perfectly 
and is reason itself 
but to his critics lubbers represents the arrogance of a party 
likely to be the centerpiece of dutch governments for the 
foreseeable future 
the christian democrats or their predecessor parties have been in 
every postwar ruling coalition no single group has ever garnered 
enough votes for a parliamentary majority 
by contrast kok former head of the nations largest labor 
organization the federation of dutch trade unions has failed to 
project as forceful a public image 
de tijd called kok drab and boring and said hes awkward in 
his movements hes all smiles waves a little but sits down far 
too soon at election rallies 
labor wants to boost buying power for lowincome families which 
has been falling steadily during the lubbers era it also wants to 
fight unemployment by shortening the standard 38hour working week 
to 32 hours in most industries

colombias war on drugs in alliance with the 
united states will move drug kingpins to neighboring brazil and 
venezuela venezuelan ambassador alberto consalvi said today 
brazil and venezuela among colombias most sensitive 
neighbors are in the midst of election campaigns and the extreme 
divisions of the political leadership do not permit them to 
agree on questions of vital importance such as defense against the 
drug cartels consalvi said in an interview 
consalvi is a close ally of venezuelan president carlos andres 
perez perez took office in february and his position was shaken 
almost at once by bloody rioting over price rises state and local 
elections are to be held in venezuela in december 
brazilians will vote in november to replace president jose sarney 
big areas in colombias neighbors that are not adequately 
policed will be irresistible to the drug barons consalvi said 
he said that in venezuela politicians seem to be losing 
perspective on the risks in the drug war 
in some countries and in important parts of their economy the 
presence of drug money has already been seen and it stimulates the 
economy mysteriously at a time of crisis he said the 
penetration of drug money is one of the most insidious problems in 
latin america 
consalvi added that the message being sent from this country is 
that latin americans should limit their conflicts in view of the 
common danger not only of losing control of their economies to the 
drug traffickers but also of interference in politics 
what is happening in colombia can happen in any other 
country he said 
political leaders can only avoid it by acting in time its a 
race against the clock

products last year becoming washingtons secondlargest 
agricultural customer after japan the volume is expected to 
increase 15 percent to 20 percent this year government officials 
say

the way dallas elects its city council an issue 
voters supposedly decided only weeks ago went before a federal 
judge today who could order changes if he finds minorities arent 
getting a fair shake 
a lawyer for two blacks who ran unsuccesfully for city council 
opened the trial by saying blacks have trouble getting elected 
because of dallas system under which some candidates are elected 
from districts and some from the city as a whole 
subtle or not so subtle racial discrimination has occurred in 
past city council elections said betsy julian attorney for roy 
williams and marvin crenshaw they sued in 1988 and were joined by a 
hispanic group alleging that the setup dilutes minority voting 
power 
but paul pearce an attorney for the city of dallas said no 
pattern can be established that shows the apportionment 
discriminates against minorities 
in the last 14 elections since 1983 the black preferred 
candidate has been successful in nine races he said 
williams and crenshaw are asking us district judge jerry 
buchmeyer to order the city to restructure the council into 15 
districts 
on aug 12 voters approved a plan under which the mayor would be 
elected at large and other council members would be elected from 
super districts but that plan does not go into effect for two 
years 
it is about selfdetermination and an end to apartheid in this 
city said crenshaw dallas is one of the few cities that didnt 
receive a challenge from the africanamerican community during the 
civil rights movement of the 1960s now its dallas time 
the city denies that the current apportionment discriminates 
against minorities the city claims that the voters right to pick 
their system of government is at stake and it denies that the 
current system is discriminatory 
both sides say the outcome will shape the dallas city government 
for years any judicial precedents that are set could affect local 
state and federal voting districts throughout the nation 
minority leaders long have said the city is dominated by its 
business community and predominantly white north dallas 
neighborhoods 
the current council governing a population estimated to be 51 
percent minority consists of nine nonhispanic whites two blacks 
and no hispanics 
under dallas 83 council system eight members are elected in 
singlemember districts and three including the mayor are elected 
atlarge 
the new 1041 system scheduled to go into effect in 1991 would 
include 10 council members from single districts four from 
quadrants or super districts and only the mayor would be 
elected atlarge 
betsy julian attorney for the plaintiffs called the plan too 
little too late and said it was a lastminute peacekeeping 
concession to maintain the status quo 
we will show there is a long history of racially polarized 
voting in the city of dallas ms julian said 
some say the case will influence realignments on all levels of 
government after the 1990 census 
the dallas hearing is the first of many related cases said 
sonya jarvis executive director of the washingtonbased national 
coalition of black voter participation it will be a microcosm of 
whats going to happen around the nation following the 1990 census 
dallas 1041 plan emerged after mayor annette strauss appointed 
a multiethnic business and civic group to find solutions to racial 
tension in the city following a series of deadly confrontations 
between minority citizens and police 
black and hispanic leaders opposed the 1041 plan which was 
approved 41456 to 20823 in a turnout of less than 14 percent of 
registered voters analyses by precinct showed whites voted for the 
plan and blacks and hispanics against it

labor day weekend ended with a 
skirmish after two nights of clashes between police and black 
college students the us justice department said it was studying 
videotapes to see if police used excessive force 
shortly before midnight monday a crowd of about 40 young people 
protested when a police dog tore at the clothes of a man officers 
were arresting police sealed off the area and the confrontation 
ended about 20 minutes later 
today atlantic avenue jammed by an estimated 100000 young 
people 48 hours earlier was nearly deserted with many shops 
boarded up 
in washington justice department spokeswoman deborah 
burstionwade said its very possible the fbi and the 
departments civil rights division will open an investigation into 
whether police and national guardsmen used undue force to quell the 
rioting 
she said the department is reviewing videotapes of the clashes to 
determine if there is a basis for a criminal investigation so far 
the department has received no citizen complaints of excessive 
police force she said 
during the melees police wielded 30inch riot batons but used no 
tear gas against rioters who threw bottles and bricks and looted at 
least 100 businesses two men were wounded by gunfire but 
authorities said officers fired no shots 
students from predominantly black east coast colleges made up 
much of the crowd in town for the annual fraternity festival that 
marks the end of summer 
during the weekend at least 260 people were arrested half of 
them area residents and hundreds of summonses issued authorities 
said at least 43 people were injured including 30 police officers 
and 13 youths property damage was in the millions of dollars said 
mayor meyera e oberndorf 
at the start of the weekend businessmen in the town of 260000 
yearround residents had hoped for a large turnout to offset a slow 
summer the turnout was greater than expected but dreams of a 
prosperous weekend evaporated early sunday 
city officials ordered police to clear atlantic avenue the major 
thoroughfare that was packed from sidewalk to sidewalk for about 30 
blocks 
as a wedge of officers moved down the street they were pelted 
with bottles ahead of police youths broke store windows and looted 
shops at city leaders request gov gerald l baliles called out 
the national guard 
on sunday night city police officers from neighboring 
localities at least 200 state troopers and about 150 guardsmen 
cleared an estimated 45000 people from atlantic avenue the beach 
section was closed and those on the beachfront were told to return 
to their rooms or face arrest 
it appears to be a case of too many people in a confined 
space oberndorf said it appears to be a case of critical mass 
of people building up an rapid mood changes in a huge crowd 
civil rights leaders said problems developed in part because 
the city failed to make any preparations for the visitors other than 
to call out the police 
the city had no damn idea what it was getting into it had no 
contact with the black community and no idea of the numbers 
involved said jack w gravely president of the state national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
the naacp said police overreacted and that the city and 
merchants had made the students feel unwelcome gravely said 
however that those responsible for the looting should be prosecuted 
black leaders said had the crowd been predominantly white police 
would have reacted differently 
oberndorf called that poppycock 
all police reports and our videotape show that the city 
controlled response to situations that have arisen she said 
the mayor showed edited videotapes to reporters monday afternoon 
the tapes showed the extensive looting sunday morning but the 
street clearing by police was edited out a tape of sunday nights 
confrontation showed a phalanx of several hundred officers moving 
toward a group of youths again the actual dispersal of the crowd 
was edited out 
police oberndorf said have rendered a tremendous service to 
this community 
but gravely said police heavyhandedness was partly to blame for 
the violence 
their response was to confront the students from a position of 
power he said 
that gravely said led to the first confrontation as students 
felt squeezed by police and felt a need to show discontent 
city officials said the only way they could ensure the protection 
of life and property was to clear the street our guests as long 
as they are willing to behave themselves are welcome oberndorf 
said 
business leaders had no estimate in the amount of lost business 
because of the violence 
we have to get past this weekend the business community has to 
sit down with a levelheaded approach and decide what we are going 
to do next said flo mcdaniel executive director of the virginia 
beach hotel and motel asociation

people holding us government checks soon will 
have one year to cash them or go to the trouble of having the 
government agency reissue them the treasury department said tuesday 
a new law requires such checks dated oct 1 and later to be 
cashed within one year of their issue the phrase void after one 
year will be printed on the checks as a reminder 
the law also requires people holding checks dated prior to oct 1 
to cash them no later than sept 30 1990 
commissioner w e douglas of the departments financial 
management service said in a statement that not only is it a poor 
business practice to keep the governments books open forever it 
is also expensive to maintain the records and its the taxpayers 
who have to pick up the tab 
douglas said the public now holds about 6 million uncashed 
government checks worth more than 25 billion that are more than a 
year old 
the checks range in value from two cents for a 1945 income tax 
refund to a 8606 compensation check dated april 9 1954 the 
oldest uncashed check is one dated april 15 1919 for 101 in 
interest on a world war i liberty bond 
the department emphasized the time limit does not affect the 
governments liability but if the time limit is exceeded the check 
will be cancelled and the person to whom it was written will have to 
apply to the agency that wrote it for a replacement 
the federal government issues about 550 million checks a year 
worth more than 600 billion the department said

the navy on thursday will release the findings 
of its monthslong investigation into the explosion aboard the uss 
iowa that claimed the lives of 47 crewmen it was announced today 
navy investigators have searched to find the cause of the april 
19 tragedy when powder exploded in the battleships no 2 gun 
turret during openseas gunnery practice near puerto rico 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said the report is 1100 pages 
in length and will be discussed at a briefing by the vice chief of 
naval operations adm leon edney and the investigating officer 
rear adm richard milligan 
williams said the two intended to offer a very thorough 
briefing on the accident he declined to discuss the details of the 
report in advance 
meanwhile a sailor from the battleship says navy investigators 
browbeat him into implicating shipmate clayton hartwig in the 
explosion 
in an interview with abc news broadcast on monday seaman david 
smith said he believed that hartwig a gunners mate was innocent 
of causing the explosion that destroyed one of the battleships gun 
turrets 
according to reports earlier this summer smith told naval 
investigators that hartwig had made sexual advances to him the night 
before the explosion and that on other occasions hartwig had talked 
about how to set off explosions and showed him a timer device 
part of me can see him doing it smith was quoted as saying 
hartwig died in the explosion with the other sailors 
in his abc news interview smith said the investigators 
questioned him in sessions lasting up to 12 hours and threatened to 
charge him with 47 counts of murder and accessory to murder if he 
did not cooperate 
smith said investigators put words into his mouth and distorted 
his testimony abc said smith said he did not receive a homosexual 
proposition from hartwig and never heard of any timing device owned 
by hartwig abc said 
navy spokesman kendall pease said he was unaware of the abc 
report and had no comment 
in cleveland hartwigs sister kathy kubicina said her campaign 
to clear her brother of suspicion in the case has been given a boost 
by the news report

him tell the truth

face he refused to see me she said but ive talked to a 
couple of the guys who survived and they assured me this kid never 
had any contact with my brother

say these things she added

five japanese were arrested for trying to sell 
nearly nine pounds of refined uranium to the us embassy for 83 
million police said tuesday 
in concentrated form the radioactive chemical element can be 
used for nuclear power generation and nuclear bombs however 
nuclear experts said the substance offered by the suspects was 
nearly in its natural state and would require more processing for 
almost any use 
city police said the four men and a woman were arrested friday 
after offering to sell the uranium to the embassy in tokyo at about 
2000 times its market value 
police said they were tipped off about the case by the us 
embassy and secretly took pictures of the suspects in cooperation 
with the embassy before making the arrests 
police said they seized photographs from the suspects showing 
about 40 metal capsules that appeared to contain uranium they said 
the suspects offered to sell a total of 88 pounds of the substance 
authorities said tuesday the five were arrested for illegal 
possession of nuclear substances but had not been formally charged 
police said the suspects brought a capsule with 35 ounces of 
uranium to the embassy in early august and offered the rest for sale 
later 
police said they sent the substance in the capsule to the science 
and technology agency which found it was refined natural uranium of 
707 percent purity 
the analysis showed only 071 percent was uranium235 the kind 
used for power generation and bombs experts say nuclear power 
generation requires more than 3 percent uranium235 and an atomic 
bomb needs more than 90 percent of that same type 
nuclear experts including prof kyoji naito of nagoya 
univerisity said the uranium was almost in its natural state and 
thus had little use without further processing 
they said it could be harmful if the human body were exposed to 
it for an extended time 
the american embassy said laboratory analysis showed the 
substance had posed no danger to embassy personnel or the public 
naito and the police said the price the suspects demanded shows 
they did not know the uraniums value the same type is being sold 
at about 275 per ounce making the price the group demanded more 
than 2000 times greater than its market value 
takaharu ushikoshi head of the police departments public 
security said police do not believe the groups had terrorist or 
political motives it looks like the groups intent was purely 
money he said 
ushikoshi said one suspect said the group bought the uranium from 
an unidentified person for 35 million 
he suggested the suspects tried to sell the material to the 
embassy because they probably thought ordinary people or companies 
wouldnt buy such an outrageous thing 
police identified the alleged ringleader as a 43yearold woman 
toshiko nishijima who owns several small companies 
the others were identified as koichi tsuru 33 owner of a 
securities firm in hong kong toshitada mizuno 44 a real estate 
firm owner kasutoshi okazaki 44 a master of the traditional 
japanese tea ceremony and tomoyuki nishida 39 owner of a trading 
company

two vietnamese women who escaped 
the killing fields of their homeland to find success in the us 
military say the fiercest motivation to make their lives count came 
when they were closest to death 
anne nguyen was 5 and jean nguyendoyne was 12 when north 
vietnamese forces captured saigon in 1975 mrs nguyendoyne said 
their father a colonel in the south vietnamese army called the 
family into his bedroom to tell them of a possible enemy attack but 
he had a plan 
he wanted to commit suicide for all of us she said he 
called all of us in and told us he had a claymore mine he had saved 
and he was going to set it off to kill us he said he would rather 
have us die together than suffer separately 
but a family friend persuaded their father instead to flee the 
country with him beginning the familys odyssey to the united 
states 
in 1985 mrs nguyendoyne became the first vietnamese woman to 
graduate from the us military academy at west point earning a 
bachelor of science degree with a double major in spanish and 
french now a first lieutenant she is an intelligence officer 
stationed at fort carson army post in colorado springs 
miss nguyen has completed basic training at the air force academy 
in colorado springs and is just beginning her four years as a cadet 
there she wants to be an air force pilot 
mrs nguyendoyne said the fact that she nearly died still 
compels her to succeed 
i felt helpless she said of her fathers intent to kill 
himself his wife and their six children i didnt want to waste 
myself i think that is still my motivation that kept me going 
after leaving saigon the refugee family spent several days 
moving among vietnams coastal islands before hitching a ride on a 
military vessel built to hold about 1200 people the ship carried 
about 3500 people on a sevenday voyage to a refugee camp in guam 
three months later the family was in a refugee camp in fort 
chaffee ark and not long thereafter the lutheran church agreed 
to sponsor them in milton pa 
i thought america must be a very rich country said mrs 
nguyendoyne now 26 everyone had cars and houses we were used 
to two families living in small houses the markets were very 
impressive too we had no indoor markets in vietnam no 
refrigeration 
the sisters soon were americanized they were given english 
names their vietnamese first names were virtually unpronounceable 
here and became highly motivated students 
for mrs nguyendoyne the hard work paid off when she was 
selected from more than 10000 applicants to attend west point 
our parents emphasized the importance of honor duty 
country she said i feel very fortunate to be able to attend 
the west point academy 
her father graduated from the vietnamese national academy before 
becoming a south vietnamese army officer besides the sisters who 
attended military academies there is another sister in the navy and 
a brother in the army infantry 
the sisters say they appreciate the opportunities they have 
received and believe american freedoms cannot be taken for granted 
there are more opportunities here especially for women said 
miss nguyen now 19 there are so many things women are allowed to 
do here in vietnam the attitude was that women should be barefoot 
and pregnant 
mrs nguyendoyne said american freedoms are worth fighting for 
when you come from another country without the freedoms there 
are here you work as hard as you can to make sure you never lose 
those freedoms she said i want to contribute as much as i can 
to the army and the country i dont take the word freedom lightly

polands solidarity leader lech 
walesa began a west german visit tuesday with a plea for western 
aid saying solidaritys plan for economic reform in poland will 
crumble without it 
our victory in poland is like a house of cards walesa said 
during a luncheon with the board of directors of the powerful german 
federation of labor unions it would crumble if it were not 
financially ensured 
walesa on the first day of a fiveday visit also met with 
johannes rau governor of the industrial state of north 
rhinewestphalia 
he presented rau with a list of 16 proposed projects for west 
german companies in the baltic port city of gdansk walesas 
hometown and the birthplace of the solidarity trade union movement 
neither rau nor walesa gave details about the proposed projects 
walesa said he was extending an invitation to west germans to 
come and rebuild poland and urged west germany to make a quick 
decision on financial assistance to the country the longer one 
waits the more expensive everything becomes he said 
the east bloc which has lifted its iron curtain can also be 
attractive to western investors he added 
west germany has built good business ties with eastern europe 
and the united states has suggested it take the lead in the wests 
efforts to support east bloc reforms 
chancellor helmut kohls government has promised west german aid 
for poland but the two sides have been unable to agree on how much 
the more conservative wing in kohls coalition government also wants 
to link the aid to polish promises to improve the condition of 
ethnic germans in poland 
walesa is trying to secure aid to help promote polish reforms 
under the new government of solidarity activist tadeusz mazowiecki 
named last month as the east blocs first noncommunist government 
leader 
upon arrival at duesseldorf airport tuesday walesa called for 
east and west to overcome economic and political barriers creating 
a europe where everyone feels that they are free 
we have the chance to work together fruitfully from the 
airplane i saw that we are indeed a united europe but it is hilly 
here and there and there are also other obstacles walesa told 
reporters through an interpreter 
i believe that these hills obstacles and walls can be 
removed he said 
differences between the two countries spoiled kohls hopes of 
traveling to poland to mark the 50th anniversary of the start of 
world war ii 
relations between the two countries have been strained by recent 
suggestions by west germanys conservative finance minister theo 
waigel that polish lands once part of the german empire technically 
still belong to germany 
on tuesday afternoon labor minister norbert bluem said he had 
told walesa that a monthold west german ban on polish seasonal 
workers was being lifted 
speaking to reporters after meeting with walesa bleum said there 
would be negotiations between poland and west germany on a quota for 
such workers 
thousands of poles spend months in west germany to earn hard 
currency usually charging less for their labor then germans the 
practice has angered west germans who have to compete with the poles 
for work 
walesa is scheduled to meet with kohl on thursday 
kohls chief spokesman hans klein said kohl and walesa would 
discuss the situation in poland following the government 
changeover economic conditions there international aid measures 
for poland and the future cooperation between our two countries

gov terry branstad on tuesday announced 
a program to hire more drugfighting prosecutors and narcotics 
agents 
many details of the package will depend on how much president 
bush proposes for aid programs to states in a 78 billion federal 
program he was to announce tuesday night 
the cost of the governors proposals was put at 10 million plus 
a 30 percent increase in prevention and treatment programs which 
now cost 135 million 
branstad said the focus of the effort would be on hard drugs such 
as cocaine and heroin but treatment and education also are 
important components 
were not going to win this drug war simply with additional 
cops branstad said 
we are beginning to see a reduction in casual use of drugs 
branstad said but he said reports of violent drugrelated crime 
are increasing 
the iowa national guard however plans to continue its aerial 
searches which so far have located 80 marijuana patches leading to 
the seizure of drugs with a street value of 4 million spokesman 
warren lawson said 
the governors proposal includes 
hiring of eight new prosecutors to work for the attorney general 
and help local prosecutors in drug cases 
hiring 10 new drug enforcement agents 
providing a hard suspension of driving privileges for those 
caught driving while using alcohol or drugs aides said that meant 
the elimination of probation and other options that allow continued 
driving 
beefing up treatment programs targeted at women the unemployed 
and youngsters 
providing funding to allow state troopers to train local police 
in drug education programs

the government announced tuesday it is 
tightening security following persistent news reports of imminent 
terrorist attacks on the mediterranean island 
an official announcement said a top level security conference 
presided over by interior minister christodoulos veniamin decided 
on taking a series of measures aimed at the further strengthening of 
internal security and preventing criminal activities in cyprus 
witnesses have reported more frequent foot and mobile patrols by 
paramilitary police at the islands two civil airports at larnaca 
on the south coast and at paphos on the west 
extra security also has been mounted at other sensitive spots 
including major foreign diplomatic missions 
the increased security also is believed to be linked to the 
transit through larnaca airport in the past week of several heads of 
state en route to the summit conference of the nonaligned movement 
in belgrade the same leaders will be passing through the airport on 
their way home at the end of the week 
the additional security follows two serious terrorist incidents 
on the island in the past two months 
six lebanese moslems armed with a shoulderfired antiaircraft 
missile launcher were arrested near larnaca airport in july they 
confessed they had arrived on the island to shoot down the 
helicopter of christian lebanese leader gen michel aoun who had 
been expected at the airport 
authorities fear that other lebanese terrorists may attempt an 
aircraft hijack or some other operation to demand the release of the 
six lebanese who are awaiting trial 
in the other incident late in august an iranian kurdish leader 
was shot to death and another iranian was critically wounded in 
larnaca by two unknown assailants 
it was the first such incident involving iranians on the island 
which has been frequently caught in the cross fire of middle east 
rivalries like the arabisraeli conflict or other interarab feuds

the court jester at the royal britain exhibition 
made unkind jokes about the royal family and the commercial museums 
managers not amused told him to stop or get the sack he was 
suspended tuesday 
kim keblewhite said james lovell a 24yearold actor could 
have his job back if he cut the offending material from his act 
lovell who traveled to and from work in tricorn hat bells and 
quartered red and green outfit was not available for comment after 
the announcement but said earlier tuesday he would not alter his 
performance 
in somewhat medieval syntax lovell said he realized his boss was 
irritated but lord fool him for being thus inflamed for i am the 
fool and therefore for him to get inflamed by my foolery makes him 
a fool for sure 
he is acting with artistic pique declared keblewhite 
marketing director of the exhibition who said the young jester had 
been doing a super job before turning his wit on contemporary 
targets 
keblewhite said some of lovells jokes are a little bit tacky 
and he doesnt know exactly where to draw the line 
for example what is small silent and lonely and lives in a 
stable captain phillips that is a jibe at shy horseloving mark 
phillips whose separation from his wife princess anne was 
announced last week 
a parody on the eccentricities of prince charles heir to the 
throne was another feature of lovells act for visitors to the 
exhibition on british royalty through the ages 
he did a threeminute monologue of charles talking to a 
sunflower it was inspired by the princes revelation some years 
back that he talked to his plants to encourage growth 
executives of unicorn heritage which owns royal britain say 
lovell was an excellent jester until pointing his japery beyond 
medieval royalty 
i said to james wed love you to carry on old chap but it 
must be jokes of the period keblewhite said in an interview 
i am nervous that some of the jokes could be offensive and we 
want to prevent people from coming here thinking we want to win some 
cheap laughs 
lovell responded ive been making a few little rudies they 
come out because im a spontaneous jester my liege i dont write 
my riddles down i suddenly think of something and if i think of 
fergie as a big red thing then thats alas what she is 
fergie is the nickname for the duchess of york whose hair is red 
and whose waistline is avidly watched by the tabloid press 
lovell worked as a clown and stage actor before taking the role 
of will somers court jester to henry viii jester in january 
he acknowledged on london broadcasting corp radio that his duty 
was to behave as a medieval clown but added i am a jester my 
liege and i a jester is licensed to say whatever i wish so if 
they dont like it they can right royally stuff it 
keblewhite said he had received no complaints from buckingham 
palace or the 500000 people who have visited the exhibition in 
londons financial district since it opened in august 1988 
in depicting british history through royalty the commercial 
museum features the lives of 52 kings and queens 
it has dummies in period dress and enlargements of contemporary 
newspaper front pages with stories on royalty visitors can vote on 
whether the press treats royals fairly and keblewhite said the 
tide is running against the press 
buckingham palace cooperated in setting up the exhibition he 
said so its important we not fall from grace through lovells 
antics

if tom wigle is the only person elected to 
village office this fall will he be a oneman government as a 
councilman will he be a quorum by himself 
could he elect himself council president allowing himself to 
become mayor 
state officials are trying to answer those questions since wigle 
was the only person to file a petition before the deadline as a 
candidate in the november elections in this northwest ohio village 
of 153 people no one is running for mayor or five of six council 
positions 
the ohio secretary of states office is searching state statutes 
in hopes of finding out whether one person can legally run the 
government and to establish a procedure for the village 
they may be breaking new ground steven fought spokesman for 
the secretary of states office said tuesday of the situation 
wigle who is running for reelection as councilman thinks a 
oneman government isnt such a bad idea his theory is that one 
person knowing what hes doing is better than seven who get nothing 
done 
ive often wondered why one person couldnt run this village 
with a lawyer and a bookkeeper he told the kenton times 
mayor susan mcclurg and two council members resigned earlier this 
year councilwoman pat mckee assumed the role of mayor leaving 
three council seats vacant making matters worse the positions of 
mayor and those held by the three remaining council members are up 
for reelection

a hearing in jim bakkers fraud trial will be 
held wednesday and the tv evangelist now in a prison hospital for 
psychiatric tests will be there an official in the us marshals 
office said today 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity would not say 
when bakker would be released from the federal prison at butner 
there was no immediate confirmation from bakkers lawyers who 
are under a gag order imposed by us district judge robert potter 
bakker is accused of fleecing followers of his ptl ministry and 
could receive up to 120 years in prison 
potter on thursday suspended bakkers trial in charlotte nc 
and sent him to a prison mental ward for tests thursday after 
bakkers psychiatrist testified he was hallucinating and cowering 
under a couch 
jurors were not told how long the trial would be delayed 
tammy bakker said in orlando fla today that her husband was 
so out of it when marshals came to take him to a mental ward 
that he thought he was going to an animal hospital 
but mrs bakker told viewers of the jim and tammy show that 
her husband wasnt mentally unstable 
after 2 years of sheer mental torture he just stressed out 
she said 
a crying mrs bakker said the judge flew into a rage when 
told bakker couldnt come to court last week and ordered federal 
marshals to seize him 
jims constitutional rights have been violated she said 
he has been treated like a carnival show 
she said us marshals wouldnt tell bakker where he was going 
and that he overheard them talk about butner and confused it with an 
animal hospital called butler 
jim was so out of it that he thought they were taking him to an 
animal hospital she said 
on sunday a minister told a gathering of bakkers followers that 
the evangelist has endured unfair treatment in the prison 
psychiatric wing including strip searches handcuffs and denial of 
toilet paper 
no matter what he has or has not done it is unfair to give him 
that type of treatment when he asked to go to the hospital the 
rev roy harthern told more than 100 people sunday in the bakkers 
orlando tv studio 
bryan bledsoe a spokesman at butner confirmed this morning that 
bakker had been handcuffed and strip searched but said he was given 
toilet paper 
that is standard operating procedure for that unit bledsoe 
said he said bakker was not given a pillow his first night there 
its standard in all these cases to first observe a person and 
observe his condition before giving them something they may hurt 
themselves with he said 
dr basil jackson bakkers psychiatrist said monday that he was 
told butner officials had stepped up their evaluation of bakker 
if thats true then its conceivable one of their people could 
come back into court tuesday or wednesday to certify that hes ready 
to come back into trial he said 
prison officials said last week that because bakker had not been 
convicted of a crime he would have the run of the prison grounds 
and wear his own clothes

what makes it hard to win a war on drugs is 
that those who use them like them or need them and are willing 
to go to criminal lengths to get them 
they just wont say no they dont want to be foot soldiers in 
the home front battles of a war that cant seem to be won at the 
borders 
thats what george bush confronts as the country turns with him 
to the conclusion that the drug problem wont be solved as long as 
people want drugs and will kill for them and die for them 
cocaine enters the country purer cheaper more plentiful and 
more in demand than ever even after decades of presidential 
declarations of war 
john f kennedy called a white house conference on drug abuse in 
1963 richard m nixon ordered a concentrated assault on the 
streetlevel heroin pusher in 1972 and ronald reagan said now 
were in another war for freedom in a television speech on drugs 
in 1986 
a few new things are working for this president as he summons the 
country to battle again events may be creating the kind of iron 
consensus that could in the past build battleships overnight and 
right old wrongs 
the drug deaths of actor john belushi and basketball star len 
bias shook their fans the disgrace of douglas h ginsburg 
distinguished lawyer professor and judge his supreme court 
nomination withdrawn following the disclosure that he had used 
marijuana had a sobering message for middleclass mortgageowning 
americans 
the polls show it drugs are going out of middleclass fashion 
cocaine was once considered glamorous and safe three years 
before becoming jimmy carters drug policy adviser dr peter bourne 
could say that cocaine was probably the most benign of illicit 
drugs currently in widespread use 
a new government survey finds a 37 percent decrease since 1985 in 
the number of people who said yes when asked if they had used 
marijuana cocaine or other illicit drugs in the previous month 
a survey of college students found only 6 percent acknowledged 
occasional use of cocaine in 1988 almost half the level from 
the previous year 
a gallup poll announced from the bully pulpit of the white house 
last month finds 27 percent of adults consider drugs the most 
severe problem facing the country worse than the threats of 
recession war or pollution 
playing into bushs hands too are startling events in colombia 
president virgilio barco vargas facing a fierce blast of total 
war declared by his countrys drug lords looked into the 
television cameras last week and addressed americans with an appeal 
from the weak to the strong 
he asked this country to give up drugs 
he said he couldnt save his country unless americans stopped 
buying its most important export 
what might seem to be a matter of purely personal habit has had 
explosive public consequences the besieged president said it 
has thrown us all into a war we did not ask for 
antidrug america may be in a mood to get tougher but not 
tenderer the country could be willing to hire more police build 
more prisons send more aid to the drugsource countries impose 
tougher sentences 
a benevolent country might even ante up the cost of treatment 
programs for the afflicted one recent analysis puts the number who 
could benefit from drugabuse treatment at 65 million and the 
number of slots for them at 250000 
but the experts say more is needed it is familiar turf get to 
the root causes combat crumbling housing joblessness schools that 
dont work dropout rates teen pregnancies poverty racism and 
hopelessness 
that doesnt look like an antidrug agenda theres not much sign 
the country is willing to accept it as one or pay for it 
if drugs become isolated as a problem of the inner city separate 
from a middleclass white society that finally came around to saying 
no thats going to be especially true

a subway train was mistakenly routed tuesday 
through an offlimits zone contaminated with asbestos but 
authorities said the 1000 passengers were not endangered by the 
hazardous substance 
up above on midtown manhattans eighth avenue meanwhile some 
automobile traffic resumed tuesday morning while workmen continued 
repairing the broken water main that caused the weekend asbestos 
emergency 
water from the break which occurred early sunday had flushed 
through the subway tunnels and carried with it asbestos insulation 
from nearby consolidated edison steam pipes 
the northbound avenue had been closed from 44th to 52nd streets 
while contractors and city employees purged it of asbestos 
the subway misadventure occurred at 7 am tuesday the start of 
the morning rush hour when a transit authority tower operator 
failed to switch a southbound train from its normal route under 
eighth avenue over to the tracks of the sixth avenue line after it 
passed 59th street 
the motorman found himself on tracks without power but because 
the tunnel south of 59th street is downhill was able to coast to 
42nd street said ta spokesman bob slovak 
the riders were evacuated at the closed 42nd street station that 
station had not yet been cleaned up slovak said but it was safe 
because the asbestos is still on the track still wet so there 
are no airborne particles yet 
inhaled particles of asbestos may cause cancer 
it took two days of intensive cleaning to clear asbestos from a 
halfmile of the surface of eighth avenue it could take that much 
time or longer just to get bids and plans from contractors to clean 
the train tunnel and stations said deputy mayor robert esnard 
con edison which had to turn off steam service because of the 
flooding said eight of 20 steam customers in the area got their 
power back at 3 am tuesday one of the restored customers was st 
clares hospital which had lost its hot water 
it is not yet possible to estimate the cleanup cost city and con 
ed spokesmen have said 
a con edison steam line on east 20th street in southern manhattan 
ruptured aug 19 killing three people and contaminating gramercy 
park apartment buildings with a mudandasbestos bath 
with no probable completion date in sight the cleanup bill for 
gramercy park already has risen into the millions of dollars for con 
edison spokesman martin gitten said the utility faces claims for 
damage and temporary housing from some 500 area residents who had to 
leave their homes

an aircraft mechanic tuesday stole an f16 
jet fighter he was untrained to fly and crashed it into a vacant 
farm minutes after taking off from an air base the military said 
he was missing and believed dead 
the aircraft exploded in the crash engulfing a farm building in 
a fireball said lt col svein fredriksen of norways oerland air 
force base from where the plane was taken there was no reports of 
injuries to anyone on the ground 
rescue helicopters found no sign the belgian mechanic ejected 
but search crews found no trace of him at the crash site fredriksen 
said the identity of the mechanic was being withheld until his 
remains were found and his family notified the officer said 
it was not clear if the mechanic accidentally or intentionally 
crashed 
fredriksen said the jet motor specialist plunged to the ground in 
the singleseat belgian plane nine miles from the coastal oerland 
base west of the city of trondheim 
the impact point is nothing but a hole in the ground we are 
looking for physical evidence that he was actually in the plane 
there is nothing left said air force major amund sveen 
the mechanic was taking a training course for nato f16 crews 
from norway denmark belgium and the netherlands fredriksen said 
the technician did not have permission or training to fly the 
f16 you could say he stole it we dont know if he had any other 
kind of flight training said fredriksen 
we have no idea what he was up to an aircraft mechanic is not 
trained as a pilot and cant control one of these fighters they 
know how to start the motors to check them and can maybe even taxi 
but they dont have a chance after takeoff said fredriksen 
sveen said the mechanic had taxied the jet onto the runway taken 
off and managed to reach about 2000 feet of elevation before 
crashing 
he said fighter pilot training lasts more than two years and that 
it is madness for untrained personnel to try flying an f16 
the technician had no contact with the control tower and was 
wearing improper equipment a defense spokesman told the norwegian 
news agency ntb 
a team of 10 belgian military investigators were on their way to 
the accident site they were to investigate with norwegian 
officials sveen said

leftist guerrillas and 
government forces battled in a northeastern province tuesday 
leaving at least 16 soldiers dead in one of the civil wars fiercest 
battles in more than two years 
armed forces spokesmen reported the deaths of the soldiers after 
the predawn fighting outside chilanga in morazan province in an 
official statement they said the rebels also suffered numerous 
casualties but gave no number 
the official death toll was the highest since the armed forces 
acknowledged 69 soldiers killed in a guerrilla attack march 31 
1987 on the 4th army brigade headquarters in the northern province 
of chalatenango 
the rebels on their clandestine radio venceremos said tuesday 
their forces inflicted 25 casualties including dead and wounded on 
government forces outside chilanga 
however the military said the government forces suffered six 
wounded for a total of 22 casualties in three hours of fighting 
the nearly decadeold civil war has killed an estimated 70000 
people 
the rightist government of president alfredo cristiani who took 
office june 1 says it wants to talk with the rebels about ending 
the war the guerrillas also say they want peace talks but the 
mechanism and agenda for such dialogue has yet to be worked out 
also tuesday an antitank rocket smashed into the headquarters 
of a leftist labor federation before dawn the missile damaged the 
facade of the san salvador headquarters of the group known as 
fenastras but it caused no casualties 
gerardo diaz the groups secretary general blamed the armed 
forces for the attack 
this is a provocation that is part of a generalized campaign 
against the organized labor movement he said 
the government and armed forces consider fenastras and several 
other leftofcenter unions peasant groups and human rights 
organizations to be guerrilla fronts

hundreds of thousands of blacks 
angered at being shut out of national elections walked off their 
jobs tuesday the biggest show of defiance in a monthlong campaign 
to discredit the balloting 
the national party despite gains made by white leftist and 
rightist forces expects to retain power in wednesdays 
parliamentary voting but it probably will suffer its biggest losses 
since coming to power 41 years ago 
hundreds rallied at universities and barricaded streets with 
flaming tires around the country to protest the elections and 
police arrested 500 people witnesses said police used tear gas 
whips rubber bullets and birdshot to break up demonstrations 
the protests were the latest in a mass campaign launched a month 
ago to defy apartheid laws that segregate the society and to protest 
the elections that exclude the countrys 28 million blacks 
the elections are addressing irrelevancies said titus 
mafolo a leader of the defiance campaign once more the ruling 
bloc is going to elections and the main concern is the 
protection of white affluence and privilege 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said we condemn south africas system of racial segregation and 
urge the south african government to permit peaceful expression of 
political dissent 
more than 3 million of the countrys 5 million whites have 
registered to vote as well as 17 million mixedrace people and 
665000 indians some black leaders have called for boycotts of the 
mixedrace and indian voting because their respective houses have no 
power to overrule the white chamber of parliament 
for the first time since 1953 political analysts predict the 
nationalists could receive less than half the white vote 
the party currently has 123 seats in the 166seat white house of 
assembly 
the extent of their loss and the relative gains made by the 
rightwing conservatives and the antiapartheid democrats will 
affect the governments pace of reform during the next five years 
it is widely acknowledged that the general election is the most 
crucial in the recent history of south africa governmentrun 
radio said tuesday the changes that await south africans will be 
fundamental and perhaps decisive for the course of events in future 
generations 
national party leader fw de klerk who became acting president 
in the midst of the campaign when the cabinet forced president pw 
botha to retire aug 14 has campaigned as a new leader with a new 
vision 
our generations greatest test has come de klerk said in his 
final campaign speech monday 
our action lays the basis for a new south africa in which all 
can achieve their rights without domination or injustice he said 
the nationalists campaign manifesto calls for negotiations with 
black leaders on a new constitution and government providing 
limited black participation in national affairs within five years 
but with protection against loss of white power 
the national party concedes its policies could lose it up to 32 
parliamentary seats chiefly to the conservative party the 
conservative party currently has 22 seats and the democrats have 20 
one seat belongs to the defunct new republic party 
the conservatives say negotiation with blacks will lead 
inevitably to black majority rule with whites being dominated they 
call for complete separation of the races into different nations 
within south african territory 
the democratic party expected to finished third wants apartheid 
laws scrapped immediately 
although the democrats do not expect to win coleader denis 
worrall said a good performance by the democratic party will 
boost international confidence in the country and send a message 
to our fellow black south africans 
organizers said tuesdays general strike most effective among 
black students and union members in the port cities of cape town 
durban and east london would expand wednesday 
in durban on the indian ocean some industries reported all 
black workers stayed home tuesday the giant putco bus company said 
it experienced a total strike of black staff and passengers in 
durban and other parts of natal province 
commuter trains from the outlying townships into cape town and 
johannesburg carried about 60 percent to 75 percent of their normal 
passenger loads transportation officials said police said there 
was a 25 percent absentee rate in mostly rural orange free state 
the national union of mineworkers the countrys largest union 
said 78000 members at 16 mines refused to work tuesday morning 
police used whips and dogs to break up a demonstration by 700 
people at the university of stellenbosch alma mater of many 
government leaders thirty students were arrested and several people 
beaten human rights lawyers said 
youths set tires ablaze to block streets in townships outside 
durban and in soweto police said they used rubber bullets birdshot 
and tear gas against stonethrowers in durban and cape town they 
said one black youth was injured by birdshot and arrested 
at the multiracial university of natal in pietermaritzburg 
police arrested about 300 participants at an antielection 
demonstration including students administrators and franciscan 
monks

they cannot understand why such protest is occurring said colin 
webb the white vice principal of the university 
about 500 sloganchanting activists in lenasia an indian 
community near johannesburg burned effigies of de klerk and the

all 26790 new york city police officers will be 
subject to random drug testing the police commissioner announced 
tuesday 
the goal of random testing is to have a drug free 
environment commissioner benjamin ward said in a statement i 
believe that this expanded drug testing program will further promote 
that environment and provide a deterrent to the use of illegal 
drugs 
the new policy excludes civilian employees of the police 
department the department now requires random drug tests only of 
the 2000 officers in the narcotics division applicants for the 
detective division and the organized crime control bureau are also 
tested but not at random 
other officers can be tested based on administrative or medical 
cause 
under the new program all officers social security numbers will 
be entered into a computer which will select some at random for 
each test the officers chosen will have 24 hours notice of the test 
ward who was in washington was not available to comment on the 
policy change 
phil caruso head of the patrolmens benevolent association 
which represents police officers was also not immediately available 
for comment spokesman joe mancini said 
during 1988 3946 police officers were tested with 37 officers 
testing positive this year through july 2220 police officers 
were tested with 23 testing positive 
random drug tests are also required of candidates for police 
officer as well as police recruits at the police academy and at the 
completion of their probationary period 
it is expected that additional staffing will be necessary to 
administer the program and the lab costs of the drug testing are 
estimated at 31000 per year

marine experts were making an artificial 
nurser tuesday to feed a baby whale that washed up on a beach over 
the weekend 
the 900pound sperm whale was not getting any worse but not 
getting any better said cheryl snyder senior trainer at 
seaarama marineworld hes holding his own 
the whale estimated to be no more than 2 weeks old was found 
ashore saturday on the bolivar peninsula when volunteers from the 
texas mammal stranding network couldnt find his mother the 12foot 
whale was hoisted onto a flatbed truck smeared with zinc oxide 
sunscreen wet down and brought to the marine park 
park personnel after consulting experts from other marine parks 
around the country were devising an artificial nurser to feed the 
whale 
its not yet put together but it will be a collapsible bottle 
with a nipple set up and a pump to force the milk out according 
to seaarama spokeswoman christy benson the plastic device is 
modeled after an apparatus used at marineland of california 
the whale dubbed odie has been fed formula every four hours 
since monday night via a stomach feeding tube officials were 
optimistic the whale would take to the nurser 
were getting a very strong suckling reponse snyder said 
hes sucking hands or anything that comes in his mouth 
snyder cautioned however that survival statistics for a 
stranded whale were very low 
a sperm whale will nurse for six months after birth the formula 
odie is being fed is made from a milk powder that contains no 
lactose which marine mammals are not capable of digesting 
if odie survives he will be released when he begins feeding on 
whole foods which would not be for several months by then he 
likely would double in size 
the whale is being kept in a tank in three to four feet of water 
hes able to float and hold himself in the water ms snyder 
said his equilibrium is off volunteers are in the water with him 
24 hours a day they gently hold on to him to keep his blow hole 
above water 
the discovery of a whale on the texas coast is quite rare since 
1984 only two whales have been found both died

a judge rejected a mistrial motion by richard 
ramirezs lawyers tuesday while the jury in his night stalker 
murder trial began its 13th day of deliberations on 43 charges 
superior court judge michael tynan also denied a motion to 
disqualify jurors for allegedly disobeying court instructions 
attorneys for ramirez claimed the panelists were obviously 
watching tv or reading news accounts when one juror was murdered 
last month several arrived at the courthouse in tears the defense 
said this showed they had disobeyed an order to avoid exposure to 
publicity 
attorneys also claimed that the murder prejudiced jurors and made 
their deliberations unfair to the defendant 
tynan ruled on the written motions without hearing arguments 
ramirez 29 a drifter from el paso texas who is accused of 
being the devilworshiping night stalker made a brief court 
appearance to acknowledge he did not want to attend the court 
session he answered yes when asked whether he understood his 
right to be there then signed a waiver of his presence 
tynan said the jury which began its deliberations anew after the 
panel member died has asked to review videotape evidence in the 
case on wednesday he said he would send a video player into their 
jury room 
the tapes in evidence show a police lineup in which victims 
identified ramirez as the attacker who murdered raped and robbed 
victims in a string of nighttime attacks during the summer of 1985 
defense attorneys have claimed that witnesses were coached to 
pick ramirez out they contend he is a victim of mistaken 
identifications 
the prosecution has said the evidence linking ramirez to the 
terrifying attacks is overwhelming 
the jury had already deliberated 13 days when it was required to 
restart its talks on aug 11 because one juror had been sleeping and 
was dismissed 
they had barely begun when word came on aug 14 that juror 
phyllis singletary was found beaten and shot to death her boyfriend 
later took his own life he left a note saying he killed her in a 
domestic argument 
after a recess for jurors to recover from the shock an alternate 
was sent in and the panel began talking again aug 16

east germans who had hoped to go west 
legally said tuesday they make risk an illegal dash across the 
border unless red tape that has stranded them in makeshift refugee 
camps is unraveled soon 
the mood in the five camps housing about 5000 east germans in 
budapest and on the shores of lake balaton grew somber even 
desperate after hungarian officials said it might be weeks before 
they can move legally to west germany 
when are you going back to austria an east german woman in 
her 30s asked a reporter near the csilleberc refugee camp in 
budapest i havent tried crossing over on my own but if the 
standoff continues much longer i might just ask you to take me with 
you and drop me off near the border 
she added im serious 
those who are caught could end up with a stamp on their papers 
showing they tried an illegal escape exposing them to punishment on 
return to their hardline communist homeland 
about 30 east germans in one budapest camp announced they would 
start a hunger strike friday if not given permission to cross the 
border 
the situation is desperate a 23yearold identifying himself 
only as rene told reporters outside budapests zugliget refugee camp 
we wanted to start fasting two weeks ago but we didnt because 
we didnt want to hurt the hungarians he said adding that now 
some east germans feel they have no choice but to protest 
last week west german and austrian officials suggested hungarian 
authorities would allow the east germans to leave by the end of that 
week they would have been received at the hungarianaustrian border 
and transported to west germany 
however disillusionment flooded the camps monday when interior 
minister istvan horvath was quoted by the west german weekly stern 
as saying it might be weeks before bonn and east berlin resolved the 
refugee crisis 
on tuesday senior foreign ministry official ferenc somogy of 
hungary reiterated that a final solution could take days even 
weeks 
hungary and east germany are allies in the sovietled warsaw pact 
alliance however reformminded communist authorities in hungary 
began removing barriers on their border with austria in may and 
created a crush of east german refugees trying to cross to the west 
about 6000 east germans have rushed across the border since 
then the wave of escapes peaked in late august but it has dwindled 
to a trickle since hungary stepped up border patrols 
east germans by the hundreds also gathered this summer to demand 
asylum at west german diplomatic buildings in budapest east berlin 
and prague czechoslovakia 
some say they are fleeing the rigid communist system in their 
homeland and others are seeking economic opportunity 
under a 1969 agreement with east berlin hungary is obliged to 
send home any east germans who try to escape however budapests 
reformist government seems willing to break that accord in a new 
commitment to human rights 
west german chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff rudolf 
seiters was quoted in an interview tuesday as saying it was 
hungarys duty to allow the refugees to leave 
however west german government and red cross officials said they 
had no information on when hungary might let the refugees depart 
the hungarian attempt to win at least grudging acceptance from 
east germany seems to have delayed if not blocked the exodus 
east germany wants to win back some of the thousands of mostly 
young skilled workers who are turning their back on their homeland 
despite the delays most of the east germans seemed determined 
tuesday to wait it out 
no way we are going back no way said a 31yearold east 
german playing with his 6yearold son behind the iron fence topped 
with barbed wire at csilleberc the largest budapest camp 
better dead than red he said but even better out of here 
as soon as possible

president hosni mubarak president of the organization of african 
unity to mediate the conflict he will visit both countries 
beginning wednesday with a stop in nouakchott mauritanias capital 
mubarak has his hands full when senegal and mauritania broke 
diplomatic relations aug 22 foreign minister ibrahim fall of 
senegal said the situation constitutes a threat to peace in the 
entire region 
fall said senegal was ready to use all means to defend its 
territorial integrity its sovereignty and its independence but 
senegal has denied mauritanian charges that it was massing troops at 
the border for a military offensive 
information minister mohamed lemine ould ahmed of mauritania said 
in a recent interview that the dispute stems from a senegalese 
plot to dominate mauritania however he did not provide proof 
farmers from senegal and nomadic herdsmen from mauritania have 
clashed for centuries 
the latest trouble began in april when a herd of goats strayed 
across the illdefined border farmers and herdsmen fought over the 
goats and two senegalese were killed 
tempers exploded in both countries in the snowballing conflict 
hundreds of people were murdered in riots in nouakchott senegals 
capital of dakar and other cities 
in addition thousands of mauritanian and senegalese expatriates 
were forced to flee about 200000 refugees are now living in camps 
on both sides of the border 
blaise cherif of the office of the un high commissioner for 
refugees said it was the first time his office has had to cope with 
such a massive influx of refugees anywhere in west africa 
the conflict has pitted mainly arabicspeaking mauritanian moors 
against largely frenchspeaking senegalese blacks about a third of 
mauritanias 17 million people are black but not all the blacks 
attacked by mobs in this country have been of senegalese origin 
president abdou diouf of senegal has said the cause of the 
trouble is the determination of mauritanias moorish majority to 
arabize their country most blacks in mauritania do not speak 
arabic and many blacks accuse the government of racism 
the dispute is complicated by the changing course of the senegal 
river has divided the two lands since france ruled them both 
mauritania says the border lies in the middle of the river 
however when the river floods its shore moves north by 20 to 30 
miles over a 580mile stretch about 18000 square miles of fertile 
land thus remain in dispute

argentina wants britain to make major troop 
reductions in the falkland islands as part of an agreement to 
normalize relations senate president eduardo menem of argentina 
said tuesday 
menem brother of president carlos menem also told a news 
conference he believes negotiations in madrid next month will lead 
britain and argentina to restore diplomatic relations 
diplomatic ties were severed during the 1982 falkland islands 
war when britain drove argentine invaders from the south atlantic 
archipelago 
demilitarization means only one thing menem said of 
course it is a reduction of forces in the area i think there is a 
consensus for making the south atlantic an area of peace 
menem was in london for a meeting of the interparliamentary 
union a 108nation conference of legislators he shook hands and 
chatted with queen elizabeth ii on monday when she opened the 
meeting 
since taking office two months ago his brother has initiated 
peace overtures toward britain including ending an economic embargo 
this week 
britain maintains a military garrison in the islands as well as 
fighter aircraft and rapier missiles to guard the 1600 british 
inhabitants 
the defense ministry refused tuesday to give the current strength 
of the garrison british newspapers say it is down to about 1000 
troops about onefourth the earlier size because britain is 
confident argentina will not attack again 
the madrid talks are expected to focus on fishing rights and 
restoring air links between argentina and the islands 
many observers believe argentina wants to patch up the 
differences because britain is a key member of the european economic 
community the 12nation community is due to drop remaining trade 
barriers and become a single market in 1992 
senator menen said argentina never put economic considerations 
in the forefront in our consideration of this subject he added 
but if through this we manage to establish good commercial 
relations then be it welcome

president bush in what he previewed as a 
hearttoheart talk with the american people tonight will urge 
a crackdown on illegal drug users and declare a 79 billion war on 
drugs 
the white house this afternoon released bushs national antidrug 
strategy disclosing plans to increase this years authorization by 
22 billion or 39 percent to reach the 79 billion 
the plan would authorize 16 billion for corrections 449 for 
interdiction on the international level including some 260 for 
military aid to the drugproduction countries of peru bolivia and 
colombia 350 million for state and local law enforcement 250 
million for expanding the court system 31 billion for other law 
enforcement 12 billion for prevention and education and 925 
million for treatment 
officials have not said where bush will siphon off money from an 
already squeezed federal budget to pay for his war on drugs 
house speaker thomas foley dwash after meeting today with 
bush said the president revealed that 720 million would be 
funnelled from other programs to pay for part of the drug package 
sources have said the funds will come from various categories in 
next years budget rather than cutting back in one or two places 
theres no question but that drugs are the quicksand of our 
entire society theyre suffocating individuals and families and 
institutions as well and all americans must pull together to solve 
this problem bush said at the outset of a cabinet meeting today 
bush will talk about the war on drugs tonight in his first prime 
time televised address to the nation as president scheduled for 9 
pm edt 
my speech will be the basis of a hearttoheart talk with the 
american people he said today 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said it would be a 
personal message from himself to the american people that talks 
about the collective need of society to pull together to solve this 
problem 
in what the white house billed as a practice session this morning 
for a 22minute speech the president quipped to photographers that 
i have it memorized i dont need teleprompters 
bush will talk considerably about users and the need to crack 
down on them and who they are and why this is such a pervasive 
problem in our society fitzwater said monday 
the president discussed his drug plan with cabinet members and 
members of congress and was joining drug policy chief william 
bennett in a meeting with groups involved in fighting drugs 
including law enforcement education and rehabilitation experts 
just back from a threeweek vacation in kennebunkport maine 
bush rehearsed his speech monday afternoon and went over lastminute 
refinements of the text he got tips on delivery and style from his 
campaign media adviser roger ailes 
all four major television networks abc cbs nbc and cnn plan 
to broadcast the speech which will be carried from the oval office 
the speech will outline the national drug strategy put together 
over several months by bennett with assistance from advisers across 
the government the strategy has been billed as a coordinated effort 
to link the drugfighting programs by various government agencies in 
a more cohesive way than has been seen in the past 
bushs package for 1990 will be close to 2 billion above the 
current antidrug spending levels 
in his televised address the president will dwell more on a 
general outline of his strategy than on its cost specifics the 
white house planned to release those figures to the media today 
bush will urge americans to think about what drugs are doing to 
our society and the many ramifications that they have for other 
social programs such as housing medical care and education 
fitzwater said 
fitzwater said the speech would be an expression of the 
magnitude of the problem what it takes to deal with it what can we 
expect how long it will take 
among the details that have emerged is that bush will earmark 
some 260 million in economic and military aid to the three main 
cocaine producers colombia bolivia and peru the final figure 
could go higher administration sources have said 
bush already is sending 65 million worth of helicopters and 
military aid to colombia to help president virgilio barco wage his 
war against the powerful drug lords 
bush would like to send us troops to join the crackdown 
according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity but 
barco has said he does not want such intervention from the united 
states 
bushs chief of staff john sununu hinted strongly sunday that 
bush would dispatch the troops if barco asked 
if that request ever came in im sure the president would 
recognize that the american public thinks that the drug problem is 
so tough and so important that there is a great feeling among 
american citizens that we probably should take even that risk 
sununu said in a cbs television interview 
the administration says the antidrug plan will focus mostly on 
the domestic front however 
it is expected to impose tougher penalties on drug users pour 
more money into treatment for addicts and give more money to state 
and local law enforcement efforts 
bennett whose job was created by order of congress said casual 
drug users will be targeted with calls for more arrests seizures of 
personal property and more widespread drug testing 
one idea that bush decided against according to sources was 
withholding federal highway funds or other federal money from states 
that did not enact tough enough laws such as revoking the drivers 
licenses of convicted drug offenders

president bush missed the boat on deficit 
reduction in the early days of his administration and will have to 
act quickly to increase revenues and make deep cuts in social 
programs if he is to make the government solvent alexander m haig 
jr said in an interview released tuesday 
haig former secretary of state in the reagan administration and 
a contender for the republican presidential nomination in 1988 told 
penthouse magazine he hopes to be campaigning for bush for a second 
term in 1992 
in the interview to be published in the magazines october 
issue haig responded to a question about domestic policy by saying 
that the most important thing is the deficit 
i think mr bush missed the boat he said it was probably 
his worst mistake in the early days of the administration 
haig said he believed bush made a conscious decision to avoid 
biting the necessary bullet on the deficit in order to try to 
structure a bipartisan coalition for the major issues facing our 
country 
he said recent events including ethical extremism in congress 
have derailed the coalition and will continue to do so so he has 
now run out of time for negotiations on the 1990 budget 
he is faced with the imperative of putting in place a credible 
fiveyear program to bring the united states to solvency he said 
now thats going to require some additional revenue but remember 
the read my lips problem 
bush repeatedly used the phrase read my lips during the 
campaign to emphasize his commitment not to raise taxes 
in addition said haig a deficitreduction program will 
require a very austere approach to some of the social programs 
including the socalled fencedoff areas indexing of social 
security perhaps 
these are very difficult steps for any president who wants a 
second term to take haig said if he had done it in the first 
six months the consequences of it could have been behind him he 
could still do it at the end of 1989 if he waits any longer than 
that it would be asking a politican to do something which 
politicians are simply unable to do and that is commit political 
suicide 
haig was asked whether he might be interested in the presidency 
in 1992 if bush for any reason did not run 
i doubt it he said 
asked if that meant another bid for the white house was out of 
the question he said yep im a republican i hope ill be 
campaigning for george bushs second term in 1992

solidarity leaders said the foreign and 
transport ministeries both sought by the communists remained under 
discussion but that prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis cabinet list 
should be complete wednesday 
as the makeup is described by various sources solidarity would 
hold the most portfolios followed by the communists and the united 
peasant party and democratic party 
bronislaw geremek solidarity leader in parliament said the 
solidarity caucus would meet with mazowiecki on thursday and the 
final list of cabinet nominees would be presented to mikolaj 
kozakiewicz speaker of the parliament or sejm 
in an interview with the state news agency pap kozakiewicz said 
the sejm was scheduled to meet sept 12 to vote on the cabinet 
kozakiewicz said hearings by parliamentary commissions on the 
nominees would start friday and last three days i hope that no 
complications will surface he said 
sixteen government ministries are to be filled but the number 
could change if mazowiecki decides to combine or split up 
departments 
mazowiecki a solidarity newspaper editor elected prime minister 
aug 24 met with leaders of the peasant party democratic party on 
tuesday 
jerzy jozwiak leader of the democratic party told pap after the 
meeting that his party would receive four posts a deputy prime 
minister domestic trade the office for scientifictechnological 
progress and a ministry yet to be decided 
asked if his party was satisfied jozwiak replied the number 
yes the arrangement not much he did not elaborate 
peasant party leader roman malinowski and the partys 
parliamentary leader aleksander bentkowski met with mazowiecki 
bentkowski said later the party would receive five posts to be held 
by four people a deputy prime minister and the ministries of 
agriculture environment health and justice the deputy prime 
minister also would be the agriculture minister he said 
bentkowski said he was satisfied because we received what the 
prime minister promised to us earlier 
geremek said not only ministries are being balanced by 
negotiations but in some cases subordinate positions in ministries 
for instance geremek said if the communists get the foreign 
minister the undersecretary of the ministry would be someone from 
solidarity 
the communists have pressed for foreign minister tadeusz 
olechowski the incumbent to be retained 
geremek said the ministry overseeing state broadcasting probably 
would be controlled by solidarity 
radio and television should not be a party man and he probably 
will have a staff composed of representatives of different political 
orientations geremek said we want the television to be 
pluralistic 
the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza quoted communist 
central committee secretary slawomir wiatr on tuesday as saying the 
party expects five ministries 
in addition to the defense and interior ministries originally 
promised the communists wiatr said the party expected foreign 
affairs culture and transportation the communists have threatened 
to oppose mazowiecki if they are not satisfied with the makeup of 
his government 
solidarity activists believe an aggressive stance by the party 
would hurt mazowieckis government as it seeks to carry out painful 
economic reforms 
solidarity leader lech walesa said monday poland belongs to 
everybody if poland is to be reformed then communists have 
to enter the government as reformers and not as party members they 
should think about poland and reform and not about the number of 
seats that fall to them

the communist party chief of azerbaijan has called 
for an end to direct rule from moscow in the republics troubled 
nagornokarabakh region which neighboring armenia also claims an 
activist said tuesday 
sources in azerbaijan and moldavia said strikes spawned by 
disputes between rival ethnic groups in the two southern republics 
spread to more factories and businesses 
aiden amirbekov the azerbaijani activist quoted party leader 
abdulrakhman vezirov as saying in the television interview at 
midnight monday we must liquidate the special form of 
administration 
taking that position would align the communist leader of the 
caucasus republic against the kremlin on the issue and with the 
peoples front political movement which organized the general 
strike that began monday 
vezirov and other azerbaijani leaders refuse to recognize the 
peoples front which called the strike to demand that the 
republics national legislators be recalled and that it reassert 
control over nagornokarabakh 
amirbekov quoted vezirov as saying nothing had been accomplished 
by the direct rule of kremlin representative arkady volsky imposed 
jan 12 in an effort to stop violence between ethnic azerbaijanis 
and armenians in nagornokarabakh 
krasnaya zvezda the defense ministry newspaper said sunday the 
disputed territory was on the verge of civil war and tensions 
between azerbaijanis and armenians are like gunpowder 
in a 20minute television interview vezirov also criticized the 
strike as damaging to azerbaijan and its relationship with other 
republics amirbekov said 
amirbekov said vezirovs comments would be discussed at a 
peoples front rally wednesday evening 
javad salamov a strike committee member claimed tuesday that 95 
percent of bakus factories were closed but a journalist at the 
republics official news agency said the number was far lower 
salamov claimed public transport was halted in baku the 
provincial capital and newspapers were not delivered 
strikers are demanding full political sovereignty for 
azerbaijan which means they dont want to secede from the soviet 
union but ought to have the right to make political decisions about 
its territory he said 
an editor at the official news agency azerinform who would not 
give his name said 95 percent is a big overstatement 
some factories were closed and others partially shut he said 
while some shops are closed but not ones selling food he 
described public transport as unreliable but said the subway 
was operating oil refineries and power plants were functioning and 
the railroad was running 
tass the official national news agency said a strike by 
transport workers in baku was slowing travelers going to work and 
shipment of finished oil products 
about 100 people have been reported killed in a the dispute that 
began 18 months ago over nagornokarabakh a mountain enclave whose 
population is 75 percent ethnic armenian but was assigned to 
azerbaijan in 1923 
hundreds of thousands fled their homes and the kremlin assumed 
direct rule in january 
most azerbaijanis have left armenianpopulated areas in 
nagornokarabakh the azerinform editor said in a telephone 
interview more and more armenians are leaving their homes in the 
rest of the republic especially baku

sir ronald syme an oxford historian who shook the 
dust from the study of ancient rome with his theories about the 
intrigues of its nobles has died at age 86 the university said 
tuesday 
syme died monday at an oxford hospital he entered last week said 
dr martin francis secretary of the governing body of oxfords 
wolfson college where syme had lived since 1975 the hospital did 
not give the cause of death 
he was probably the most eminent classicist of this century 
francis told the associated press 
his grasp of the language and concepts used in roman society 
combined with his sense of style has made him the foremost scholar 
of roman historiography kirsti simonsuuri senior research fellow 
at the university of helsinki wrote in a 1983 anthology of modern 
thinkers 
instead of focusing on the ideals and constitutional structure of 
the roman emperors as his predecessors had syme disclosed the lust 
for power and money that motivated their careers comparing them to 
european dictators in the 1930s 
he introduced the theories in his first and most famous book 
the roman revolution published sept 7 1939 
we were about to have a party to celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of the publication next thursday said francis who described syme 
as an upright courageous totally dedicated man 
syme was knighted in 1959 in 1976 he was awarded the order of 
merit britains most desired civil distinction which is limited to 
24 intellectuals and scientists 
born march 11 1903 in new zealand syme studied classics at 
oxford in the 1920s 
he worked for the british government during world war ii in 
embassies in yugoslavia and turkey then taught classical philology 
at the university of istanbul syme pioneered a method of historical 
research that involved studying the backgrounds of groups of 
influential people 
as part of his work syme held that the roman republic was 
transformed into an empire partly because of struggles between 
political factions surrounding the emperor augustus who died in the 
year 14 
although he retired in 1970 after 21 years as oxfords camden 
professor of ancient history syme continued to work until his 
death francis said 
his last book the augustan aristocracy was published in 
1986 of his later works a twovolume study of the emperor tacitus 
published in 1958 was generally seen as his masterpiece 
syme a bachelor was not known to have any immediate survivors

the united states and other foreign nations have 
rejected israels appeal for aid to improve conditions at 
palestinian refugee camps calling first for progress in the middle 
east peace process officials said tuesday 
in a letter this week to prime minister yitzhak shamir president 
bush turned down israels request for help to rehabilitate camps in 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip according to yossi 
ahimeir shamirs spokesman 
he said japan canada and european nations also rejected the 
request 
the maariv newspaper reported that in his letter bush said the 
refugee camps should be part of a comprehensive plan to resolve 
the conflict between israel and arab states 
finance minister shimon peres denounced shamirs appeal israel 
radio quoted him as saying the move was folly lacking elementary 
reasoning 
the national news agency itim reported that peres speaking at a 
histadrut labor federation meeting tuesday night said the first way 
to aid the palestinian refugees in the camps is for israel to get 
out of there 
peres leader of the socialist labor party has accepted the 
principle of trading land occupied by israel for peace with its arab 
neighbors 
shamirs conservative likud bloc which shares power with labor 
in a coalition government opposes any territorial concessions 
the issue concerns more than 2 million palestinians who were 
uprooted with the founding of the state of israel in 1948 and during 
subsequent arabisraeli wars 
deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu left tuesday for 
washington where officials said he will promote the refugee plan 
and argue against plo chief yasser arafats being granted a us 
visa so he can address the un general assembly 
israeli soldiers on tuesday shot and killed an arab guerrilla 
found several hundred yards north of the israelilebanon border 
across from an israeli communal farm an army spokeswoman said

forces suffered no casualties according to the spokeswoman 
military sources said the guerrilla was found with an ak47 
assault rifle and grenades officials did not identify him or his 
organization 
the spokeswoman was not identified under military regulations 
the army has begun using helicopters to track down wanted 
palestinians in remote west bank villages and mountain hideouts 
israel radio said tuesday 
an army spokesman said the military has used helicopters for 
specific missions but refused comment on the report they would be 
used in a new strategy to capture leaders in the nearly 21monthold 
palestinian uprising 
at least 558 palestinians have been killed in clashes with 
israeli soldiers or civilians in the revolt against israeli 
occupation thirtynine israelis also have died 
the latest palestinian victim was 12yearold ahmed alabed 
elbittar who died tuesday of wounds suffered in a clash last week 
with soldiers arab reports said he was from khan yunis in the gaza 
strip 
in the gaza strip town of rafah masked palestinian youths 
stabbed to death naeem fakhri afana 27 who was suspected of 
collaborating with israel arab reports said 
at least 107 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs during 
the uprising most on suspicion of cooperating with israeli 
authorities or for drug dealing or prostitution 
eight palestinians were shot and wounded in stonethrowing 
clashes with israeli troops on tuesday hospital officials said 
the army confirmed the two deaths and one gunshot wound casualty 
it said it was checking other reports 
bushs letter came in response to shamirs request about two 
months ago for the united states to take a leading role in aiding 
rehabilitation of the refugee camps ahimeir said 
bush reportedly told shamir that the united states already plays

evangelist jim bakker facing a hearing on 
whether his fraud and conspiracy trial will continue suffered 
stress and not mental illness when he collapsed his wife said 
tuesday 
also tuesday bakkers lawyers filed a motion seeking a mistrial 
on grounds that the collapse of a witness during defense cross 
examination last week prejudiced the jury 
the us marshals office said a hearing would be held at 1030 
am on wednesday to determine if bakker is mentally competent to 
stand trial attorneys and others in the case are forbidden to 
discuss it under a gag order 
defense lawyer harold bender filed the mistrial motion just 
before the court closed tuesday 
the motion said it was likely that jurors would blame defense 
attorneys for steve nelsons collapse since he passed out during 
cross examination by the defense 
nelson a former ptl official testified he had warned bakker 
that someone could go to prison because of financial practices at 
ptl he collapsed during that testimony and bakker suffered his 
emotional collapse the next day 
tammy faye bakker said her husband was so out of it that he 
thought they were taking him to an animal hospital when he was 
sent to a prison hospital last week 
after 2 years of sheer mental torture he was just stressed 
out mrs bakker said in a taped statement broadcast tuesday on 
the jim and tammy show 
bakker resigned from the ptl ministry in march 1987 in a sex and 
money scandal his trial started aug 28 in us district court on 
charges that he used nearly 4 million in ministry funds to support 
a lavish lifestyle the trial was recessed thursday when bakker 
didnt come to court and his psychiatrist said it was because he was 
hallucinating 
when bakker was taken to the prison hospital at the federal 
correctional institution at butner north of durham bakker 
apparently confused it with an animal hospital in charlotte named 
butler animal hospital 
mrs bakker also said her husbands civil rights were violated 
when us district court judge robert potter ordered bakker to the 
federal prison hospital 
jims constitutional rights have been violated he has been 
treated like a carnival show she said 
the judge flew into a rage when he was told thursday that 
bakker couldnt come to court mrs bakker said in the broadcast 
and ordered federal marshals to seize him 
these big men took one small man and put him in shackles 
and paraded him across the yard in shackles sobbing and crying 
with his hair all messed up she said 
nobody called us no one told jim where he was going i called 
the lawyers and they didnt even know where he was i went for an 
entire day and didnt even know if jim was dead or alive 
bakker is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy and 
faces 120 years in prison and more than 5 million in fines 
bryan bledsoe a spokesman at butner declined to comment tuesday 
on the progress of the evaluation but he did confirm reports from 
bakkers wife that her husband was handcuffed during her visits with 
him and was strip searched afterward

president bushs new 78 billion drug plan is a 
courageous combination of law enforcement and treatment the head of 
the nations largest private nonprofit drug treatment center said 
tuesday 
the founder and president of phoenix house dr mitchell s 
rosenthal who has seen a draft copy of president bushs plan said 
the program could have an even higher success rate than the 
president is projecting 
i think the goals of a 50 percent reduction are probably too 
modest rosenthal said before leaving for a white house meeting 
with bush and federal drug czar william bennett 
i think if the american public can get behind this plan we can 
see a 75 to 80 percent reduction in drug use over the next 10 
years 
rosenthal who brought bennett to a phoenix house facility in the 
borough of queens three months ago said the best aspect of the bush 
proposal was its acknowledgement of jail as the start of a road to 
rehabilitation funds for the program will be divided 70 percent for 
law enforcement 30 percent for treatment the doctor said 
im very encouraged with the plan its a gutsy comprehensive 
plan which addresses a coming together of treatment and law 
enforcement concerns rosenthal said at a news conference 
it recognizes most users are not motivated for treatment and 
includes sanctions to push them toward treatment jails are an 
opportunity to begin treatment 
rosenthal said one key to bushs plan is convincing americans 
that casual drug use is an evil that must be stopped in 1962 2 
percent of americans said they had used illicit drugs in 1982 it 
was 38 percent he said 
its essential to target casual users this plan is trying to 
make casual use by mainstream americans something to think long and 
hard about he said

a woman who planned her funeral was evicted 
from her trailer and lost her boyfriend after two tests mistakenly 
showed she had the aids virus has filed a complaint against the 
hospital and doctors involved 
it should never have happened and i dont think it ever ought 
to happen again gayla gray said in a recent interview with the 
indianapolis news i wouldnt wish this on someone i despised 
gray 33 of noblesville was hospitalized for peritonitis in 
1987 and was tested for aids antibodies when she failed to respond 
to antibiotic treatment the first test was positive as was a 
second more sophisticated test on the same blood sample 
thirteen months later doctors discovered those tests were wrong 
when a routine test on grays blood came up negative for the hiv 
antibody they retested the original blood sample that had been 
stored at indiana university hospital and it tested negative 
in the meantime grays boyfriend broke up with her friends and 
neighbors shunned her and her teenage daughter was taunted by 
schoolmates gray a nurse had not been working during the period 
because of other health problems 
her complaint which seeks an unspecified amount of damages was 
pending before the medical malpractice division of the indiana state 
insurance commission if the case is not settled by the panel it 
will proceed to court 
neither party has yet requested a medical review panel be 
appointed to hear the case marsha harrison chief counsel for the 
medical malpractice division said tuesday 
dr robert goulet and another physician named in grays 
complaint dr richard kohler said an attorney had told them not to 
discuss the case a third physician named in the complaint dr 
lawrence wheat did not return telephone calls placed to his office 
tuesday 
grays lawyer michael w van treese believes the mistake could 
have occurred in one of two ways 
the tests for the aids virus could have registered false 
positives in that case treese said doctors should have retested 
grays blood earlier than they did since the number of tcells 
present was much higher than usual for hivpositive tests 
a second possibility is that grays blood sample could have been 
confused with another patients this other person could have been 
told they do not have the virus and they have now spread that 
further in the community he said 
before gray even left the hospital after recovering from 
peritonitis she learned she had been evicted from her trailer her 
landlord said it was because the grass hadnt been cared for 
later several people told her the landlord had burned the 
trailer because no one wanted to live where an aids patient had 
lived 
gray said her father her two sisters and other family members 
rallied around her but her boyfriend couldnt accept her having the 
aids virus 
i had told him that if he decided to break up i certainly 
would understand gray said 
her 16yearold daughter becky also pulled away and friends 
shunned her the family began receiving prank phone calls someone 
scrawled aids in the snow on grays car 
living in a small town you know you tell one person and the 
whole world knows gray said 
she lived in fear from day to day expecting every minor ailment 
to develop into aids she said i was so sure i was going to die 
that i already had picked out the thing i was going to wear to my 
funeral 
gray said she felt euphoric in october 1988 when she heard she 
was all right but then she grew angry 
i still dont understand how something like that could have 
happened she said

jamaican singer and actress grace jones 
failed to show up tuesday for her trial on cocaine possession 
charges and a court said it will order her arrest if she doesnt 
appear at the rescheduled trial 
ms jones attorney tom tavaressimson told st andrew criminal 
court magistrate owen parkin that her absence was due to 
contractual bligations in italy which she was unable to break and 
should not be taken as any form of disrespect for the court 
parkin issued an arrest warrant but immediately suspended it 
making it effective oct 3 if she fails to show up for a new trial 
on that date 
the trial had already been postponed three times since it was 
originally scheduled in june either because prosecutors were not 
familiar with the case witnesses were missing or judges failed to 
show up 
ms jones 37 returned to the caribbean island for the last 
three trial dates after flying from paris italy and spain each 
time she complained of the high cost of flying back to jamaica only 
to learn in court that the trial had been suspended 
ms jones was arrested in april while vacationing in kingston and 
charged with possession of 006 ounces of cocaine that police found 
in her handbag police said the street value of the cocaine was less 
than 18

elie wiesel an auschwitz survivor and nobel peace 
laureate said tuesday only pope john paul ii can end the conflict 
over whether to move a roman catholic convent away from the 
auschwitz death camp in poland 
the american writer asked the pope to take a clear position on 
the issue 
both wiesel a jew and the pope were born in poland 
john paul has made no public comment on the controversy over the 
carmelite convent which was to be moved to an interfaith prayer 
center under an agreement between jewish and catholic leaders signed 
in geneva in 1987 
a deadline for the transfer passed last feb 22 leading to 
protests at the site by jewish activists polish church leaders then 
said the agreement was suspended because of the protests and what 
they called aggressive demands cardinal josef glemp the 
primate of poland was quoted last week as calling for the agreement 
to be renegotiated 
vatican officials have said on condition of anonymity that the 
pope believes the problem should be worked out by the poles without 
his intervention 
the popes silence will be judged by history wiesel said 
during a visit to paris how could the pope who in his crusades 
around the world speaks of the problems of the countries he passes 
through sometimes with courage fail to take a position on an 
affair concerning his own country 
wiesel has campaigned tirelessly for human rights and has 
stressed the need to remember the horrors of the nazi holocaust 
cardinal albert decourtray the primate of france who headed the 
roman catholic delegation at the 1987 negotiations has called for 
the agreement to be carried out but said on sunday he hoped it 
could be done without involving the pope

portauprince haiti ap the government said tuesday if 
recently decreed austerity measures succeed they will help this 
impoverished caribbean nation receive up to 340 million in aid 
finance minister leonce thelusma told a press conference that 
once haiti has cleaned up its house it will receive the funds 
from the world bank the interamerican development bank and the 
international monetary fund 
he said when we have put our public finances in order we will 
obtain an enlarged structural adjustment loan of about 50 million 
from the imf 
an additional 170 million would come from the world bank and 
100 million from the interamerican development bank according to 
thelusma 
that amounts to 320 million and the finance minister did not say 
where the additional 20 million would come from nor did he say 
when haiti expected to receive the aid 
haitis annual budget is under 300 million 
in a series of weekend decrees the government of lt gen 
prosper avril raised tariffs on imports changed tax deductions for 
home loans increased the number of merchants required to pay the 10 
percent valueadded tax on their sales by including smaller 
businesses and raised taxes on basic foodstuffs 
the moves are designed to help the government balance its budget 
and are a pill we have to take now but in the long run the 
results will be positive thelusma said 
the chamber of commerce and many businessmen and politicians 
criticized the austerity measures saying they would hurt the poor 
and provoke social unrest 
thelusma confirmed unofficial reports that haiti is negotiating 
with the imf he said the economic measures were not demanded by the 
imf and were initiated by the government 
haiti which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican 
republic is one of the worlds poorest nations it has a foreign 
debt of 800 million and the annual per capita income is less than 
300 
declining farm production has been aggravated by cheap products 
smuggled into the country mainly from florida and political 
instability has dissuaded foreign and local businessmen from 
investing

president bush on tuesday proposed cuts in 
juvenile justice housing immigration and economic development 
programs to help defray some of the costs of his new antidrug 
program 
but the size of the cuts less than 800 million was relatively 
small compared with the overall 79 billion price tag of the 
program bush outlined in his first nationally televised addres to 
the nation 
white house budget director richard darman said that most of the 
funds for the presidents new program already had been earmarked or 
proposed previously by the president 
overall the package represents a 22 billion spending increase 
over the current antidrug effort 
but of that just 716 million would represent a budgetary 
increase over funds bush already requested of congress in his 
february budget message and his may anticrime package 
ending weeks of silence on how bush would pay for the package 
darman was ready with a series of reductions that he said would 
cover the increases 
this isnt a comelater approach darman told a briefing 
however the 751 million list of program reductions a juvenile 
justice program funds for housing immigration and rural economic 
development a postal program and a pentagon communications project 
drew immediate skepticism from capitol hill 
to say weve declared war and developed a domestic policy and a 
foreign policy and then we have to go back and nickelanddime from 
the different committees to raise 700 million to me it just 
doesnt seem as though were sincere said rep charles rangle 
dny chairman of the select house committee on narcotics abuse 
and control 
in addition house democrats suggested that bush still has not 
said how he would pay for all of his earlier anticrime proposals 
the white house announced the overall program in terms of budget 
authority which includes some spending on projects in future years 
and thus tends to exaggerate the price tag some critics contend 
in terms of budget outlays money that will be actually shelled 
out in the fiscal yera beginning oct 1 the programs firstyear 
price tag comes to 64 billion rather than the 79 billion in 
budget authority 
one reason for the disparity in the two figures is that a 
fairsized chunk of the program involves spending on new prisons 
and most of those costs would not be paid until later years budget 
officials said 
darman gave his list of the 716 million in new spending 
proposals along with his 751 million in offsetting costs in a 
letter to the chairmen and senior republicans on the house and 
senate approprations committees 
the proposed cuts 
320 million from a human and health services program to help 
states bear the costs of immigration legalization services the 
white house cited a slow startup for the program as rationale and 
said states will still have sufficient funds available 
194 million from the economic development administration of the 
commerce department a program that former president reagan long 
sought to kill 
40 million from a grant program for the justice departments 
juvenile justice program budget officials claimed claimed the 
orignial purpose of the program separation of junveile from adult 
offenders had already been accomplished 
15 million from a fund set up to reclaim lost postal revenue 
through curbing past abuses of federal subsidies to nonprofit 
mailers 
50 million from public housing operating subsidies by the 
department of housing and urban development funds that essentially 
would be redirected to a hud program to rid public housing of drug 
dealers and to increase security 
132 million from the defense departments single channel ground 
and airborne radio system which the white house said needs more 
testing

a prominent politician and union leader 
shot to death in his office tuesday was among at least 25 people 
reported killed in sri lankas ethnic violence officials reported 
military officials said an unidentified man walked into the 
office of merril wijeyesena kariyawasam in ratmalana a town 10 
miles south of colombo and opened fire 
kariyawasam 52 was a senior official of the national workers 
union affiliated with the governing united national party he 
formerly represented the southern agalawatte constituency in 
parliament and was chairman of the stateowned rubber research 
institute

accomplices of the gunman stood watch outside said the officials 
who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
they said the raiders were believed to be from the peoples 
liberation front a group of sinhalese extremists trying to 
overthrow the government 
earlier tuesday president ranasinghe premadasa told the 
governing partys parliament delegation the crisis had shaken the 
very foundations of democracy and human rights he urged all 
parties to work for an end to ethnic violence 
the government says more than 5000 people have been killed in 
two years of violence by the sinhalese radicals 
premadasa plans an allparty meeting sept 13 to seek solutions 
to ethnic problems he invited the peoples liberation front which 
has rejected other peace offers but it has not responded 
what is essential is the bringing in of all groups that still 
remain outside the democratic process within its fold he told the 
united national party lawmakers 
officials have reported at least 20 deaths a day in the past 
week the bloodiest of the sinhalese extremist campaign at least 
237 people were killed in the aug 28sept 4 period according to 
military reports

built an army of about 7500 men with sophisticated weapons 
supported by 2000 people who can use a shotgun or maybe a 
singleshot rifle he spoke on condition of anonymity

lankas 16 million people and claim discrimination by the 
predominantly buddhist sinhalese majority 
the 6yearold tamil war has killed 11000 people including 
1000 indian soldiers 
india became involved because it is the regional power and its 
own population includes 60 million tamils most of whom live in 
southern india just across the palk strait from sri lanka

the us justice department said 
tuesday it may investigate whether authorities used excessive force 
to quell labor day weekend riots but officials defended the actions 
of police and national guard troops 
this is the most devastating thing to ever happen to our resort 
city mayor meyera e oberndorf said at a news conference we 
are eternally thankful that no lives were lost in this tragedy 
merchants in this seaside resort spent the day cleaning up from 
the rioting early sunday and sunday night much of it by black 
college students attending the annual endofsummer greekfest 
at least 100 businesses were looted more than 1000 people were 
arrested and 30 police officers or national guard soldiers were 
injured authorities said 
police toting 30inchlong riot batons and national guard troops 
armed with unloaded m16 rifles or 45caliber pistols and billy 
clubs cleared city streets of rioters the 325 virginia national 
guardsmen were dispatched at the citys request 
state civil rights leaders have said police overreacted that the 
city and merchants made the students feel unwelcome and that police 
would have reacted differently had the crowd been white 
deborah burstionwade a justice department spokesman in 
washington said it was possible the fbi and the departments civil 
rights division would investigate the riots handling after 
reviewing videotapes she said the department had received no 
complaints of excessive police force 
oberndorf who has called the last accusation poppycock said 
officials have received hundreds of calls supporting police 
these officers were exposed to an extreme situation said 
city manager aubrey v watts jr its incredible that they were 
able to restore law and order without firing a single shot or using 
fatal force 
maj gen john g castles commander of the virginia national 
guard said he was pleased with his troops actions he said they 
performed their duties in a professional manner under difficult 
circumstances 
according to preliminary police reports 1235 people were 
charged with 1346 offenses between friday and monday mostly 
disorderly conduct drinking violations and traffic offenses 
these statistics do not even begin to tell the story said 
police chief charles r wall when youre in the middle of a riot 
you dont have time to make arrests your main concern is to get the 
streets secured 
an estimated 100000 people jammed atlantic avenue virginia 
beachs main drag before the violence began 
merchants plan to meet this week to discuss how to prevent 
another riot next labor day weekend said rick kowalewitch owner of 
rks windsurf shop 
you cant do a whole lot said kowalewitch who had an 
employee armed with a shotgun guard his store no matter what we 
do we look like a racist 
many of the young people who were chased off the streets by 
police were black but kowalewitch said he and other whites were 
ordered off the streets as well 
he said police properly enforced city crowd control ordinances 
enacted after last years greekfest became unruly 
greekfest participants who remained at the beach tuesday were 
divided on whether they would return next year 
brad williams 23 of white plains ny said he has been coming 
to greekfest for five years and will come back i enjoy myself 
he said 
but tracy duncan 26 of springfield mass said her first 
greekfest will be her last 
this was really outrageous she said of the police crackdown 
its like being in a prison camp

the 79 billion national drug control strategy 
announced tuesday by the bush administration recommends stripping 
even casual drug users of their drivers licenses while mounting a 
costly struggle against the drug lords of south america 
whatever the extent of their offense if they use drugs they 
should be held accountable president bush declared of the 
millions of casual drug users in this country 
for the most hardened drug traffickers in the united states bush 
renewed his endorsement of the death penalty 
for the war against the drug lords of south america he 
recommended 261 million in 1990 aid and the promise of 2 billion 
more over the following five years for the governments of colombia 
peru and bolivia nations that produce most of the cocaine that 
crosses us borders 
for the casual drug users in the united states he urged states 
to suspend their drivers licenses notify their employers put them 
in jail cells overnight or on weekends evict them from public 
housing or seize their cars he also urged newspapers to publish the 
names of drug offenders 
the president called for a mix of sanctions against the 
youthful offender including school suspension parental 
notification postponement of drivers license eligibility and 
weekends of community service 
the plan envisions militarystyle boot camps to bring a sense 
of order and discipline to the lives of youthful nonviolent 
firsttime offenders and perhaps serve as a deterrent against future 
crimes 
among its other proposals halfway houses and various house 
arrest programs that keep an offender incapacitated at his own 
expense 
the proposals include an increase in federal funds for treatment 
of addicts and for prevention programs 
but the main emphasis was on bringing the suppliers and users of 
illegal drugs to justice 
we should be tough on drugs much tougher than we are now 
the presidents 154page report declared 
anyone who sells drugs and to a great if poorly understood 
extent anyone who uses them is involved in an international 
criminal enterprise that is killing thousands of americans each 
year says the strategy which bush unveiled in a nationally 
televised address 
national drug control policy director william j bennett summed 
up a crucial element of the 79 billion antidrug strategy drug 
use we say is wrong 
there are lots of other things that are wrong money 
laundering crime violence in the inner city but drug use itself 
is wrong and that means the strategy is aimed at reducing drug 
use bennett said at a white house briefing shortly before bushs 
speech 
the white house recommendations to the states are just that 
bush rejected earlier plans to threaten states with the loss of 
federal highway funds and criminal justice funds if they failed to 
implement tough new sanctions 
however states must impose drug testing for arrestees 
prisoners parolees and those out on bail to receive criminal 
justice grants 
similar testing would be mandated for all federal arrestees and 
complete abstinence from drugs would be a condition for release on 
bond probation or parole 
bush plans to help cities enforce whatever antidrug laws they 
have on the books by pumping 350 million into law enforcement 
grants a 200 million increase over the current authorization 
local governments can use some of the money to plan new jails while 
the federal government sets aside some 12 billion for construction 
of new federal prisons 
the federal prison system has a capacity of 31000 inmates the 
strategy recommends expanding this by 77 percent 
while the bush strategy focuses on making those at all levels of 
drug trafficking pay for their crimes it also would provide help 
for addicts particularly those suffering from addiction to crack 
the relatively cheap cocaine derivative that is smoked 
the bush proposal calls for a 53 percent increase in federal 
funds for drug abuse treatment from 604 million authorized in the 
current budget to 925 million in 1990 programs would have to 
demonstrate their success to receive funds 
in addition the strategy seeks 12 billion for prevention 
efforts 25 percent over the current authorization of 943 million 
the strategy calls for 25 million in emergency drug education 
grants for urban areas with major drug problems that would be in 
addition to the 350 million now spent to support schoolbased drug 
education programs 
it also requires schools colleges and universities to impose 
firm drive prevention programs and policies to receive any federal 
funds 
overseas the strategy takes into account the plight of the 
governments of colombia peru and bolivia the three main cocaine 
producers in their efforts to combat the drug trade while battling 
insurgent groups and maintaining a legitimate economy 
the recent flareup of violence in colombia where the government 
reinstituted its agreement to extradite alleged drug traffickers to 
the united states to stand trial already has resulted in the 
emergency dispatch of some 65 million in immediate military aid 
for 1990 the strategy calls for 261 million to be spent in 
military and law enforcement aid for these three south american 
countries more than a fourfold increase over the approximately 53 
million in the current budget for antidrug efforts total foreign 
aid to those countries including the antidrug money is almost 
163 million in 1989 
budget director richard darman announced tuesday that the 
administration will seek 2 billion over the next five years in 
economic aid to the three countries much of it contingent on those 
countries proving their willingness to fight drug traffickers 
the strategy urges elevation of drugs as a bilateral foreign 
policy issue and says that in the past programs in this area 
have been hampered by the lack of importance given by this country 
to the drug issue as a foreign policy concern 
meanwhile the strategy also called for more widespread drug 
testing in the public and private sectors and encouraged employers 
to identify employees who use drugs including drug testing where 
appropriate 
the numbers in the strategy reflect authorization figures not 
what actually will be spent or where that money will come from for 
example one senate staffer familiar with the drug issue noted that 
prisons take a long time to build and only a small portion of the 
12 billion for prisons will be spent in 1990 
when congress passed the antidrug abuse act of 1988 it called 
for authorization of 28 billion above what was already being 
spent faced with a staggering budget deficit congress agreed to 
spend only 500 million in fiscal 1989 and up to 967 million by the 
end of fiscal 1990 
a bid by the house to spend 822 million in a supplementary 
spending bill earlier this year was killed following a threat by 
darman the supplementary spending on antidrug efforts later was 
lowered to about 75 million

the leader of a visiting soviet delegation said 
tuesday that president mikhail s gorbachev is trying to develop a 
truly federal state but ruled out independence for soviet 
republics seeking greater autonomy 
breakaway independent states would not be in the interests of 
either the baltic republics themselves or the ussr said 
yevgeny m primakov chairman of the soviet of the union one of two 
houses of the supreme soviet legislature 
what we are trying to achieve is a truly federal state and not 
in name only but in essence he said speaking through an 
interpreter at the news conference at the soviet embassy we would 
like the republics to be as sovereign and independent as possible 
primakov is in london for a meeting of the interparliamentary 
union a gathering of lawmakers from around the world 
earlier moscow and london announced that british prime minister 
margaret thatcher will visit moscow for talks with gorbachev on 
sept 23 on her way home from a trip to tokyo 
it will be their first meeting since britain expelled 11 soviet 
diplomats and journalists in may charging they were spies and the 
soviet union retaliated by ordering out 11 britons 
primakov said he hoped the visit would give a new impetus to arms 
control negotiations and other eastwest issues 
we are not going to forget that the first meeting between 
mikhail gorbachev and margaret thatcher was in a way a prelude to a 
number of developments in the international arena which considerably 
reduced tensions said primakov 
he was referring to a 1984 meeting in london gorbachev and mrs 
thatcher appeared to strike up a particularly good personal 
relationship and she described him as someone with whom she could 
do business 
however relations cooled after the expulsions in may 
also tuesday the foreign office announced that foreign secretary 
john major will visit the united states next week 
major who became foreign secretary in july will spend sunday 
through tuesday in washington and meet with president bush vice 
president dan quayle and secretary of state james a baker iii

a prisoner who won 1000 in a restaurant 
promotion was escorted to the post office in handcuffs tuesday to 
mail paperwork to receive his prize 
police spokesman kerry pool said one person complained that 
inmate charles e wilson was not entitled to the money since the 
taxpayers bought the meal that enabled him to win 
but most people were happy for wilson who is being held for 
extradition to face a drug charge in missouri pool said 
mayor david kinley agreed i thought it was great usually 
its some rich dude that wins the money in a contest like that not 
someone in need like this fellow 
wilson 33 who was arrested last week while hitchhiking had 
finished munching on a jailprovided mcdonalds fish sandwich and 
french fries sunday night when he decided to peel a game piece from 
his medium cocacola 
i thought maybe id win a hamburger and theyd pick me up an 
extra one wilson said 
however i pulled it off and said do what its pretty good 
to be sitting in jail and win 1000 wilson said monday 
a mcdonalds spokesman said wilsons chance of winning was 
476000to1 
officers fetched paperwork for wilson to redeem the prize pool 
said but the prisoner had to sign in person to send the game piece 
to mcdonalds by registered mail so he was escorted to the postal 
counter a block from the jail pool said 
the check is going to be mailed to his mother in illinois 
since mr wilson doesnt know what his home address is going to be 
for awhile pool said 
wilson paid his own postage pool said 
after signing the forms wilson was taken to the faulkner county 
jail since the city jail is a shortterm holding facility pool 
said he will probably have a hearing thursday he said 
unlike the city jail which sends out to mcdonalds for all 
prisoner meals the county jail does its own cooking 
when a reporter noted that the authorities were being helpful to 
the prisoner pool said he is incarcerated but we want to treat 
him as humanely as we would want to be treated under these 
circumstances this is the first time we ever had a prisoner win a 
prize like this

libyan leader moammar gadhafi told 
the nonaligned movement tuesday in a rambling speech that the us 
dollar is the devil itself and jews in israel should be 
resettled elsewhere 
gadhafi spoke without a prepared text for one hour and 25 minutes 
on the second day of the fourday summit ignoring the time limit of 
20 minutes for each leader addressing the assembly 
some delegates said the speech was an embarrassment 
earlier cuban vice president raul castro fired broadsides 
against the united states accusing it of nurturing subversion plans 
against cuba 
in other speeches to the delegates from 102 nations 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi said it is dominance by 
economic pressure that is now emerging as the single most important 
threat to the independence freedom and stability of the nonaligned 
nations the central issue in the present international economic 
order is the domination of the global economy by a few without 
regard to the interests of the many 
nigerian president ibrahim badamosi babangida demanded major 
concessions from the west to ease the debt burden as did other 
african delegates earlier he said official debts owed to creditor 
countries should be abolished through outright cancellation by 
creditor countries he asked partial writeoffs of debts to 
commercial banks and international financial institutions 
the emir of kuwait sheikh jaber alahmed alsabah proposed an 
international meeting under un secretary general javier perez de 
cuellar involving creditor countries the international monetary 
fund and the world bank on ways to resolve the debt crisis 
gadhafis address simultaneously translated on inhouse 
television at the sava hall conference center was marked by 
incomplete sentences and repetitive and often confusing statements 
the dollar is one of the worst currencies the devil itself it 
should be burned it should not be of any real value at all the 
libyan leader declared 
he also said charging interest on credits was against the 
religion of islam and that libya would stop demanding interest 
from debtor countries 
he said the jews should be resettled from palestine to 
form a buffer state between france and germany 
later he suggested that if the united states is sympathizing 
with the jews why doesnt it give them alaska 
in an apparent attempt to underscore what he believes is an 
absurdity of jews settling in israel gadhafi asked why dont we 
moslems go to new york 
a yugoslav delegate grumbled his speech is a mockery of the 
world we live in and of the nonaligned movement 
an arab delegate commented there is certainly something mad 
about him but some of his ideas were not so bad 
both delegates spoke on condition of not being identified 
raul castro brother of president fidel castro made attacks on 
the united states a main theme of his address to the conference 
which was attended by about 50 heads of state and about a dozen 
prime ministers from the middle east africa asia and latin america 
castro accused washington of aggression against panama and 
called it a crime we cannot tolerate according to an english 
version of his speech made available by cubas prensa latina news 
agency 
the united states the major imperialist power is behaving 
today more arrogantly threateningly and aggressively than ever 
before 
he said cuba is now being subjected to an unprecedented 
defamation campaign and new plans for penetration and subversion 
by the united states 
the united nations perez de cuellar was in belgrade for the 
summit and met tuesday with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
in remarks later to reporters aziz charged that iran rejects 
peace talks with iraq on settling the persian gulf war 
talks between iran and iraq held under un auspices collapsed 
last march 
the two countries 8year border war ended inconclusively with a 
ceasefire in august 1988 
on monday de cuellar met with iranian foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati who insisted iran was willing to resume the talks

salvadoran rebels said tuesday they have 
proposed talks with the new rightist government to end el salvadors 
civil war and that negotiations begin next week 
there was no immediate response from the salvadoran government 
but it did announce a 48hour ceasefire 
the announcements followed a fierce predawn battle in 
northeastern el salvador in which at least 16 soldiers were killed 
armed forces spokesmen reported the deaths after the fighting 
outside chilanga in morazan province they said the rebels also 
suffered numerous casualties but gave no number 
the farabundo marti national liberation front which represents 
five leftwing guerrilla groups fighting el salvadors usbacked 
government called for talks to be held in mexico starting sometime 
between next sunday and thursday sept 10sept 14 
col inocente montano the vice minister of defense said tuesday 
the armed forces would observe a ceasefire sept 1415 as part of 
the celebration marking central americas independence from spain on 
sept 15 1821 
montano did not mention the rebels proposal for peace talks but 
told reporters the ceasefire is a positive initiative as long 
as it is respected by the fmln the spanish initials for the 
guerrillass front 
a ceasefire for the independence festivities had been suggested 
on monday by the permanent committee of the national debate for 
peace an organization representing more than 70 church union 
humanitarian and civic groups 
it the government agrees to the proposed peace negotiations it 
would be the first meeting between the two sides since president 
alfredo cristiani of the conservative republican nationalist 
alliance suggested talks at his inauguration june 1 the guerrillas 
agreed at that time but the effort snagged on the mechanics of 
arranging the dialogue 
were taking away practically all obstacles said ana 
guadalupe martinez a rebel commander were making it the easiest 
thing in the world 
in a significant softening of their previous conditions she said 
the front would bargain with any committee the government names 
before the rebels had insisted that an army representative and 
highlevel officials be at the negotiating table they rejected one 
delegation the government considered on grounds its members would 
not have the power to negotiate 
the front suggested the dates and mexico as a site for the talks 
in a proposal sent friday to cristiani through monsignor arturo 
rivera damas the archbishop of san salvador ms martinez told a 
news conference in mexico city 
she added the front has not received a reply from the government 
but she said the fmln had received an unacceptable response to a 
proposal that the government release all wounded rebel it is holding 
as prisoners 
ms martinez said the proposal was made through rivera damas and 
the government replied that it would release the wounded prisoners 
if the rebels stopped sabotaging electrical installations and their 
bans on transportation 
that point was not negotiable she said 
mario lopez another rebel commander said new steps would be 
announced thursday 
commanders will make public a series of measures to create an 
atmosphere of confidence for the negotiations lopez told 
reporters 
he did not elaborate but there was speculation the offers might 
include a ceasefire 
in the past the guerrillas have opposed a unilateral ceasefire 
saying a truce would have be to be negotiated at the bargaining 
table 
the fmln in its proposal for talks next week again demanded 
rivera damas be present during negotiations 
cristiani has said the archbishop should not be involved in the 
talks 
the fmln also has insisted that delegates from the organization 
of american states and united nations be present 
lopez said rebel representatives met monday in costa rica with 
oas secretarygeneral joao baena soares and francisco bandrel a 
un representative 
three rounds of talks with the government of former president 
jose napoleon duarte between 1984 and 1987 failed to make progress 
toward ending the nearly 10yearold war duarte headed a centrist 
christian democrat government 
an estimated 70000 people most of them civilians have been 
killed in the fighting

colombian president virgilio barco 
in a message to the belgrade summit of nonaligned nations appealed 
to the industrialized world to help his country in its war on drug 
cartels 
his speech was prepared for delivery early wednesday by foreign 
minister julio londono at about the same time president bush 
announced in washington a 79 billion program to fight the illegal 
drug trade 
an english translation of barcos message was made available to 
the news media 
barco said he decided to cancel his visit to this summit in 
order to deal personally and directly with an unprecedented 
offensive against the scourge of drug trafficking 
the struggle against the illegal drug traffic will only be won 
in a definite way when every country assumes the responsibilities 
they share the message said adding 
colombia has already paid a huge price and has made an enormous 
sacrifice 
luis carlos galan colombian senator and candidate for the 
presidency of the republic who was recently assassinated in bogota 
is but another one of the hundreds of martyrs fallen in this 
struggle 
galan an outspoken foe of drug trafficking was slain by cartel 
henchmen while addressing a campaign rally aug 18 his murder 
brought a declaration of war against the drug barons and a promise 
of aid by the bush administration 
barco said in his message that expressions of solidarity from the 
international community is not enough in the battle concrete action 
must be taken 
he called for serious and resolute actions designed to stop 
drug consumption in industrialized countries 
we cannot by any means accept that while colombia fights a 
most hard and widespread battle against this ominous trafficking 
drugs are currently sold in the streets of the main cities in the 
developed world under the tolerance of both inhabitants and local 
authorities barco declared 
every nation must urgently assume without hesitation its 
responsibility in this struggle he added otherwise what we 
the colombian people and its government are accomplishing will 
enter history not only as an example of heroic behavior but 
unfortunately also as an unfruitful sacrifice 
colombia is making heroic efforts to destroy an important link 
of the organization that corrupts millions of youngsters of latin 
america europe the united states of america and other regions of 
the world the message said 
we have given our help to their children and we shall continue 
to do so but the time has now come for others especially the 
industrialized countries to give their help to colombia and to our 
children 
venezuela announced tuesday it would extradite any colombian drug 
lords entering the country to escape the antidrug operations under 
way in neighboring colomba 
police director mauro yanez told a news conference in caracas 
that police national guardsmen and army troops are patrolling the 
border to prevent extraditables the chieftains of the drug 
cartels from crossing into venezuela 
if they enter and are captured they will undergo a judicial 
process that includes extradition naturally yanez said 
barco in his declaration of war against the drug dealers said 
he would use emergency powers to extradite to the united states 
colombians wanted there for drug trafficking 
the drug cartels responded by threatening to kill 10 colombian 
officials for each person extradited to america to stand trial

as you can see in the chart in 1985 the government estimated 
that 23 million americans were using drugs on a current basis 
that is at least once in the preceding month 
last year that number fell by more than a third that means 
almost 9 million fewer americans are casual drug users good news 
because we changed our national attitude toward drugs casual 
drug use has declined we have many to thank our brave 
lawenforcement officers religious leaders teachers community 
activists and leaders of business and labor 
we should also thank the media for their exhaustive news and 
editorial coverage and for the air time and space for antidrug 
messages 
finally i want to thank president and mrs reagan for their 
leadership all of these good people told the truth that drug use 
is wrong and dangerous 
but as much comfort as we can draw from these dramatic 
reductions there is also bad news very bad news 
roughly 8 million people have used cocaine in the past year 
almost 1 million of them used it frequently once a week or more 
what this means is that in spite of the fact that overall 
cocaine use is down frequent use has almost doubled in the last few 
years and thats why habitual cocaine users especially crack 
users are the most pressing immediate drug problem 
what then is our plan 
to begin with i trust the lesson of experience no single policy 
will cut it no matter how glamorous or magical it may sound to win 
that war against addictive drugs like crack will take more than just 
a federal strategy it will take a national strategy one that 
reaches into every school every workplace involving every family 
earlier today i sent this document our first such national 
strategy to the congress it was developed with the hard work of our 
nations first drug policy director bill bennett 
in preparing this plan we talked with state local and community 
leaders law enforcement officials and experts in education drug 
prevention and rehabilitation we talked with parents and kids we 
took a long hard look at all that the federal government has done 
about drugs in the past whats worked and lets be honest what 
hasnt 
too often people in government acted as if their part of the 
problem whether fighting drug production or drug smuggling or 
drug demand was the only problem but turf battles wont win this 
war teamwork will 
tonight im announcing a strategy that reflects the coordinated 
cooperative commitment of all federal agencies in short this plan 
is as comprehensive as the problme with this strategy we now 
finally have a plan that coordinates our resources our programs and 
the people who run them 
our weapons in this strategy are the law and criminal justice 
system our foreign policy our treatment systems and our schools 
and drug prevention programs 
so the basic weapons we need are the ones we already have what 
has been lacking is a strategy to effectively use them 
let me address four of the major elements of our strategy 
first we are determined to enforce the law to make our streets 
and neighborhoods safe so to start im proposing that we more than 
double federal assistance to state and local law enforcement 
americans have a right to safety in and around their homes

call your local drug prevention program be a big brother or 
sister to a child in need pitch in with your local neighborhood 
watch program whether you give your time or talent everyone counts 
every employer who bans drugs from the workplace 
every school thats tough on drug use 
every neighborhood in which drugs are not welcome 
and most important every one of you who refuses to look the 
other way every one of you counts 
of course victory will take hard work and time but together we 
will win too many young lives are at stake 
not long ago i read a newspaper story about a little boy named 
dooney who until recently lived in a crack house in a suburb of 
washington dc in dooneys neighborhood children dont flinch at 
the sound of gunfire and when they play they pretend to sell to 
each other small white rocks they call crack 
life at home was so cruel that dooney begged his teachers to let 
him sleep on the floor at school and when asked about his future 
6yearold dooney answers i dont want to sell drugs but i will 
probably have to 
well dooney does not have to sell drugs no child in america 
should have to live like this together as a people we can save 
these kids we have already transformed a national attitude of 
tolerance into one of condemnation but the war on drugs will be 
hardwon neighborhood by neighborhood block by block child by 
child 
if we fight this war as a divided nation then the war is lost 
but if we face this evil as a nation united this will be nothing 
but a handful of useless chemicals 
victory victory over drugs is our cause a just cause and with 
your help we are going to win

the number of chinese students at us 
colleges this fall has dropped sharply but those remaining still 
feel the legacy of protest from this summers quest for democracy at 
beijings tiananmen square 
tv forgets you but people dont liu yuan president of the 
china information center here said tuesday 
television needs a hot story but actually thats not how 
changing a system really works liu said thats not how a 
movement grows 
students in the boston area include wuer kaixi of harvard 
university and shen tong of brandeis university exiled leaders of 
the democracy movement whove been on the chinese governments 
mostwanted list since the student demonstrations in tiananmen 
square in june 
in the months following the crackdown on protesters martial law 
has been imposed many demonstrators have been jailed or executed 
and western journalists in china have had a tough time getting 
people to talk 
but the china information center which was set up in this boston 
suburb still receives more than 200 calls daily and volunteers 
still work around the clock relaying messages to and from contacts 
in western europe japan and australia 
china center volunteer david blumental who was one of the 
protesters near shanghai in june said true reform would only come 
by applying quiet but constant external pressure on the government 
the focus has moved outside of china as has the main 
leadership he said the focus has moved to activities that will 
promote the flow of the truth back and forth out of china 
organizers here are planning a worldwide fast for oct 1 the 
40th anniversary of the founding of the peoples republic of china 
and conferences to debate the issues concerning the reform movement 
student activists in china went underground after the crackdown 
but many have returned to campuses there and face arrest 
theyre in a dangerous position liu said we cant push 
too much the only way we can hurt the chinese government is to tell 
the truth 
the government has made it difficult for the story to get out in 
addition to the crackdown the number of students granted visas for 
study abroad has been dramatically reduced us state department 
officials said tuesday 
chinese embasssy and state department officials in washington 
said they could not immediately pin down the number of visas issued 
since june but state department spokesman kenneth bailes said it 
had dropped 
after the events in tiananmen square the government required 
that those who had been previously issued such documents had to 
apply for new ones bailes said that in itself would cut down 
on the number who actually got visas 
bailes said that while no firm figures are available the 
impression persists that up to half the 40000 chinese who were 
studying in the united states last year may not have returned 
at harvard universitys kennedy school of government only two of 
the six chinese students expected showed up for a summer fellowship 
program about half of the 80 students originally expected at the 
university of california at berkeley will attend this fall said 
marvin baron director of the schools international office 
i know a lot of people who were planning on coming but only 
know of one who got out blumental said

immigration officials blocked the 
courtordered release tuesday of former mexican president luis 
echeverrias brotherinlaw who was being held in federal jail for 
questioning in the 1985 slaying of a us drug agent 
the surprise turn of events came hours after a federal judge said 
he did not believe ruben zuno arce was a material witness to the 
slaying of us drug agent enrique camarena 
zunoarce who had wept when the judge announced his finding was 
grim faced later as he was led out of court by us marshals for 
transport to san antonio texas for an immigration hearing 
zunoarce 59 whose sister is married to echeverria was held on 
an immigration warrant alleging he is involved in drug trafficking 
us district judge edward rafeedie who had ordered zuno 
released after 28 days in custody said he was powerless to 
interfere with ins 
zunoarces attorney edward medvene denied the drug trafficking 
allegations at the earlier hearing medvene had argued that his 
client had nothing to do with the slaying but had the misfortune of 
having a house that was ultimately sold to reputed drug lord rafael 
caro quintero who allegedly masterminded the slaying of camarena 
the government had sought to keep zunoarce in prison in order to 
ensure his testimony at the upcoming trial of juan jose bernabe 
ramirez who is the latest defendant charged in the camarena case 
his trial is scheduled for oct 3 prosecutors argued to keep 
zunoarce in custody until then the judge refused 
camarena and his mexican pilot alfredo zavalaavelar were 
tortured and killed in guadalajara mexico in february 1985 their 
bodies were found four weeks later in a remote area of michoacan 
state 
zunoarce was not charged with any crime but in midaugust 
rafeedie ordered him temporarily held without bail the judge had 
warned prosecutors he would not allow the indefinite imprisonment of 
zunoarce 
several members of the mexican federal police force were linked 
to the killings and one raul lopez alvarez was convicted in los 
angeles last year along with two drug traffickers 
caroquintero is in custody awaiting trial in mexico city seven 
more men are charged with murder and conspiracy in the case 
echeverria was president of mexico from 1970 to 1976

lima and much of peru was blacked out tuesday 
night minutes before president bush gave a tough speech that 
promised to crack down on drug traffickers throughout the andes 
the blackout was the sixth since june most of which have been 
caused by leftist rebels blowing up hightension power pylons the 
shining path known to operate in league with drug barons has been 
fighting to topple perus elected government since 1980 
bushs speech was to be broadcast live by radio in peru but the 
radio station that was to carry the speech instead carried reports 
on the blackout 
according to radio reports the blackout affected cities as far 
north as chiclayo about 400 miles north of lima as well cities in 
the andean highlands 
shining path started its insurgency near the highland city of 
ayacucho but now operates through much of the andes it also 
operates throughout the upper huallaga valley which produces about 
60 percent of the worlds coca crop the rebels provide drug 
traffickers with protection from the police and permission to do 
business in the area in exchange for a portion of their drug profits 
early radio reports said police had reinforced personnel near the 
us embassy to prevent terrorist attacks in the blackout no 
incidents were reported late tuesday

president bush calling drugs the gravest 
domestic threat facing our nation tuesday night proposed a 79 
billion war on narcotics emphasizing harsher penalties for users and 
more money for prisons treatment and education 
bush warned latin american drug lords that the rules have 
changed and for the first time pledged us military help to any 
government that requests it in an allout assault against drugs 
drugs are sapping our strength as a nation the president 
said in his first nationally televised address from the oval office 
he punctuated his speech by displaying a plastic bag of crack 
cocaine seized across the street from the white house 
to attack cocaine at its source bush proposed a fourfold 
increase in the amount of military and law enforcement aid for 
colombia bolivia and peru to 2612 million in 1990 he called it 
the downpayment on a 2 billion fiveyear program for the andean 
region with more aid contingent on progress in eradicating drugs 
at home bush called for a battle fought neighborhood by 
neighborhood block by block child by child and sought a 
crackdown against those who use drugs even casual users would pay 
by losing their driving privileges or spending time in 
militarystyle boot camps 
to help offset the cost of his program bush proposed diverting 
751 million from other programs including juvenile justice 
housing immigration and economic development 
we can pay for this fight against drugs without raising taxes 
or adding to the budget deficit he said 
on capitol hill democrats greeted bushs plan with restraint 
house speaker thomas foley dwash said bush was not seeking 
enough money to mount a longterm assault and said the program will 
increase pressure for a tax increase 
with cocaine and crack dealing creating violence and record 
homicide rates across the country americans appear ready for a new 
assault against drugs 
a gallup poll released at the white house last month said a 
record 27 percent of americans consider drugs the most important 
problem facing the nation above poverty the economy the 
environment and fear of war 
all of us agree that the gravest domestic threat facing our 
nation today is drugs bush said 
bush held up the bag of cocaine and said it was as innocent 
looking as candy but the president added if we fight this war 
as a divided nation then the war is lost but if we face this evil 
as a nation united this will be nothing but a handful of useless 
chemicals 
although overall cocaine use is down frequent use has almost 
doubled in recent years roughly 8 million people have used 
cocaine in the last year the president said almost 1 million of 
them used the drug at least once a week 
even before the speech bushs program was praised by the head of 
the international association of chiefs of police charles d 
reynolds who said in a statement that the criminal justice 
recommendations of this report are responsive to critical needs 
however rep don edwards the democratic chairman of the house 
judiciary committees civil rights subcommittee said the plan 
proposes more of almost everything that hasnt worked more 
arrests more prisons tougher sentences 
delivering the democratic response to bushs address senate 
judiciary committee chairman joseph biden said quite frankly the 
presidents plan is not tough enough bold enough or imaginative 
enough to meet the crisis at hand 
key elements of bushs plan 
authorization of 16 billion for corrections 250 million to 
beef up the court system 31 billion for law enforcement 12 
billion for prevention and education and 925 million for treatment 
funds for local law enforcement efforts would more than double 
to about 350 million to finance a streetlevel attack on drugs 
states were urged to adopt stiffer fines for casual drug users 
from seizing users cars and suspending drivers licenses to sending 
some offenders to militarystyle camps 
as a condition for receiving federal funds schools colleges 
and universities would be required to adopt drug prevention programs 
states and local governments as well as private institutions 
and companies were urged to adopt drug testing programs for 
employes drug testing would be mandatory for federal arrestees 
prisoners and parolees for illegal drug use 
the nations insurance companies were urged to cover drug 
treatment programs in their policies but he stopped short of 
proposing mandatory standards 
he also called for studying ways that drug users could be 
committed to hospitals and other facilities for treatment without 
being charged with crimes 
bush emphasized the toll in the nations poorest communities by 
targeting 50 million to fight crime in public housing projects 
you know bush said the poor have never had it easy in 
this world but in the past they werent mugged on the way home 
from work by crack gangs and their children didnt have to dodge 
bullets on the way to school 
in a report to congress bush called for full swift funding and 
implementation of the many proposals and initiatives in his plan 
theres no question but that drugs are the quicksand of our 
entire society bush said in an afternoon meeting with his 
cabinet theyre suffocating individuals and families and 
institutions as well 
and all americans must pull together to solve this problem 
the president said bush said his program mandated by congress 
amounted to the first time we really have had such a strategy 
bushs program would authorize spending 22 billion in 1990 
above the current antidrug war chest of 57 billion more than 
half of the increase 12 billion is earmarked for a previously 
announced expansion of federal prison cells 
actual outlays to carry out the program in 1990 would be 64 
billion an increase of 15 billion over the amount already 
earmarked the higher figure of 79 billion also includes budget 
authority for additional spending on multiyear programs 
the 1989 funds for the andean region are separate from the 65 
million worth of military equipment and aid that bush authorized 
this month for colombia to combat a new bloody offensive by the 
countrys drug barons bush once again praised colombian president 
virgilio barco for his crackdown and reiterated his call for an 
international drug summit

democrats led by house speaker thomas foley 
said tuesday the bush administrations drug plan will increase 
pressure for a tax boost while republicans praised the plan and 
vowed to find the money somehow 
its very difficult to assume we can at least over the long 
term meet the cost of the drug war without some additional revenue 
coming into the government foley said after president bush met 
with congressional leaders 
sen strom thurmond rsc emerged from the white house meeting 
to tell reporters there would be some differences about where the 
money comes from but we can get the money 
bush described a 79 billion program stressing tougher penalties 
for drug users and more money for prisons treatment programs 
education and prevention 
in his nationally televised speech outlining the plan bush said 
tuesday night that the government can pay for this fight against 
drugs without raising taxes or adding to the budget deficit 
we have submitted our plan to congress that shows just how to 
fund it within the limits of our bipartisan budget agreement bush 
said 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said however that bush has 
suggested only 716 million in offsets to finance a 2 billion 
program he has missed the mark there he said much broader budget 
offsets in programs such as the b2 bomber and foreign aid would be 
needed to do the job 
meanwhile senate minority leader bob dole rkan issued a 
statement saying that what we dont need now is instant criticism 
and nitpicking about whats wrong with the presidents plan 
congress helps spend about 1 trillion every year so i feel 
confident we can find enough funding to fuel our war on drugs 
dole said i just dont believe we have to raise taxes to pay for 
it this is a war on drugs not a war on the american taxpayer 
initial reaction among local officials around the nation notably 
police chiefs was welcoming but these officials said they could 
not be optimistic about an easy victory 
baltimore mayor kurt schmoke who last year called for legalizing 
drugs said it was too early to judge bushs strategy 
we ought to be a little bit careful because this is the third 
time now cinse 1972 a president has launched an allout war against 
drugs schmoke said 
foley said bush outlined 700 million in budget transfers to pay 
for the plan and didnt seem to suggest any new taxes i think 
thats fair to say 
over time i think some of us feel that in order to deal with 
the entire functioning of government were going to need some 
additional revenues foley added 
house minority leader robert h michel rill suggested that a 
transfer of funds should work for the first year of the drug war 
and after that were going to have to take a look at it 
because its not going to be won in one year and it will be a 
costly venture when its over 
rep charles rangel dny emerged from the session complaining 
about plans to obtain the money through transfers it just seems 
unfair to me to be unfair to declare war and tell the congress to 
come back and pick up the money without talking about taxes or 
without talking about waiving the grammrudman deficit reduction 
law 
to say that weve declared war and develop a domestic policy 
and a foreign policy and then we have to go back and nickle and dime 
from the different committees to raise 700 million to me it just 
doesnt seem as though were sincere rangel said 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel 
delivering the democratic response said that the bush plan is not 
tough enough bold enough or imaginative enough he called for a 
much broader attack including an international team to hunt down 
drug kingpins 
there must be no safe haven for these narcoterrorists biden 
said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said i commend president bush 
for the comprehensive strategy he has announced in the war on drugs 
the phony war of the past eight years is over but he added 
in my view substantially more federal resources are needed 
to make our national strategy more credible 
rep dan rostenkowski dill said that unless the president 
supports the tax increases that will be necessary to fight this war 
the drug dealers are going to win 
as despicable as drug dealers are they understand economics 
rostenkowski said if you want to play youve got to pay 
sen richard g lugar rind expressed strong support for 
what he called a comprehensive plan and challenge to the nation 
hopefully an overwhelming majority of americans are prepared 
to reject totally the use of narcotics and to help relieve the 
suffering of those previously addicted he said he also praised 
bush for offering aid to south american nations attempting to 
curtail cocaine production 
sen patrick j leahy dvt said he was glad the president 
has gone beyond sloganeering but the best kept secret in town is 
how we pay for it 
it will take more than one speech leahy said we need 
presidential leadership along with the financial commitment to 
finish the job 
in the house rep charles schumer dny was critical of the 
bush blueprint saying it isnt really a war on drugs its barely 
a skirmish against drugs 
he called for a 1 percent surtax on individual and corporate 
income taxes saying there was no question that voters would support 
it as a way to fight the drug war people from one end of america 
to the other will he said if they know where the money is 
going

a british newspaper reported wednesday that up to 
700 iraqis and egyptians died in an explosion aug 17 at a secret 
iraqi missile center near the capital of baghdad 
the independent quoting unidentified diplomats and middle east 
sources said iraq with egyptian assistance is believed to be 
developing missile technology at the center near al hillah 40 miles 
south of baghdad 
the report said the explosion caused a fire that took 
firefighting planes nearly a week to extinguish but it said no 
reports of the disaster had appeared in the official iraqi news 
media 
the london newspaper quoted us diplomats as saying they had 
received information from iraqi sources of a major incident in the 
second half of august in which the casualty toll numbered in the low 
hundreds 
but it quoted unspecified sources as saying that 700 bodies had 
been recovered it quoted the other sources as saying the blast 
destroyed a third of the huge center which contained workers 
housing as well as armament factories 
the paper said there was no immediate suggestion of sabotage 
the casualties appear to have included egyptian military and 
civilian engineers as well as iraqi defense workers the 
independent said sources in cairo said that three egyptian air 
force transports flew from iraq to the almazha air base on 18 
august apparently carrying dead and injured from the explosion 
egyptian sources said the maadi military hospital in cairo was 
closed to civilian visitors from 19 august and doctors and nurses 
specializing in skin grafts respiratory disorders and burns were 
drafted in 
the paper said egyptian personnel have been based in iraq for two 
years 
it reported the joint egyptianiraqi team succeeded in 
producing a longerrange version of the sovietmade scudb missile 
by adding a north koreanmade supplementary fuel tank and reducing 
the payload 
the team also developed the badr2000 an improved version of 
the argentine condor2 by early 1988 the egyptians managed to 
increase the range of the missile to over 500 miles but it has 
proved notoriously inaccurate

president bushs battle plan against drugs 
sounded like a classroom lecture by a teacher who didnt know the 
subject addicts and counselors at a drug treatment center said 
tuesday 
hes talking like hes talking to a bunch of schoolchildren 
said frank 33 who is addicted to painkillers he watched bushs 
speech on television at the center for chemical dependency at 
cedarssinai medical center 
he sounded like a thirdgrade schoolteacher said terry 34 
who is battling heroin he was banging those rocks on the table 
he didnt make it scary enough 
she referred to the plastic bag of rock cocaine the president 
used as a prop during the speech 
frank terry and richard who is an alcoholic watched the 
speech in a room at the sprawling medical center which has a 27bed 
voluntary treatment program the patients asked to be identified 
only by their first names 
dr ronald gershman the medical director of the unit also 
listened to bushs speech 
he made one big blunder calling cocaine the nations no 1 
drug problem said gershman who has been treating addicts for 15 
years alcoholism is the no 1 drug in the nation i think they 
are being very narrow to focus all their attention on cocaine its 
a scapegoat 
he talks about cocaine fields in colombia how about the 
california marijuana fields gershman said 
terry said bushs plan to spend 925 million for treatment of 
addicts was far too little 
treatment is expensive street addicts are not going to be able 
to come to cedarssinai and the state programs are a joke she 
said 
the bottom lines on those programs is that they are 
ineffectual gershman added he missed the point what he 
outlined wont work drug treatment is laborintensive and 
expensive it has to be recognized as a major medical problem 
all three patients agreed that employee insurance should be 
mandated to cover drug treatment programs

my children my africa the 
latest play by athol fugard tells of a black teacher who stands for 
reason and dies for it 
the twoact work by south africas foremost dramatist is based on 
a short newspaper article about the murder of a teacher during the 
antigovernment violence and school boycotts that spread through 
black townships in 198487 a black man was hit over the head with 
an iron rod and burned by a crowd of blacks 
i didnt want to just write a play defending the oldstyle 
traditionalist saying come back into the classroom saying 
liberation first then education is a suicidal slogan fugard 
said in an interview after his play premiered at the market theater 
and before heading to washington for the opening of the road to 
mecca his 1984 play 
it would have also been too easy to have beaten my breast 
about my disgust with mob violence he said it would have 
been easier to just take a line of the young radical and just come 
out with a statement of what it means to have to endure and suffer 
the insult of a sick thirdclass education system but i had to 
really encompass all three perspectives 
fugard 57 has written produced directed and sometimes acted 
in a string of hits plays such as the blood knot master 
harold and the boys and hello and goodbye have been 
produced on broadway and in london 
the playwright may have attempted to give the views of his 
characters equal weight but an audience watching tony awardwinning 
actor john kanis portrayal of the teacher cannot help but 
sympathize with the wise kindhearted mr m whose dreams for his 
favorite student go up in the flames that consume the old man and 
his schoolhouse 
fugard even stacks the cards against mr m by making him guilty 
of an isolated act of collaboration so out of character that it 
stuns the audience as well as his student it may be fugards 
concession to certain leftwing circles in south africa who cannot 
believe that an innocent person could have been killed in the 
peoples movement that engulfed the townships 
fugard said that kani a role model for the black community 
had to overcome important hurdles and carefully explain to his 
children that he was playing the part of a police informer 
mr m stands for reason in a situation where reason does not 
necessarily count kani said in an interview with the associated 
press its not a matter of being right or wrong these days its 
a matter of being with the right side 
fugard wrote the part specifically for kani whose masterful 
performance has been uniformly praised but the lengthy sometimes 
tedious structure of the play has been criticized 
student activism and the comrades who controlled the townships 
during the unrest would provide any dramatist with the ingredients 
for a terse articulate 90minute drama which i do believe is 
lurking somewhere hidden in the voluminous dullness of this current 
production wrote critic barry ronge of johannesburgs sunday 
times 
the play is three hours long half of it consumed in the first 
act by philosophical lectures from mr m his top student thami 
and a white girl who becomes thamis partner in a literature 
competition disrupted by the black school boycott 
the first act particularly makes one feel somewhat harangued 
and needs a lot of tightening said rina minervini critic for 
johannesburgs sunday star 
the play is largely structured along the lines of a debate 
there are long tired monologs said the new nation a leftist 
black newspaper but it added the debate he raises is a vital 
one 
kani 46 describes himself as a revolutionary but i cant 
throw stones at the moment so i decided to turn my art into a 
weapon to fight the system 
his character mr m feels the same way about education he 
knows that in south africa black schools are substandard but he 
believes ignorance and illiteracy are not the answer 
unfortunately hes dealing with the angry youth kani said 
the youth who see him with these ideas as a collaborator because 
the struggle has drawn a line you are either with us or you are not 
with us it doesnt allow you to be an observer it doesnt allow 
you to be neutral it doesnt allow you even to want to think in a 
way that would be identified as the other side 
the youth says no more talk we do mr m takes his chance 
by saying i will stand for what i believe in and he dies

the 1980s burned through a lot of fads but 
mtv music television has refused to join the trendsetter trash heap 
growing stagnant mtv and its musicvideo format have been 
revamped from top to bottom and have emerged on its eighth 
anniversary as one of televisions more robust and diverse 
enterprises 
in the wake of a twoyear overhaul spread across mtv and its two 
affiliated channels vh1 and nickelodeonnick at nite mtv 
networks now features a mix of game shows childrens programs 
newscasts dance shows sitcom reruns and rap music 
mtvs archly irreverent remote control quiz show has become 
so popular that its now a hit in the tv syndication market 
nickelodeon jammed with offbeat childrens shows will deliver 
2343 episodes this year an increase of more than 300 percent since 
1986 
after losing about 50 million in its first two years mtv 
networks now has a combined subscriber base of 125 million viewers 
mtv says and a growing following overseas earnings for the three 
channels through the second quarter of this year were up 21 percent 
from a year ago to 179 million 
all the same mtvs evolution has been clumsy at times and the 
future is dotted with challenges even after a redesign softrock 
vh1 still attracts meager ratings and nick at nite has yet to 
become more than a rest home for old sitcoms 
in the coming months both mtv and home box office will introduce 
allcomedy cable channels 
we think a comedy channel is a real logical next step for us 
said tom freston mtv networks president and chief executive 
officer but i think that you probably will see only one comedy 
channel surviving 
with ha as mtvs comedy channel will be called mtv will be 
chasing the competition 
i think that what were doing is unique and innovative and what 
theyre doing is already available on other cable channels said 
dick beahrs president of hbos comedy channel 
the comedy channel which debuts in november will be composed of 
brief comedy sketches culled from movies and nightclub performances 
complemented by occasional featurelength films and sitcoms ha 
using longerform program packages premieres april 1 
mtvs other channels continue to be reworked vh1 now 4 years 
old faces perhaps the most difficult battle 
freston labels vh1 a work in progress a few cable operators 
have called it something else unnecessary 
when the consumer news and business channel began in april 
several cable systems bumped vh1 to make room at a cost of nearly a 
million subscribers according to cnbc mtv however says its 
closer to 250000 
vh1s problem is that it is still seen as the drydock for mtv 
flotsam it was a repository for everything mtv didnt want to 
play freston said and it still has a way to go 
vh1 these days offers an eclectic musical blend of artists such 
as enya fine young cannibals 10000 maniacs and edie brickell amp 
new bohemians gone for good vh1 promises are julio iglesias and 
neil diamond 
the channel also has added lifestyle reports entertainment news 
nostalgia programming such as my generation and the sunday jazz 
show new visions a new comedy program will join the vh1 lineup 
this fall 
what music videos did to music we can do to information and 
entertainment said ed bennett vh1s president ratings have yet 
to take off 
john reardon the new president of mtv echoed the theme of 
diversifying as he explained the burst of packaged shows now 
arriving on mtvs schedule clearly weve been trying to keep the 
viewer interested longer 
so mtvs videos from acts such as bon jovi madonna and prince 
are being supplemented by the dance program club mtv the rap 
show yo mtv raps monty pythons flying circus regular 
news broadcasts occasional concerts and a variety of other original 
programs including remote control 
among other projects discussed for mtvs future are a daily soap 
opera at least two movies and a musicrating show 
originally a property of warneramex nickelodeon is mtvs oldest 
property at age 10 its gross ad billings have grown from 318 
million in 1988 to an estimated 482 million this year according 
to paul kagan and associates 
the childrens service which switches to the sitcomheavy nick 
at nite at 8 pm in most time zones offers whimsical programming 
such as the messy game show double dare the legal sendup 
kids court and the talk show dont just sit there 
were always trying to stay as close to kids as we can said 
geraldine laybourne president of nickelodeon and nick at nite 
and we believe that they deserve a full entertainment network 
everything doesnt have to be a ratings hit 
among the new shows being added to the networks schedule are 
eureekas castle an ambitious daily series for preschoolers 
and hey dude a weekly situation comedy set at a dude ranch a 
childrens cooking show a daily news program and a soap opera also 
are being planned 
and then theres nick at nite 
although nick at nites been around since 1985 its first 
original program a spoof review show called on the television 
was just announced this july other than that nick at nite 
consists of reruns of such ancient sitcoms as mr ed my three 
sons and laughin 
laybourne conceded we have to have something on the network 
where if audiences dont watch tonight theyre going to miss it

if brokers really want to improve their image 
they might consider recording all conversations with their clients 
to do so would provide a service to themselves and their clients 
says james b cloonan it might protect each of them it would tend 
to limit deceit and even the mild puffery that can lead to 
misunderstandings he says 
the idea is also likely to set off a backlash especially from 
sales people expert in the arts and nuances of enticing investors 
into stocks they could do without in effect it would place every 
conversation on the record 
cloonan however observes that the reputation of the industry 
battered in recent years by insider trading scandals may be in need 
of repairs to its image and that electronic documentation can only 
help 
he has some experience in the field being an adviser to the 
congressional office of technology assessment which has been 
seeking ways to prevent fraud through legislation and electronic 
surveillance 
most of that effort however has been involved with the major 
insider trading scandals and with indictments for fraud and various 
securities law violations 
meanwhile he says another serious fraud persists he calls it 
frontoffice fraud it includes churning unsuitable 
recommendations unauthorized trading and making unfulfillable 
promises 
for various reasons says cloonan who is president of the 
110000member chicagobased american association of individual 
investors these activities get much less attention from the legal 
system and the media 
while an individual involved in insider trading may go to 
prison and pay a fine of millions of dollars the broker who cheats 
a retired person out of his life savings seems to get a short 
suspension or a small fine he says 
cloonan a former professor thinks so highly of the need for 
recording broker conversations that he wrote an editorial on the 
subject for the aaii journal frontoffice fraud must be more 
vigorously prosecuted he says 
he believes the reason prosecutions arent as common in this area 
is that so much boils down to a conversation involving only two 
people his word against hers perhaps a misunderstanding who 
knows 
as a consequence criminal prosecution isnt likely and civil 
action or arbitration usually involves some kind of modest 
settlement and the punishments may be a temporary or permanent 
suspension of broker privileges 
i see reports of such behavior not only in boiler room 
pennystock operations but in the betterknown brokerage firms as 
well he says and he adds temptation may grow as retail brokers 
incur profitability pressures 
of course investors themselves could record conversations or 
keep a journal but cloonan believes those individuals most likely 
to be cheated are the least likely to do so in his view it should 
be the brokers job 
with todays technology i see no reason why conversations 
shouldnt be recorded he says in fact some discount stock and 
commodity brokers already use such methods to record oral orders 
erasing the tapes after confirmation 
the very existence of the recording would tend to place 
constraints on exaggeration and fraud and the recording would 
provide evidence in cases where laws were violated customer and 
sales person alike would benefit 
it would be nice for investors to be able to prove what they 
authorized said cloonan and it would be nice for brokers to be 
protected from unjust accusations from confused clients when that 
is the case

after years of preparation and realigning his 
familys multimillion dollar television business robert p buford 
undertook a second career one that spends money instead of making 
it but better fulfills the motto engraved on his desk nameplate 
on a mission for god 
buford a management aficionado has turned from television to a 
different kind of network leadership network where he brings 
together pastors of large churches to talk about running their huge 
organizations 
we found that theres more in common or more similarity 
between a large methodist a presbyterian and a bible church or 
charismatic church even in the leadership function than there is 
between a large church and a small church in the same 
denomination buford said 
the skills needed to run such an organization staffing 
organizing motivating budgeting are largely ignored in 
seminaries and are usually treated as continuing education 
in the five years since buford began his crusade to bring better 
management to large churches those with more than 1000 attending 
weekly he has brought together the 400 senior pastors from various 
denominations plus other church and organizational staff in 
separate meetings most of them at a conference center in colorado 
springs colo 
what we hope to accomplish is to provide an environment where 
they could hear how to help one another operate in those 
circumstances buford said adding that there are 10000 large 
churches in the country 
the discussions at the threeday long sessions generally revolve 
around three areas buford said how to set a vision so that the 
church is cohesive how to manage staff and how to retain their 
personal spiritual vitality 
and its all free except for the transportation because buford 
foots the bill 
it struck me that a mans life does not consist of bread alone 
that i should live a life of service as well as a life of 
accumulation said buford a member of a midsized episcopal church 
where he teaches some bible classes 
i had in my middle 30s a clear desire to at some point lead a 
life of service and ill be 50 in september and i feel that im 
embarking on that parallel career 
buford is chairman and chief executive officer of buford 
television inc which owns wmbbtv a vhf station in panama city 
fla and cable systems in 120 cities and counties in six states 
a private man buford has deliberately kept a low profile in his 
own community a recent interview at his office tucked away on a 
wooded lot outside of tyler is the only one he has given and he has 
declined repeated offers to become involved in various local civic 
organizations 
buford who says his model is industrialistphilanthropist andrew 
carnegie only reluctantly agreed that he could be described as a 
millionaire although he owns a third of bti 
buford said he has spent six or seven years preparing his 
family and realigning bti to allow him to spend about half his time 
dealing with leadership network 
like buford leadership network has been almost invisible there 
is no advertising and participants in the invitationonly meetings 
are recruited on recommendation from other pastors 
even at a retail cost of 27980 buford says he doesnt expect 
to make a profit and may even lose money but thats ok 
his leadership organization is branching out and joining forces 
with management guru peter f drucker who has produced the 
nonprofit drucker a fivevolume series of discussions with 
leaders of nonprofit organizations 
buford said he and drucker believe the mission of a church may be 
different from many nonprofit institutions but the management 
issues are not 
in his latest book the new realities drucker extols the 
place volunteerism or the third sector has in the nations 
economy 
the third sector is actually the countrys largest employer 
though neither its workforce nor the output it produces show up in 
the statistics drucker writes 
he estimates 90 million people work as volunteers in addition to 
their regular jobs there are 979000 nonprofit organizations 
drucker says they are the fastest growing segment of american 
society and with this growth has come an urgent need for a 
comprehensive resource geared specifically to management challenges 
that the leaders of nonprofit institutions face every day 
management used to be a bad word in nonprofit institutions it 
implied big business drucker says adding that nonprofits are 
big business and must be held accountable 
in the nonprofit organization we use other peoples money 
the donors money or tax money and we are accountable for it 
drucker says the specific threat to the nonprofit organization 
is to become mired in mismanagement through paper work procedures 
and myriad decision makers

government helicopters and 
warplanes have stepped up attacks on suspected guerrilla positions 
near towns in the northern war zone but local civilians say the 
rockets bombs and bullets have hit homes in the area and left 
civilians terrified 
a nun said rockets hit near a school where a crowd of children 
were at play 
this town of 1000 people in the heart of el salvadors 
rebeldominated mountains was the only municipality to suffer direct 
hits in raids aug 1920 but inhabitants of surrounding hamlets are 
angered and worried by the governments use of powerful weapons in 
civilian areas 
only by the providence of god was none of the children 
killed sister teresa racia said as she described a raid aug 19 
that left rocket craters and strafing damage across town 
she said more than 200 children were playing around the adobe 
schoolhouse when a helicopter gunship arrived and one rocket crashed 
into a hillside 60 yards away and a second just 15 yards away 
minutes after the ussupplied uh1m gunship blasted the 
surrounding cornfields and hills a c47 warplane strafed las flores 
with 50caliber machine guns firing 
the paving stones looked like they were exploding said elias 
menjivar whose house was one of a dozen damaged they were even 
smoking 
rev miguel vasquez a roman catholic priest in arcatao said an 
a37 dropped four bombs aug 20 at the nearby hamlet of santa rita 
damaging three houses 
peasant farmers andres cordova and felipe orellana said their 
hamlet los pozos was strafed the same day 
there was combat near the houses and they called in the 
airplanes cordova said six houses were damaged everyone was 
panicstricken 
orellana said it seems the planes are coming more often and 
closer to the houses and it makes you afraid 
the air force says that air strikes are made only against 
military targets but in densely populated el salvador few areas are 
well away from civilians 
chalatenango province is one of the most foughtover areas in the 
nearly decadeold war between the 56000member ussupplied and 
trained armed forces and about 7000 marxistled guerrillas 
air power is the armed forces single biggest tactical advantage 
over the rebels who control a wide northern swath of the 
massachusettssized country 
but the danger of catastrophic error such as a direct hit on 
the las flores schoolhouse has increased lately because new 
antiaircraft weapons acquired by the guerrillas force government 
pilots to attack from higher altitudes and therefore with less 
accuracy 
since late last year the rebels have received several hundred 
sovietdesigned dragunov sniper rifles when used against aircraft 
the dragunovs effective range of 3000 feet obliges government 
pilots to stay higher in the sky 
the guerrillas also have obtained several thousand ak47 rifles 
and they have been trained to fire them at helicopters and aircraft 
flying below 2000 feet 
while they rarely bring down aircraft the groundfire wounds 
crewmen and damages the aircraft pilots report taking more hits and 
abandoning more missions than at any time in the war

its business as usual in shanghai for 
most of its 12 million people a little more than two months since 
prodemocracy demonstrations shook china they go about making a 
living haggling in the markets sitting around talking and playing 
cards on the sidewalk 
the people of chinas most cosmopolitan city seem relaxed and 
cheerful as they sit under the chestnut trees squeezed between tall 
gray walls and bustling narrow streets 
things are about the same as before here said one man 
sitting outside the electronics factory where he works we all get 
the same salary no matter how hard we work so were taking it 
easy 
like beijing shanghai was hit by protests in may and june when 
workers and students demanding democracy blocked streets with buses 
sat on railroad tracks set a train ablaze and gathered by the tens 
of thousands in the citys peoples square 
but unlike beijing which has been under martial law since may 
20 shanghais officials did not have to call in the army what 
happened in beijing the army attacks and the killings was enough 
to subdue shanghai 
historically shanghai has been a seat of rebellion in china the 
communist party was formed here in 1921 the seeds of rebellion 
against foreign imperialists germinated here after world war i from 
shanghai mao tsetung launched his turbulent ultraleftist 196676 
cultural revolution 
political repression is much less obvious here than in beijing 
the national capital where police surveillance cameras are trained 
on many streets and soldiers with automatic rifles stand watch at 
major intersections and government buildings 
in shanghai the cameras are far fewer and police at government 
buildings carry only small revolvers a truckload of greenclad 
soldiers is a rare enough sight downtown that it draws stares 
shanghai is chinas top manufacturing center and its people dress 
and eat well its also one of the worlds most densely populated 
cities with 65000 people jammed in per square mile in contrast to 
about 23500 per square mile in new york city 
markets are filled with shoppers taking time out from the workday 
to haggle over fresh and salted fish red peppers huge scallions 
and fresh noodle dough 
at night families sitting outside to escape the heat of their 
dark crowded apartments seem relaxed friendly and willing to chat 
shanghais all right said a sales clerk in a dry goods 
store we never did get too nervous there arent any troops 
here 
a young government official said id say things are pretty 
relaxed here shanghai people are known for business they dont 
care much for politics 
still the turmoil of may and june which shook more than 80 
chinese cities has had a deep impact on some aspects of life in 
shanghai 
for example the city has seen a sharp decline in foreign tourism 
and business travelers since the unrest 
before june i could make about 300 yuan 81 a month a 
taxi driver said now im lucky to make 100 yuan 27 
the students dont understand that common people like me need 
to improve our living standards life just isnt comfortable here 
a secondyear science student at fudan university whose students 
helped lead the protests agreed the protests were less popular in 
shanghai than in beijing where hundreds of thousands of people 
risked their lives to support the students 
most people were somewhere in the middle he said they 
didnt fully support the students but then they thought what the 
government did in beijing was too cruel 
many people especially older people still believe in 
socialism and in the communist party they dont support student 
uprisings 
but officials in shanghai have taken measures against some of the 
protesters and their sympathizers 
the weekly newspaper world economic herald which challenged 
official policies and expressed support for democracy has been 
closed while its employees accused of antigovernment activities 
undergo thought reform 
theyre correcting their thinking said a guard at the 
publications gate 
students in shanghai also face political reeducation that could 
seriously disrupt their studies an official report says the city 
government will set up 500 production centers to give the citys 
120000 college students practical experience and enhance their 
political consciousness 
police arrested more than 150 people in midnight raids following 
the protests officials say ninetynine others have been arrested 
or investigated for allegedly participating in underground political 
groups several dissident writers are reportedly under house arrest 
the student at fudan university looks cautiously over his 
shoulder as he talks to a foreigner 
many students will get black marks in their files that will do 
a lot of damage later on he said 
people certainly havent forgotten about it but its just like 
a bad dream we dont want to talk about theres a long road ahead 
of us

experts are restoring the spectacular 
centuriesold castle of alukhaidir a crumbling architectural 
masterpiece and iraqs oldest islamic monument as part of an 
ambitious program to revive the nations ancient glories 
the 120million restoration program also calls for the 
conservation of other small palaces in the western desert not far 
from the shiite moslem shrines at karbala and najaf 100 miles south 
of baghdad the capital 
the restorations will make iraqs early arab heritage more 
accessible to visitors and provide a contrast with the renowned 
ancient sites of ur babylon nimrud and nineveh in the north of the 
country the conservators say 
president saddam hussein is striving to bolster iraqs image by 
promoting its ancient greatness and its history of civilization that 
dates back at least 6000 years 
during the 8year war against iran in the persian gulf saddam 
portrayed iraq as an arab bulwark against persian aggression by 
recalling assyrian and babylonian victories over the persians in the 
first millenium bc 
alukhaidir characterizes that ancient glory with its 48 towers 
and thick walled fortifications still rising 65 feet above the 
desert it looms as a striking landmark visible for miles 
the british scholar gertrude bell who visited alukhaidir in 
1909 called it a solitary magnificence which rose out of the 
desert 
two years later she concluded that the architecture was the 
logical outcome of the period of cultural transition when arabs 
switched from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle 
historians and archaeologists differ on how old the castle is 
but agree it was built by an arab emir or caliph in the century 
after the islamic conquest of iraq in the mid7th century ad 
whoever built it the castle testifies that the first islamic 
builders assimilated neighboring civilization an assimilation 
which later expressed itself in a high order of artistic impulse 
said abdul aattar alazawi head of the restoration team 
the complex was built of rough stones hauled from surrounding 
areas with mud brick used for interior walls it was coated with 
gypsum a soft white plaster for protection against rain and the 
sandstorms that still howl in from the desert 
the palace filled most of the interior of the complex featuring 
a huge banquet hall guest suites guardrooms a mosque and baths 
as well as two large assembly areas the stairways on the walls were 
broad enough for defenders to ride horses up to the battlements 
the restorers aided by a small army of sudanese and egyptian 
laborers are using traditional materials for the reconstructions 
including trunks of datepalms to replace missing roofs villagers 
in the region still use that method in roofing their mud brick 
houses 
alazawi said the castle was the first important structural 
monument built by the arabs after they established themselves in 
areas formerly ruled by the sassanian and byzantine empires 
no doubt the interaction and even borrowing from these 
civilizations are still evident but the arab contribution can 
easily be detected he said 
warriors from the arabian peninsula set out in the 7th century to 
conquer the sassanian empire 
they occupied iraq but it was another century before the 
abbasids broke free from the syrianled umaiyad dynasty and 
transformed iraq into islams most prosperous region 
there are no inscriptions or records by which archaeologists can 
establish the date the castle was founded oddly for such a 
monumental building complex alukhaidir isnt mentioned by early 
islamic poets or historians 
azawi is also working to piece together evidence suggesting the 
castle stood at a crossroads of caravan routes across the desert 
linking trading centers in iraq and syria 
when gertrude bell visited the castle she found bedouin nomads 
camped in the ruined palace 
they were evicted in the 1930s when the first restorations were 
made but they still flock to the area for water from nearby springs 
and wells and for pasture for their cattle

they are urban pioneers squatters who are 
inhabiting manhattans derelict buildings with or without legal 
sanction while many of the squatters especially on the lower east 
side are drug users and dealers many are simply working people 
trying to find an affordable place to live in a city where housing 
costs are astounding

in the world of new york real estate anne edris 
has the deal of a lifetime a brickwalled studio apartment that 
costs 50 a month 
there are however two main drawbacks 
1 she must share a bathroom with 14 other residents of the 
building 
2 the city could come by any time and tear down the building 
edris and her neighbors are squatters in a ramshackle structure 
on manhattans lower east side before they moved in it was a 
vacant shell that had reverted to city ownership 
now this building and dozens like it have sprung to life once 
again much as the homesteaders populated the west urban squatters 
have inhabited some of the crumbling hollows of the nations largest 
city legally or illegally 
they rehabilitate the buildings decorate their apartments hook 
up to utilities sometimes illegally and live communally 
edris is an aspiring artist who works in the photography 
department of an architectural firm ive always liked the idea of 
reclaiming abandoned buildings and i really believe in what were 
doing here she says 
the rent edris pays goes into a building fund used to 
refurbish the building she won the right to live in the building 
only after its tenants association voted her into the building much 
as a coop board would do all tenants are required to perform 
structural and esthetic work on the building any improvements she 
makes on her space are up to her 
not everyone shares edies enthusiasm mayor edward i koch and 
other city officials are hostile 
our basic position is that people shouldnt live in unsafe 
buildings says mayoral spokesman lee jones if a building is 
demonstrably unsafe it is incumbent on the city to remove the 
threat of danger 
the squatters though defend their homes tenaciously 
in may when the city moved to demolish a building that had been 
occupied by squatters for nearly five years residents attacked 
police guarding the demolition crew a police car window was 
smashed a woman jumped on the back of a police supervisor and began 
beating him police retreated 
the growing crowd marched to a nearby condominium building they 
threw bricks and rocks through the buildings window before police 
broke up the demonstration and made some arrests 
a court order temporarily blocking the demolition was overturned 
in the middle of the night the citys housing preservation and 
development crew tore down the building as hundreds of police 
officers in riot gear stood guard 
if the wrecking ball arrives at edris building she says 
weve already decided that were going to handcuff ourselves to 
the fire escape rather than let them tear our house down 
to enter edris building one must navigate a narrow hallway 
cluttered with construction debris assorted junk lumber painting 
and cleaning supplies 
dust and dirt filter through holes and cracks in the buildings 
floors and ceiling and climbing the stairs requires a keen eye for 
loose and missing boards 
in most apartments much work remains to be done but there are 
signs everywhere that modest as they are these are peoples homes 
and in five maybe seven years residents say this building will be 
a source of pride 
by that time they hope the city will allow them to legally 
remain in the building or allow them to earn credit for refurbishing 
the building and buy it at a bargain price its a wish edris 
realizes may never come true 
many people who squat however are just pleased to have a roof 
over their heads ownership of the building is not a pressing 
concern 
some apartments in edris building are clean although there are 
holes in the walls and no windows others are filthy they vary in 
size with tenants in the larger apartments paying 100 a month 
edris has removed layers of plaster to expose the brick walls of 
her neatly arranged thirdfloor apartment plastic covers the 
ceiling to catch dirt from upstairs the wooden floor is faded but 
clean 
a portable stereo is set to a jazz station as edris shows where 
she will erect a wall to divide her apartment and create a studio 
work space 
the apartment is twice the size of her old one and comes at 
onetenth the cost still she is concerned about her parents 
reaction when they come to visit from bluffton ind theyll 
probably be shocked at first and be glad they dont live here but 
theyll still support me she says 
next door rico martinez and noel faulkner are installing support 
beams in a large open room 
where the rats were living is where we live says martinez a 
trade school student in his 30s the city tells us to go to the 
homeless shelters hell let them stay there ive been there were 
safer here we take care of each other here 
why is faulkner working so hard on this building you have to 
give back you cant just walk around saying the city stinks crime 
stinks you have to put something in says faulkner an actor 
or you can call it workingitoff karma he says laughing 
it makes up for all the pot we smoked in the 60s

a visitor asks if the building has running water and electricity 
yeah but its not legal yet edris says we have running 
water we have a bathroom and a shower and were putting in others 
so that we can have a bathroom on every floor 
at the moment the only bathroom is on the bottom floor and is 
shared by the 15 people living in the building 
residents and their friends inevitably include carpenters 
electricians plumbers and construction workers who can make water 
hookups and power connections with or without permission from 
utility firms or the city 
a notice in one squat tells residents what jobs they must do 
and reminds them to take their trash to a public garbage can on the 
corner 
at another a bulletin board notice warns do you want to live 
in the dark and tells each resident to ante up or the power 
company consolidated edison will shut off the electricity 
to some con eds willingness to service an abandoned building 
might be surprising were customers we pay says one squatter 
who declined to give his name everyones entitled to have 
electricity 
hes right under the states home energy fair practices act con 
ed extends service when requested and certain criteria are met says 
martha liipfert a spokeswoman for the utility 
if theres a meter there we cant really turn down service as 
long as there are no safety problems liipfert says 
the company will even provide service on a communal basis 
billing the building and allowing the residents to split the cost 
liipfert says 
others do not pay for power choosing instead to hook up to a 
nearby street lamp in the often anarchic world of the squats all 
is fair 
the lower east side which has seen wave upon wave of immigrants 
move in and out is now a home to blacks hispanics eastern 
europeans drug dealers and addicts and a mix of punks motorcycle 
gangs artists and other fringe elements 
but a new influx of wellheeled residents has heightened 
tensions residents claim the city wants to bring down old buildings 
so restaurants and coops acceptable to yuppies can be built in 
their place 
when police tried to enforce a curfew at nearby tompkins square 
park last summer a riot ensued residents claimed the curfew was 
part of an effort to sanitize the neighborhood so it is acceptable 
to the affluent 
buildings near tompkins square still bear spraypainted messages 
die yuppie scum need a home take one squat and yuppies 
go home 
in july police and park police evicted homeless people living in 
tompkins square park and tore down tents and leantos they were 
enforcing a new city law forbidding structures to be built in parks 
angry residents retaliated by burning police barricades police 
in riot gear arrested 31 people several days later protesters 
marched into the park and defiantly pitched a tent more people were 
arrested 
the city denies it is engaged in social engineering vahe 
teryakian spokesman for the city department of buildings says 
evictions and demolitions dont occur unless the city has received a 
specific complaint and an inspection determines a building is unsafe 
squatters however say their buildings are safe having been 
inspected by friends who are architects and engineers 
george marco 31 will dispute any contention that the work he 
and his friends have done on their building near tompkins square is 
substandard 
we put in all new stairways did the structural work and did 
most of the plumbing in the building says marco an electrical 
worker we did all the electric everything in the building has 
been brought up to code nothing has been scrimped on 
it was a cityowned building that had been abandoned by private 
owners about 15 years ago it sat there empty and deteriorated we 
salvaged that building and created homes 
marcos fourthfloor apartment is no exemplar of good 
housekeeping it is a haphazard aggregation of unfinished plumbing 
and carpentry projects 
the pride on his face cant be suppressed however when he shows 
his visitors the bathroom complete with tub shower sink and 
commode that he installed got hot and cold water he beams 
the homeless and urban pioneers are not the only squatters the 
biggest squatting efforts are by the drug users especially in the 
lower east side says peter smith head of the partnership for the 
homeless 
but marco defends his friends and neighbors and the hundreds of 
others who are fixing walls stringing wire rebuilding stairways 
and joining pipes at dilapidated buildings all across the lower east 
side 
sure weve had problems with drugs but this has been going on 
all over the country all over the place marco says but to 
single out people who are homesteading buildings and classifying 
them as being drug addicts is totally biased and totally wrong 
i want to let it be known that the people who are working and 
living in this building are not junkies theyre not druggies 
theyre not outcasts or anything like that

trivia humor and momentous events are among the 
lessons in american history provided by the eight presidential 
museums which drew 12 million visitors last year including 9000 
researchers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
most visitors to the gerald r ford museum in grand rapids 
mich are drawn to the fullsize replica of the oval office but a 
few feet away is an inconspicuous document for which fords 
presidency may best be remembered 
unlike many other exhibits there is no accompanying audiotape or 
video only a glassencased document in which ford grants richard 
nixon a full free and absolute pardon 
we get a lot of comments on that one says frank mackaman 
director of the ford museum and library 
there is almost as much interest in the display of green bay 
packers coach curly lambeaus letter offering ford a professional 
football contract following his graduation from the university of 
michigan 
recently donated to the museum was the gun used by lynette 
squeaky fromm in an attempt to assassinate ford 14 years ago 
nuggets about the men behind the office are part of the lesson in 
american history provided by the eight presidential librarymuseums 
run by the national archives 
plenty of priceless presidential trivia is thrown in too 
the franklin d roosevelt library and museum in hyde park ny 
displays the presidents wheelchair a kitchen chair with the legs 
cut off and wheels attached 
at harry s trumans library in independence mo theres a 
cabinet with about 150 canes sent to the former president from all 
over the united states 
he carried a cane even though nothing was wrong with him so 
people started sending him canes says archivist ray geselbracht 
weve got a drawer with hundreds of pairs of gloves that people 
sent the first lady bess truman i dont know why i dont think 
she ever wore any of them 
at the herbert hoover library and museum in west branch iowa 
the first working television set is displayed because hoovers image 
was the first of an american president to be projected it happened 
in the mid1920s on a broadcast from washington to new york city 
theres also a photograph of hoover fishing in a stream wearing 
rubber boots and a threepiece suit 
that man was never in casual clothes says curator maureen 
harding 
on the sites of the hoover roosevelt and truman libraries and 
the dwight d eisenhower center in abilene kansas are the 
presidents burial sites and their birth or boyhood homes 
having the library in the presidents hometown not only enables 
people to see the president in the context of his childhood it also 
allows the town to relate to the presidency in an intellectual 
environment as well as a patriotic one says jill brett 
spokeswoman for the national archives 
the structures of the libraries themselves also are telling 
before i ever became associated with the library system i was 
struck by the impression that each of the facilities reflects the 
personality of the incumbent mackaman says 
the ford museum is a very comfortable place to see an exhibit 
and president ford is very comfortable with himself his place in 
history mackaman says a trip to john f kennedys library he 
says is a very somber experience while lyndon b johnsons is 
quite grandiose 
about 12 million people many of them schoolchildren visited 
the museums in 1988 and about 9000 researchers studied in the 
libraries each of which contains thousands of presidential papers 
and photographs 
the museums are built with private funds but operation which 
totaled 162 million in 1988 is federally subsidized 
the johnson center on the campus of the university of texas at 
austin is the largest and most popular library with more than 
300000 visitors a year followed by the kennedy library in boston 
there is a lovehate relationship with our politicians and our 
leaders in general says james kratsas newly appointed curator at 
the ford museum people come here to see how government works but 
also presidents represent a time in our lives 
presidential museums are popular among tour groups some families 
plan their vacations around them 
kratsas former curator at the 3yearold jimmy carter library in 
atlanta says that a day after the carter museum opened he met a 
san diego family that had flown there for the day because it was the 
only presidential museum they hadnt visited 
some former presidents were deeply involved in the direction of 
their libraries 
truman who lived less than a mile from the library following his 
retirement had an office in the building he would sometimes 
surprise schoolchildren by giving impromptu tours 
some classified documents are off display for national security 
reasons but presidents often help decide how to handle the 
sensitive issues of their administrations 
president carter wanted to deal with the iranian hostage crisis 
in a display and president ford evidently wanted to deal with 
the pardon kratsas says 
a prepared speech in the ford museum written before richard 
nixon was charged with any crimes in connection with watergate 
reads i have the greatest confidence in the president and i am 
absolutely positive he had nothing to do with this mess 
next to the official pardon are several critical letters and 
just a few supportive of fords decision 
documents regarding his assassination are absent from the kennedy 
library says deputy curator frank rigg 
the library illustrates his life and the enthusiasm he 
embraced rigg says theres something about our museum that 
takes people back into their own lives most people do not find it 
to be a sad experience because there is an inspirational side to 
it 
the presidential library system was inaugurated by roosevelt 
before his day presidential papers handwritten notes and 
memorabilia were considered personal items and were kept either in 
the library of congress or snatched up by university libraries or 
private collectors 
the museums chronicle the presidents lives before and after 
their administrations and in some cases dispel myths 
president hoover is mainly remembered as the president during 
the depression and thats very unfortunate harding says when 
he was elected six months earlier he was a national hero and won by 
the biggest landslide ever 
the archives establishment of richard nixons library has been 
stalled because of litigation involving the ownership of the 44 
million documents thousands of photos and 4000 hours of taped 
conversation from his administration nixon is building his own 
library in yorba linda calif 
ronald reagans library is scheduled to open in 1991 in thousand 
oaks calif 
the various cities that president bush has called home already 
are fighting for rights to his library

autoworker jim del conte was nearing retirement 
when an accident compounded by a doctors error left him physically 
and mentally handicapped rumors of bad medical care had circulated 
for years at the plant where del conte worked now chrysler corp 
is challenging the quality of care provided to dozens of its workers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after more than three decades as an 
autoworker and 20 years as a union official jim del conte was at 
the pinnacle of his career 
a simple industrial accident a long series of medical procedures 
and a doctors error have left him with the faculties of a child and 
his peers with questions about adequate medical care 
i think what has happened to jim del conte is horrible i love 
him like a brother and really feel for him and his family says 
rudy kuzel a longtime friend and bargaining chairman for united 
auto workers local 72 
del contes case was often cited by workers and union officials 
this summer after chrysler corp announced it was challenging the 
quality of medical care provided dozens of injured workers at its 
nowclosed kenosha assembly plant 
chrysler is refusing to pay some 200 workers compensation claims 
and is reviewing an additional 300 medical bills the automaker says 
it made the decision after an outside consultant determined the care 
provided to many former kenosha workers was inappropriate 
unreasonable and excessive 
del contes case is not believed among the claims being 
challenged 
because chrysler has stated it will not hold the workers liable 
for the bills and will provide them with legal assistance union 
officials have given the challenge a favorable response 
i wish this would have happened five years ago because maybe 
all that wouldnt have happened to jimmy kuzel says 
kuzel says rumors of bad medical treatment have circulated among 
workers for more than a decade and he hopes chryslers challenge 
will give everybody their day in court 
del conte 58 was an executive board member of uaw local 72 for 
20 years his hard work and friendly demeanor won him widespread 
popularity among the citys blue and whitecollar ranks 
his wife rose marie says her husband looked forward to retiring 
to spend more time with her his five children and eight 
grandchildren 
instead he spends most of his time sitting at home dependent on 
his family for care his speech is broken his brain is damaged and 
his body is partially paralyzed from the waist up 
dad is more like a 5yearold sometimes than a grandfather 
says michelle scuglik del contes 37yearold daughter who 
remembers her father as active strong and consumed with work 
del contes troubles began in february 1983 when he slipped and 
fell on ice while working at the kenosha plant then owned by 
american motors corp the plant was sold in 198687 to chrysler and 
closed last december laying off about 5000 workers 
del conte developed lowback pain and was hospitalized twice for 
a total of about two weeks immediately after the accident 
according to legal documents and court testimony del conte was 
referred to dr galo tan who has offices in gurnee ill and is on 
staff at american international hospital in zion ill 
under tans care he was hospitalized several times in 1986 and 
1987 in february 1986 tan performed a cervical laminectomy in which 
bone spurs believed to be pinching nerves and causing pain were 
removed from a vertebra in del contes neck 
the pain continued del conte was hospitalized several more 
times exposed to nearly 100 xrays and given a variety of 
treatments including a series of nerve blocks in which medicine was 
injected to temporarily stop the pain 
in december 1987 about a year after he retired del conte 
entered american hospital for the last time complaining as he had 
in the past of back and neck pain and headaches 
tan wrote orders for dr celan t ordonez an anesthesiologist at 
american to perform another nerve block this time in the upper 
spine near where the laminectomy had been performed 
ordonez performed the nerve block dec 15 1987 using among 
other drugs marcaine a strong longlasting anesthetic 
within minutes del conte went into cardiac arrest and then a 
coma he was revived but remained in a coma or semicomatose state 
through february 1988 
del conte was moved from american to froedtert memorial hospital 
in wauwatosa after the mishap for more than three months his family 
traveled 40 miles from kenosha each day to be with him 
del conte was later transferred to sacred heart rehabilitation 
hospital in milwaukee for therapy and then released to the care of 
his family he undergoes therapy twice a week 
del contes lawyer james a pitts of racine says his client has 
only partial use of his arms has difficulty speaking clearly and 
has an iq of about 80 because of brain damage 
pitts filed a lawsuit against tan and ordonez on behalf of the 
del contes 
ordonez insurance carrier settled before the trial for 920000 
of that 75000 went to reimburse the del contes insurance carrier 
for medical bills 
a us district court jury in illinois acquitted tan of any 
wrongdoing in connection with the coma pitts had argued tan should 
be held responsible because he ordered the treatment that led to the 
mishap 
but defense witnesses testified that the procedure could be 
performed safely in the right hands and that only ordonez could be 
held responsible 
pitts says the del contes lawsuit only challenged the procedure 
that led to the coma and did not raise the question of whether del 
contes overall care was excessive 
that was not the issue but it would have been nice if that 
stuff came in that may be a separate issue of whether there was 
overtreatment here pitts says 
while the issue of overtreatment was not a factor in the civil 
trial it was alluded to in documents accompanying the lawsuit many 
referred to the countless xrays and hospitalizations del conte 
endured 
dr david s dahl chairman of neurology at the university of 
wisconsin medical school criticized the low level of record 
documentation and general competency regarding the case and the 
overreliance on epidural injections for treatment 
while chrysler challenges the medical care other workers 
received the del contes will be able to live comfortably because of 
a pension social security disability checks and the settlement 
pitts says 
but you cant put a value on what the guy has lost he adds 
his mind is like one of the grandchildren someone has to be with 
him all the time his family has to take care of him

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for rene dumont whos been grumbling i told you 
so for 50 years new focus on global environment comes not a 
moment too soon 
if we dont do something fast were finished it is as simple 
as that says dumont whose 32 books make that point in chilling 
detail 
a french agronomist turned agitatoradvocate for the planet at 
large dumont still evokes sly smiles among countrymen used to his 
white hair red sweater and green politics 
at 85 dumont spends more time in france before small provincial 
audiences than television cameras but abroad his colleagues now 
see him as a prophet whose cries in the wilderness should have been 
heard 
the prophetic nature of his vision is spectacular wrote 
lloyd timberlake an american environmentalist in a preface to a 
fresh edition of dumonts classic false start in africa 
dumont timberlake added remains an eccentric a gadfly an 
agent provocateur in the very best sense of the word 
dumont trots the globe collecting honorary doctorates and 
speaking he scrambles for early flights on hectic schedules but he 
never misses his nap even if it means stretching out in a crowded 
room 
he is cheered on now that environmental issues are finally 
reaching summit conference agendas its coming he says 
eyebrows bristling like mystic antennae its coming 
at a recent panel in spain timberlake picked up a main theme 
dumont has hammered away at for decades careless needless emission 
of gases threatens catastrophic weather changes 
look at africa said dumont his words rising to a crescendo 
first we stole their labor then we stole their primary products 
and now we are stealing their weather 
in a nottoodistant future he warned everyone else is next 
dumont clutched his notes and flailed at unseen culprits with 
them his eyes twinkling at irony and burning at punch lines 
suggested he might leap up and convert words to action 
in the small apartment at the edge of paris where he once thought 
hed retire he expands on the point more calmly 
everyone blames aerosol sprays but the problem is automobiles 
carbon dioxide emissions he says we keep on as if there is 
nothing wrong no danger no urgency what madness 
with new evidence he stresses constant themes education the 
status of women population control fair trade and development are 
as vital to saving the world as scientific remedies 
poverty desperation and ignorance cause ecological plunder he 
says but greed and extravagance cause much more 
we waste half the energy we produce he says and we are 
killing ourselves it is suicide 
the difference between dumont and most others who deliver that 
message is that hes watched it happen up close since his father 
taught him about agriculture in postworld war i france 
i studied agriculture because you have to understand the world 
to change it he says rather than focusing on a neighborhood in 
france i looked at the whole world but it is the same thing 
as a colonial officer in indochina in 1934 he wrote a book about 
rice that also told how officials destroyed 500000 tons of rice to 
bolster the price of french wheat 
that set a lifelong pattern mingling hard truths about official 
incompetence with scientific wisdom dumont left both devoted 
followers and bitter enemies in his wake 
he repeatedly sacrificed comfortable government posts for the 
right to speak out in the early 1960s as most of africa broke into 
small independent nations dumont took a customary hard look 
he saw european economists encouraging africans to produce export 
crops at cheap prices laying waste to fragile lands while 
neglecting farmers they depended upon for food 
he noticed young african men swelling inept bureaucracies while 
women left unschooled in the fields accounted for the only 
production 
if your sister goes to school dumont told one young african 
clerk youll have nothing to eat but your fountain pen 
it took economists 25 years to focus on these basic crises 
despite three more dumont books on the subject 
dumont was so close to the mark that president julius nyerere of 
tanzania and kenneth kuanda of zambia took his ideas as their own 
although neither put them into practice 
in latin america dumont warned of disappearing rain forests 
rising debt and the economic dominance of coca crops well before 
environmentalists sounded the alarm 
in asia he presaged the green revolution 
today he remains one step ahead the world resources institute 
in washington suggested that natural resources be included in 
measuring a nations economic worth vintage dumont 
a growing number of economists and environmentalists argue that 
gasoline should be heavily taxed to discourage waste and generate 
research funds dumont pressed for that well before the oil crisis 
as agronomists finally consider the specter of mass hunger they 
reach for a book dumont wrote in 1966 we are headed for famine 
in the 1970s he edged into politics he ran for president in 
1974 and won 13 percent of the vote he holds nonspecific leftist 
views that put the earth first his latest book an intolerable 
world picks apart freemarket dogma 
his forthright striding through french politics has caused some 
to lose sight of his scientific expertise and his track record 
some people say i weaken my credibility by being political 
he says they dont understand the environment is politics 
asked why his spirits had not flagged reiterating the obvious to 
the uninterested for so many years dumont shakes his head in sharp 
disagreement and recounts the previous weeks schedule 
if you reach anyone at all you are making an impact he 
says i need everyone to save the planet 
when not lecturing or writing dumont is out learning something 
at the spain panel he skipped lunch and reappeared later 
coddling a bouquet of wildflowers carefully uprooted for study 
his professors salary royalties and assorted earnings might 
allow him to take it easy amid the nature he has defended all his 
life 
i tried four months of retirement he says it was four 
months of nervous depression 
his apartment is spare but for walls of books and a few doodads 
such as a fifth century chinese buffalo and some priceless tang 
horses 
when an interviewer comes to lunch he sweeps his 
worksinprogress off the small antique table he uses as a desk it 
doubles as the dining table 
we dont believe in having a separate room only for eating 
dumont says such a waste

stehekin is a remote community in washingtons 
cascade range reachable only by floatplane boat or wilderness 
trail its a yearround home to 70 people who live a life free of 
telephones supermarkets and other modern conveniences however 
life in stehekin is not free of controversy 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a deer grazes on the lawn of the new 
oneroom schoolhouse nearby a salesman for a nationally 
distributed newspaper pitches a vending machine to operators of the 
only hotel 
its hard to imagine a more remote corner of the continental 
united states than this community of 70 people occupying a narrow 
valley in the majestic cascade range there are no phones and no 
doctors and stehekin cant be reached by car nonetheless people 
manage to find it 
some come by floatplane others take a fourhour boat ride up 
lake chelan starting 55 miles south in the resort town of chelan 
there is a third option a mountain hike on a wilderness trail 
shared by black bears 
the remoteness of stehekin and the adventure of reaching it 
have made the town a popular tourist attraction in summer drawing 
over 40000 visitors from down lake at the same time 
competition for those limited tourist dollars has created a 
capraesque struggle between private citizens and the national park 
service that controls the community since stehekin is in the lake 
chelan national recreation area adjacent to north cascades national 
park 
stehekins location within the recreation area rather than the 
park is important it means that the 600 acres of private land it 
contained when it received national recreation area status in 1968 
are allowed to remain in private hands 
still because of that nra designation what might be an obscure 
civic dispute in another setting is elevated to high drama in 
stehekin where the right to sell cinnamon rolls rent mountain 
bikes or operate a tour bus can determine whether a family is 
banished from the community by economic need 
its hard to make a living up here says roberta courtney a 
longtime resident who just opened a bakery youve got to find 
employment and make enough in the summer to live through the 
winter 
since stehekin has no farming no logging and no industry that 
means tourism 
but even that isnt easy the national park service has a 
monopoly on serving tourists and awards each contract to a lone 
company those contracts require that the concessionaires have a 
reasonable chance of making a profit 
this is supposed to be a monopoly says steve gibson a 
chelan resident under contract until 1992 to operate stehekins 
25room north cascades lodge as well as a small grocery 
restaurant gas station boat rentals tour bus and bike rentals 
the businesses are concentrated at the stehekin boat landing 
where the daily arrival of the lady of the lake with hundreds of 
tourists provides the major activity many tourists stay just the 
hour and a half before the boat returns to chelan 
my contract grants security for my investment says gibson 
who contends he faces heavy expenses for liability insurance and 
winter services that the government demands even when there arent 
any tourists 
the system doesnt sit well with mrs courtney 27 after 
launching her bakery two miles from the landing she was prohibited 
from selling goods to tourists from a cart is that free 
enterprise she asks 
also angry are ron scutt the lone schoolteacher and wife kim 
who rent mountain bikes in defiance of the park service they have 
been stopped from operating a competing tour bus business however 
the scutts contend the current concessionaire is not willing to 
share the wealth with local residents more cooperation would 
help scutt says 
gibson argues that the private entrepreneurs are free to operate 
only during the high tourist season and to set their own prices 
enabling them to provide cheaper services that results in unfair 
competition he contends 
in one form or another the conflict has been going on for 
decades 
there is another side to life in stehekin the magical beauty of 
a mountain valley surrounding a lake situated amid snowcapped peaks 
and evergreens 
the first time we came here we never wanted to leave says 
mrs scutt 39 the scutts two children are among the 10 students 
enrolled in the new school like all buildings in stehekin its 
heated with firewood in winter students ski to class

in summer stehekin takes on the air of a busy campground 
the landing area for the 350passenger lady of the lake is 
downright congested as people stream off the boat some speak german 
or dutch and many are accompanied by young children 
theyre greeted by park service rangers in crisp uniforms or 
local residents in walking shorts polo shirts and fashionable 
sunglasses 
popular activities include hiking biking airplane tours and 
horseback rides the lodge has a hot tub there are evening lectures 
at the information center on subjects ranging from acid rain to 
wildlife myths 
electrical service is provided by a small hydroelectric plant 
and the park service does have a radiotelephone should emergencies 
arise 
still when the last tourist departs in midoctober its hard to 
view stehekin as a trendy vacation spot four feet of snow falls in 
winter and the major lifeline to the outside world becomes a monthly 
supply barge 
a lot of time is devoted to living says philip campbell 
district manager for the park service who oversees the 10 fulltime 
rangers in stehekin you move snow and keep the fireplace going 
residents read socialize ski and swap videocassettes he says 
a few have satellite dishes but most do without broadcast 
television 
campbell came to stehekin indian for the way through from 
delaware water gap national recreation area in new jersey an area 
with 2 million annual visitors i wanted to do this once in my 
career he says this is probably the largest intact piece of 
wilderness in the lower 48 
the scutts raised near philadelphia are typical stehekin 
residents they were dormitory supervisors at washington state 
university in pullman when scutt decided to return to teaching 
choosing to do so in a oneroom schoolhouse 
the scutts have been here 13 years and dont want to leave but 
they may be forced to because their oldest son will soon graduate 
from the eighth grade and must leave town to attend high school 
like other stehekin parents the scutts must decide whether to 
send 13yearold huuti to another town alone split the family with 
one parent moving with him or move the entire family 
we spend a great deal of time over coffee talking about it 
says scutt whos considering sending huuti to a quaker school near 
philadelphia 
despite its remoteness stehekin has a surprisingly diverse 
population one of the 25 park service volunteer rangers this summer 
is judy abrams 21 a student at harvard university who hails from 
atlanta 
taking tourists on a nature walk along forest trials miss abrams 
points out edible berries and bear tracks and identifies trees and 
plants 
when not leading tour groups she digs irrigation ditches at 
stehekins only apple orchard where fruit is picked and eaten by 
residents tourists and the occasional bear she works for lodging 
and 35 per week 
ive got to go back to the big city at summers end she 
says can you imagine what a change its going to be 
mark stewart a yearround resident with three children spends 
two weeks each month working on a tugboat on puget sound and the 
other two weeks living in stehekin i like the isolation says 
stewart who used to live in a seattle suburb were out of the 
mainstream 
the remoteness of stehekin can be a mixed blessing while the 
park service can provide some first aid the closest doctors are in 
chelan and it can take well over an hour to transport an injured 
person by float plane at night the only way to get downlake is by 
boat for that reason pregnant women leave stehekin at least two 
weeks before their delivery dates 
this is not the place to get hurt says campbell who warns 
tourists about the lack of medical facilities 
after raising two sons in stehekin scutt says the key is just 
having faith that misfortune will not occur you cant live here 
if you are constantly afraid of what is going to happen to your 
children 
it also helps in stehekin to be an organized shopper 
residents mail grocery lists along with blank signed checks to 
a grocery store in chelan the store fills the order and places it 
on the lady of the lake for delivery

researchers at pittsburghs carnegie mellon 
university are making beautiful music the newfashioned way with 
computers and sophisticated synthesizers one of their creations is 
a computer that teaches beginners how to play the piano scolding 
them when they make mistakes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
practice makes perfect in piano playing 
especially when the tutor is a computer 
a new computer tutor keeps beginning pianists in line by 
selecting appropriate lessons then monitoring the students efforts 
on an electronic keyboard 
piano tutor as its called is just one example of how 
musicminded researchers are tapping technology and pushing beyond 
the boundaries of the familiar moog synthesizer of the 1960s and 
1970s 
what were doing is learning how to control the technology that 
is part of our culture and thats not just for the sake of using 
technology says craig harris president of the computer music 
association 
we need to reevaluate how we learn how we think about sound 
how we think about music and art 
piano tutor accomplishes that as an instructional tool missing 
nary note nor beat 
there was something extra between these notes try again the 
computer flashes on a screen after a lessthanperfect performance 
by a student 
or 
you waited too long before playing this note 
you played this note too soon be sure to give the preceding 
rest its full value 
your rhythm was very uneven try keeping a steady beat 
during downright awful renditions the computer interrupts and 
instructs students to begin again and again and again if 
necessary 
were trying to model this after real teachers and a real 
teacher would interrupt right at the beginning says roger 
dannenberg a research computer scientist at pittsburghs carnegie 
mellon university 
his collaborators annabelle joseph and marta sanchez music 
professors at carnegie mellon have interrupted countless piano 
students over the years for mistakes mysteriously materializing in 
practice 
the three entered exercises and tunes such as yankee doodle 
dandy into the computer by describing how the music appears on the 
written page and by performing the selections on an attached 
electronic keyboard 
always as piano teachers youre concerned about what happens 
with a student between lessons ms joseph says no matter how 
carefully you explain things strange things happen in the week 
between so you spend a lot of time correcting 
another carnegie mellon researcher paul mcavinney has invented 
videoharp a computerized instrument capable of sensing gestures to 
reproduce the sound of any instrument including an entire orchestra 
images of a performers fingers are reflected by mirrors into an 
optical sensor mcavinney designed from this pattern of light and 
shadow the position and velocity of each fingertip are deduced the 
information subsequently is translated by computer and transmitted 
to synthesizers that produce the sound 
the kind of sound emanating from amplifiers string woodwind 
percussion brass is determined by programs stored in the computer 
it is neat that an absolute musical idiot like myself can make 
a good sound by just having enough flexibility says mcavinney a 
senior research programmer at carnegie mellon and chairman of sensor 
frame corp 
while speaking mcavinney haphazardly brushes his hands across 
both sides of the 13pound trapezoidshaped instrument just as a 
harpist might a stream of deep lush notes never before heard and 
likely never to be heard again fills the small music laboratory 
a lot of people ask me if im a musician i tell them no but i 
dont believe stradivari was either he says 
each finger is capable of reproducing a particular instruments 
sound successively or simultaneously four fingers consequently can 
sound like a string quartet with practice of course 
you certainly cant play each of those instruments the way that 
a person in the orchestra plays each instrument mcavinney says 
no human is capable of that but if anybody ever wants to try 
there it is 
until five or so years ago socalled computer music was 
impractical for live performances since it took longer to compute 
the sound than the sound actually lasted says stephen pope editor 
of the computer music journal 
that changed in the early 1980s with the advent of digital 
synthesizers which enabled instruments to sound like something else 
anything else in fact while played the usual way 
videoharp goes a step further by incorporating totally new ways 
of playing brushing ones toes against the instrument for example 
can generate sounds the same as using ones fingers 
while other researchers around the world are trying to 
communicate with computers on an artistic level the carnegie mellon 
projects are really good major examples of it harris says 
how do you get a machine to be expressive a lot of people have 
complained about that he says even the piano is a machine but 
the leap from the piano to a device like videoharp is a rather large 
leap especially when it involves creating many sounds that are new 
to our hearing 
piano tutor is significant harris says in that it moves beyond 
routine instruction 
there are many programs out there for doing exactly what we did 
in 1950 but now doing it in computers treating learning as if it 
were a notebook a classroom going page by page by page and not 
really paying attention to what that particular person needs right 
now he says 
in addition to tracking pupils efforts piano tutor features a 
builtin metronome and provides accompaniment on request students 
also can watch a prerecorded videodisc of piano teachers in action 
to see how their own hands and posture should look 
piano tutor is still evolving according to dannenberg and 
should be commercially available in three years 
some people most notably musicians worry that computers 
eventually may replace instrumentalists even if those concerns 
prove true harris believes there will be more not fewer jobs 
its not that were taking six peoples work and turning it 
into one whos using a synthesizer he says thats a real myth 
because were creating many new fields and were creating new uses 
of instruments and were creating a huge need for teachers who 
understand where its going 
while admittedly unconventional there is nothing radically new 
or weird about computer music according to pope 
its just composers using the stateoftheart technology of 
our time which happens to be software and computers he said 
its no less musical if a composer is involved in technology

nicaraguan contra rebels based here are 
bitter because the united states has agreed they should disband but 
some say they wont give up and will return to the nicaraguan 
jungles 
the united states abandoned us when we needed them said a 
contra fighter who uses the battle name jonas because the 
biblical jonas was delivered safely from the belly of the whale 
in contrast most said the hondurans had been good allies 
allowing the contras free run of a large swath of territory in 
eastern honduras 
we get along great with the contras they are good people 
said a honduran soldier assigned to a small detachment based in 
yamales 
the united states has spent hundreds of millions of dollars 
helping the contras but the end is in sight following a central 
american agreement to disband the contra army seeking to topple 
nicaraguas sandinista government 
the united states is still providing nonlethal aid but several 
contra commanders complained that even before this us aid had been 
uncertain that conditions on the aid had limited the contras 
ability to fight a guerrilla war and had in addition made a 
peasant insurgent movement appear to be nothing more than a us 
tool 
we never knew what position the united states was going to 
take said israel galeano contra chief of staff 
he is one of a group of young and battlehardened commanders who 
have taken control of the fighting forces from what they call the 
desk warriors of the nicaraguan directorate 
the desk commanders got too far away from the fighters said 
commander dimas head of operations for the contra general staff 
officials at the contras offices in miami said they could no 
longer grant permission for journalists to visit yamales for 
instance because galeano controls access to the base 
the young commanders say they know the contras cannot survive as 
a fighting force in honduras following the disbanding agreement aug 
7 so despite a shortage of supplies they are planning to lead 
their men back into the jungle to await nicaragua elections set for 
february 
us officials and sources in the directorate say they fear the 
returning soldiers will simply be wiped out by a vastly superior 
sandinista force but field commanders say they are confident they 
can survive and many fighters said that when they took up arms 
years ago they never thought of us aid 
the 29yearold galeano said his men wont attack sandinista 
forces but will defend themselves he added that his strategy is to 
keep his force operative as a means of pressuring the sandinistas to 
hold fair elections 
weve been exploited weve got to show the world we arent 
mercenaries of reagan and bush said a battalion commander known 
as commander nolan he like others said the contras were 
created by conditions inside nicaragua and that the war would not 
end until those conditions change 
the united states provided military aid during the reagan 
administration but that was cut off in february 1988 
on aug 7 presidents of the central american countries agreed to 
disband the contras by dec 8 in exchange for democratization in 
nicaragua but most fighters interviewed recently saw the agreement 
as leaving them with options that range from bad to worse 
few believe the promise of president daniel ortega of nicaragua 
that it is safe for them to return peacefully and many see death 
awaiting them in the nicaraguan jungle 
its immoral to send all these people to their deaths said 
nolan who is planning to lead his own battalion even though he 
lost a lung in battle 
galeano was the only commander who expressed any sympathy for the 
us position where the reagan administration was unable to impose 
its will on a democratcontrolled congress 
we understand the problems of a democracy that needs consensus 
to act galeano said in an interview its what we want for our 
own people 
the aug 7 agreement effectively took the contra issue out of the 
honduran presidentialelection campaign where a vote is set for 
nov 26 two weeks before the deadline for disbanding the nicaraguan 
rebels 
to honduras well say thank you and goodbye said dimas 
effectively theyve been allies 
president jose azcona hoyo who cannot run for reelection said 
that if the contras move out of honduras as an armed force their 
fate will be an an internal matter for nicaragua and none of 
honduras business 
even so honduras has reinforced a battalion of the 110th 
infantry brigade that patrols the isolated hills and blocks the 
access road to the camps 
many hondurans have been upset by rumors that groups of contras 
would become bandits but a honduran soldier said we cant stop 
them from getting out individually 
the contra fighters worry about their families as well as about 
3000 guerrillas who suffered crippling wounds 
were going to ask the united states to take care of them 
dimas said thats the least they can do 
the united states is providing medical aid and rehabilitation 
and contra leaders say they have been told refugees and the wounded 
will be taken care of even after aid to the fighters runs out 
the fighters families mostly live in nearby villages refugee 
camps and the small city of danli 80 miles to the west 
people there are very discouraged said enrique rizo lopez a 
resettlement group spokesman a lot of them want to go to the 
states 
us officials point to a new aspect of the aid program efforts 
to teach literacy civics and skills like barbering cooking and 
even oratory to the fighters most of them poorly educated peasants 
i want to show them they still have supporters they will not 
be left alone said a us aide a nicaraguanamerican 
schoolteacher from hialeah fla who gave his name only as julian 
but a doctor who uses the name ulysses said a ussupported 
hospital has been forced to suspend all but emergency services to 
both contras and local civilians as he spoke he tried to light a 
cigarette 
its like us aid he said flicking a balky lighter it 
works when it wants to

death has run hard after ieshia williams 
from the moment she was born nearly catching her on her eighth 
birthday a year ago when pneumonia attacked an immune system 
weakened by the aids virus 
tyesha williams born the same september day in 1980 in the same 
hospital knows death one step removed never infected and now 
taller stronger and quicker in school than ieshia she cannot shake 
her worry is my sister going to the hospital today 
theyre identical twins and yet they could hardly be more 
different 
i and ty as they are called do not share aids but they 
share its anguish and though they differ in growth they are close 
in spirit 
clapping together they chant the singsong of a favorite game 
mama got the measles 
papa got the flu 
i aint lyin 
neither are you 
doris williams watches a 51yearold widow she adopted the 
twins when their mother barely 21 poor and jobless gave them up 
but as mrs williams cares for the girls who share identical 
genes no one can tell her for certain why their lives have taken 
such divergent paths 
ieshia had the bad luck tyesha had the good luck says dr 
james oleske medical director of the aids program at childrens 
hospital in newark nj 
what is amazing is that they shared bottles and the whole bit 
since birth says their pediatrician dr karl e russellbrown 
ieshia and tyesha are among 12 sets of twins in this country 
known to have been exposed to aids according to oleske in four 
cases only one twin was infected with the virus 
its rare says oleske you usually expect both and thats 
usually what happens 
a tainted blood transfusion may be to blame for ieshias illness 
or it may have been an infinitesimal difference in the blood supply 
to the placenta allowing the virus to reach her and not tyesha 
before birth the mother has refused to be tested for exposure to 
the virus 
ieshia has survived twice as long as do most children with aids 
she has got to be gods kid says mrs williams a former nurse 
ieshia was among the first diagnosed child aids victims in the 
united states she was the trendsetter in getting some new jersey 
schools to accept children with the virus 
her survival is a bright spot amid the bleakness for families and 
doctors who have watched more than 700 children die of aids 
children with aids have more severe recurrent bacterial 
infections says oleske the disease progresses much more 
quickly so that children will frequently die much faster than the 
adults 
oleske diagnosed ieshia when she was 2 years old in the early 
1980s when immunologists like himself first started seeing cases of 
what turned out to be pediatric aids we didnt even know what to 
call it then recalls oleske 
today with the increased knowledge of aids a child like ieshia 
would probably be diagnosed at six months 
aids has delayed ieshias development to the point where she is 
in a class for neurologically impaired children two years behind 
tyesha oleske doesnt think shell ever catch up to her sister 
but aids has not dampened ieshias spirit even though it has 
stunted her growth she is only 3 feet 8 inches tall nearly a foot 
shorter than her sister who is in fourth grade 
ieshia is a charming child with ponytails and a smile showing 
silvercapped teeth the latter a legacy of the decay brought on by 
aidsinduced complications and yet shes ornery feisty and tough 
when other children taunt her in school after mrs williams 
obtained a court order to get her in she hurls the taunts right 
back 
her toughness masks her longing for kinder attention 
i made up a father for ieshia says mrs williams when she 
kept asking for this father i gave her george who was her mothers 
brotherinlaw i think she knows better but she just wants to 
have a father 
while tyesha jumps rope double dutch and goes to girl scouts 
summer day camp ieshia can only dream of such fun shes too 
small tyesha explains 
instead ieshia goes to the park with her little cousins and plays 
on the slides swings and monkey bars her cousins play tennis but 
not ieshia 
she doesnt play tennis cause shes not allowed to stay in the 
sun too long says cousin curtis grimes 
although no one knows for sure how ieshia became infected 
russellbrown and mrs williams believe it was through a blood 
transfusion she received shortly after she was born 
they both had transfusions in the newborn period because they 
were premature says russellbrown and the only logical 
explanation i assume that she got infected by the virus from one of 
those transfusions but again they both had blood and whose blood 
tyesha had and whose blood ieshia had i dont know there was no 
other exposure 
while oleske does not rule out blood transfusion as the cause he 
suspects ieshia was infected through her natural mother although 
her refusal to be tested for aids leaves that possibility uncertain 
if so one explanation why only she and not tyesha was stricken 
might be very small differences in the blood supply to the placenta 
the organ through which a fetus receives nourishment from the 
mothers circulatory system 
sometimes in one placenta you see a different flow of blood 
so that it has more exposure to the virus oleske says 
whatever the source of the virus it gives the child little 
respite at school ieshia slips into the hall to swallow azt a 
lifeprolonging drug she takes every six hours 
even at home between the slides and the swings she has to stop 
for treatment a nurse michele lapadura comes by daily to give her 
therapy chopping at her tiny chest with cupped hands to clear her 
lungs of mucus 
if there is an explanation for ieshias survival part of it is 
the good care and love she has received says oleske 
ieshia is a very special girl who is one of the few cases that 
give me hope and encouragement he says some days it gets 
pretty bleak taking care of so many children that die shes one of 
the cases that im most gratified with she has survived to the day 
when we now have drugs like azt that may in fact help cure her 
childrens hospital staffers have been counseling both girls i 
think to a limited degree to their age abilities they can 
understand says oleske 
for tyesha aids means she could lose a beloved sister 
every time a hospital stay comes mrs williams says you 
can tell the fear in her when we go to the clinic you can see her 
worrying then when we come back shes so thrilled to see us 
ieshias understanding despite a lifetime of sickness reflects 
a childs belief in a better future when i grow up she says 
i want to be a nurse because i want to help sick people

satire george s kaufman once warned is what closes on 
saturday night that didnt stop him from collaborating with moss 
hart on once in a lifetime the biting spoof of early hollywood 
the new hollywood with its buzzphrases lets take a meeting 
and do lunch and numbing vapidity and undercurrent of deceit 
could certainly provide ample material for a biting satire the 
big picture isnt it christopher guest and his collaborators are 
not kaufman and hart and their film proves annoyingly flat like a 
series of shaggydog stories without punchlines 
more was expected of guest who contributed some of the funniest 
sequences to saturday night live as writer and actor he also 
cowrote and appeared in rob reiners clever sendup of the rock 
world this is spinal tap 
guest who makes his feature debut as a director with the big 
picture cowrote the story with michael varhol who also 
produced they wrote the screenplay along with michael mckean they 
obviously took delight in conveying inside jokes trouble is 
many of them are too inside for the layman 
the big picture opens promisingly enough with an awards 
program at the national film institute student films most of them 
grossly pretentious are screened the winner is nick chapman kevin 
bacon an eager young filmmaker with high principles and a 
supportive girlfriend emily longstreth 
nicks award draws him into the hollywood vortex he is wooed by 
a variety of smarmy agents and signs with an orientallooking loony 
martin short who receives no billing 
a bigtalking studio chief jt walsh hires nick to direct his 
original script with dizzying speed nick betrays his principles 
dilutes his script betrays his best friend mckean and abandons 
his girlfriend for a starlet 
then one morning nick picks up the trade papers and finds the 
studio boss has been fired nicks project is dropped and he 
becomes unemployable after hitting bottom he directs a music video 
that makes him hot again he is able to film his original script 
hire his best friend and reconcile with his girl 
if guest intended a hollywood morality tale it doesnt work the 
characters are standard cliches and its hard to believe that 
nicks dopey screenplay would get a second look at any studio kevin 
bacon does his best to breathe life into the weakwilled nick but 
the character is hard to like or admire brief roles are played by 
eddie albert june lockhart john cleese and roddy mcdowall 
the columbia release is rated pg13 mostly for language running 
time 100 minutes

cousins paramount home video vhs beta rated pg13 
 
cousins carries no suggested retail price because it is 
intended for the rental market good idea because its hardly worth 
the celluloid on which its filmed 
cousins is joel schumachers graceless treatment of 
jeancharles tacchellas charming 1976 comedy cousin cousine 
schumacher makes the mistake of trying to closely follow the 
original both open with a rousing family wedding scene in which the 
husband and wife of different couples meet run off for a little 
sexual fling and leave their respective mates waiting at the 
catering hall for their returns the cuckholded spouses start up a 
harmless flirtation and friendship and eventually have an affair of 
their own 
but where the original danced lightly with the passions and 
eccentricities of french culture the new version applies the thin 
moralistic veneer of an american tv sitcom with idiot level dialogue 
and conviction simply put the french have a different way of 
viewing adultery 
ted danson as compelling in this role as a bottle of warm flat 
champagne plays larry kozinski who is married to tish played with 
airhead finesse by sean young isabella rossellini perhaps cast in 
this movie to give it some sort of continental class and a little 
sunshine is maria hardy an understanding wife and mother married 
to a brutish bore named tom william petersen who sells suburus but 
who likes to say he sells bmws 
the truly comic moments which were many in cousin cousine 
are diluted in cousins by weighty and blunt situations when tom 
realizes maria and larry are also having an affair he confronts 
larry in typical hollywood macho style with if you go near my 
wife again ill kill you petersen is more fred flintstone than 
valentino 
what saves cousins from utter and total oblivion is the 
wonderful patter between larrys father lloyd bridges and larrys 
son mitch keith coogan grandpa and grandson have a bucolic 
moment over some girlie magazines and the scene in which mitch 
helps grandpa vince prepare for a date with marias mother norma 
aleandro is worth the rental 
a totally unnecessary addition to cousins is the subplot 
involving the boygirl problems tom and marias daughter experiences 
in preschool who cares 
perhaps hollywood will one day realize that some things get lost 
in translation one would think the lesson would have been learned 
in 1983 when jim mcbride remade jeanluc godards classic 1960 film 
breathless into a pathethic and misguided movie it starred 
richard gere who was embarrassing as he attempted to take on the 
role jeanpaul belmondo had created in the original 
something gets lost in the translation as hollywood puts its neon 
wand to french confections if it aint broke dont fix it

tap rcacolumbia pictures home video vhsbeta 8995 
rated 
 
movie audiences have yearned for those splashy joyous romantic 
musicals of the 1930s 40s and 50s when boy met girl boy lost 
girl boy got girl back and everybody lived happily everafter 
dancing all the way to the altar 
nick castle whose father choreographed many of those wonderful 
fred astaireginger rogers vehicles attempts to bring back those 
golden dance movies with tap a love letter to hoofers great and 
small 
starring gregory hines and some of the greatest tap kings living 
tap features excellent dancing and a splendid exuberance 
unfortunately the movie holds back the dance sequences never seem 
to totally reach their potential and on the small screen they may 
be lost altogether 
one production number in which hines takes a club full of tap 
fans out to times square to feel and hear the beat and rhythms of 
the city such as cars going over metal plates in the road or 
construction crews thumping the pavement and marks out a dance the 
number starts out well luring the viewer to the rhythms and moves 
then it fizzles 
another disappointment is the wistful rooftop soft shoe 
performed by hines and the lovely suzzanne douglas to cheek to 
cheek its a romantic fred and ginger takeoff that never really 
gets off how sad 
the biggest problem with tap is castles script and story 
line max hines is a genius dancer who unfortunately finds 
secondstory work more to his liking than hoofing after a stint in 
jail he returns to new york where he hooks up with the hoods again 
at the same time his mentor little mo sammy davis jr encourages 
him to resume his dancing and even tries to turn him on to a new tap 
innovation amplified shoes 
the plot though gets in the way of the dancing its not 
compelling poignant or interesting enough the tap dancing 
however is 
hines perhaps the greatest contemporary tap stylist around these 
days is marvelous his supporting cast includes savion glover a 
14yearold hoofer who one day will make the same claim there are 
also sandman sims bunny briggs harold nicholas jimmy slyde and 
steve condos some of the dancers who helped define and perfect the 
art and craft of tap in the 20th century 
forget the story view tap as a tribute to the great ones and 
to appreciate what tap dancing was all about before broadway and 
hollywood took away its snap and crackle

the end of the innocence geffen don henley 
 
on the title cut of the end of the innocence don henley 
interrupts his seduction of a woman to grouse about ronald reagan 
best of my love indeed 
henley sounds cranky on much of the rest of his new album too 
and no wonder the guy is undergoing some serious transitions on 
side 1 alone he tells of a lover about to leave him i will not 
go quietly another already in his past new york minute and 
a third that he hopes is in his future the last worthless 
evening 
such emotional clutter would rob most folks of their sanity it 
robs henley of his hooks the tally for the end of the innocence 
reads 53 minutes of music no memorable melodies 
also absent is the keen social commentary that has marked the 
exeagles best solo work here henley stoops to attacking the most 
obvious of targets evangelists little tin god 
the supporting cast includes bruce hornsby w axl rose edie 
brickell take 6 mike campbell and danny kortchmar so talent isnt 
lacking but inspiration is much of the record has the spark of a 
demo tape 
henley had a hand in writing all 10 songs he coproduced played 
the drums and sang all lead and some backup vocals as the title cut 
suggests henley might be trying to do too many things at once

piano quintet in a the trout by franz schubert piano 
quartet in g minor by wolfgang amadeus mozart artur schnabel and 
the pro arte quartet emi 
 
artur schnabel giant of 20thcentury pianists and superlative 
beethoven interpreter is reported to have said i play beethoven 
to make my living schubert i play for love his loving treatment 
of the trout can be heard on this emi reissue of a 1935 
recording previously released on arabesque 
the interpretation may put off some listeners at first but it 
grows on you after a number of hearings schnabels occasional 
rhythmic flexing evokes an earlier romantic style as do the string 
players tendency to slide between notes 
the sound quality is not the greatest the remastering from 78s 
is uneven the background noise considerable but first violinst 
alphonse ounnous sweet tone and schnabels direct lucid reading of 
the notes shine through 
the performance is brisk and muscular but not so much that 
schuberts fleeting changes of color and mood are sacrificed in the 
first movement phrases seem to build through their own natural 
momentum the cello and viola of the pro arte a belgian quartet 
founded in 1912 and one of the most prominent before world war ii 
sing beautifully in the andante 
the scherzo is the least successful of the movements with a not 
very appealing percussive militaristic quality the tempi in the 
fourth movement variations never seem quite right but that problem 
is straightened out in the forceful finale 
the wonderful mozart g minor quartet was recorded a year earlier 
schnabel and the pro arte members give a clean squarecut 
rendition more than in the schubert the pianists singing tone and 
uncluttered phrasing come out

before the b52s became rock stars they were 
friends after 10 years and six albums theyre still close so 
close that when guitarist ricky wilson died of cancer in 1985 the 
four surviving members stayed together 
it seemed like at that moment we werent going to continue 
said vocalist kate pierson but we kept hanging around together 
we helped each other i just felt we kept wanting to do music being 
friends we found a lot of strength in each other 
so close they need an outside producer because nobody wants to 
give orders 
we all have different strong points but theres no leader 
pierson said 
its been a problem in some ways but creatively its good 
everybody is more satisfied no ones left out its very 
laissezfaire you cant force creativity the fact we all 
collaborate so much is what gives us our unusual sound 
they are rocks most subversive cartoon spreading their message 
under bouffant hairdos and giggly vocals the b52s combine the 
inspired silliness of 1960s surf groups with the social conciousness 
of the folkprotest music that pierson performed in high school 
imagine the flintstones warning against deforestation or the jetsons 
defending animal rights 
our influences are really eclectic pierson said stephen 
foster brazilian music were really influenced by patti smith and 
captain beefheart weve been influenced by movie soundtracks tv 
its just in the air 
it all started at a chinese restaurant in athens ga five 
friends ricky wilson his sister cindy keith strickland fred 
schneider and pierson five straws and one drink flaming volcano 
they had never played together before but thought it might be fun 
to try 
we went to our friend owens house and started writing 
strickland said we had no notion of starting a band we just 
wound up at his house because there were instruments and a tape 
recorder owen went upstairs to write a letter otherwise he would 
have been in the band too 
we started playing at parties and had great response people 
wanted us to play more we would go to parties and dress up and be 
ridiculous the slang term for bouffant hairdo was b52 and that was 
what we called ourselves thats the most calculated thing weve 
ever done 
a selfproclaimed trashy little band the b52s quickly 
became a favorite of critics and dancers with rock lobster 
dance the mess around and private idaho what other band 
could sing i want to kiss your pineapple and make audiences beg 
for more 
we had this perpetual innocence pierson said like the 
film born yesterday we still have this enthusiasm like we just 
started i dont feel jaded at all 
their songs come from everywhere the vegetarian restaurant where 
rock lobster was written a billboard reading topaz the right 
choice which provided the title for topaz off cosmic 
thing their new album even a psychic who predicted the band 
would use the word topaz in a song 
i was standing in a door of a shopping mall strickland 
recalled and two different songs were playing in the same key i 
was thinking ahhhh i loved it the subliminal will register 
theres always an awareness 
for cosmic thing the b52s decided some stripping down was 
in order after making increasing use of studio effects over the 
years 
we wanted to approach this as a band pierson said not as 
a studio album the first two albums we played the stuff ourselves 
we didnt overdub anything that we couldnt do live 
the next three albums we did more and more overdubs and our 
last record bouncing off the satellites was the most produced 
we were able to add layers of sounds and do some different moods 
but now we really have this urge to rebel no more drum machines 
rebels or not they still needed a producer and used both nile 
rodgers the exchic guitarist who has worked with madonna and diana 
ross and don was of was not was 
rodgers has this reputation of being slick but he was really 
the opposite pierson said he understood our approach 
immediately we wanted to do the whole album with nile but his 
schedule is so crazy hes booked until the year 2000 we thought 
wed better call someone else 
they tried several producers at the suggestion of their record 
label but none worked out until the group met was who recently 
worked on bonnie raitts popular nick of time album 
cosmic thing could be the movie soundtrack to around the 
world in 10 songs starting cheerfully with the title tracks 
batman riff gradually darkening with roam the lead song 
off side 2 and concluding hopefully with follow your bliss an 
instrumental 
we made a sequence in the studio strickland said and it 
didnt make any sense at all the final order was sort of an 
accident i realized we could do it a certain way take you on a 
journey and back again side 1 relates to southern rural imagery 
side 2 becomes more global especially channel z 
follow your bliss is like closing credits cosmic thing 
sort of says what the albums about standing on your own two feet 
shake that cosmic thing its your birthright to enjoy life 
follow your bliss is kind of saying the same thing

bob schaeffer must know something about the sat 
in 1965 as a high school student aiming for ultraselective 
massachusetts institute of technology he scored a perfect 800 on 
the math portion of the scholastic aptitude test and an only 
slightly less sublime 700plus on the verbal section 
not enough to stand out in the mit crowd but not too shabby 
considering the average us pupil scores about 500 points lower 
schaeffer shrugs off his standardized test prowess calling his 
scores embarrassingly high when pressed to reveal them he has 
spent the last four years waging a highly publicized war on the sat 
which he believes is biased flawed and ought to be banished from 
students lives 
in 1985 he and fellow testing foe john weiss formed fairtest a 
cambridge massbased research and lobbying organization that has 
emerged as the principal gadfly of the college board which sponsors 
the sat and the education testing service which administers the 
test taken by more than a million collegebound students each year 
schaeffer weiss and barbara beckwith have cowritten standing 
up to the sat arco books 695 it contains a foreword by 
womens rights activist eleanor smeal and an afterword by consumer 
advocate ralph nader who cowrote an earlier investigative 
broadside against the sat in 1978 
standing up to the sat is best described as a guerrilla test 
preparation book the sat is the enemy it says here are the tricks 
you need to defeat it 
the chapter headings tell the story how to outwit the verbal 
sat how to outfox the math sat how to outsmart the test of 
standard written english 
students who cant afford 600 or so for private coaching or test 
preparation classes will find dozens of invaluable testtaking tips 
on the verbal portion for example the authors counsel students 
to leave the reading comprehension questions for last they take the 
longest to do and count the same as the analogy and antonym 
questions 
on the math the book advises students to write the figuring in 
the test book dont work out complicated questions in your head 
later you can see your steps clearly and catch careless errors and 
the book advises students to memorize the six formulas and eight 
math terms and definitions printed at the beginning of every sat to 
avoid wasting precious test time flipping back to them 
such tip mongering gives the college board fits the sat has long 
held a mystique as an educational barometer a test supposedly able 
to objectively predict college success to suggest that a student 
can be coached for the sat that the test can be outwitted 
outfoxed or outsmarted is heresy 
the bias charges leveled by fairtest repeated at length in the 
opening chapters of this book have been widely reported 
legislators courts and even some colleges have begun to question 
whether the sat is unfair to women and minority students unfair 
perhaps to all students 
but students reading these charges for the first time in this 
book should be aware that they are getting one side of a complicated 
educational debate 
to demonstrate the sats alleged race and income bias the 
authors reproduce questions that in several cases havent been used 
in years 
and they offer this sample analogy question supposedly showing 
how unfair the sat is to poorer students 
dividends stockholders 
a investments corporations 
b purchases customers 
c royalties authors the correct answer 
d taxes workers 
e mortgages homeowners 
why it could be asked is it unfair to expect collegebound kids 
to have some nodding familiarity with concepts such as taxes 
customers investments or mortgages even if he or she is not rich 
the sat is sexbiased against women the book further asserts on 
average girls score 43 points lower on the math and 13 points lower 
on the verbal than boys yet their grades are generally higher than 
boys grades in those subjects in high school and college the 
reason says the book sat questions feature boys and male topics 
far more often than girls or topics of interest to females 
but can test critics really prove that girls cant understand a 
question because it features dick instead of jane mightnt 
there be some truth to the college boards explanation that schools 
and parents are subtly steering girls away from advanced math in 
high school 
the books ends with a call to arms to students and others to 
pressure testmakers colleges and others to make the sat and other 
standardized tests fairer 
stand up to unfair standardized exams nader exhorts in his 
closing essay that is the only way to end the intellectual 
serfdom that tests such as the sat represent 
perhaps the best single piece of advice in this book is a lesson 
schaeffer obviously learned himself with his disdain for his own 
superb sat scores dont internalize your sat score high or low 
your score measures only a tiny part of who you are a high score 
doesnt make you a genius if you score low that doesnt mean 
youre dumb and not college material

rodney crowell may be this years newcomer 
to mainstream country music but behind the success of his diamonds 
amp dirt album is a solid career thats touched nearly every facet of 
the music industry 
crowells older fans his cult following as he puts it kept 
his wideranging talents a secret until recently 
hes written hits for bigname artists he produced the brilliant 
kings record shop lp for his wife rosanne cash and he helped make 
a legend out of emmylou harris as a member of her hot band in the 
1970s 
but 1989 was his year 
diamonds amp dirt crowells fifth album has produced four no 1 
singles on the country charts the first time four top singles have 
been written produced and performed by the same artist the album 
also earned him three grammy awards and the academy of country 
music named him its top new male vocalist it was an honor the 
38yearold performer might have scoffed at had he not won 
its funny how you can justify either side of the coin 
crowell said if you dont win you say im an artist awards 
dont mean anything then suddenly you win and the hypocrite 
comes out and says hey this is not bad 
last month warner records released the rodney crowell 
collection his first greatest hits album crowells new lp for 
cbs records is due in october 
he recently talked about his new popularity and his arrival 
after years in the background 
not long ago he watched his wifes career take off while his own 
talents were tucked away in the production booth 
i got sidetracked in the role of producer a few years back and 
i got involved to the point where i couldnt give any attention to 
my own personal desires he said and while doing that rosanne 
was having a great deal of success it was really tough the bottom 
line was that she was doing better than me 
crowell doesnt like to hear labels pinned on his music though 
he acknowledges that country music radio is his window to the 
world 
his disdain for categories started when he was a child in austin 
texas he said 
the 60s was a good time musically because i would go to the 
store and buy a beatles record a merle haggard record a buck owens 
record and a flatt and scruggs record all on the same rack they 
didnt separate them id buy them at the grocery store 
thats why i bristle when somebody pegs it all down because i 
would easily go from country to something classical ravel to the 
rolling stones music is something to be appreciated for how it 
feels how it speaks to your heart not your mind 
crowell hooked up with emmylou harris in 1974 after she recorded 
some of his songs and sent out word she wanted to meet the young 
songwriter he visited her at her home in the washington dc area 
and later followed her to los angeles 
she came through austin where i was hanging out at the time 
handed me an airline ticket and said cmon move to la and i 
said ok 
before long crowell was tagged the next gram parsons a 
reference to the man considered one of the founders of country rock 
parsons who discovered harris and later recorded with her died in 
1972 of a heroin overdose 
i didnt know gram parsons crowell said i suppose that 
comparison is only natural given the fact that emmylou was his 
collaborator then he died and i became her collaborator 
the hot band proved a strong foundation for crowells first album 
in 1978 aint livin long like this which featured ry cooder 
dr john ricky skaggs and james burton like the albums that 
followed it received strong critical acclaim but had little 
commercial success 
at the time cash was an aspiring actress also living in los 
angeles but the two met by chance in nashville tenn where they 
both happened to be visiting 
i found out she lived in la we became friends and that turned 
into a romance crowell said 
when she left acting for a singing career cash asked crowell to 
produce her first album he has since produced all of cashs albums 
in the past few years the couple have weathered wellpublicized 
drug and marital problems they now live in nashville with their 
four children and the hard times and jealousy seem to be things of 
the past 
if anything cashs success seems to be more of an inspiration 
than a threat to crowell 
thats one thing about rosanne shes a real seeker of any 
kind of growth emotional artistic intellectual she is very 
creative and is not complacent

sylvia corvo tired of retirement and went back 
to work when she was nearly 72 now 80 she doesnt plan to retire 
again unless poor health forces her and she doesnt think thats 
likely any time soon 
shes among a growing number of people returning to work or 
staying on the job after they turn 65 and corvo one of two 
travelers insurance co retirees who run a 700person job bank says 
many return for the same reason she did 
i had been retired for seven years and i woke up very bored 
one day and thought i ought to do something i thought maybe id 
take some courses 
but that days mail brought a letter from travelers where she 
had worked as an executive secretary and spent nine years running 
the suggestion plan the company was collecting names of retired 
workers who might want to return for parttime or occasional work 
was she interested 
she has worked at the job bank thursdays fridays and alternate 
wednesdays ever since keeping track of who is available their 
skills and what jobs need to be filled were very proud of our 
job bank and we save the company about a million dollars a 
year thats not bad 
travelers isnt the only company seeking out workers who once 
would have been considered over the hill mcdonalds prints 
applications for mcmasters on its tray liners days inns of 
america inc held a senior power job fair in may that attracted 634 
companies and 5000 older people in 26 states polaroid corp offers 
gradual retirement for those who want to continue parttime 
companies are hiring or retraining older workers to stave off an 
impending labor shortage as baby boomers age 
the united states is ahead of europe in having the elements of 
such programs said peter plett an international labor 
organization employee who is studying programs for older workers in 
north america and europe 
european business is still focusing on younger workers but 
europeans will have to face a change from this youth wave in the 
next few years plett said at a national council on the aging 
seminar earlier this year 
there is really no choice if were going to increase 
productivity and meet the needs of an aging workforce were going 
to have to totally change the concept of retirement said daniel 
e knowles vice president for human resources and planning at 
grumman aerospace corp 
the nations average age is rising as the baby boomers get older 
and medical advances extend life expectancy meanwhile the labor 
market has gotten tighter said philip rones of the bureau of labor 
standards 
we have 3 million fewer younger workers than we did 10 years 
ago were in the middle of the nations longest peacetime 
expansion unemployment is at a 15year low rones said 
the dearth of teenagers coupled with a tight labor market has 
prompted mcdonalds to look for older people to work as everything 
from burgerflippers to managers for its fastfood restaurants 
thirty percent of american men aged 65 and older held parttime jobs 
in 1960 by 1986 that had risen to 48 percent for women the 
increase was from 43 percent to 61 percent 
we recruit from our customers said stanley stein a senior 
vice president at the oak brook illbased company mcdonalds says 
older workers can set their hours and wont work enough to lose 
social security benefits 
that possible loss of social security or pensions is one of the 
biggest obstacles to keeping older workers those 65 to 70 can make 
8800 this year and not lose any benefits under 65 its 6480 
generally 1 in benefits is lost for each 2 earned over the limit 
at 70 earnings dont affect benefits 
when travelers set up its job bank in 1981 it had to change 
restrictions that kept workers from collecting pensions if they kept 
working said harold johnson who was the companys personnel 
director at the time 
we can only work 960 hours a year thats approximately six 
months said corvo some people fill in for those on sick leave or 
vacation others work regularly one two or three days a week a few 
work fulltime six months at a stretch then take six months off 
all are classified as temporary workers and paid the midpoint for 
each jobs salary 
johnson now with a company that trains executives said that 
when travelers set up the job bank it also eliminated mandatory 
retirement and set up a plan for workers who wanted to continue 
working parttime rather than fulltime after 65 
not every company though or even a majority is worried about 
a labor shortage or looking toward older people as its solution 
downsizing is a fact of life in american industry and older 
employees are the most affected johnson said and dozens of 
companies are still laboring under the myths that we have blown 
away 
the myths include belief that a workers ability deteriorates 
with age and that older workers will cost a company more in sick 
leave and medical benefits than their work is worth said ncoa 
conference participants 
older workers at days inns have a better attendance rate and stay 
longer than younger workers said spokeswoman laura myers mccoy the 
headquarters in atlanta loses an average 40 percent of its 
reservation agents a year but the turnover rate among the older 
workers is less than 1 percent 
dave thomas 71 was a structural engineer most of his 
professional life and was in charge of scheduling design and 
construction of the metro atlanta rapid transit authority when he 
retired in 1982 now he puts in 5 hours a day for 620 an hour as 
a reservations clerk for days inn its been a lot of fun 
talking to different people and different kinds of people ill 
keep working as long as i enjoy it and as long as theyll let me 
knowles said grummans highly trained workforce has always tended 
to be older than average something which itself refutes the belief 
that a younger worker is better the average age at grumman rose 
from 37 to 45 from 1970 to 1977 as a result of 13600 layoffs that 
were based on department rankings of ability rather than on age or 
seniority

module he said our past president told me it wasnt a bunch 
of kids who put a man on the moon it was a bunch of middleaged and

in a land where the elderly have long been 
venerated miyoko morita and misako tanaka spend their days looking 
after old people whose plight worries them so much that we cant 
let ourselves die 
japans rapid transition to an industrial power has been 
accompanied by an equally swift aging of its population one in five 
japanese will be over 65 years old by 2010 compared to one in 10 
or 12 million now 
the japanese live longer than anyone else men to an average 
756 years and women to 814 they once could count on spending 
their old age as respected senior members of extended households in 
closeknit neighborhoods or villages 
today for many elderly japanese those happy golden years 
have turned gray says mrs morita 74 a widow who lives with her 
sons family she and ms tanaka 65 take calls on a hotline and 
fight for more government help 
crowded in cities many families have no space for grandparents 
spiraling land costs have pushed the elderly out of their homes as 
old neighborhoods are replaced by apartment buildings where everyone 
minds their own business 
the change has forced many to turn to the government for help 
finding jobs housing and health care needs traditionally met by 
families but officials say social welfare programs are already 
overloaded as the number of incapacitated elderly rises this 
burden may overwhelm the system says hiroto itami of tokyos 
welfare planning department 
the housing that was built after the war for young couples 
small houses and apartments with no elevators isnt suitable for 
old people itami says 
japanese families have shrunk on average from five people in 
1955 to three in 1985 making it difficult if not impossible for 
families to care for older relatives without help caring for the 
aged is considered womens work but more than half of all married 
women work 
more than half of all japanese think an extended family structure 
is best surveys show but only 22 percent of all families have 
three generations living under one roof in some cases they cant 
manage by themselves or even with their families itami says 
but there arent enough nursing homes or lowincome housing units 
for the elderly 
in the tokyo area home to over 1 million people 65 and older 
nine public nursing homes accommodate a total of 2700 people 
another 2000 are on waiting lists nationwide 3090 public nursing 
homes house 216000 people 
the government plans to build nursing homes and lowcost housing 
for the elderly and to expand athome medical services and an 
experimental system of emergency alarm pendants that let sick or 
injured elderly people call for help 
in the meantime the health and welfare ministry estimates 
380000 aged are bedridden in hospitals the government employs 
150000 women parttime to help families care for 220000 bedridden 
elderly living at home with 13 million elderly living alone and 
another 347 million elderly couples also on their own needs far 
outweigh the services available itami says 
predictably the burgeoning demand for services has spawned a 
silver industry for families with enough money to pay for 
highquality housing and medical care such services arent cheap 
entrance fees for the least expensive private oldage homes average 
106000 to 212000 in addition to monthly food and maintenance 
fees of 425 to 700 
the average monthly income of couples in which the husband was 60 
or older was about 1343 in 1987 about 959 of that was from 
pensions according to a national survey of household income and 
spending spending was 1481 
financial concerns and habit send half of all retirees back to 
work but ichiro kami of the labor ministry says most elderly can 
only get lowpaying jobs like guards or janitors work that younger 
people dont want 
the elderly face housing discrimination too skyrocketing land 
prices have forced many out of their old wooden homes due to heavy 
tax burdens and strong pressure from land developers to make way for 
new buildings itami says 
when aged people do reluctantly give in to the pressures to move 
they often find closed doors says ms tanaka one woman i know 
has plenty of money and is healthy and active but landlords wont 
accept her because they worry she might forget to turn off the gas 
and start a fire 
the director of a shelter for the elderly in south tokyo said 330 
of 1300 cases handled in 1987 were elderly homeless and that the 
problem is growing 
mrs morita and ms tanaka who is a roman catholic nun say 
housing is a key worry of elderly callers to the hotline begun by 
their volunteer group of 30 women this april callers also ask for 
advice on finding home helpers and even graves they are put in 
touch with agencies that can help 
a few call to discuss marriage problems says mrs morita 
families generally consider marriage by old people to be 
embarassing and strongly object but thats just not right 
one lady just called to say she was so lonely so i went to 
spend the night the situation is so bad we just cant let ourselves 
die 
she chafes at the fact that elderly japanese facing 
discrimination and indifference often fatalistically give up because 
they were brought up when the aged were sheltered and protected 
elderly people here dont know their rights theres just no 
concept of silver power here 
were trying to teach them jkapan needs a silver wave of old 
people learning to cope for themselves

the aging of america means more older drivers 
will travel tomorrows roads increasing the need for better ways to 
judge who can safely drive and for cars and highways designed with 
the elderly in mind 
the nations system of roads traffic signs cars licensing and 
training essentially was designed for healthy 25yearolds said 
adele derby of the national highway traffic safety administration 
our challenge is to adapt this system to preserve mobility and 
promote the safety of older people 
for many older americans there may be no other possession so 
highly prized as a drivers license said patricia waller 
director of the university of michigan transportation research 
insitute 
when the older driver has difficulty with the system too often 
the reaction is get the old codger off the road we can do better 
than that 
people 65 and older comprise 12 percent of the population and 
could account for 17 percent by 2020 nearly half of them over 75 
states are not prepared to handle the growing number of very old 
drivers or to identify those at high risk of accident involvement 
the transportation research board said last year 
because older people tend to drive less their overall accident 
rate is relatively low but when mileage driven is considered they 
have a disproportionately higher crash rate than other age groups 
this is true even though many older motorists modify their travel 
habits to avoid difficult situations such as night driving heavy 
traffic freeways and lefthand turns waller said 
in addition older drivers involved in accidents are more 
vulnerable to injury motorists over 65 are three times more likely 
to die than 20yearolds from serious injuries of equal severity 
the research board found 
theres a lot of interest building up out in the research arena 
to attack this problem which is good because this is becoming an 
increasingly important problem how to increase both the mobility 
and safety of older drivers said richard waxweiler of the us 
centers for disease control 
the cdc nhtsa federal highway administration and national 
institute on aging sponsored a conference here in august on 
directions for research on older drivers organizers had expected 
about 40 people but the twoday session drew some 150 experts in 
gerontology medicine transportation and other fields 
a top priority they concluded should be more study of skills 
needed to drive and how driving ability changes with age that 
knowledge they reasoned could lead to licensing tests driver 
training cars and highway systems designed to help keep older 
motorists safely on the roads 
however the government has little money targeted for research on 
issues related to older drivers waxweiler warned people who want 
to do research on this problem will have to compete with all the 
other research interests in this time of fiscal prudence 
changes that help the elderly like simpler dashboard displays 
better highway markings or more accurate licensing tests will 
benefit other drivers as well research advocates say and helping 
older people keep their driving privileges will ease the burden on 
family friends and communities that otherwise might have to meet 
their travel needs 
we need to get away from the idea that the highway 
transportation system is a given and that drivers must adapt to 
whatever it is waller said no one functions at optimal level 
at all times 
researchers hope to come up with driving tests that will remove 
unsafe drivers while making travel safer for those who still can 
drive said richard w pew principal scientist at bbn systems and 
technologies corp in cambridge mass because we dont have 
adequate testing we take a lot of people off the road who dont 
need to be off the road 
a recent nhtsa study of state licensing found the current system 
fails to weed out some bad drivers and may suspend licenses 
needlessly or discourage some qualified drivers from applying for 
license renewal 
james hedlund nhtsas director of driver and pedestrian 
research said the agency hopes states will move toward reasonable 
performancebased license requirements our goal is not to institute 
procedures based on age 
more than a dozen states impose special licensing or renewal 
requirements based on age a practice keenly opposed by the american 
association of retired persons 
were all going to age very differently and there is no 
chronological age at which suddenly older drivers become a 
problem said aarps steve stiles there is no basis for 
singling out the older driver 
stiles said small steps are being taken to recognize and deal 
with problems related to older drivers but there are worlds of 
improvement to be made 
we are just beginning to recognize we can better peoples 
ability to drive and can create better environments for people to 
drive in

alice verhotz has lived in asia and 
negotiated the streets of crowded singapore but she began to 
question her driving ability two years ago when she and her husband 
moved to west virginia 
im absolutely terrified of some of the areas i have to drive 
in i get very nervous and grip the steering wheel hard 
the bottom line is im 60 years old if something happens im 
not going to react or brake as quickly as an 18yearold 
mrs verhotz who since has moved to dallas was among a group of 
older motorists who took part in an experimental program and study 
at west virginia university designed to ensure that older drivers 
are safer drivers 
we dont want people on the road who arent safe said dr 
kenard mcpherson director of the west virginia traffic safety 
center and a professor of safety at west virginia university but 
then we dont want senior citizens taken off the road prematurely 
because then they lose their freedom and become dependent on a 
relative a friend or some social agency 
mcphersons twoyear study indicated that exercise stress 
management and driver education may help older people improve their 
driving skills 
we found that about a quarter of those in the study had given 
up driving prematurely they had skills as good as those as 
people who were driving but they were taking themselves out of the 
system because they didnt think they were good enough we dont 
want that to happen 
eleanor milam 73 another participant in the study funded by the 
american automobile association foundation for traffic safety said 
she was surprised by her good marks on a screening test used by the 
researchers 
my kids say im a hotrodder and sometimes i do drive too fast 
but i learned to watch my speed closer and be more observant she 
said i also learned how not to be so afraid of those big trucks 
on the highway but ill still pull over and stop to let them go by 
if i have to 
about 12 percent of the nations population is 65 or older and 
that number is expected to increase to about 17 percent by the year 
2020 when more than 50 million older americans will be eligible to 
drive 
ive never seen a traffic safety issue as hot as this one with 
the possible exception of drunk driving said mcpherson who has 
gotten requests for the program from across the united states and 
several foreign countries 
his study of 43 drivers aged 2035 and 63 aged 6075 tested 
physical skills reaction time range of motion in seven joints and 
driving ability it revealed that older drivers most commonly have 
difficulty in situations that require visual skills or rapid 
judgments many of these problems mcpherson said may stem from a 
general decline in physical fitness as they age 
while driving skills often deteriorate after age 75 the study 
said many elderly people are capable and safe and pose less risk 
than many teens 
the study points out the shortcomings of programs that 
concentrate on reviewing rules and procedures mcpherson said the 
typical program gives them information as if information was going 
to solve the problem 
i dont know how information is going to help a person whose 
ability to physically function behind the wheel is declining 
our program is the first and the only one that provides for 
behindthewheel training its expensive but weve demonstrated 
its more effective 
the researchers found that many older people who are poor drivers 
have trouble twisting their necks and torsos to check traffic when 
changing lanes or backing up he said we would prescribe a 
specific set of exercises to help improve the drivers flexibilty 
while reviewing with them how important it is not to rely just on 
mirrors when switching lanes or backing up 
drivers improved observation habits resulted in better scores 
for straightline backing parallel parking intersection scanning 
and checking both sides when changing lanes however 
vehiclehandling skills like keeping in a lane or stopping at a 
point showed little if any improvement 
we dont know all the answers said mcpherson but weve 
got the largest database in the world on older drivers and were in 
the process of reviewing it to further refine our program 
his goal is to refine the program so community groups and state 
agencies can use it theres no reason why a 70yearold with good 
driving skills cant sit down and tutor someone who doesnt

at an age when most men are into their third 
decade of retirement harry h lipsig decided to start his second 
law firm 
with characteristic nerve and verve the 87yearold lipsig one 
of the nations bestknown personalinjury lawyers marched into 
his longtime office several months ago accompanied by a halfdozen 
guards with his men standing sentry the decision stemmed from a 
feud with his partners lipsig emptied his desk and pulled his name 
from the door 
lipsig still appears in the courtroom occasionally but most of 
the daytoday trial work goes to his new partner and protege 
bonita e zelman a tough nononsense lawyer and former assistant 
queens district attorney 
but driven by a passion for perfection enormous ambition 
endless energy and a gift for showbiz glitz lipsig has made 
millions for himself winning unheardof settlements in apparently 
unwinnable cases 
it was lipsig known at the courthouse as the equalizer 
who got 740000 for the family of a heartattack victim by 
convincing a jury the man had been frightened to death by a car that 
rolled up on his lawn 
it was lipsig who once showed how an acapulco hotel was actually 
to blame when a shark attacked a guest he argued that the hotel had 
dumped garbage in the ocean and failed to warn guests that the 
refuse might attract sharks 
it was lipsig in the dual roles of lawyer and exhibit a who 
argued last year that dr hyman chernow a 71yearold psychologist 
run over by a squad car driven by a drunken officer had years of 
potential incomeearning left 
he could well have outlived me lipsig argued 
city lawyers threw in the towel and settled the case for 125 
million 
lipsig boasts that hes one of the reasons new york city employs 
120 fulltime personalinjury lawyers overworked lawyers at that 
and expects to shell out some 175 million this year in awards and 
settlements 
like most lawyers in tort or personalinjury law he works on a 
contingencyfee basis typically taking a third of the final award 
he sneers at those who say aggressive personalinjury lawyers have 
caused insurance rates to skyrocket and are costing taxpayers 
millions in suits against city governments 
then he tells of the feelings that well up within me very often 
on behalf of some poor devil torn to shreds or living in that vilest 
of prisons one can conceive not a prison cell that he has been 
unjustly confined in but the vilest prison of all helpless on a 
hospital bed paralyzed 
at his finest lipsig handles the emotions of a jury with the 
finesse of a symphony conductor bore a jury and youve lost the 
case he says 
but his victories are supported by long hours of meticulous 
research lipsig is obsessed about not being proved wrong or made 
to appear the fool for overlooking something in the law 
in a career that has lifted ambulancechasing to a new level 
lipsig has seen himself adoringly profiled in time magazine and the 
wall street journal he points proudly to the framed clippings on 
the walls of his office 
modesty has no place in his vocabulary when he speaks of himself 
or his practice no lawyer who tries cases is any good unless he 
has vanity what is vanity but the blood brother of selfrespect and 
confidence 
the details of his personal and professional life are overseen by 
mary lou castillo a 33yearold woman adopted in january by lipsig 
and his wife 
some of his old partners say ms castillo the owner of a mexican 
restaurant and lipsigs everpresent assistant drove the wedge that 
split him from his former firm he says she merely helped open his 
eyes 
lipsig whose ukrainian family immigrated to new york when he was 
6 graduated from brooklyn law school in 1929 when most of the good 
legal work went to large and politically connected irish firms 
aspiring jewish attorneys like lipsig were left with minor criminal 
cases personal injury and the like 
it has made him rich lipsig was getting a reported 5 million a 
year when he quit his old firm still he insists on working and is 
driven to his office in lower manhattan daily from his luxury 
apartment near the united nations 
he still finds time to be host of a weekly cable tv talk show and 
ask harry a radio show in which he offers legal advice he has 
no plans to take it easy after all he has a fledgling law firm to 
get off the ground

have you ever gotten a postcard offering a 
bargainpriced travel package or a phone call hawking a lowpriced 
vacation 
these might be legitimate but be wary many are run by scam 
operators who each year bilk victims of hundreds of millions of 
dollars 
as a rule of thumb if an offer sounds too good to be true it 
is too often there is a catch and the innocent victim doesnt 
figure it out until its too late the scams take many forms but 
here some of the most common identified by the federal trade 
commission and the american society of travel agents 
you receive a phone call from a special operator who is 
prepared to offer you what sounds like an unbelievably lowpriced 
travel deal you are told this is a very limited offer and you must 
make a decision or at least make a deposit by credit card during 
that initial phone conversation 
you receive a postcard or brochure in the mail offering a dream 
vacation at a bargain price it may read something like this you 
have been specially selected to receive a free trip for more 
details you must call a special number usually tollfree once 
theyve got you on the phone you will get the familiar highpressure 
pitch the object is to get you on the phone and then get you to 
reveal your creditcard number 
you are urged to pay a travel club membership fee of 50 to 
400 to get a travel package that includes roundtrip air 
transportation for one person and lodging for two the catch you 
must buy a highpriced roundtrip ticket for the second person you 
can end up paying two to three times what it would have cost if you 
bought your own tickets in advance through a reputable travel agency 
a clever twist is the offer of a free or nearly free vacation as 
an inducement to visit a timeshare condominium resort hidden 
costs which you learn about only when you arrive tend to add up 
quickly you can be herded into a highpressure sales pitch with 
lengthy inperson sales sessions calculated to break down your 
resistance 
when the offer of a trip seems to be too good to be true ask a 
travel agent about it agents can help you spot phony offers you 
also may want to check with your local better business bureau or 
chamber of commerce or with the consumer affairs department of the 
american society of travel agents these organizations keep records 
of complaints about fraudulent operations 
even while youre talking to a telephone salesperson there are 
ways to protect yourself ask detailed questions to make certain 
what the price covers and what is not covered ask if there will be 
additional charges later find out the names of the airports 
airlines hotels and restaurants your package includes you may wish 
to contact these places yourself to doublecheck the arrangements 
ask about cancellation policies and refunds if the salesperson 
cant give you detailed answers this is probably not the deal for 
you 
the most important precaution you can take is never to give your 
credit card number over the phone the easiest way for a scam 
operator to succeed is to get your card number then charge your 
account sometimes these operators will bluff by telling you they 
need the number for verification purposes only 
make sure you get all information in writing before you agree to 
buy anything no legitimate business should expect you to make an 
instant decision over the phone once you have all the information 
in front of you you can read the fine print and investigate the 
company bear in mind that many fraudulent firms change their names 
frequently to avoid detection 
when in doubt about an offer either say no or demand full 
details by mail there is an endless array of exciting travel 
opportunities available to all so you have nothing to lose by 
making sure youre getting what you pay for 
with todays selection of destinations hotels fares and 
cruises youre sure to find a legitimate trip that meets both your 
needs and your budget

a rose by any other name might smell as sweet but 
relying on common names of plants can be a recipe for disaster or 
disappointment as gardeners moving to different climates after 
retirement discover quickly 
botanical names are the answer dont recoil in horror 
camellia bougainvillea aloe agave eucalyptus gardenia 
hibiscus philodendron verbena youre doing fine 
the toughest part is the first step deciding to insist on such 
identification before spending money time and effort on seeds or 
plants but it definitely ensures getting what you really want and 
being able to locate and follow the best directions for taking care 
of it 
for example in the eastern united states a muchrecommended 
shrub is the mock orange it is deciduous has white fragrant 
flowers in late spring mediumgreen foliage and needs minimal care 
it was a major asset everywhere in my former neighborhoods of 
suburban new york city philadelphia and washington 
botanically it is the philadelphus a member of the 
saxifragaceae family 
but ask for mock orange in southern california and youll 
likely get pittosporum tobira an evergreen member of the 
pittosporaceae family with entirely different needs than 
philadelphus about the only similarity is that the flowers smell 
like blossoms on orange trees 
after discovering this following a transfer to los angeles years 
ago i began an informal check on how many mock oranges were 
being sold in this country my counting stopped after 28 botanically 
different ones 
pittosporum tobira is a rugged magnificent performer outdoors in 
wide areas of the west and does great as a house plant in 
frostprone regions like the midwest and east its great for 
southern california but in arizona my retirement home it sunburns 
badly if grown under afternoon sun 
as another example at least a halfdozen different but 
oftenused shrubs are sold in phoenix as birds of paradise 
the most familiar in spectacular bloom in august is the 
mediumsized one caesalpina pulcherrima with orangeredandyellow 
flower clusters but even there the common name blurs it is called 
variously the mexican bird of paradise or red bird of 
paradise two yellowflowering cousins also are often called 
mexican bird of paradise 
the various birds of paradise sold here fall into two quite 
different families strelitzia and caesalpinia both are wonderful 
in supplying a tropical effect but once established the 
caesalpinias need little if any supplemental water take all the 
heat sun and cold of our desert and grow quickly the strelitzias 
like ample water and part shade can be killed by temperatures in 
the low 20s and grow slowly 
many nurseries in recent years have added the botanical name to 
the common on their labels its becoming common in most catalogs a 
fast way to learn is to use a reference that insists on the 
botanical names while also giving common names 
the botanical name of all roses incidentally begin with rosa 
by definition this is the genus plants consisting of one or more 
species from the same family and sharing many characteristics

estelle brownstein thought a want ad reading 
grandma wanted would lead to the perfect job but she never 
expected to end up as an honorary relative to hundreds through a 
phonein service for latchkey children 
mrs brownstein a 66yearold grandmother of five is one of 35 
grandmothers by telephone to children who come home from school 
to empty houses while one or both parents are at work 
the ad ran we need grandmas well im a grandma so i 
volunteered she said i found my niche in life my niche is to 
give of myself and get something in return 
grandma please lets children aged 6 to 13 call in when they 
feel insecure need a little advice or just want to talk said 
monica glaser who directs the program at the uptown center hull 
house social service agency 
and for some senior citizens the need to talk is often as great 
as that of the latchkey children many are confined to their homes 
she said 
being a senior citizen is not enough to qualify volunteers must 
undergo screening and receive training before being ready for the 
help line 
seniors must be warm and welcoming on the telephone and very 
nonjudgmental ms glaser said the 33 grandmas and two grandpas 
sing to the children on their birthdays mediate fights and often 
help with homework 
oh they test you mrs brownstein said there are some 
children who want to see if they can get me mad and ive done 
pretty good so far 
problem cases are directed to the help lines supervisor a 
psychologist who reviews the days work and directs major problems 
to appropriate agencies 
the program the first of its kind was created in 1985 and has 
spread to 30 cities in maryland new jersey and minnesota ms 
glaser said this year it has received more than 800 calls an 
increase of 300 over last year operators handle 25 to 30 calls a 
day between 3 pm and 6 pm transferring calls to a volunteer at 
home 
the biggest problem the program has had to date is attracting 
grandpas she said the name is grandma please you know i 
wish we could call it something else but i have to tell them were 
kind of stuck with it

the consumer groups who fought for acceptance 
of generic drugs now find themselves defending an industry caught up 
in charges of fraud and mismanagement despite the controversy one 
gadfly emphasizes there is no evidence generic drugs have caused any 
medical harm 
moreover pharmacists report few customers are switching to 
generally more expensive brandname products 
in the years since congress approved marketing the brandname 
clones generic drugs have become a staple of the pharmaceutical 
menu accounting for about a third of all prescriptions filled in 
the united states 
the renewed attention to generics stems from disclosures of 
improprieties that so far have been confined to a few generic drug 
makers and food and drug administration employees but that some fear 
could be more widespread 
at this point there is no evidence that generic drugs have 
resulted in any harm reminds dr sidney wolfe a physician and 
head of the public citizen health research group a ralph 
naderfounded consumer group that fought hard for generic drugs 
consumer reaction has been quiet 
although pharmacists say customers have been asking more 
questions about the drugs theyre getting few have insisted on 
switching to brandname products 
were surprised were getting such a small response said 
john mchugh president of the american association of retired 
persons pharmacy service whose 12 pharmacies nationwide fill 30000 
prescriptions a day 
aarp also worked hard to win acceptance of generic drugs which 
they say save consumers money since generics usually cost less than 
the brandname drugs they mimic and aarp officials say they continue 
to support generic drugs 
i dont see anything yet that would require us to backtrack 
said john rother director of legislation research and public 
policy for aarp so far it appears to be a fairly isolated type 
of malfeasance in the industry and within the fda it doesnt seem 
to be something that cant be dealt with fairly quickly 
as evidence of its confidence aarp last week was continuing to 
fill prescriptions with bolar pharmaceutical co incs generic 
version of the widely prescribed hypertension brandname drug dyazide 
the fda wants to remove bolars drug the last remaining generic 
of dyazide and the companys leading seller from the market 
because of questions about sample testing when it was approved for 
marketing in 1987 
earlier this summer vitarine pharmaceuticals inc of springfield 
gardens ny withdrew its generic version of dyazide from the 
market after admitting it had substituted the brandname drug for its 
own in tests conducted as part of the fda approval process 
besides bolar and vitarine nine other generic drug makers are 
under investigation by the fda for suspicion of improprieties 
ranging from mismanagement to fraud including sample switching 
an additional 20 generic drug companies are under scrutiny by the 
agency and the fda is sampling all versions of the 30 
mostprescribed generic drugs on the market 
recently three former employees of the fdas generic drug 
division have pleaded guilty to charges that they accepted illegal 
gratuities from drug makers 
to win approval generic drug makers must prove to the fda that 
their product has the same potency that it is absorbed into the 
blood at a comparable rate as the brandname version 
the fda allows about 20 percent variability in potency which 
some doctors say can be a problem for some patients with certain 
illnesses and conditions 
this has been raised by a committee of the american academy of 
family physicians which is recommending that the academy go on 
record this month as opposing use of generic drugs in certain 
patients including those who are 75 years and older and those with 
diabetes mellitus congestive heart failure cardiac problems 
psychoses depression and asthma 
but wolfe and other generic drug supporters say potency 
variability is no greater than the variability seen in prescribed 
dosages doctors usually prescribe the same dose of medication for a 
125pound adult as they do for a 250pound adult wolfe said 
the brandname manufacturers which have been defending their 
products against competing generics for years have been silent for 
the most part during the controversy 
the researchbased drug companies could not have purchased 
better advertising questioning the merits of generic drugs than 
theyre getting right now nordmann said they dont have to say 
anything theyre looking at the generic industry shoot itself in 
the foot 
even though those mainstream companies emphasize developing new 
drugs and winning exclusive marketing rights during a multiyear 
patent period they also produce roughly threefourths of all 
generic drugs sold to remain competitive with the companies that 
deal solely in generic drugs

peering into the future and predicting where 
the 5 trillion us economy is headed has never been an easy job 
but it has gotten a lot tougher lately 
chagrined economists have watched in horror as the government 
last month made revision after revision in data on past performance 
that they use for coming up with their prognostications 
the net result was that the us economy was not nearly as weak 
during the spring as first believed consumers spent at double the 
pace first reported employment growth was much stronger and the 
overall economy rather than limping along at an anemic annual 
growth rate of 17 percent from april through june actually grew at 
a healthy 27 percent rate 
as a consequence of all the revisions the gloomanddoom 
forecasts of a month a go that a recession was imminent have been 
tossed out the window replacing them is the new upbeat assessment 
that the economy will continue cruising ahead at a healthy clip for 
the rest of the year 
while there are plenty of red faces accompanying the sudden 
turnabout in forecasts a lot more is at stake than the reputations 
of highpaid analysts employed by major banks and investment houses 
government officials from the white house to the federal reserve 
depend on accurate economic data in setting economic policy wrong 
statistics can produce policies that throw tens of thousands of 
people out of work needlessly or kick the economy into an 
inflationary spiral 
many private economists say the problem lies in major budget 
cutbacks in the statistic gathering agencies during the reagan years 
the problem with the statistics has gotten worse because they 
dont have enough money to do a proper job said michael evans 
who heads a washington economic consulting firm some day policy 
mistakes based on bad statistics will end up sending the country 
into a recession 
some economists believe the country may face a resurgence of 
inflation six months down the road because because of decisions that 
the federal reserve made in june and july based on the bad 
statistics 
viewing the extremely weak original reports on consumer spending 
and employment growth fed policymakers decided to lower interest 
rates to jumpstart a sluggish economy and avert a recession the 
revised data show that the economy far from being sluggish was 
actually growing at a healthy rate last spring 
i believe if the fed knew then what they know now they would 
not have eased said allen sinai chief economist of the boston 
co an investment house they helped to propel a basically strong 
economy even more and thus they now run the risk of losing the 
battle on inflation down the road 
sinai and other economists worry that by spurring growth when a 
stimulus wasnt really necessary the fed will end up making 
inflationary pressures worse next year 
they maintain that when prices start rising faster then the fed 
will have to clamp down so hard on growth that it could topple the 
country into the first economic downturn since the 198182 recession 
the governments reports on factory orders and retail sales have 
been notoriously unreliable at times in the past and analysts have 
grown accustomed to looking at the figures with skepticism 
what has economists most in a tizzy now is that the labor 
departments monthly employment report generally considered one of 
the most accurate economic measurements veered so far off the mark 
earlier this year almost half the actual job growth in april may 
and june was missed in the original reports 
lois plunkett an official with the departments bureau of labor 
statistics said three consecutive monthly revisions of such 
magnitude is unusual the average upward monthly revision in job 
growth for the three months was just under 90000 compared with 
revisions averaging 47000 jobs monthly over the past five years 
we have been getting better over the years but we feel we could 
improve further with additional resources ms plunkett said 
michael boskin president bushs chief economic adviser has 
called the quality of government statistics a serious problem 
and an interagency task force assigned to recommend changes is now 
reviewing the situation 
former commerce undersecretary robert ortner who was in charge 
of many of the economic reports during the reagan administration 
said the answer does not lie simply in providing more money to 
collect and analyze the data 
some surveys that now rely on business providing data voluntarily 
may have to be made mandatory to insure adequate responses ortner 
said for other reports the solution may be as simple as delaying 
them a few more days while more data is gathered he said 
the commerce department did just that last year with its 
merchandise trade reports after problems with collecting data 
produced wildly unreliable figures on the nations monthly trade 
deficits 
but ortner failed in getting another report on new orders to 
factories for durable goods delayed for one week in order to get 
better information when he suggested the idea federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan strongly objected ortner said 
greenspan wanted to have as much information as he could as 
early as possible for the conduct of monetary policy ortner said 
you always face the tradeoff between timeliness and accuracy

montgomery ward amp co which fought its way back 
from collapse four years ago on the strength of electronics and 
appliances is preparing to battle for a share of the lucrative 
retail clothing market 
next month the chicagobased retailer will unveil a new west 
suburban store on the nilesskokie border containing what it hopes 
will be a successful formula for men and womens casual and career 
clothing 
the push comes at a time when general retailers like sears 
roebuck and co see a downturn in consumer spending for durable 
goods like refrigerators and color televisions and are trying to 
reclaim customers in the softgoods arena 
i think i can say for the first time since ive been here i 
really have a high level of confidence that we are on the brink of a 
strategic rollout of apparel said ward chairman bernard brennan 
in a recent interview 
i think where we are now is in a position where apparel can be 
a very significant factor in our growth 
brennan who took ward through a 38 billion leveraged buyout a 
year ago says ward has little choice but to make the highmargin 
clothing business a winner if the retailer wants to keep growing 
apparel may be 30 percent of wards business now but it 
drives in all the traffic were also reaching an economic period 
where theres pressure on bigticket merchandise so if were 
accepted in apparel well drive more traffic into the stores 
much of the success of wards brandname lowprice strategy has 
been in such areas as electric avenue for electronics and 
appliances home ideas for home accessories gold n gems for 
jewelry and auto express its auto parts aftermarket business 
whatever growth ward has seen in clothing has been in the kids 
store the brandname childrens apparel concept launched last year 
now its the grownups turn the effort has been an arduous one 
brennan says the company has been working for more than three years 
to find the right mix of moderate goods and has gone through several 
top executives over that time trying to accomplish its goal 
the companys new apparel buying office now is run by dan levy 
former head of home ideas who also was an executive at gimbels and 
kaufmans department stores 
the casual clothing line for men and women will be similar to 
merchandise sold at the gap where everything is coordinated by 
color and fabric brennan says 
and the company also will sell casual career clothing for men and 
women but no tailored suits or jackets ward will carry such brand 
names as gitano jordache von furstenburg sag harbor lee and 
wrangler and add more over time 
brennan also said ward will come out with a new privatelabel 
brand very soon bearing the name of a celebrity 
even with the revamp in apparel ward isnt straying from its 
main customer base families with household incomes varying from 
30000 to 50000 a year men and women between the ages of 25 and 
45 
ward also is in the midst of an aggressive expansion plan for its 
department stores and freestanding specialty stores the company 
has said it expects to build four new fullline stores and 22 of its 
specialty stores between this year and 1991

reporting plunging profits in its 
carmaking division swedens saabscania ab has confirmed it is in 
negotiations with ford motor co about a possible collaboration 
reports have said that the automotive and aircraft giant may sell 
a major stake in its carmaking operation to ford ford has declined 
to comment 
georg karnsund saabs president and chief executive officer 
refused to disclose details of the talks monday saying saab signed 
an agreement of confidentiality with ford 
discussions are taking place between the two companies the 
purpose of these discussions is to explore whether there are any 
possibilities of closer cooperation in various areas of the 
automotive business karnsund said in a statement cleared with 
ford 
the statement released at the urging of the stockholm stock 
exchange said the talks were still at an early stage 
karnsund said no further information would be released until the 
talks were concluded he said saab also was talking with other 
carmakers but declined to identify them 
prices of saab shares meanwhile rose slighly on the stockholm 
market tuesday following saabs announcement 
sales in the united states once saabs most profitable market 
dropped 15 percent in the first six months of the year the company 
said the us troubles dragged down the profit of the car division 
by 30 percent to the equivalent of 139 million in the period it 
said 
karnsund said saab needed to increase volume to overcome the 
crisis and this applies regardless of whether we go it alone or 
start to collaborate with another car manufacturer 
the saabscania group could carry the ailing car division but 
we would achieve bigger volumes faster through collaboration with 
a suitable partner he said 
a sixmonth report showed that despite setbacks in passenger 
cars saabscania remained one of swedens most successful 
companies with sales of 35 billion up 12 percent over the same 
period in 1988 
its backlog of orders for commercial aircraft totaled 18 
billion compared with 12 billion this time last year the report 
said 
rumors have ciruclated for months that saab might sell off its 
problematic car division 
a deal with ford that includes the profitable scania truck 
division would give the american company a european foothold in 
heavy vehicles to compete with general motors corp which signed a 
cooperation agreement two years ago with ab volvo swedens leading 
automaker 
swedish newspapers reported last week that saab was negotiating 
to sell ford a 20 percent to 40 percent share of the car division 
ford reportedly was bidding for a majority share 
janerik larsson head of the car division said last week that 
saab will remain a swedish automaking company indicating that a 
buyout was not being considered 
karnsund denied speculation that saab might sell the division to 
volvo

24 percent to 13 billion despite a drop in the number of cars 
sold to 58700 from 61400 worldwide

arthur andersen amp co and price waterhouse 
announced today that they plan to continue discussing a possible 
merger a move that could create the worlds largest accounting firm 
the two firms had hoped to reach a merger agreement by early this 
month on july 6 chicagobased andersen and new yorkbased price 
waterhouse announced that they had entered into 60 days of formal 
talks to explore the feasibility of a merger 
in a statement released today price waterhouse chairman joseph 
e connor and andersen chief executive lawrence a weinbach said 
the initial period of discussion has been beneficial and the 
exploratory merger discussions are continuing 
they said partners at both firms offices around the world were 
participating in task forces to make recommendations on the proposed 
merger 
the executives said the discussions so far have concentrated on 
exploring a combination that would add value to client service 
capitalize on shared values of commitment to quality and provide 
enhanced opportunities to personnel of both firms 
but the statement said both firms would have no public comment on 
details of the merger discussions because of confidentiality 
agreements 
industry observers say the talks between andersen and price 
waterhouse have run into some obstacles including how to deal with 
andersens rapidly growing consulting business the chicago 
suntimes reported in todays editions 
but the firms apparently are resolved to deal with the problems 
so as not to lag behind other major accounting firms which are 
trying to complete mergers 
a lot of andersen consultants dont want to do it but i think 
its going to go through anyway said arthur bowman publisher of 
bowmans accounting report in atlanta 
the merger of arthur andersen and price waterhouse is also not 
just a us issue and that may be one of the reasons for the 
slowness of the decision joel portugal a consultant who has 
worked with both firms told the new york times 
another potential problem is ibms relationship with both 
andersen and price waterhouse 
ibm is price waterhouses largest audit client worth millions of 
dollars in fees a year to the firm the giant computer maker is also 
involved in dozens of jointventure partnerships with andersen 
consulting to develop computer integration projects for clients 
but federal securities and exchange commission rules bar an 
accounting firm from participating in joint ventures with audit 
clients because of possible conflicts of interest 
if they move forward theres the potential something big could 
be lost james emerson publisher of emersons professional 
service review in bellevue wash told the suntimes

the number of working oil and gas rigs in the 
country jumped by 27 to 936 last week fueled by doubledigit 
increases in texas and oklahoma a widelyfollowed index of drilling 
activity said tuesday 
a year ago the count stood at 933 the index had risen by six 
the previous week and by 45 two weeks earlier 
the baker hughes rig count reflects the number of rigs actively 
exploring for oil as of last friday but not those actively 
producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
texas which dropped by 14 a week ago showed a 20rig gain in 
the most recent count while oklahoma was up by 16 
among other major oil producing states colorado and wyoming each 
were up by three while kansas increased by two louisiana lost 11

opec nations widened their oil taps a 
bit more in august to boost their crude production to one of the 
highest levels so far this year according to estimates released 
tuesday 
the international energy agency said in its monthly oil market 
report that the organization of petroleum exporting countries pumped 
about 216 million barrels of oil a day last month up 200000 
barrels from a revised july figure of 214 million and 26 million 
barrels a day higher than last year 
the iea estimate also is about 2 million barrels more than the 
195 millionbarrel ceiling set by opec when it met in june 
other sources have put opecs august production at between 215 
million and 217 million barrels petroleum intelligence weekly a 
respected trade newsletter estimated opecs july output at 218 
million barrels 
too much oil last year led to a price drop of more than 5 in wti 
from 1852 on april 18 1988 to the years low of 1260 on oct 
5 while higher demand has kept prices from falling as dramatically 
this year prices have weakened and analysts say they could continue 
to do so before they recover 
by october consumers could see a slight decline in retail 
gasoline prices about 2 cents to 3 cents said william veno 
director of oil market analysis for data resources inc 
the majority of the higher output came from iran which had 
experienced a decline in july the iea report said 
the 13 opec nations agreed in june to try to keep output under 
control and prices near a target of 18 a barrel but despite the 
promises the cartels supply has remained strong depressing prices 
from their highs of last spring 
the average price of a basket of the seven opecmonitored crudes 
registered 1644 a barrel at the end of august compared with 18 
last spring 
prices for west texas intermediate the us benchmark brand 
have been running in the range of 18 to 19 a barrel but other 
us crudes have been weaker wti which a growing number of 
analysts say does not represent the market had been up to 24 a 
barrel in april 
paul mlotok head of energy research at morgan stanley amp co in 
new york said opecs production seems to have stabilized theyve 
kind of found their level and the market is pretty much absorbing 
it he said 
higher demand this year about 1 million barrels a day more is 
one reason prices havent fallen further veno said 
moreover lower us production and oil rig accidents in the 
north sea and elsewhere have lowered world oil output and enabled 
opec to pump more oil without serious repercussions said veno 
in order for them not to undermine prices further and 
precipitate a collapse opec will have to hold production at about 
216 million barrels veno said while fourthquarter demand is 
expected to grow north sea and other nonopec production also is 
expected to grow as repairs are completed he said 
an opec monitoring panel will meet in geneva switzerland on 
sept 23 to analyze the market and decide whether to raise the 
supply cap to around 20 million barrels a day in the last quarter of 
the year 
the united arab emirates produced 18 million barrels a day in

this is one of a series of periodic reports 
looking ahead to western europe in 1992 when the 12 nations of the 
european economic community remove their trade barriers and 
interlock their policies and goals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
once upon a time in america was one 
of the first movies a new european network showed when it went on 
the air this year 
in fact american shows are increasingly what the 320 million 
viewers in the 12 nations of the european economic community see 
almost every time they turn on their television sets 
be it the original batman series the odd couple star 
trek or dallas us programs pervade the airwaves and 
european politicians and artists are rallying against them 
after years of waffling the eec member nations will try to 
decide in october whether to stem the flood of us programming 
through quotas 
the united states is crying foul complaining about protectionism 
and fearing a loss of millions of dollars in trade 
but defenders of quotas here say european culture is at stake 
calling for protection as the eec prepares turn the community into a 
single trading bloc by the end of 1992 
writing to key members of the eecaffiliated european parliament 
recently carla hills the special us trade representative said 
quotas would be blatantly discriminatory patently unjustifiable 
and would almost certainly have a disastrous effect on the us 
industrys substantial european earnings 
experts said more homegrown productions may not improve the 
overall quality of european television and doubted whether europe 
can produce enough to replace us shows kept out by quotas 
this decade many european nations deregulated their television 
industries more than doubling air time which could be filled only 
with more us programs 
as early as 1982 culture minister jack lang of france called for 
a real crusade against lets call things by their name this 
financial and intellectual imperialism that no longer grabs 
territory or rarely but grabs consciousness ways of thinking 
ways of living 
he said he counted more than 200 hours of american shows in one 
week on the six french channels 
last year on belgiums rtltvi a commercial network 65 percent 
of the movies 83 percent of the series and 70 percent of the 
cartoons were americanmade according to parliamentary records 
quotas would hit the us television industry hard as it is 
increasingly using international sales to offset huge production 
costs 
george gerbner of the annenberg school of communications in 
philadelphia said in an interview that us producers had only 
three major buyers in the united states meaning the three big 
networks 
and they put the price so low that the domestic market only 
takes care of the cost for a profit they are forced onto the world 
market so there is a strong drive to get into as many markets as 
possible 
a decade ago the western european market for us television 
consisted of only a handful of state networks but more stations 
have since gone on the air and the competition for top shows has 
driven prices up 
lorimar telepictures corp which produces dallas has been 
seeing its international revenues rise by about 25 percent annually 
the series which sold for 12000 an episode in 1986 yielded four 
times as much in 1988 
today walt disney studios gets more than half its overseas 
television revenue from eec countries the communitys business for 
us producers swelled to more than 650 million last year from 100 
million in 1980 
the european public continues to gobble up american tv with great 
cheer despite pleas that they should not yield to cultural 
imperialism 
but american programs gave been on european tv screens for a long 
time chiefly because there was little else to chose from 
as long ago as the 1950s there was a void in tv schedules and 
only the us producers could work on such a massive scale said 
professor cees hamelink of the international association of mass 
communication research in the hague netherlands 
the process was selffulfilling larry gross also of the 
annenberg school said us television forces audiences to expect a 
level of production that europeans cant match 
to meet them you have to join them he said in an interview 
western europes new commercial networks do just that it is 
cheaper to show reruns of taxi alf benson and 
hogans heroes than to make their own programs or buy more 
expensive european series in any case major european series are 
not likely to be available in sufficient quantities for some time

discussing possible eec quotas jack valenti president of the 
motion picture association of america raised the question at a 
congressional hearing in washington earlier this year whether 
european producers can ever satisfy european viewers demands after 
so much american television 
yet the eec is moving ahead with plans to protect european 
television 
if not said jacques delors president of the eec commission 
all televisions will be made in japan and all programs will be 
american 
as early as 1984 the eec suggested a localcontent quota of 60 
percent this year this was watered down to a majority of european 
programs where practicable 
but the european parliament wanted precise figures and that has 
led to a stalemate the eec nations will reopen the debate in 
october 
meanwhile us television remains a political issue for the left 
and more recently the extreme right 
franz schoenhuber leader of the west german republicans rang 
the theme during election campaigns this year assailing dallas 
and other us shows on west german television 
we dont want the american way of life he said 
the french film director claude autantlara reflecting the views 
of many of his european colleagues talked about the terrifying 
threat to european culture from across the atlantic 
comparing the best in europes cultural heritage with american 
mass consumerism claude brule president of frances union of 
playwrights and composers begged europeans not to turn the 
grandchildren of moliere into those of cocacola 
the americans are seen as crude and rude and it is a continuing 
process said gross of the annenberg school 
it is a defensible argument to impose quotas on other cultures 
but the context and the reason have to be different than to think 
domestic is good and foreign is bad 
the culture split can even get blurred 
once upon a time in america which the belgian commercial 
station vtm showed on its opening weekend last winter is a us 
movie featuring lots of blood and gore however it was directed by 
sergio leone an italian 
not all us television gets a bad rap in europe nor does made 
in europe guarantee unrivaled quality 
on the day that the british and the continental europeans can 
make programs as good as hill street blues they may be in a 
position to talk about holding back american cultural imperialism 
wrote tv critic christopher dunkley in britains financial times 
early this year 
europeans have produced such successful programs as the british 
series jewel in the crown and brideshead revisited and the 
quality west german production berlin alexanderplatz 
but they are not the norm 
italys 250 or so mostly local stations lure viewers with endless 
jewelry sales game shows beauty contests and entertainment 
programs where culture is as sparse as clothing 
some experts see no european television style merely a spinoff 
of the us style they point to chateauvallon a french series 
titled after a fictive town or west germanys das erbe des 
guldenburgs the guldenburg inheritance which match the family 
feuds and romantic escapades of dallas 
they doubt whether quotas can change this since local programs 
would have to be mass produced to meet the new demand 
only the european media giants stand to win when quotas are 
introduced said jean claude burgelman director of brussels 
center for the study of new media and information technology 
these winners could be italys silvio berlusconi the west german 
leo kirch and britains robert maxwell he said in an interview 
and they have no history of producing television art burgelman 
added 
they will want to make heaps of money and will produce works 
for the largest common denominator said hamelink of the hague 
research group you will get the typical series you get in the 
united states a bit of violence a bit of mild sex 
said burgelman instead of american pulp we will have european 
pulp

standard amp poors corp the creditrating 
agency said tuesday that a proposed accounting rule for retirees 
medical benefits would be prone to large errors and distort 
companies balance sheets 
the proposed rule would make companies face up to reality by 
listing the future cost of retirees medical benefits as a liability 
on their books 
rough estimates of the new liabilities range from 400 billion to 
2 trillion for all us companies 
its not the concept thats the problem so much as as the 
implementation solomon samson a standard amp poors managing 
director said in an interview you may be doing yourself more of 
a disservice even though the objective is very noble 
samson said standard amp poors would stick to its own method of 
estimating how retirees medical expenses would affect 
creditworthiness 
companies that promised generous medical benefits to employees 
upon retirement are seeking changes in the accounting proposal 
which would force firms to slash their reported profits by billions 
of dollars 
standard amp poors criticism which first surfaced in a wall 
street journal story tuesday was the severest yet in the ongoing 
debate 
officials at ford motor co and american telephone amp telegraph 
co said tuesday in phone interviews that they support the change in 
principle while believing it is too stringent as proposed 
listing future medical benefits as a liability will sting all 
companies but especially ones that gave their employees better 
retirement medical benefits because it seemed cheaper in the short 
run than paying higher wages and salaries 
hardest hit will be smokestack industries such as automakers and 
steelmakers that have generous benefits packages and growing ranks 
of retirees combined with slow growth or no growth in revenue 
the benefits issue is much like the national debate over social 
security and how to account for the cost of supporting the baby boom 
generation when it reaches retirement 
the financial accounting standards board the chief rulemaking 
body for accountants is taking companies suggestions into account 
and probably will relax the rule somewhat before adoption timothy 
lucas research director of the norwalk connbased organization 
said tuesday 
by accounting rules whenever companies add a new liability for a 
future expense they have to reduce their reported profits by an 
equal amount if the charge were taken all at once or over a short 
period it could turn a profit into a large reported loss alarming 
shareholders 
this liability was built up over past years and under prior 
management teams and some people have the feeling that why does 
this have to happen on my watch lucas said 
still standard amp poors reported criticism was very unusual 
since most other companies have at least supported the concept of 
the change he said 
moodys investors service the main rival to standard amp poors 
said the proposed rule would help rating agencies by providing them 
with more complete information about companies liabilities 
we feel that it is a positive to both rating agencies and 
investors the logic of accruing a future liability has validity 
said harold goldberg a moodys senior vice president 
the debate over accounting rules does not even touch on an even 
bigger issue which is whether companies should set up funds for 
retirees medical benefits the same way they set up pension funds 
tax laws discourage such funds because money put into them cant be 
deducted from corporate income taxes the way pension contributions 
can 
the proposed accounting standard would go into effect in 1992 and 
companies would have 15 years to bring their books into line with 
their actual liabilities 
companies have proposed several ways to ease the blow one is to 
stretch the catchup period to 20 30 or even 40 years another is 
to let companies account for liabilities that have already been 
incurred by going back and restating earnings for prior years 
instead of taking the full blow in current and future earnings 
statements 
an alternative would be to add to liabilities without taking a 
corresponding hit on the profitandloss statement an unusual and 
controversial approach 
some companies including ford want leeway to assume that they 
will be able to reduce inflation in medical benefits costs below 
historical levels something not permitted under the proposed 
standard 
finally some companies have proposed easing the blow by making 
the assumption that employees will not retire until they reach 
mandatory retirement age that would allow more years to accumulate 
the reserve and assume fewer years of payouts

the dollar gained sharply against most foreign 
currencies in active trading tuesday despite a reported wave of 
selling by central banks 
gold prices softened on the commodity exchange in new york gold 
bullion for current delivery settled at 35960 a troy ounce down

us financial markets were closed monday for the labor day 
holiday

confidence that us interest rates would remain firm and could even 
move higher but the dollar ended off its highs of the day largely 
due to profittaking they said

a senior trader for irving trust co the market likes the dollar 
but it thinks its slightly overbought 
traders said the market had little reaction to reported efforts 
by about a dozen major central banks to drive down the dollars 
value including the federal reserve which was said to have 
intervened three times 
a recent chain of positive economic data has helped support the 
dollar by making us securities more attractive to foreign 
investors thereby increasing the need to convert overseas 
currencies into dollars 
some dealers say the dollar is poised to move higher because the 
economys apparent strength might prompt the fed to raise interest 
rates to quell inflationary pressures 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins

in supply which normally occurs at the beginning of autumn when 
refiners shift part of their capacity to output of heating oil from 
gasoline analysts said 
andrew lebow at edampf man international futures inc said the 
energy market was generally quiet with crude taking a cue from the

like modernday conquistadors foreign airlines 
are descending on the new world to buy up pieces of us carriers 
major us airlines have become hot properties stalked by 
bigtime investors unions and rival carriers foreign airlines are 
keen to get in on the action and the americans are eager to get the 
infusions of capital from abroad 
more importantly though the foreigners are taking equity stakes 
in order to help them gain access to the booming us air travel 
market which can augment their passenger traffic 
foreign airlines arent allowed under us law to own domestic 
airlines or carry passengers within the united states so many are 
linking up with american partners in special marketing agreements 
as big stockholders the foreigners can exert even more influence on 
the strategies of us carriers 
theyre using it to get a toehold in the us market said 
andrew geller an airline analyst at provident national bank in 
philadelphia 
british airways scandinavian airlines system klm royal dutch 
airlines swissair japan air lines and australias ansett transport 
industries ltd all have snapped up or are seeking equity stakes 
in us carriers 
the attraction is especially strong for european airlines which 
have been seeking ways of positioning themselves to exploit the era 
of common market deregulation that is set to begin in 1992 
sas the first foreign carrier to buy a stake in a us major 
signed a 50 million cooperation agreement with texas air corp last 
october and holds 99 percent of the houstonbased company sas 
recently has been in talks to buy a stake in struggling continental 
airlines one of texas airs main subsidiaries 
we had a very limited number of us gateways said nils flo 
an sas spokesman in new york explaining why the airline entered the 
agreement that gave it a feeder network in the united states 
a new pilotsandmanagement proposal to buy united airlines 
parent ual corp for 675 billion would include a 15 percent share 
for british airways which has agreed in principal to invest 750 
million speculation was rife tuesday that billionaire oilman marvin 
davis who previously made a lower bid may seek help from another 
foreign airline to top the groups offer 
british airways role in the ual bid is similar to that played by 
klm which is the foreign partner in the investor group that 
recently paid 365 billion for northwest airlines parent nwa inc 
in a leveraged buyout 
under us law foreign airlines may not own more than 25 percent 
of a domestic carrier and the department of transportation can 
object to smaller stakes if it believes the foreign company is 
trying to exert control 
assistant transportation secretary jeffrey n shane said last 
week that the department is reluctant to approve such foreign 
purchases partly because there still are many questions about us 
airlines access to european markets after the common markets 
planned unification in 1992 
ual and british airways two of the biggest airlines started 
with a marketing agreement back in december 1987 that includes 
sharing airport facilities and coordinating schedules 
a british airways passenger in london for example can book a 
flight through to chicago on one ticket the british airline would 
take him from london to new york where he could connect to united 
for the second leg 
the venture has been so successful it has increased both 
airlines passenger traffic by around 30 percent according to sir 
colin marshall british airways chief executive officer 
british airways has methodically extended its presence in 
several bold strokes that should improve the companys 
alreadypotent position as international airline markets are 
gradually deregulated michael armellino and glenn engel analysts 
for goldman sachs amp co wrote in a report 
another international alliance was struck mainly for defensive 
reasons rather than expansive designs delta air lines fearing it 
could be a takeover target recently agreed to sell a 5 percent 
share to swissair the two also have a marketing agreement signed 
earlier 
lufthansa german airlines disclosed friday that it is in talks 
with amr corp parent of american airlines about a possible stake 
in americans sabre computer reservations system 
ansett an australian conglomerate owned 5050 by media tycoon 
rupert murdoch and transportation company tnt ltd in august 1987 
bought a 20 percent stake in america west airlines an aggressive 
regional carrier the two do not have a cooperative agreement but 
america west leases and purchases some of its aircraft from ansett 
we have a lot in common said daphne dicino an america west 
spokeswoman in tempe ariz basically its a very positive 
experience 
hal inc the parent of hawaiian airlines is about 20 percent 
owned by japan air lines a subsidiary of the japanese carrier plans 
to build several hotels in the hawaiian islands 
last week hal signed a definitive agreement for its sale for 
around 22 million to an investment group that includes former 
baseball commissioner peter v ueberroth

wang laboratories inc seeking to restore customer 
confidence and boost sales after a devastating loss and management 
shakeup unveiled a new line of four ibmcompatible personal 
computers tuesday 
analysts said the pcs including one using international business 
machine corps micro channel architecture were priced to compete 
with ibm compaq computer inc and other manufacturers of integrated 
office systems for large corporate customers 
this should allow wang to move out inventory and turn it into 
cash to reduce debt which is the first thing theyve got to do 
get their balance sheet cleaned up said fred pastore a high 
technology analyst at moodys investors service in new york 
wang reported a 424 million loss for the fiscal year that ended 
june 30 and has announced plans to eliminate 2200 of its 30000 
employees by the end of this month it recently reshuffled its top 
management naming richard miller to succeed frederick a wang son 
of founder and chairman an wang as president 
the lowellbased company was a leader in word processing 
equipment in the 1970s but was criticized in the early 1980s for 
sticking with its proprietary systems instead of moving quickly into 
ibmcompatible machines in recent years its sales of minicomputers 
have been hurt by competition from more and more powerful pcs and 
workstations 
pastore said the introduction of the new pcs was intended to 
restore customer confidence by signaling wangs commitment to 
follow established standards rather than trying to go its own 
route and do its own thing 
but because of its financial position he added the best the 
company can realistically hope for is to retain its existing 
customers we dont expect them to get much new business 
pastore said 
wangs worldwide marketing manager daniel h miley disagreed 
he said the company believes the machines will attract new customers 
by providing higher performance greater capability at a better 
price than their competitors and offering a longterm ability to 
run offtheshelf industrystandard software 
theres a move in the industry toward open standards and we 
are clearly supporting that move with this announcement miley 
added 
the new machines manufactured in lowell taiwan and limerick 
ireland include the model pc 35016s a desktop based on the 386 sx 
microprocessor from intel inc of santa clara calif it carries a 
list price of 2695 about 600 less than a comparable model from 
houstonbased compaq the leading maker of ibm compatibles 
wang also introduced the model mc 35016s combining a 386 sx 
chip with micro channel architecture at 2995 micro channel 
which wang has licensed from ibm speeds the transfer of data 
between the computers memory and central processor 
wang also unveiled two pcs based on popular 80286 chips the pc 
25016 at 2095 and the pc 28020 at 2995 the later can be used 
as an inexpensive local area network server linking multiple 
machines

in a booklet sent to bat industries plc 
shareholders hostile raider sir james goldsmith has accused the 
companys board of attempting to frustrate the 216 billion 
takeover bid a published report tuesday said 
the financial times reported that the 23page booklet from 
goldsmiths hoylake investments ltd consortium also attacked the 
performance of bat a tobacco retailing and insurance concern 
securities and exchange commission regulations prohibit hoylake 
from promoting its bid in the united states so the full text of the 
booklet was not made available to american journalists 
bat shareholders received documents in the mail tuesday from both 
sides in the takeover battle 
hoylake sent its booklet on saturday bat on sunday responded by 
describing the hoylake document as highly selective and 
misleading 
hoylake has accused bat of trying to frustrate the offer in us 
courts in its latest document bat countered the criticism by 
quoting statements made by us officials including california 
attorney general john van de kamp that support bats position 
goldsmith has tried repeatedly to uncover evidence that bat has 
not performed for shareholders the statement said no feats of 
statistical manipulation can disguise the consistent strength of 
bats outstanding record 
the threepage letter called on shareholders to reject the bid 
as decisively as they have done so far by doing absolutely 
nothing

cocoa futures prices tumbled to lifeofcontract lows tuesday on 
new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange following a selloff monday 
on the london market that analysts attributed to signs that supplies 
will remain abundant 
on other markets coffee and cattle futures fell sharply energy 
and wheat futures advanced and precious metals retreated 
cocoa futures settled 75 to 78 lower with the contract for 
delivery in september at 1045 a ton 
analysts cited a variety of bearish fundamental and technical 
factors behind the markets decline including rumors that a large 
purchase of ivory coast cocoa was in danger of falling through and 
reports that cameroon another major cocoa producer had followed 
the ivory coasts lead in lowering its minimum guaranteed price to 
farmers 
theres an implication there that they might be aggressive in 
selling cocoa in the future said arthur stevenson an analyst in 
new york with prudentialbache securities inc 
the selloff occurred on the eve of a meeting of some of the 
worlds largest cocoa producers to discuss a strategy for restoring 
stability to the cocoa market through a strengthening of the 
international cocoa association cartel 
but analysts noted that malaysia the worlds fourthlargest 
cocoa producer was not joining the cartel so there is little 
chance for an effective international agreement 
coffee futures fell amid profittaking in new york after posting 
strong gains last week 
green unroasted coffee settled 27 cents to 5 cents lower with 
september at 8430 cents a pound 
live cattle futures plummeted on signs that an expected drop in 
cattle marketings was not materializing 
many traders had been convinced that supplies of fattened cattle 
would dry up in late summer and early fall due to a drop in 
firstand secondquarter feedlot placements 
but many feedlot operators saw the same pattern developing and 
delayed marketing of cattle off of feedlots hoping to sell them a 
little later at higher prices 
because so many feedlot operators delayed marketings the 
expected drop in supplies never developed said chuck levitt senior 
livestock analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
anticipation was the name of the game and everyone responded to 
it he said 
live cattle settled 13 cent to 125 cents lower with october at 
7225 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent to 50 cent lower 
with october at 8112 cents a pound live hogs were 02 cent to 88 
cent lower with october at 3927 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 45 cent to 105 cents lower with february at 4337 cents a 
pound 
energy futures prices rose on the new york mercantile exchange 
paced by an advance in wholesale home heating oil and gasoline due 
to stronger worldwide demand and expectations for a temporary drop 
in supply 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 13 cents to 20 cents 
higher with october at 1905 a barrel heating oil was 53 cent to 
60 cent higher with october at 5457 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 45 cent to 68 cent higher with october at 5376 cents 
a gallon 
wheat futures posted solid gains on the chicago board of trade in 
reaction to improved foreign demand for us wheat while corn and 
soybean futures prices retreated in lackluster trading 
the wheat market was supported by last weeks sale of 200000 
metric tons of us wheat to china and indications the chinese may 
have purchased another large shipment over the weekend analysts 
said 
after the close the agriculture department announced it had 
targeted the philippines for sales of 600000 metric tons of us 
wheat at subsidized prices 
wheat settled cent lower to 5 cents higher with september at 
397 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cents lower with september at 
232 a bushel oats were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with 
september at 134 a bushel soybeans were 7 cents lower to cent 
higher with september at 581 a bushel 
gold and silver futures retreated slightly in quiet trading on 
new yorks commodity exchange 
gold settled 1 lower across the board with october at 36140 a 
troy ounce silver was 13 cents to 15 cents lower with september 
at 5063 a troy ounce

a federal judge tuesday approved a settlement of a 
6yearold racial discrimination suit against general motors corp 
that requires the automaker to pay up to 3 million 
the suit claimed that gm discriminated against nearly 10000 
salaried black employees in michigan ohio and indiana in its 
promotion wage transfer and layoff policies of those about 7000 
still work for gm 
after years of legal wrangling attorneys for gm and the 
employees reached an agreement oct 21 1988 
the decree calls on gm to pay between 1 million and 16 million 
to about 2800 former employees depending on the number of claims 
filed gm also will pay about 1 million in salary increases 
immediately to about 1000 current employees eightyeight 
individual plaintiffs and witnesses will split about 322500 in 
onetime payments 
the settlement also establishes a system to monitor discretionary 
pay raises and promotions for five years based on computer models 
that portion of the agreement has the potential of being the most 
beneficial said attorney dennis james who represented the 
employees 
we think thats where the vast benefit comes in he said 
it will affect a substantial increase in black salaried promotions 
compared to the past patterns 
gm spokesman john mueller said company officials ha not seen the 
order however he said the agreement provides the opportunity to 
redress some perceived inequities and strengthens gms existing 
systems to ensure all employees receive equitable treatment

unionized machinists and ground crews expressed 
doubt tuesday that a pilotled takeover attempt worth 675 billion 
for the parent of united airlines could succeed because it would 
require enormous new debt 
the machinists stance seemed to strengthen the chances that 
california investor marvin davis could succeed in his rival bid for 
ual corp 
cooperation of by all of the companys workers is seen by some 
industry analysts as crucial to the pilotled offer which would be 
undertaken with management and make ual the biggest employeeowned 
company in the country 
the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
said in a statement that ual was worth about 2 billion less than 
the labormanagement offer which was announced friday 
we are very skeptical that united airlines could survive in 
todays marketplace with the additional debt that would be placed on 
the carrier under this proposal as we understand it particularly 
since the proposed purchase price far exceeds the value of the 
airline said john peterpaul general vice president of the 
machinists union 
he said the machinists had not been invited to participate in any 
discussions regarding the labormanagement proposal disclosed friday 
hank krakowski a spokesman for the united chapter of the air 
line pilots association said he had not seen the machinists 
statement and could not comment on it but he said it is our 
strong desire to have all employees on board this proposal 
meanwhile uals stock price climbed tuesday amid speculation 
that davis would top the pilotmanagement offer for ual of 300 a 
share possibly with help from a foreign carrier 
ual closed at 29075 a share in nationwide new york stock 
exchange trading up 375 from fridays close 
the market thinks something else is going to happen said 
andrew geller an airline industry analyst with provident national 
bank in philadelphia i think theres a fair chance hell come 
back with another bid 
analyst edward starkman of painewebber inc interpreted the 
market action as investor caution 
the offer on the table is going to be tough to beat he 
said 
davis a california billionaire who put ual in play last month 
with a 240ashare offer that he later sweetened to 275 was 
reportedly seeking the help of foreign airlines in an attempt to 
outbid the insider group 
the new york times quoted an unidentified source in the davis 
camp as saying davis was talking with european and noneuropean 
carriers 
the davis group did not return telephone calls seeking 
confirmation of the report 
davis previously indicated he might increase his bid to acquire 
united the nations secondlargest airline 
the bid by the labormanagement alliance has financial backing 
from british airways plc 
if successful the labormanagement groups plan would result in 
75 percent employee ownership making ual the countrys largest 
workerowned company british airways would own 15 percent of the 
company and uals management led by chairman stephen wolf would 
hold 10 percent 
federal aviation regulators reportedly are concerned with the 
involvement of foreign entities in takeovers of us airlines 
government authorities are expected to closely examine proposed 
acquisitions that include nonus backers 
the 6300member united chapter of the pilots union helped devise 
the labormanagement offer and is the only ual employee group 
committed to participating in a buyout 
uniteds 12700 flight attendants have indicated a willingness to 
discuss participation the machinists which represent the companys 
mechanics and ground crews havent ruled it out but the unions 
statement tuesday strongly suggested they wouldnt participate 
the pilots have indicated their bid may be partly financed with 
pension money but brian freeman a financial adviser to the 
machinists has said it is inconceivable that his group 
representing 25000 of uniteds 70000 workers would invest pension 
funds in ual 
starkman said the pilots would have a difficult time running ual 
without strong support from the other unions 
what really makes this deal go or not is the cooperation of 
labor he said 
ual has said its board of directors will form a committee to 
review the bids for the company

the blockbuster action film batman and the 
comedies honey i shrunk the kids and parenthood helped 
hollywood rack up a record summer gate of 205 billion according 
to figures released tuesday 
boxoffice revenues from memorial day to labor day were up 20 
percent from last summers record 17 billion 
batman emerged as at least the sixthbiggest smash in movie 
history with ticket sales to date of 2386 million 
nobody in the business can predict how big a movie goes once it 
goes big said rob friedman president of worldwide advertising 
and publicity for warner bros did we know batman was going to 
be a big movie yes did we know how big you never know 
exhibitor relations co president john krier whose company 
compiles box office figures said the popularity of batman 
created a lot of interest in other movies and once people arrived 
there was a little bit of everything out there great variety 
among those contributing to the record season were adult 
moviegoers who in recent years have stayed at home although exact 
figures were unavailable it is believed older patrons boosted the 
grosses of dead poets society parenthood and honey i 
shrunk the kids 
ive always maintained that if there are good movies out there 
people will go to them said si kornblit executive vice president 
of worldwide marketing for universal which distributed 
parenthood 
the healthy summer season was expected to lead to a record year 
at the nations theaters which took in 446 billion last year 
in a summer stuffed with sequels indiana jones and the last 
crusade lethal weapon 2 and ghostbusters ii entertained 
capacity crowds for weeks 
but it was original uncalculated programming such as dead 
poets society when harry met sally parenthood and 
turner amp hooch that gave this summers top 10 list its real 
depth 
five summer movies surpassed the 100 million mark the top five 
respectively were batman indiana jones and the last 
crusade which pulled in 1895 million lethal weapon 2 
1313 million honey i shrunk the kids 1191 million and 
ghostbusters ii 1099 million the titles accounted for 40 
percent of all summer tickets sold 
rounding out the top 10 were dead poets society 864 
million when harry met sally 666 million 
parenthood 641 million turner amp hooch 571 million 
and star trek v the final frontier 505 million 
even though it finished in the top 10 star trek v the final 
frontier was not a huge hit as were a number of other heavily 
promoted sequels karate kid iii and the latest james bond 
installment licence to kill also failed to spin turnstiles with 
any consistency earning 379 million and 332 million 
respectively 
in the horror genre the retreads a nightmare on elm street 5 
the dream child and friday the 13th viii jason takes 
manhattan did not make killings at the box office those films had 
revenues of 20 million and 141 million 
several other summer films featuring superstar names yielded 
benchwarmer business the highpowered flops included clint 
eastwoods pink cadillac 121 million sylvester stallone in 
lock up 171 million casualties of war starring michael 
j fox and sean penn 137 million and dennis quaids great 
balls of fire 137 million 
several industry observers have said the summer record was 
sparked by higher ticket prices with some theaters in new york and 
los angeles charging 7 per admission 
the studios countered that todays movies must compete with 
paycable television and videocassette rentals 
warner bros propelled by batman and lethal weapon 2 
led the studios in summer revenues the studio accounted for 24 
percent of all tickets sold 
disney with no sequels and no overpublicized epics quietly 
claimed the no 2 spot with its honey i shrunk the kids and 
dead poets society 
among the major studios tristar and mgmua had the most 
miserable summers finishing last and nexttolast respectively

a 16 million plan filed in federal 
bankruptcy court tuesday seeks to end a multibillion dollar battle 
between former financier marvin warner and creditors claiming losses 
from a bank collapse that threw the ohio thift industry into a 
tailspin attorneys said 
under the plan filed in us bankruptcy court here warner would 
immediately pay 10 million and make three annual 2 million 
payments beginning with the first anniversary of the plans approval 
warner 70 the target of a flood of lawsuits following the 
collapse of his cincinnatibased home state savings bank in march 
1985 filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in october 1987 
against creditors seeking more than 45 billion 
a motion filed with the proposal states that approval would 
settle virtually all adversary proceedings and litigation related to 
this bankruptcy case 
warner the former us ambassador to switzerland will also pay 
all legal fees and administrative costs and an estimated 2 million 
in taxes associated with liquidation of assets to pay the settlement 
the creditors agreeing to the settlement include ohio deposit 
guarantee fund which went bankrupt because it insured home state 
american savings amp loan assocation of florida thomas tew a trustee 
at the defunct esm government securities fidata corp and several 
communities that invested with esm such as beaumont texas clark 
county nev and harrisburg and dauphin county pa 
they will be paid a prorated share of the 16 million attorneys 
said 
also filed was a motion asking us bankruptcy judge george 
proctor to convert the case back to a chapter 11 reorganization case 
from a chapter 7 liquidation case proctor converted warners 
bankruptcy case to liquidation on july 31 
court officials say they do not know how the proposal would 
affect a hearing scheduled thursday to deal with an earlier motion 
to reconvert the case to chapter 11 
the pact must be approved by proctor and hamilton county ohio 
common pleas judge richard niehaus who will be asked to reduce a 
22 million restitution order in 1987 to cover losses from the home 
state collapse 
warner will be left essentially with his farm which is 
located in ocala said jack r pigman an attorney for connie j 
harris smallwood superintendent of ohios division of savings and 
loan association 
but niehaus who presided at warners 1985 criminal conviction 
resulting from the home state collapse has been firm so far in 
upholding the restitution figure 
warner said friday he decided to pursue a settlement because of 
the pressure the court proceedings have placed on his family 
my family my wife and children have suffered and have suffered 
enough said warner who now lives on a 153acre horse farm 
were it up to me alone i would continue the battle of redemption 
with the last ounce of my strength 
pigman said under the settlement ohio will get about 8 million 
coupled with funds recovered in other home state legal actions the 
state will have collected over 100 million and there are still 
sources of additional funds he said 
the state paid out 129 million to reimburse home state 
depositors float bonds needed to sell home state to other banks and 
resolve the savings and loan crisis that saw 70 ohio thrifts 
temporarily closed in 1985 
warner was convicted on ohio felony charges in home states 
collapse but was acquitted of federal charges in a separate trial 
he is appealing the state conviction and the restitution order 
home state collapsed four days after fort lauderdalebased esm 
was shut down by federal regulators for insolvency home state had 
invested heavily with esm through securities trade and lost 144 
million when esm was closed 
settlement talks going on since january picked up speed last 
week after ronald mowrey a former fbi agent and tallahassee 
attorney was appointed to begin liquidating warners assets 
mowrey conducted an inventory of warners ohio farm near in 
clermont county last week

everybody doesnt like something but nobody 
likes being told a light cheesecake has fewer calories than the 
regular version when it really doesnt attorney general jim mattox 
says 
announcing a settlement tuesday with the sara lee corp mattox 
said the chicagobased sara lee corp will stop advertising that its 
light cheesecake and pound cake snacks have fewer calories than 
its regular cakes 
mattox said that sara lees light classics cheesecakes and its 
all butter pound cake snack have more calories and fat than the 
original creme cheesecake and original all butter pound cake 
respectively 
the advertisements for the light cheesecake and pound cake 
were misleading mattox said 
those of us who are weightwatchers and connoisseurs of 
desserts need as much help as we can get mattox said 
mislabeling a dessert is unfair to consumers 
in chicago sara lee said the agreement involved the use of the 
words light classics on the packaging and advertising of its 
french cheesecake strawberry french cheesecake chocolate mousse 
and strawberry mousse desserts 
the word light appeared in small print and referred to the 
desserts texture said t patrick costello president of sara lee 
bakerys retail division these products were formulated to 
respond to consumers who prefer authentic whipped frenchstyle 
cheesecakes and mousses 
he said while sara lee felt the objection has no merit in 
fact the company decided to settle the dispute because it will 
save us additional costly legal expenses 
under the settlement reached with mattox and the attorneys 
general of eight other states sara lee agreed to stop the 
advertising to display the perserving calorie content of its 
products and said any product labeled light will contain no 
more than twothirds of the calories of the product to which it is

the commerce department ordered shrimp 
fishermen tuesday to install trap door devices in their nets to 
protect endangered sea turtles 
the decision came after months of controversy during which gulf 
coast shrimpers argued the requirement would threaten their 
livlihood 
shrimpers immediately denounced the government order and 
suggested some fishermen may not comply with the regulation despite 
a maximum 20000 fine per violation 
its going to drive a lot of people out of business 
maintained jimmy russell president of the 200boat brownsvilleport 
isabel shrimp producers association on the texas coast i wouldnt 
be surprised if they have a lot of people tell them theyre not 
going to do it 
the government directive came under a court order requiring the 
commerce department take action to protect the turtles thousands of 
which drown yearly when caught in the nets of shrimp fishermen 
primarily in the gulf of mexico 
the question of how to protect the turtles prompted lawsuits by a 
half dozen environmental groups seeking to protect the turtles and 
charges from shrimp fishermen groups that the use of the trap door 
devices will cause them to lose a significant part of their daily 
catch 
last july commerce secretary robert mosbacher suspended 
enforcement of a regulation requiring the devices after angry gulf 
coast shrimpers blockaded shipping channels along the texas coast 
and threatened violence against law officers and the coast guard if 
the requirement were enforced 
among the species to be protected by the socalled turtle 
excluder devices or teds are the kemps ridley leatherneck 
and hawksbill all of which are listed as endangered species and 
the loggerhead and green se turtles which are listed as being 
threatened 
in making the announcement john a knauss undersecretary of 
commerce said that under the federal endangered species act the 
only way to ensure protection of these vanishing species is through 
the use of teds 
there is no other choice knauss said in a statement 
the decision takes effect friday 
commerce spokesman brian gorman said violators could be fined as 
much as 20000 per violation although penalties likely will be in 
the 8000 range in most cases fishermen will have a grace period 
until oct 15 where all or some of the fine would be suspended if 
the violator installed the required net equipment 
knauss said attempts to protect the turtles by limiting the 
length of time that shrimpers nets are in the water an approach 
that has been tried in recent months was insufficient to protect 
the turtles 
the decision immediately was hailed by environmental group which 
had filed suit seeking the government to require that the trap door 
devices be used by gulf coast shrimpers many shrimpers off the 
south atlantic coast already use the devices 
the decision is certainly what we had hoped for said michael 
weber vice president of the center for marine conservation he 
added however that he expects possible legal attemps by shrimpers 
to get the decision reversed or pressure in congress to have the 
regulation changed 
basically were pleased but were sorry it took so long and we 
had to jump through so many legal hoops said charles miller a 
spokesman for the national wildlife federation at this point the 
turtles are going to have fighting chance 
the controversy over the use of the socalled teds has dominated 
this years gulf coast shrimping season 
last may the commerce department directed that the trapdoor 
devices be installed by shrimp fishermen in the gulf coast where an 
estimated 11000 sea turtles are reportedly drown annually when 
caught in the nets 
but the shrimpers loudly protested use of the teds an 
ovalshaped metal grate about four feet in diameter that is place 
inside the funnellike shrimp nets to allow large animals such as 
turtles to be diverted and escape through a special trap door 
the shrimpers argued that the devices also cause them to lose 
large amounts of shrimp as much as 40 percent of the catch 
according to some fishermen environmentalists have argued that such 
assertions are wrong and that at worst only about 2 percent of the 
shrimp catch is affected and possibly less if the teds are used 
properly 
because of economic concerns mosbacher ordered a twomonth delay 
in enforcing the federal requirement for the devices in july after 
sometimes violent protests erupted among some gulf coast shrimp 
fishermen over the use of teds mosbacher gave the shrimpers a 
choice of using the devices or limiting their thrawl times 
the federal courts however ordered a final rule to be issued by 
sept 8 prompting the commerce department decision tuesday to 
return to requiring the use of the trap door devices 
environmentalists warn that several of the sea turtle species 
especially the kemps ridley may be doomed to extinction in the 
coming decades if they are not protected from shrimpers nets the 
number of female kemps ridley sea turtles nesting each year has 
declined from some 42000 in the 1940s to no more than 700 today 
according to james ross an expert on sea turtles 
ross said that from 600 to 1600 kemps ridely turtles are killed 
each year often after the young turtles get in the way of the 
shrimping nets the decline of the species is estimated at about 3 
percent a year he said

irving azoff who in six years 
resurrected mca records from a sleepy alsoran to the no 2 pop 
music label quit tuesday to form his own entertainment company 
what i want to do is a broadbased company the cornerstone of 
which will be a record company he said in a telephone interview 
basically i intend to start the first major independent of the 
90s with major funding 
azoff said he was evaluating an offer from mca to fund the 
venture asked if there had been other offers he said the phones 
always ring 
before joining mca azoff achieved prominence by his deft 
handling of the careers of such rock superstars as the eagles boz 
scaggs and steely dan many thought him crazy when he decided in 
april 1983 to join the company he once characterized as the music 
cemetery of america 
the roster i inherited was uniquely interesting azoff said 
in a letter to mca employees tuesday could we ever forget the 
catholic girls mcas answer to the gogos zoom the black 
heavymetal band and helen reddy best remembered as a nun in 
airport 75 
after he joined mca the company dropped 41 of its 46 acts and 
started rebuilding often resurrecting the careers of other labels 
discards 
most significantly azoff broadened the labels base beyond rock 
and jazz into black music by signing such acts as klymaxx 
stephanie mills patti labelle and gladys knight and contemporary 
country with artists such as the judds lyle lovett george strait 
and reba mcentire 
today our roster boasts some of the most impressive names in 
contemporary including bobby brown elton john boston tiffany 
jody watley new edition pebbles and fine young cannibals azoff 
said 
a proxy statement shows azoff was paid about 5 million in salary 
and stock last year also in 1988 billboard magazine reported mca 
had become the no 2 pop label behind cbs records mca was ranked 
12th in 1983 the year azoff signed on 
in a statement mca said azoff resigned as an mca inc vice 
president and as chairman of its music entertainment group and was 
working on his future plans including possible business ventures 
with mca 
reports had circulated for several months that azoff wanted to 
run his own company along the lines of david geffen who controls 
the powerful music and movie company named after him 
the trade newspaper daily variety said azoff had been variously 
reported to be negotiating with polygram warner communications and 
boston ventures the investment firm with which mca teamed last year 
to buy motown records as well as mca itself 
mca president and chief operating officer sid sheinberg referred 
to those talks in a news release 
we are very hopeful that negotiations for us to continue to be 
involved with irving in exciting new music entertainment 
undertakings will come to a successful and mutually beneficial 
conclusion he said 
azoff will be succeeded as chairman of mca music by al teller a 
former cbs records president who joined mca last year as a corporate 
vice president and president and chief operating officer of mca 
records 
statistics for mcas music and entertainment group help convey 
how azoff converted mca into a challenger to such recording giants 
as cbs records and warner bros records 
for the 1982 fiscal year mcas recording and musicpublishing 
operations grossed 1417 million for fiscal 1988 the music 
entertainment group which includes homevideo revenues grossed 
661 million 
during his career at mca azoff was plagued by allegations of 
conflict of interest because of his partial ownership of three 
outside companies that did business with mca 
in may 1986 mca bought the companies front line management 
which handled don henley stevie nicks jimmy buffett and heart 
full moon records a small label whose artists included dan 
fogelberg and chicago and facilities merchandising inc which 
handles vending of tshirts caps and other novelties at more than 
40 arenas nationwide 
under azoff mca records boycotted an industry move in 1985 to 
put warning stickers on records that contain obscene material 
besides the record company the music entertainment group 
includes mcas musicpublishing business its records and home video 
distribution unit the universal amphitheater in universal city and 
amphitheaters in atlanta dallas and denver and several other 
businesses 
azoff will continue to act as a consultant for the facilities 
merchandising unit which azoff founded before joining mca

spy the irreverant new york humor magazine can 
distribute its spoof of cliffs notes the longestablished study 
guide to the classics a federal appeals panel ruled tuesday 
three judges of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals vacated a 
lower courts injunction that banned the distribution of spy notes 
a parody that used the cliffs notes format to also poke fun at what 
spy coeditor kurt andersen called the hip urban novel 
the onepage ruling did not give the reasons for the decision 
the judges said a full opinion would follow 
it is a happy day for us and the first amendment andersen 
said 
as a result of the ruling spy notes is expected to be on sale at 
bookstores around the country by the week of sept 18 said 
jacqueline deval a spokeswoman for the parodys publisher bantum 
doubleday dell publishing group inc 
spy notes gives humorous plot summaries commentary and questions 
for review on contemporary novels like bright lights big city 
by jay mcinerney and slaves of new york by tama janowitz 
it also includes the novelomatic a slide rulelike device that 
andersen says allows readers to create their own 1980s novel 
cliffs notes inc sued the publishing concern because it claimed 
the parody whose cover has cliffs notes distinctive 
yellowandblack stripes looked too much like the real thing and 
would confuse consumers 
us district judge shirley wohl kram granted cliffs notes a 
preliminary injunction on aug 2 and doubleday immediately appealed 
needless to say were sorely disappointed by the ruling 
said cliffs notes attorney william hart he said he could not 
comment further until the appeals panel issued a full opinion

the world bank owned by 151 countries is 
planning grants from a new 100 million package to help some of the 
worlds poorest countries pay off loans to commercial banks a 
spokesman for the world bank said tuesday 
it is expected that the governments will be able to buy back some 
of these commercial bank loans for a fraction of their original 
value 
world bank spokesman william brannigan said that the amount owed 
by any one country to any one bank would be small and that the 
banks would be glad to get the loans off their books 
possible candidates would be bangladesh and nepal in asia and 
countries in southern africa where average incomes are one dollar a 
year or less 
it is expected that a country would only be eligible if it is up 
to date on repayments of loans to the world bank itself and has set 
up a new economic program satisfactory to it or its sister 
organization the international monetary fund 
big debtors like brazil argentina and mexico would not qualify 
brannigan said the plan has been approved by the world banks 
board of executive directors 22 representatives chosen by the 151 
governments but he said approval is still needed from the board of 
governors which is composed of treasury secretary nochlas f brady 
who controls the largest single block of shares in the world bank 
and ministers of finance of the other member governments 
the board of governors will hold its annual meeting in washington 
at the end of this month 
brannigan said its approval is needed because the world bank 
wants to take the 100 million from 1 billion earned annually by 
its international bank for reconstruction and development and use 
the money for grants by its international development association 
the ibrd makes a profit by borrowing money at low rates on the 
market and lending it to third world governments at higher rates 
but for longer periods than those offered by commercial banks and to 
many countries they refuse to lend to 
ida makes loans to the poorest countries for as long as 50 years 
at less than 1 percent interest but normally does not make outright 
grants it gets most of its money from direct contributions by the 
united states and 32 other donor countries 
brannigan pointed out that money owed by the poorest countries 
was lent largely by governments and intergovernment bodies like the 
world bank it is estimated that the total they owe commercial banks 
is about 2 billion 
juergen warnke west germanys minister for cooperation told 
reporters last week that his country alone had cancelled more than 
44 billion in loans over the past 10 years 
president bush announced in july that the united states will also 
be canceling some debts estimated at 1 billion to the poorest 
countries

held by societe centrale dinvestissement the announcement said

percent of industrielle gaining control of industrielle would 
automatically give it a majority stake in group victoire 
industrielle currently has about 40 percent in its insurance unit 
the move follows allegations last week by vernes that suez had 
offered him 3000 francs or about 478 per share above its public 
stock offer suez denied the charges but negotiated the agreement 
with vernes who until now had adamently opposed the offer
