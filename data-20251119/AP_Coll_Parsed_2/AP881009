us commercial bank failures are expected to 
surpass last years record level by the end of 1988 with southwest 
institutions continuing to require the most federal assistance the 
head of the federal deposit insurance corp said sunday 
but fdic chairman l william seidman said the agency remained in 
good shape and is expected to have reserves of 15 billion to 16 
billion at the end of the year despite the mammoth bailout of first 
republicbank corp and a recent call for help by mcorp both in 
dallas 
meanwhile seidman and comptroller of the currency robert clarke 
reiterated their opposition to a possible merger of the fdic which 
insures deposits of about 14000 banks and savings institutions 
and the troubled federal savings and loan insurance corp which 
insures 3200 savings and loans both organizations cover deposits 
of up to 100000 
seidman told a news conference at the american bankers 
associations annual convention that by the end of 1988 as many as 
250 banks will have failed or needed federal assistance to stay 
afloat 
last year a record 184 fdicinsured institutions failed and 19 
received federal assistance reserves at the end of 1987 totaled 
183 billion 
right now the 89 outlook looks better to us it the failure 
rate could go down as much as 25 percent seidman said but i 
must caution you i made that same prediction a year ago 
seidman said the problembank list is slowly declining 
the farm and energy belts in the southwest particularly texas 
were the biggest trouble spots said fdic spokesman alan j whitney 
among the biggest bailouts was first republicbank corp the 
largest bank in texas it had 286 billion in assets when the fdic 
seized all 40 of its subsidiary banks earlier this year before 
agreeing to sell them to ncnb corp of charlotte nc 
and last week mcorp the secondlargest bank in texas with 
assets of about 201 billion said that it probably would need 
federal assistance to survive the bank said it expected to post 
the biggest loss in its history about 525 million in the third 
quarter that ended sept 30 
seidman said it was too soon to tell how much federal 
assistance if any might be needed for mcorp we just received 
their application on saturday he said its premature to have 
any opinion 
still seidman said that a number of substantial institutions 
are interested in a possible investment in mcorp 
in discussing the ailing savings and loan industry both seidman 
and clarke said they remained opposed to a merger of the fdic and 
fslic however both agreed it was likely to be considered by 
congress and the new president 
the fdic hopes to complete a study that began about eight months 
ago on possible solutions for the thrift crisis seidman said the 
cost of liquidating or rescuing the nearly 800 problem thrifts 
nationwide has ranged from 45 billion to 100 billion and many 
experts are predicting that taxpayers eventually will have to foot 
the bill 
but clarke insisted all other alternatives should be 
considered before the taxpayers are asked to pick up the tab

informal bilateral talks ended sunday on 
plans for the withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops from angola without 
reaching agreement on a timetable for their departure sources said 
sunday 
the new york times in mondays editions however reported 
officials from angola cuba south africa and the united states 
agreed sunday that all cuban troops should be withdrawn from angola 
within 24 to 30 months 
the times account quoted unidentified american officials as 
saying the agreement had been reached after three days 
negotiations in new york 
the negotiators had not expected a breakthough at these 
meetings which were hastily arranged because senior diplomats from 
all the nations involved were in new york attending the 43rd un 
general assembly 
south africa has linked its willingness to cooperate with a 
oneyear independence plan for neighboring southwest africa which 
it rules to the withdrawal of the cuban troops soldiers that 
pretoria says threaten the territorys independence 
diplomats involved in the talks say they are working toward 
reaching agreement on a withdrawal timetable at a formal meeting to 
be held later this month in the congo 
that meeting will be crucial because the negotiators are running 
out of time to achieve a compromise before nov 1 the date south 
africa has suggested for implementation of the uns independence 
plan for southwest africa also known as namibia 
negotiators for cuba angola south africa and the united 
states which has acted as mediator held a series of bilateral 
discussions throughout the week with a fourparty meeting taking 
place friday in a midtown manhattan hotel 
chester crocker us undersecretary of state for african 
affairs mediated the talks a role he played earlier this year in 
brazzaville congo the us and south african officials said 
south africas delegation was led by neil van heerden that 
countrys directorgeneral of political affairs said aubry dwyer 
a spokesman for south africas un mission 
in earlier talks cuba and angola first said the withdrawal 
would take four years then compromised to three 
last month south africa and angola agreed on a twoyear 
withdrawal in phases with early retreat from angolas southern 
border with southwest africa but cuba said the withdrawal would 
take 28 months 
if the brazzaville talks are successful the united nations 
plans to send a peacekeeping force of 7500 backed by 2000 
civilian support staff to oversee elections for a national assembly 
in southwest africa to approve a constitution and independent 
government 
south african security forces would gradually withdraw under the 
supervision of the un peacekeepers as specified in security 
council resolution 435 passed a decade ago 
south africa has ruled southwest africa since world war i the 
uns predecessor the league of nations gave pretoria a mandate 
to govern the former german colony 
the general assembly security council and international court 
of justice have since revoked the mandate and declared south 
africas administration illegal 
the cuban troops are in angola to defend that countrys marxist 
government from the us and south africanbacked unita rebel 
movement many observers doubt the ability of the angolan army to 
resist unitas attacks without the cuban troops if washington and 
pretoria continue their support 
the unita rebels have not been party to these talks nor have 
the marxist rebels of swapo the southwest africa peoples 
organization which has been fighting for independence for namibia 
for more than 20 years 
according to the times account the accord reached sunday 
insures that some cuban troops will remain in angola after south 
africa grants independence to namibia 
the times quoted an american official as saying the nov 1 
transition of namibia to independence remained a political 
commitment of the negotiators 
a south african official was quoted by the times as saying that 
nov 1 while still the target was perhaps not achievable

a multimilliondollar battle is being waged in 
massachusetts over a binding referendum that could produce the 
nations first votermandated shutdown of nuclear power plants 
voters here will decide on nov 8 whether to ban the continued 
generation of electric power by commercial nuclear power plants in 
the commonwealth by means which result in the production of nuclear 
waste after july 4 1989 
boston edison co yankee atomic and other utilities have 
funneled more than 5 million into an organization called citizens 
against the shutdown initiative outspending antinuclear activists 
by nearly 201 
antinuclear activists collected 120000 signatures to qualify 
the referendum for the november ballot similar measures have 
failed in oregon maine and california 
a poll by the boston globe in late september of 619 registered 
voters said 49 percent opposed the referendum 37 favored it and 14 
percent were undecided 
the measure if adopted would force the shutdown of boston 
edison cos troubled pilgrim nuclear station in plymouth a 
16yearold plant closed for the past 2 years for nearly 400 
million in safety management and technical improvements after the 
nuclear regulatory commission rated it one of the nations 
worstrun nuclear plants 
boston edison confident it has corrected problems at pilgrim 
has applied for nrc permission to restart the plant massachusetts 
officials are still concerned about the adequacy of evacuation 
plans 
the states other nuclear plant yankee atomic electric cos 
station in rowe in western massachusetts also could be closed by 
the referendum though relatively small and with a good operating 
record it is the oldest operating nuclear station in the country 
at 28 years

increase the danger and the threat from radioactivity and potential 
accidents said anna gyorgy of the citizens for safe energy 
campaign promoting the referendum 
citizens against the shutdown acknowledges industry backing but 
claims both pronuclear and antinuclear members the group says 
the value of pilgrim and rowe should be studied individually with a 
view to what alternative sources of power are available to replace 
them 
gov michael dukakis takes the same position and has opposed the 
referendum for that reason 
opponents contend that if the referendum passes the state will 
be forced to compensate the utilities potentially up to 4 billion 
supporters argue utility shareholders and ratepayers will pay

nasa astronaut william readdy says the 
success of the recent flight of the space shuttle discovery 
provides hope and reopens the door to the future for the us space 
program 
i asked the discovery crew what i should tell you and they 
said to let you know that the dream is still alive i think we 
proved that to all the doubters and all countries with the launch 
last week readdy said the flight of discovery has set us free 
again 
readdy addressed a group of about 200 people at chadron state 
college where he was honored by the college faculty 
administration and students friday his appearance here was part of 
the nasa community information project which has been touring the 
nebraska panhandle 
the last 32 months have been agonizing and painful but the 
successful launch of discovery made it all worth while said 
readdy 36 one of about 60 active astronauts in the nasa program

british experts have used a 2684yearold skull 
to reconstruct the head of king midas who according to legend 
turned everything he touched turned into gold the sunday times 
reported 
dr john prag an archaeologist at the manchester museum and 
richard neave an illustrator in the department of medicine at 
manchester university used the latest knowledge about distribution 
of skin tissue on bone to produce the plaster and clay head the 
newspaper said 
midas ruled phrygia in what is now central turkey from 738 bc 
until 696 bc and was considered the most important member of the 
phrygian dynasty 
according to mythology dionysius the god of wine granted 
midas the golden touch and the kings food and even his daughter 
turned to gold he overcame the curse by bathing in a river the 
legend was apparently inspired by midas great wealth 
in 1957 american archaeologists found what was believed to be 
midas tomb in turkey the skeleton was lost the sunday times 
said but last month turkey invited prag and neave to make a 
plaster cast of the skull and attempt the kind of reconstruction 
they made in 1983 of the head of king philip ii of macedonia 
father of alexander the great 
the two experts drilled tiny holes in the plaster cast inserted 
matchsticks at strategic points and smoothed on clay to the 
appropriate thicknesses the newspaper said 
photos accompanying the times story showed a long narrow face 
with a sharply hooked nose small deepset eyes a downturned mouth 
and prominent lower lip 
neave was quoted as saying that the striking feature of midas 
head was that it was deliberately elongated by bandaging in 
childhood because long distorted heads were considered attractive 
at the time 
dr ellen kohler one of the american archaeologists who 
discoverered the tomb in 1957 was thrilled when shown a photo of 
the reconstruction the newspaper said 
the face is quite striking she was quoted as saying in 
philadelphia it fits in with the one terracotta figure of him 
that exists 
she was quoted as saying the now missing skeleton was of a man 5 
feet 3 inches tall who had died at the age 65 
legend also has it that apollo god of music gave midas an ass 
ears after midas judged a music contest between apollo and pan the 
god of fields and forests and found in favor of pan 
the sunday times quoted prag as saying that if midas suffered 
from a malformation of the ear cartilage called darwins tubercle 
it might explain the legend 
we are pursuing it from a medical point of view and our 
colleagues in turkey are going to get in touch with anthropologists 
and geneticists to see if the condition is still prevalent in 
central turkey the newspaper quoted prag as saying 
the times said midas is believed to have been killed or have 
committed suicide when his kingdom was devastated by a barbarian 
tribe called the cimmerians and some argue he would therefore not 
have been given the rich sort of burial indicated by findings at 
the tomb 
professor rodney young who led the american expedition thought 
the tomb was of midas predecessor king gordios the newspaper 
said but today most experts including other members of the team 
believe it was that of midas it said

every year vice president george bush 
totes a shotgun through the south texas mesquite and huisache brush 
to hunt quail and other birds like many texans 
but does bush born and bred a yankee qualify as a true texan 
texas is really his home and he loves the state he comes down 
as much as he possibly can said will farish whose houston 
company handles bushs assets in a blind trust farish also owns 
the 10000acre ranch where bush has hunted for 20 years 
says daniel ouellette of beeville president of the texas 
republican county chairmans association hes lived in texas 
longer than ive been born quellette is 40 
george bush has been portrayed by some in the media as 
harvard northeasterner wealthy wealthy wealthy ouellette 
said they dont do the same with lloyd bentsen they look at him 
differently 
like bush the democratic vice presidential candidate and native 
of the rio grande valley often reminds texas audiences that hes 
back home 
with bush and bentsen on opposing tickets and 29 electoral votes 
in the balance texas has become a crucial battleground in the 
presidential race 
so how does each candidate claim the title of native son 
bush votes in houston reared his children in texas made a 
respectable sum in the oil business and was elected to congress 
from texas 
he was born in milton mass in 1924 grew up in greenwich 
conn and first came to texas during world war ii to train as a 
navy pilot at the corpus christi naval air station 
in 1948 he returned to the lone star state to take a job in 
odessa in the middle of the west texas oil patch he was 
transferred to california about a year later to sell drilling bits 
then returned in 1950 to midland near odessa 
he eventually formed zapata petroleum with partners that 
included j hugh liedtke who later became head of the pennzoil co 
george made a comfortable amount of money out of it liedtke 
told the associated press in an interview earlier this year it 
was a substantial sum but hes not what in texas is called big 
rich 
the bushes and their five children later moved to houston bush 
became harris county republican chairman in 1962 ran 
unsuccessfully for the us senate in 1964 won a house seat in 
1966 and sold his 6 percent stake in zapata for 11 million 
bush has not owned a home in texas since he became vice 
president in 1981 
his legal voting residence is suite 271 of the houstonian hotel 
and conference center his voting eligibility was challenged by a 
houston state representative because bush purchased a home in 
kennebunkport maine after becoming vice president and has lived 
in the vice presidents residence in washington dc 
but bush prevailed in the 1985 case because the texas 
constitution allows a voter to continue to claim state residency if 
he is serving elsewhere in the federal government 
he lost a 1984 battle with the internal revenue service 
however when he used the maine address on his income tax return 
the idea was to avoid capital gains tax on profits from the sale of 
his 792000 houston home by reinvesting them in the kennebunkport 
house 
the irs ruled that bushs principal residence the only one for 
which the tax break was allowed was washington dc not maine 
and that he therefore had to pay 
attorney harold demoss who represented bush at the june 3 
1985 hearing on his voting eligibility presented harris county 
assessor carl smith with documents proving that bush owned 
undeveloped land in houston had a texas drivers license and 
belonged to a houston church 
bentsen lists the arrowhead ranch in starr county as his voting 
residence 
i would guess on average he spends 35 percent of his time in 
texas and for the last two years i would say 50 percent said 
jack devore spokesman for bentsens race for reelection to the 
us senate 
bentsens father made a fortune in real estate and agriculture 
in the rio grande valley 
calvin bentsen of mcallen a cousin of the senator said they 
grew up together in south texas working on their fathers farms 
he likes the valley calvin bentsen said he likes the 
ranch life out there 
bentsens first elected office was as county judge of hidalgo 
county in 1947 he served in congress from 1949 to 1954 before 
dropping out of politics to become president of lincoln 
consolidated a financial holding company 
bentsen defeated bush and was elected to the senate in 1970 
some doubt whether voters will place much importance on either 
candidates texas residency 
ouellette said people will judge bush not by his residence but 
by his conservatism 
besides says ranch owner farish i dont know exactly what a 
texas accent is

when political filmmaker charles guggenheim 
was asked to list the qualities that democrat michael dukakis 
projects in this presidential campaign he responded with this 
controlled efficient knowledgeable predictable humorless 
what about likable 
no i dont think likable is one of them he said 
is that a problem 
oh its a serious problem 
guggenheim whose career dates back to his service as democratic 
candidate adlai stevensons television consultant in the 1950s 
expresses a widespread view that dukakis has a serious image 
problem which his tv campaign commercials are doing very little to 
dispel 
the smartest clerk in the world was how abcs peter 
jennings a panelist for the first presidential debate last month 
described the massachusetts governor to preface a question about 
his passionless technocratic governing style 
passionless responded the democratic nominee with a smile 
i care deeply about people all people working people working 
families people all over this country 
but does that concern come across to people who watch dukakis 
debating or see him campaigning on tv news broadcasts 
dukakis comes across like your accountant or god forbid your 
dentist said new york media consultant david garth you know 
you have to see him but you dont look forward to it 
he is a very very conservative guy and he is a very 
deliberate guy and he has no natural sense of humor said garth 
who says republican nominee george bush doesnt display much more 
appeal than dukakis 
i dont think theres any warmth or depth of feeling for 
either one of these guys garth said 
the public catches only rare glimpses of dukakis in repose he 
takes a power walk every night dressed in a casual warmup 
suit but photographers are not welcome bush by contrast jogs 
regularly with reporters and cameras in tow 
judy pearson a professor of interpersonal communication at ohio 
university who has written extensively on how women react to 
presidential candidates said dukakis manner doesnt blend with 
his message 
he tends to be very stiff cold she said he doesnt have 
warmth even though the message tends to be one of caring for 
people for the hungry and homeless 
she said his delivery of the words contradicts what hes saying 
what she called his nonverbal message is cold short 
phrases being thrown out like bullets 
when people look at a verbal and a nonverbal message and 
theyre in contradiction what we tend to do is subconsciously 
believe the nonverbal message she said 
kathleen hall jamieson professor of communications at the 
university of texas and author of packaging the presidency 
said dukakis gestures dont go over well 
he originally had a pointing thrusting gesture that looked 
like he thought he was superior and giving a lecture and the 
problem with it was it underscored a tone that was subtle but real 
in his speech she said 
he sounds as if he knows more than we do the danger is you 
can put a spin on that to suggest hes arrogant and patronizing and 
moralistic and selfrighteous 
we dont like people who think theyre better than we are 
she said 
is there something dukakis could do to warm up his image 
im not sure from my experience that a person like that is 
changeable said guggenheim 
i think they could make television films which would help 
allay some of this problem he said but it would have to be 
done by an outside hand the moments in which he does show some 
sensitivity warmth and compassion are unguarded they wouldnt 
be dishonest moments they just would be moments the candidate 
doesnt feel are important 
guggenheim and garth independently offered almost identical 
criticism of the series of dukakis television ads in which actors 
portray political advisers trying to create a positive image for 
bush 
by putting those ads on themselves and being sponsors of them 
they the dukakis campaign are showing they are no different than 
the people they are criticizing guggenheim said 
i think the ads are a disaster garth said 
the message is bush is packaged and were delivering that 
message in our own package he said

tons of food medicine and other 
supplies are pouring into jamaica but officials and relief 
agencies say much more is needed to feed and shelter tens of 
thousands left homeless by hurricane gilbert 
the aid is reaching the people the problem is the magnitude 
of their need said an official close to prime minister edward 
seaga its like an endless pit the suffering of the people is 
greater than the amount of aid available 
seaga said in a nationally broadcast speech last week that by 
christmas he hoped comfort will be restored to those who are 
shelterless farmers will be in the fields and the lights will 
shine again 
he told parliament that gilbert caused 818 million to 1 
billion damage in jamaica far less than the 8 billion he 
estimated when gilberts 130 mph winds slammed into the island 
sept 12 
the latest government damage report said the storm killed 45 
people severely damaged or destroyed half the countrys homes and 
caused 200 million damage to banana coconut coffee and other 
crops 
seaga said other countries and international agencies such as 
the international monetary fund and the world bank have pledged 
515 million in aid including 125 million from the united states 
he said the funds would cover government emergency spending and 
regular fiscal year expenses but more is needed to repair damage 
to private farms shops and industries 
most of the hundreds of tons of donated food medicine and 
building material from abroad is handled by private relief 
organizations such as the salvation army the red cross and 
project accord a grouping of local churches 
the agencies say their most urgent needs are plastic sheeting 
zinc roofing and lumber 
there are no official figures on the number of people left 
homeless by the storm 
seaga originally estimated a half million homeless but jean 
lewis director of the jamaican information service said officials 
now believe the number is much less 
the salvation army said it is caring for about 50000 homeless 
nationwide and the red cross has about 26000 in its shelters 
both agencies operate dozens of shelters across this nation of 23 
million people 
about 200 people still homeless three weeks after the hurricane 
were sheltered at the national stadium in kingston 
if we had a house and bed we would have been out of here long 
ago said gloria lesly 47 a mother of five she said both her 
home and the shop where she sold fish were blown away during the 
hurricane 
the refugees were crowded into four large rooms of the stadium 
sleeping on dirty bedding spread over the cement floor and cooking 
outside on small gas stoves the group included about 40 sparsely 
clothed barefoot children and several pregnant women 
kingstons streets have been cleared of debris and workers in 
cherrypickers are repairing power lines city employees and 
residents can be seen repairing the roofs of homes government 
buildings and churches which were either completely blown off or 
sustained heavy damage 
at least half the homes and buildings in kingston appear 
damaged and most big trees in courtyards and public squares were 
blown down 
the tourist industry suffered about 45 million damage to hotel 
roofs and windows but 85 percent of hotels are back in operation 
and business is expected to return to normal by the end of october 
the jamaica tourism board reported 
although most of the island was without power the day after the 
hurricane about 55 percent of the nations power supply has been 
restored and 60 percent of the water supply is running 
technicians from several caribbean nations the united states 
puerto rico great britain and canada have arrived to help restore 
lights by christmas 
most of the 125 million received from the united states will be 
used for reparing power lines and water mains supplying seedlings 
for destroyed crops and financing rebuilding efforts said bill 
joslan the local director of the us agency for international 
development 
col franklin thompson director of the kingston chapter of the 
salvation army said 300000 pounds of food and medical supplies 
donated by new york citys west indian population is stranded at 
jfk international airport for lack of transportation

two out of three small investors who 
experienced problems during the stock market crash are still 
waiting a year later for their complaints to be resolved according 
to a survey released sunday by state regulators 
the north american securities administrators administration said 
64 percent of investors responding to a survey said their problems 
arising from the collapse of the stock market in october 1987 had 
not been resolved 
this confirms our suspicions that small investors were and 
remain the invisible victims of the oct 19 stock market crash 
said john baldwin the new president of the nasaa the national 
organization for state securities regulators 
a full year after black monday those of us who regulate the 
markets at the grass roots level are still finding a surprising 
number of dazed investors stumbling through the ruins of their 
postcrash finances said baldwin who is director of the utah 
securities division 
baldwin said the organizations survey showed that investors who 
had been burned were not rushing back into the market one out of 
seven small investors said they had bailed out of the market 
altogether or were holding less than 500 in securities 
of those still in the market twothirds indicated they had 
changed or were planning to change brokerage firms 
the most common complaint made by half of the survey 
respondents concerned problems with brokers executing trades late 
or getting trades wrong during the hectic period surrounding the 
crash the next most common gripe made by 337 percent of those in 
the survey concerned charges that their broker had misled them 
close behind at 303 percent were complaints concerning brokers 
who put their customers in unsuitable investments such as a highly 
risky venture for a customer without a lot of money to lose 
asked how long it had taken to resolve their complaints an 
overwhelming 64 percent of those responding said their complaints 
were still not resolved some 36 percent said their problem had 
been resolved in one month or less 
among the comments made in the survey 
a housewife in florham park nj who lost 50000 invested 
in stocks wrote my financial security has been drastically and 
unnecessarily destroyed even if i were in a financial position to 
invest now i would never put my money anywhere but in the bank i 
could never have faith in brokers again 
a pineville ala engineer who lost a 197000 portfolio 
accumulated in 20 years of investing wrote since the stock 
market crash i have been surviving day by day depressed trying to 
forget about the stock market 
a retiree in cape gable fla who complained that his broker 
had never outlined the danger of option trading said i lost 
basically everything we owned we have now had to go back to work 
to earn enough to live own 
a new york city public relations man wrote this continues 
to be one of the most painful situations ive ever experienced to 
have lost so much money which was hardearned and difficult to 
save and to feel that i have nowhere to go for help and dont know 
how to rectify the problem or recoup the loss 
not all investors complained about their brokers a port orange 
fla investor who complained to the manager of a major discount 
brokerage house that his order placed on oct 20 1987 had been 
mishandled received a credit for more than 6500 covering the 
full amount of his loss 
baldwin said it was important for investors to know what avenues 
of help existed for them to get their complaints resolved he said 
one of the best places to look for assistance was the investors 
state securities bureau 
baldwin said often state regulators were able to get results 
just by getting the brokerage firm and the investor together to 
discuss the problem 
he said arbitration and court suits were also available 
although the survey found that both approaches were time consuming 
of the cases that went to court 90 percent of them were still 
pending and 87 percent of the cases in arbitration were still 
unresolved 
the survey was based on responses to questionnaires mailed to 
2500 callers selected at random from 15000 investors who have 
used a hotline set up following the crash by the nasaa a total of 
829 investors returned the mailed surveys 
the association said the typical respondent was a male aged 55 
or older with a gross income of around 30000 who had lost 
between 1000 and 5000 in the stock market crash 
the survey results were released at the start of the 
associations annual convention in sante fe nm

the picture post founded in 1938 pioneered photojournalism in 
britain and was bought weekly by millions throughout world war ii 
and the late 1940s it folded in june 1957 because of poor 
circulation 
he built up a most interesting and excellent assortment of 
rather good magazines during his career said stevens but he 
was convinced that television was going to destroy picture post 
which was his great creation so he took this extraordinary 
decision to kill it 
after an early career as a lawyer hulton moved into the 
publishing business following in the footsteps of his father who 
once owned londons evening standard newspaper 
in 1937 he founded the hulton press and published several weekly 
journals including the pocketsized lilliput magazine he sold the 
business in 1959 
hulton owned the entire village of salperton in gloucestershire 
western england where he tried to set up a model farming community 
fiercely proeuropean he became editor in chief of the european 
review a member of the executive committee of the european league 
for economic cooperation and a member of the british council of the 
european movement 
hulton was married twice both times to russian women and both 
marriages were dissolved 
stevens said hultons second wife princess nika yourivietch 
with whom he had lived for the past nine years despite being 
divorced was with him when he died as was his eldest son 
hulton is also survived by another son and a daughter

a bill initially intended to improve airline 
service is hitting a stone wall as congress debates controversial 
provisions that would protect jobs after industry mergers and 
require employee drug testing 
with the senate and house hoping to adjourn for the year by 
weeks end the chances seem bleak that negotiators from the two 
chambers will work out a compromise and persuade president reagan 
to sign it 
its going to be very difficult to put it together conceded 
sen wendell ford dky chairman of the senate aviation 
subcommittee and one of the legislators trying to shape the bill 
the measure contains three separate initiatives that each are so 
divisive that the legislation seems to be sinking under its own 
weight 
certain members are on and off the reservation said rep 
norman mineta dcalif chairman of the house aviation 
subcommittee its like a chess game 
each chamber passed its own version of the bill last october at 
the height of public fury over deteriorating air service and 
concern about safety 
the legislation would require the airlines to submit monthly 
reports to the government on flight delays lost luggage and other 
problems the department of transportation began releasing similar 
figures last fall but the bill would require a more extensive 
reporting system 
this section of the legislation is the basis for problem no 1 
the house bill is much tougher on the airline industry containing 
one provision for example that would force carriers to provide 
free tickets to passengers whose bags are lost ford says he wants 
nothing tougher than the requirements the transportation department 
has already imposed 
both chambers measures also contain laborsought language 
opposed by the airline industry that would protect the jobs of 
employees whose jobs are endangered by air carrier mergers 
these provisions have strong support from most lawmakers but 
paradoxically they are the real hangup in the bill according 
to sen ernest hollings dsc chairman of the senate commerce 
committee 
that is because the laborprotection provisions are so strongly 
opposed by reagan that administration officials say it would cause 
him to veto the entire measure the presidents opposition seems so 
steadfast that hollings are some other lawmakers would prefer to 
remove the language from the bill 
i just dont believe in spinning my wheels just to make tv for 
someone he said weve got work to do 
problem no 3 is over language in the senate bill but omitted 
from the house version that would set up extensive testing for 
drug and alcohol abuse by employees in the airline railroad and 
trucking industries 
hollings and sen john danforth of missouri the ranking 
republican on the senate panel have fought for the testing 
provisions all year 
the initiative was inspired by the jan 4 1987 collision of a 
conrail locomotive with an amtrak passenger train in chase md in 
which 16 people died and 175 others were hurt 
two crewmen on the conrail engine admitted later that they had 
smoked marijuana shortly before the crash 
but the testing issue has been a difficult one for lawmakers to 
resolve 
labor groups contend the testing particularly random 
examinations of workers would violate privacy and could be 
vulnerable to erroneous laboratory results that would jeopardize 
employees jobs 
there are also differences over whether rehabilitation programs 
should be provided for workers with drug or alcohol problems who 
would pay for them and whether employees who go through them should 
be guaranteed getting their jobs back 
how far were going to be able to go i dont know mineta

the case of tawana brawley whose 
story of rape was branded a lie by a grand jury has left an 
atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion between blacks and whites in 
the countrys most populous area 
the black teenagers account of abduction and attack by six 
white men which became a national symbol of racial tension and 
occupied new york state politicians and law enforcement authorities 
for much of 1988 was nothing more than a teenagers tall tale 
possibly to avoid punishment for staying out late the panel 
concluded 
miss brawley 16 still insists shes telling the truth 
but after her initial claim to be a crime victim family 
advisers insisted that she not testify before the grand jury her 
mother refused to honor a subpoena and faces possible arrest 
as far as im concerned it was the biggest hoax thats ever 
been perpetrated on the american public said lt william mccord 
acting police chief in wappingers falls former home of the 
brawleys 
the teenager was found last nov 28 lying in a garbage bag 
after being missing for four days her body was smeared with feces 
and epithets like nigger and kkk scrawled in charcoal on 
her torso 
she wrote white cop on a piece of paper when asked who was 
involved 
sympathy poured in entertainer bill cosby offered a 25000 
reward for information 
miss brawley and her family insisted that a legal system 
dominated by whites couldnt give justice to blacks 
her advisers the rev al sharpton and attorneys c vernon mason 
and alton maddox jr called for a special prosecutor to 
investigate the case gov mario cuomo named attorney general 
robert abrams as special prosecutor and a grand jury was empaneled 
feb 29 
but while the grand jury tried to investigate in secrecy the 
brawley teams public statements became more heated and twisted 
sharpton equated abrams to adolf hitler and maddox publicly 
suggested the attorney general masturbated in front of a picture of 
miss brawley 
and they named names the lawyers flatly accused two law 
enforcement authorities dutchess county assistant prosecutor 
steven pagones and former fishkill police officer harry crist jr 
of being involved in the attack a notion later discounted by the 
grand jury crist had committed suicide apparently for unrelated 
reasons shortly after miss brawley was found 
at the outset i think i accepted that if not all the charges 
were true at least there was something there said lucille 
pattison dutchess county executive i could not believe that the 
story was all cut from the same cloth but the longer the advisers 
kept tawana from talking the more suspicious i got 
the grand jury confirmed such suspicions it said there was no 
evidence miss brawley was sexually assaulted but that there was 
plenty of evidence including clothing fibers and hair samples 
that indicated she had concocted the story herself the grand jury 
also cited evidence of a troubled family life and suggested that 
miss brawley had been beaten for earlier transgressions by her 
mother and by her stepfather who once served a prison term for 
killing his thenwife 
abrams wrote a letter to the state judicial discipline committee 
calling for an investigation of miss brawleys lawyers for 
violations of legal ethics he also said his office is 
investigating sharptons activities and said he believed federal 
prosecutors are conducting a similar investigation 
miss brawley denounced the grand jury report declaring i am 
not a liar many of her supporters stood by her 
i have not allowed myself to agree with the minority that 
thinks this is a hoax said the rev saul williams a newburgh 
minister whose church has held rallies for miss brawley i 
believe it 
hazel dukes chairwoman of the state chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said shes 
distressed by the divisions caused by the case dukes said she 
accepts the grand jurys conclusions but has a hard time believing 
a girl could scrawl such slurs on herself 
there have been several racial incidents among youths in 
wappingers falls this autumn with a half dozen people arrested 
mccord said its due in part to tensions caused by the brawley 
case 
the difficult thing is trying to put things back together 
here pattison said noting the bitterness has given new 
ammunition to bigots 
i think there will be a suspicion for a while but i think new 
yorkers are a wise compassionate people dukes said i would 
hope that each case could be judged on its own merit i hope that 
this case could be put behind us and we can concentrate on other 
problems

ethnic and economic unrest is 
destroying the legacy of the late josip broz tito chipping away at 
the power of the communist party and leaving many people clamoring 
for another strong leader 
serbian nationalist rallies that brought hundreds of thousands 
to the streets in recent weeks have turned into antigovernment 
protests by workers chanting that they cannot feed their families 
and students demanding a multiparty system and free elections 
the country is ruled by fascists one student told an 
antigovernment protest in montenegro last week 
just a year ago such a statement immediately would have brought 
the student a lengthy term in jail 
but the worst economic and political crisis since world war ii 
has weakened the power of communist authorities so much that such 
declarations and acts of resurgent nationalism are now common 
symbols of royalist precommunist serbia have appeared as 
graffiti on belgrade streets songs from the same period banned 
just months ago are sung openly in restaurants 
the system tito bequeathed to yugoslavia when he died in 1980 
was designed to keep this nationalism in check 
by giving each of yugoslavias six republics and two autonomous 
provinces broad control of their own affairs and rotating national 
offices annually among communists from the different regions tito 
prevented one republic from dominating the others 
but the ethnic splits in this nation of 23 million and the 
yawning economic gap between the prosperous north and backward 
south have combined to weaken the federal system so it is 
incapable of dealing with the worsening economic crisis 
inflation is at 217 percent unemployment at 15 percent and the 
foreign debt at 21 billion austerity measures imposed in may to 
ensure more foreign loans have slashed wages but not prices making 
life hard for many workers and driving them into strikes and 
protests 
as economic hardship increases nationalist sentiments grow 
people who thought of themselves as yugoslav in better times now 
think of themselves more as serbs slovenes or croats and angrily 
blame other republics for their own economic demise 
in serbia this summer this nationalist sentiment exploded into 
a series of rallies fueled by serbian discontent over the treatment 
of their brethren in kosovo an autonomous serbian province now 
dominated by ethnic albanians 
the serbian minority in kosovo once the heart of serbias 
medieval empire alleges daily harassment by albanians 90 percent 
of the population serbs accuse the majority of seeking union with 
neighboring albania 
the serbian rallies quickly turned into a huge show of support 
for serbian communist party leader slobodan milosevic an ambitious 
47yearold politician who has dominated serbias politics and 
media for the past year 
milosevic has won popularity by pushing for greater serbian 
control over its two autonomous provinces vojvodina and kosovo 
on thursday a combination of his pressure and a 30hour siege 
by tens of thousands at local communist party headquarters forced 
the resignation of vojvodinas leadership 
when demonstrators tried to do the same thing in the southern 
republic of montenegro on friday night clubwielding police waded 
in to break up the crowd police used tear gas in another town in 
montenegro and authorities clearly feared the unrest was getting 
out of hand 
many yugoslavs feel a strong leader like tito is needed to 
control the bubbling ethnic and economic tension for the serbs 
milosevic is such a man a dynamic speaker who last week 
demonstrated his oratorical skills by persuading angry workers 
outside the national parliament to go home 
but the westwardlooking most prosperous republics of slovenia 
and croatia will oppose any serb becoming a leader and they are 
alarmed by milosevics use of street rallies to pursue his 
political aims 
the slovenes also fear another option military rule 
we must stop the method of the lynch and more sharply discuss 
the responsbility of all of us in legal institutions slovene 
communist franc setinc said in an interview published sunday 
setinc resigned two weeks ago from the communist partys ruling 
politburo after coming under heavy fire in media controlled by 
milosevic 
in sundays interview in tanjug without mentioning milosevic by 
name he noted that the unrest is fueled by spontaneous 
dissatisfaction over kosovo the economy and the communist party 
but is not unorganized 
i am not trying to undermine anyone but i am afraid of the 
directors in the wings and their plans where is all this leading 
us

a white librarian who was dismissed for using 
a racial slur before a class in an almost allblack district has 
been taken back by the school district after her students decided 
they wanted her to stay 
the gould school board dismissed lois bostic after she used a 
phrase including nigger while trying to control a class of 
sixthgraders 
two of the districts 147 students are white 
she didnt mean any harm to it ray rainey jr gould high 
school senior class president said friday while he and other 
students celebrated the boards reversal 
the school board reacting to a petition signed by 91 parents 
had asked mrs bostic to resign by the weeks end 
but on wednesday six students gathered in the library to 
discuss the situation 
we decided we wanted her to stay rainey said 
the students typed petitions and handed them out and of the 135 
students present thursday 124 signed 
i think the parents signed their petition without really 
knowing what it was about rainey said they didnt know mrs 
bostic he said of the parents 
my aunt was the one that started the first petition rainey 
said but my father said to do what i felt was right 
alan minor school board president was surprised by the 
students efforts 
i thought there had been anger and animosity among the 
students he said instead the anger came exclusively from the 
parents 
mrs bostic was overwhelmed by the students reaction 
i was dumbfounded when i found out how many students signed 
she said 
mrs bostic who is in her first year at the community of 1670 
in southeastern arkansas said she had heard the word nigger used 
in conversation between two black students and got the impression 
that it was acceptable among them 
she also said she used the word for shock value to try to get 
through to the students 
rainey said most students didnt take offense 
she was saying not to act that way he said 
ive become a hero for this mrs bostic said and its 
not right because i made a stupid mistake

this years presidential campaign 
between republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis has 
made little contribution to the english language say editors at 
merriamwebster dictionaries 
its been dull said senior editor james g lowe whose 
lexicographers have been keeping close tabs on campaign rhetoric in 
hopes of finding new words 
since the days of caucus an algonquin indian term that 
entered the american political vocabulary in the 1760s and down 
through mugwump power broker suffragette 
smokefilled rooms armtwisting wheelerdealer and 
dirty tricks national politics and particularily presidential 
campaigns have been a rich source of new words he said 
although the candidates have revived some old terms such as 
limousine liberal coined by mario procaccino during his 1969 
campaign against new york city mayor john lindsay they have come 
up with little new 
with only a few weeks of the campaign left lowe sees only 
scam used as a combining term as in iranscam 
contrascam debatescam as enduring and pastel 
patriotism as a possible starter 
according to one version pastel patriots were what the 
republicans called the democrats for decorating their convention 
arena not in traditional red white and blue but in hues that 
looked red white and blue on television 
i dont know whether to blame their speech writers but the 
candidates havent been talking about issues said lowe pointing 
out that this campaign is devoid of new deals square deals 
hoovervilles and frontiers of any kind 
their forte is oneliners he said its a quick way of 
getting attention but as soon as the campaign is over those 
oneliners will be forgotten 
even the press has been uninspired according to lowe 
its very often the journalists that invent words lowe 
said time and newsweek magazines because of their breezy style 
and need to condense information have been particularily fertile 
sources for us over the years but not in this campaign 
a new word gets into websters simply by being used repeatedly 
in newspapers magazines and other contemporary writing lowes 
staff spends most of its time reading and noting new words and new 
uses on citation cards and when a term builds up sufficient 
citations over an extended period of time it is added to the 
dictionary 
the test involves being more than a onecampaign phenomenon 
such as former vice president spiro agnews radiclib which 
quickly amassed a pile of citations following his 1970 speech and 
has been heard little since 
the reagan years in general have provided slim linguistic 
pickings lowe said two terms that have stuck and moved beyond 
their political origins are exit poll which came into popular 
use in 1980 when west coast television viewers learned before their 
polls closed that reagan had defeated jimmy carter and yuppy 
which blossomed with colorado sen gary harts campaign for the 
democratic nomination in 1984 
not only has the current crop of candidates added little to the 
vocabulary republican vice presidential hopeful dan quayle even 
tried unsuccessfully to get websters to delete a word 
quayle took offense last year at supplementary definitions for 
the word hoosier in the third new international dictionary 
which pointed out that besides referring to a resident of indiana 
the noun can refer to an awkward unhandy or unskilled person 
as a verb the word can mean to loaf or botch a job 
quayle suggested the dictionary company define hoosier as 
someone who is quick smart resourceful skillful a winner 
william a llewellyn president of merriamwebster declined to 
revise the dictionary entry he pointed out that many words have 
more than one meaning and we in the dictionary business cannot 
arbitrarily decide that we will enter only one of those senses 
dictionary makers do not truly define words llewellyn said 
rather they record the language as it is used

a vast and previously undiscovered population 
of tiny plants and animals lives in hollowed pores carved through 
the sea ice that forms annually around antarctica researchers said 
in studies released sunday 
cornelius sullivan coleader of a national science foundation 
polar study expedition said scientists studying the sea ice found 
large and thriving populations of krill a small shrimplike 
animal grazing on onecelled plants and animals that live in the 
ice pores 
the sea ice is a place where for a small expenditure of energy 
the krill can avoid predators and live in a rich pastureland 
said sullivan the director of marine biological research at the 
university of southern california in los angeles 
existence of the vast population of plants and animals living in 
the ice came as a surprise to researchers who spent 70 days during 
the heart of the antarctic winter studying the polar ice 
during the winter sea water freezes to a sixfoot thickness and 
forms a pack extending 1100 miles from the antarctic mainland the 
total ice formed around the south pole continent is roughly 11 
million square miles three times the area of the united states 
each spring 80 percent of the ice melts creating a 
nutrientrich layer of water that is filled with small plants and 
animals and with the birds and mammals that feed on them 
but the amount of life that existed within the ice during the 
winter months was an unanticipated discovery said sullivan in a 
telephone interview 
he said the scientists found that the sea ice was not solid but 
was pocked with channels rather like swiss cheese these 
channels form as hairlike pores when the ice freezes and then are 
enlarged by wave action said sullivan 
once the channels are in place they form a home for onecelled 
plants called algae that live in the microscopic spaces between the 
ice crystals 
sullivan said the algae is remarkable because it is able to 
perform photosynthesis in temperatures at or below freezing 
sunlight strikes the ice five to six hours a day in the winter and 
enough of the light penetrates the ice to allow the algae to grow 
the ice algae he said has adapted to the frigid temperatures 
and will fall apart if allowed to warm to typical room 
temperatures 
once the algae has bloomed in the ice sullivan said the pores 
in the ice surface becomes home to bacteria protozoans and 
amoebas many of which feed on the algae the krill free swimming 
from the ocean then make their way into the channels and feed on 
the other small ice creatures 
divers exploring the ice from below were able to probe the ice 
channels and bring out samples of the life there 
almost all of the krill we found were in larval or juvenile 
stages which gives us the idea that the krill are using the ice as 
a giant nursery for early development stages said sullivan 
some studies indicate that the ice pack around antarctica may be 
shrinking because the earth is slowly warming if this is true 
said sullivan it could have an impact on krill which is a key 
animal in the polar ecosystem 
adult krill live in vast schools and are a favorite food of 
whale penguin and seal 
krill is a key species that others depend on said sullivan 
a decline in the krill population could affect the populations of 
other animals he said because they are obviously all linked

canada has lost its patience with us fishermen 
poaching in its territorial water and after years of fruitless 
pursuit has resorted to firing machine gun warnings at one boat 
and boarding another 
on oct 1 canadian fisheries officials fired a 50caliber 
machine gun across the bow of a new bedford scalloper the donna 
lynn and chased it for six hours before giving up 85 miles east of 
nantucket 
the vessel has yet to return to port but canada has asked the 
us state department to investigate and press charges against the 
vessels skipper 
the conflict goes back to 1984 when the world court divided up 
the thousands of miles of the georges bank in the gulf of maine 
when the court was through the united states had fishing rights in 
twothirds of the area but the 9000 square miles that went to 
canada turned out to have the lions share of the fish 
for about three years canadian officials simply gave chase when 
they found american vessels where they didnt belong late last 
year they decided to crack down arming patrol boats with machine 
guns and threatening to disable vessels if necessary 
weve been very careful to be sure that all these steps are 
well known to the whole fishing industry obviously there are very 
controlled sets of procedures in place which may result in an 
armed boarding very similar to those your coast guard uses 
said peter flewwelling chief of surveillance and enforcement for 
the canadian federal department of fisheries and oceans 
there are many sensitivities that come to play and so 
consequently there is due concern flewwelling said in a 
telephone interview from ottawa 
us policy is to neither assist nor interfere in canadian law 
enforcement 
of course it is of concern said coast guard cmdr terry 
hart chief of law enforcement for the northeast district more 
than 11000 us fishing vessels are licensed to work in his 
district which runs from new jersey to the canadian border 
we are always concerned about the safety of life at sea we 
put out a release last winter notifying the us fishing fleet 
that this is what the canadians intend to do 
the coast guard even plies canadian water to find us 
offenders hart said 
we go on the canadian side if we find us vessels we 
document the violation we tell them they are in violation and 
taking a risk he said 
hart said he knows of no canadian vessels fishing where they 
dont belong weve never seen any over there and probably for a 
very good reason theres better fishing on their side of the 
line 
if penalized in this country violators risk loss of their boat 
a year in jail and up to 10000 fine 
the us national marine fisheries service and coast guard plans 
to board the donna lynn when it returns to port he said 
information gathered then and the canadian allegations will be 
delivered to a federal magistrate for possible prosecution 
this months incident was the second in three months 
in july the mary elizabeth a new bedford dragger was seized 
and the captain arrested after canadian authorities claimed the 
boat was fishing in canadian water the captain and crew denied the 
charges insisting they were illegally boarded and were fishing in 
international water 
the donna lynn allegedly was discovered three nautical miles 
inside canadian water

his name didnt appear on the list of foreign 
policy heavy hitters who were recruited as advisers to george 
bushs presidential campaign and his face hasnt appeared in any 
photographs of the republican nominee on the campaign trail 
donald gregg a 60yearold retired cia agent studiously avoids 
publicity as he labors in an office adjacent to the white house as 
the vice presidents national security adviser it is a role he 
might continue to play if bush is elected president in november 
gregg has survived lingering questions about his role in the 
irancontra affair although his name surfaced again last month in 
a congressional report charging that cia specialists ran a covert 
propaganda campaign to arouse public support for president reagans 
centralamerica policy 
hes a loyal man loyal to bush loyal to his country said 
retired adm daniel murphy the vice presidents former chief of 
staff 
hes done a good job murphy said reflecting the view taken 
by bush when he is asked about gregg 
madeleine albright a georgetown university professor who 
advises democratic nominee michael dukakis on foreign policy said 
i think generally there remain questions about the kind of people 
that the vice president surrounds himself with 
the house foreign affairs committee staff asserted sept 13 that 
cia operatives along with military experts in intelligence and 
psychological operations improperly used the state departments 
office of public diplomacy for latin america and the caribbean for 
the alleged propaganda campaign 
the report said that on greggs recommendation former cia 
propaganda expert walter raymond jr was assigned to the white 
house national security council unit that directed the public 
diplomacy office 
the staff suggested that the committee investigate whether the 
agents used the state department as a cover for a domestic 
operation which went far beyond the legal and ethical scope of 
their authority 
the committee has not yet acted on the report white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater dismissed the report as a rehash of 
earlier allegations 
gregg refused requests for an interview steve hart a spokesman 
in the vice presidents office said i think its fair to say 
that the focus is on the presidential campaign right now and mr 
gregg prefers that it stay that way 
greggs name figured in other disclosures stemming from the 
clandestine sale of us arms to iran in 1985 and 1986 and the 
subsequent diversion of proceeds to assist nicaraguan contras at a 
time when congress had banned military aid to the rebels 
in middecember 1986 bush published a chronology of meetings 
between gregg and felix rodriguez a former cia official and 
counterinsurgency expert who was identified as a coordinator of 
supply flights to the contras the chronology showed they met at 
least 10 times starting nov 3 1983 
bushs office has said repeatedly that it was was never involved 
in directing coordinating or approving military aid to the 
contras 
bush called gregg to task for failing to inform the vice 
president of his meetings with rodriguez 
fitzwater who was bushs press secretary in late 1986 said 
gregg apparently had taken it upon himself to put felix in touch 
with various people he had not previously told the vice president 
i think the vice president feels he should have been told 
nonetheless bush has consistently expressed confidence in 
gregg a 30year cia veteran who headed the national security 
councils intelligence branch when murphy hired him to become the 
vice presidents national security adviser in august 1982 
murphy said he would not rule out the possibility that gregg a 
former cia station chief in vietnam who speaks japanese fluently 
might keep his current job in a bush administration other foreign 
policy advisers to the bush campaign include former secretary of 
state henry a kissinger and former national security advisers 
zbigniew brzezinski and brent scowcroft 
im sure he gregg is on a short list murphy said 
theres no reason why he shouldnt be on the short list or near 
the top of it hes done a good job

while jim and tammy bakker have been 
asking for money to regain control of ptl and set up a new 
television ministry federal agents have been keeping a close watch 
on their fundraising tactics 
i imagine theyre checking very carefully to see what hes 
doing said hendersonville lawyer jim toms one of bakkers 
attorneys he said federal authorities have questioned him about 
the recent fund raising 
theyre looking at it critically but are keeping an open 
mind toms said theyre giving him room to see what he is 
really going to do 
the focus on the latest fundraising effort comes in the midst 
of a 14monthlong federal grand jury investigation into possible 
wrongdoing by the former ptl president and founder and his top 
aides 
bakker wont disclose how much his latest efforts have raised 
but toms said he is keeping federal authorities posted on bakkers 
activities and has offered to let internal revenue service agents 
inspect bakkers financial records 
in a fundraising campaign launched last month the bakkers 
mailed about 200000 packets to potential donors across the nation 
cards in the packets spell out their intentions your gifts 
are used to support jim and tammy and all their ministry they have 
the discretion to allocate your gift where needed jim and tammy 
have a nonprofit ministry new covenant partners and church and 
are proceeding to apply for tax exemption but your gift is not tax 
deductible at this time 
charles alexander the justice department prosecutor heading the 
grand jury investigation declined to say if agents are asking 
about the bakkers latest fundraising techniques 
i have no comment at all alexander told the charlotte 
observer i dont even acknowledge the existence of an 
investigation 
les witmer an irs spokesman in atlanta said obviously 
based on previous activities the internal revenue service would be 
very interested in the fundraising activities of the new 
corporation 
the irs in april revoked ptls taxexempt status on the ground 
that bakker operated it mostly to make money not to minister 
bakker resigned as ptl president in march 1987 after admitting a 
onetime sexual encounter with former church secretary jessica hahn 
three months later ptl filed for reorganization under federal 
bankruptcy laws and a bankruptcy judge has since ordered the 
ministry to sell its assets the heritage usa christian retreat 
and theme park the ptl satellite tv network and 1700 undeveloped 
acres of land 
bakkers bid to buy the assets fell through last month last 
week stephen mernick a toronto businessman won the bidding for 
ptl with an offer of 115 million 
toms said contributions sent to help bakker buy back ptl wont 
be used for anything else unless contributors give permission 
the bakkers say they havent given up on their dream to buy back 
ptl but say they are soliciting contributions for a new television 
ministry 
donations will be used to pay bakker as pastor of the new 
covenant church 
clearly he will be paid as pastor toms said and will be 
provided with the normal ministerial allowances for 
transportation and the like 
but toms said bakker will not use donations to support the 
luxurious lifestyle he was accustomed to while president of ptl 
he isnt going to go out and pick up sticks for people to beat 
him with by buying something that people will criticize him for 
toms said 
bakker admits he made mistakes at ptl and says this time will be 
different 
there will be strict financial controls he said

prime minister brian mulroney is leaving little 
to chance while he campaigns for a progressive conservative party 
victory and for implementing a free trade agreement with the united 
states 
the prime ministers opponents in the heated threeway race for 
the nov 21 election say a mulroney victory would mean nothing less 
than selling out canada to its more powerful and richer neighbor 
the traditional roughandtumble of canadian campaigning was 
altered this year by mulroneys insistence on carefully controlled 
public appearances and at least in the first week of the campaign 
only rare departures from the script 
mulroneys two opponents describe their efforts to block the 
free trade agreement his government negotiated with the united 
states as the fight of the century 
the deal would eliminate all tariffs between the two countries 
end eventually put canadas 26 million people in open competition 
with the 245 million people of the united states it would mean the 
dismantling of a system of high tariffs that dates back to the 19th 
century 
its a cause of my life to save canada from this deal 
liberal party leader john turner has told canadians this is more 
than an election it is your future 
ed broadbent of the socialist new democratic party has 
reiterated his partys traditional stand against free trade 
agreements 
early polls show the progressive conservatives ahead in the 
campaign which mulroney insists should not be simply a referendum 
on the trade issue but rather an endorsement of his record during 
four years of national leadership 
the prime minister has the advantage of prosperity during his 
administration and optimistic economic forecasts the unemployment 
rate for september announced friday showed a further decrease 
from 8 percent to 78 percent considered low for canada 
a gallup poll taken during the 48 hours after mulroney called 
the election oct 1 indicated the conservatives with 43 percent 
support liberals with 33 percent and new democrats with 22 percent 
such an outcome could give the conservatives 295 seats in the 
house of commons up from the 208 seats they held in the 282member 
house that was just dissolved the liberals held 40 seats and the 
new democrats had 33 with one vacancy 
given the volatility given the fickleness of canadian voters 
its possible the conservatives can stumble and lose their lead 
said sylvia bashevkin a political science professor at the 
university of toronto 
ms bashevkin who is writing a book about canadian nationalism 
said in an interview that the intensity of the free trade 
discussion is rooted in a visceral issue in canadian society 
that the larger more powerful united states could overwhelm huge 
but sparsely populated canada 
nationalists of all sorts unite to speak out against any loss 
of sovereignty ms bashevkin said 
opponents of the free trade agreement raise a range of fears 
from environmental dangers and the exploitation of energy resources 
to the potential loss of a fragile national identity they also see 
threats to canadas extensive health care and social service 
network 
at the heart of the debate are fears that what is considered a 
more aggressive american lifestyle could move north pushing aside 
canadian traditions that value a sense of community 
mulroney says the fears are unjustified charging the opposition 
with pursuing some nostalgic version of a past that perhaps never 
existed he says the creation of a larger north american market 
is needed to assure canadas future prosperity 
a conservative majority in the next parliament would remove any 
remaining blocks to the creation of a north american free trade 
zone on jan 1 
both opposition parties say they would tear up the deal 
the us senate approved the agreement with canada the united 
states top trading partner by 839 last month at least 70 
percent of the 150 billion in trade each year between the 
countries already is tarifffree 
the gallup poll found free trade to be the dominant issue among 
canadian voters 
mulroney 49 is a former corporate lawyer and leader of his 
party since 1983 
although scandals that touched eight of his ministers reduced 
the conservatives standing in the polls sharply during the first 
three years of his term mulroney appears to have distanced himself 
from those troubles and surged ahead

paola ricas will return to italy to 
describe in her gourmet magazine foods made from us soybeans 
ng myndru will return to his farm in the soviet union to oversee 
livestock feeding trials using us soybean meal 
product promotion including sponsoring visits by italian food 
journalists and soviet agricultural experts is a key feature of 
the us soybean industry 
we raise high quality grain here in illinois and we hope we 
can meet your needs for your people and your diet champaign 
county farmer lee eichhorst said at a recent dinner honoring 
visiting soviets 
money contributed by farmers enables the american soybean 
association to carry out a wide range of programs aimed at creating 
new uses and markets for american soybeans some money also comes 
from the us department of agriculture 
we have invited the italian food journalists to the states to 
acquaint them with soybeans and hopefully they will go home and 
write about them said asa official roger leysen who was 
visiting illinois but is based in belgium 
ms ricas editor of la cucina italiana was especially 
interested in new foods made from soy 
i saw the pizza with the soybean flour and the ice cream 
she said this is new and it is very important to me to taste 
these things 
the italian journalists visited a farm where soybeans are grown 
the chicago board of trade where beans are bought and sold a 
factory that makes salad dressing university of illinois 
laboratories where new soy foods are developed supermarkets and 
export facilities 
the idea is to show potential customers that the united states 
is the largest and most reliable soybean supplier illinois is the 
nations no 1 soybean state 
the italians are growing soybeans but not enough to meet their 
demand leysen said we still need publicity in italy to 
increase demand even more 
however the major use of soybeans is in livestock rations and 
asa has been conducting feeding demonstrations on large cooperative 
farms in the soviet union 
soy meal is added to soviet corn which is chopped and fed green 
because their growing season is too short to produce mature ears of 
corn 
the tests showed the asa formula worked said mansfield 
farmer ken dalenberg noting faster weight gain and better quality 
meat compared with the traditional soviet diet for hogs these 
promotions and feeding trials should build markets for us 
soybeans 
the soviets including top officials from huge state and 
cooperative farms where feeding tests are conducted came to the 
united states to see how farmers raise soybeans and hogs 
we are all involved in the production of something very 
necessary for this world food said myndru chairman of a 
50000acre cooperative farm and member of the supreme soviet we 
are doing our best to get good results like you if a farmer is 
good we say he is like an american farmer 
myndru encouraged exchange visits between american and soviet 
farmers and agricultural researchers 
aleks cerne associate director of the asa office in vienna 
travelled with the soviets he said there is a great potential for 
increased soybean sales to the soviet union but cautioned that it 
will take time and cooperation 
markets will come very slowly but trade is a twoway 
street cerne said we sell them 10 times as much agricultural 
product as we buy from them

indian peacekeeping forces landed on 
this island nation one year ago to try to end fighting by minority 
tamils demanding an independent state once regarded as heroes the 
indians have become the enemy 
when we saw the indian troops arrive here we greeted them 
with garlands as our saviors said parameswari a tamil housewife 
who spoke on condition that her family name not be used 
we realized our mistake she said the indians launched an 
operation not only to kill the tamil tigers but tamil civilians 
jaffna about 165 miles north of the capital of colombo is a 
city under siege 
on oct 3 two pistol shots fired near a crowded bus stop killed 
two young tamil men the streets emptied as indian troops dressed 
in camouflage gear drove into the city in military vehicles and 
retrieved the bodies 
the next day three indian soldiers died when a boobytrapped 
bicycle exploded indian troops retaliated by shooting and killing 
a young tamil fleeing the scene 
a group of tamil boys about 12 years old ran through the 
streets warning residents do not allow anybody to go into the 
town the indians are coming 
we have gone through world war i and now we are in the midst 
of world war ii said one tamil woman who did not want her name 
used 
the presidents of sri lanka and india which became involved in 
the conflict because of its own 60 million tamils signed an 
accord july 29 1987 aimed at ending the 5yearold campaign by 
militant tamils for a separate nation in the northern and eastern 
provinces 
the mostly hindu tamils 18 percent of the islands 16 million 
people claim they are discriminated against by the majority 
buddhist sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the population and 
control the government and the military 
an estimated 8500 people have died since the insurgency began 
in 1983 including an estimated 1000 civilians and at least 625 
indian soldiers 
the peace accord was aimed at giving the tamils more autonomy in 
exchange for laying down arms 
on oct 10 1987 the first of an estimated 50000 indian troops 
arrived in sri lanka across the palk straits a waterway off the 
southeast coast of india that separates the countries the soldiers 
were ordered to neutralize the most powerful of the rebel groups 
the liberation tigers of tamil ealam who rejected the peace accord 
an estimated 47000 indian soldiers remain in sri lanka and the 
indian government says they will stay there until sri lankas 
president junius r jayewardene says they are not needed 
tamils in jaffna have mixed feeling about the presence of the 
peacekeeping forces many want the indians to leave but others 
arent sure 
they have been here for the past 12 months and our problems 
have become worse what will happen if they leave is anybodys 
guess said sinnathamby murugaveli a student at jaffna 
university 
some sri lankans fear that if the indian soldiers leave they 
will leave behind arms for some of the six moderate tamil groups 
who have helped hunt down the tigers 
this will lead to a fresh bout of bloodletting giving an 
excuse for the sri lankan armed forces to take over where the 
indians left leaving us tamils back at square one said a 
professor at jaffna university who spoke on condition of anonymity

a newspaper on sunday accused officials in a 
central russian city of failing to report the true extent of 
devastation in a train crash and explosion that killed at least 
four people last week 
komsomolskaya pravda the newspaper of the young communist 
league also said there were similarities between the sverdlovsk 
accident and another train accident that killed about 100 people in 
june 
it called for an investigation by the local prosecutor implying 
that criminal negligence or sabotage might be involved 
in these revealing days mixed with human grief are a lack of 
coordination shirking responsibility confusion and unconcealed 
red tape the newspaper said 
on tuesday two freight cars loaded with explosives broke loose 
and smashed into a coal train adjacent to an oil tank yard in 
sverdlovsk a city 850 miles east of moscow 
the resulting double explosion killed at least four people 
according to initial reports and blew a crater 30 feet deep and 
180 feet wide komsomolskaya pravda said its reporter found that at 
least five people died 
in arzamas 240 miles east of moscow a train carrying 
explosives blew up june 4 the newspaper said that train was just 
three minutes away from an oil tank yard 
why do trains full of dangerous materials keep blowing up near 
oil storage areas it asked 
the newspaper said sverdlovsk officials had no idea of the 
extent of the tragedy and didnt know anything about the victims 
except their last names 
the newspaper said its reporter discovered 838 people sought 
medical care and that 10 were in critical condition five lost 
their eyesight the report said 
initial reports said 280 people sought medical care 
authorities in sverdlovsk originally reported 12 dwellings and 8 
other buildings destroyed but the newspaper said 20 apartment 
buildings were destroyed and 14 damaged 
the article said there was no evidence a law requiring that the 
explosives be guarded by four people was observed 
soviet officials have suppressed information on accidents for 
decades and newspapers have only recently begun covering them 
under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness 
but even under glasnost some disasters have been hushed up 
when a fire and explosion rocked the chernobyl nuclear power 
station on april 26 1986 soviet authorities denied the accident 
for days and were forced into acknowledging it only after radiation 
contamination was discovered hundreds of miles away in western 
europe the accident killed 31 people

dan quayle was supposed to show the country 
last week that he has no horns as one adviser said instead 
the republican vice presidential nominee remains the most 
controversial candidate on either partys ticket 
he admitted as much when he observed friday that he had become 
the lightning rod for the campaign 
aides say quayles debate with democratic rival lloyd bentsen a 
confrontation many voters seem to think quayle lost has not 
affected the campaign strategy for the indiana senator or his 
relationship with gop nominee george bush 
but some bush aides have been quoted as saying privately that 
his debate performance was assessed as a negative bush himself 
rarely mentions quayle during campaign appearances unless he is 
responding to reporters questions 
conservative republican political analyst kevin phillips 
interviewed sunday on nbcs meet the press said there is no 
doubt that voters including many republicans are nervous 
about quayle 
its very clear that the democrats did get a dynamic out of 
the bentsenquayle debate phillips said the question is how 
much the democrats whose campaign strategy so far this year has 
often been somewhat inept can take advantage of that opening 
democratic pollster peter hart interviewed on the same show 
said comparisons of public and private polls before and after the 
debate show a nationwide switch of 2 or 3 percentage points in 
favor of the democratic ticket 
during an impromptu news conference on his campaign plane late 
friday quayle rejected suggestions that he is viewed as a 
liability by the bush camp 
id like to find out who did say that he said i think i 
might have some influence on their job security 
as for bush i dont know how he could have defended me any 
more vigorously quayle said 
he thought the debate was outstanding he called me right 
after the debate and he said home run an absolute home run and 
he believes that and still believes that i dont know how he 
could be any more vigorous in his support 
some gop officials have seen quayle 41 as a liability almost 
from the moment he was selected by bush at the party convention in 
new orleans in midaugust 
intense media focus on his military service academic record and 
personal life combined with his youth and his tendency to 
misspeak created the image of a lightweight candidate especially 
when compared with the patrician 67yearold bentsen 
bush campaign chairman james a baker iii told reporters before 
the oct 5 debate in omaha neb that quayle would have to show 
millions of television viewers that he has no horns and was 
steady serious and substantive 
quayle generally performed well although he seemed stumbling 
and hesitant when asked repeatedly what he would do if he had to 
assume the presidency 
democrats immediately capitalized on that with two tv ads one 
depicting bush advisers regretting the choice of quayle and another 
conjuring up the specter of a quayle presidency 
quayle responded by telling reporters that his new campaign role 
was to take the heat for bush and that in any event the voters 
ultimately choose between bush and democratic nominee michael 
dukakis not their running mates 
quayle insisted that he not bushs campaign strategists had 
assigned him the role of lightning rod 
im going to take all the heat and thats just fine well let 
george bush have a free ride he said 
asked why bush was not the one to respond to the ads quayle 
replied theyre attacking me 
whether the debate will prove to be any sort of campaign 
watershed remains to be seen aides say their strategy remains the 
same 
quayle will continue to campaign in the partys traditional base 
as well as key swing states such as michigan and ohio which he 
will visit this week he will continue to raise money for the 
ticket court local and regional media coverage and make dukakis 
his primary target for attack 
if anything aides say quayles campaign schedule will get 
busier between now and nov 8 
this guy is going to be playing a major role in helping this 
ticket get elected said david prosperi quayles spokesman 
this is the big run for the finish line 
quayles reception on his postdebate campaign travels has been 
good although he has appeared mostly at college and high school 
events that resemble student pep rallies 
bushs running mate seems more relaxed around reporters since 
the debate although he makes no secret of his resentments over 
press coverage of his campaign 
he playfully turned a paint sprayer on reporters as he toured a 
chattanooga tenn technical school recently thats for all 
those articles youve written about me he said 
but quayle didnt seem flustered during his airborne session 
with reporters friday even though the exchange was testy at times 
i figured out you werent all that bad he told them

authorities on sunday allowed the first religious 
service in 30 years in a latvian cathedral converted into a concert 
hall and an overflow crowd prayed for a new nationalist group 
the service was in the 13th century dom cathedral also known as 
st peters cathedral in riga the capital of the republic of 
latvia 
tass the official soviet news agency and ingrid titavs who 
attended the service said a lutheran pastor devoted prayers to the 
peoples front the group which demands that latvians have more 
say over their religious economic and cultural affairs ended its 
founding congress sunday 
ms titavs a member of another group called the latvian 
national independence movement said by telephone from riga that 
staterun television broke with its usual policy of promoting 
atheism to carry the end of the service live 
she said a long line of people waited to get inside the church 
and a huge crowd stood outside during the service because there was 
no more room for them inside police did not interfere as they 
have at other religious gatherings she said 
the cathedral begun in 1211 is the largest in the baltic sea 
republics of latvia lithuania and estonia the soviet unions 
atheistic communist government had the building turned into a 
concert hall about 30 years ago 
tass implied sunday that the conversion was not done for 
political reasons it said the state took control of the cathedral 
because the small parish appeared to be unable to keep up this 
architectural monument in due order 
the peoples front which claims 130000 members ended a 
twoday conference in riga by adopting a charter resolutions and 
electing its leaders tass said 
neither ms titavs nor tass provided details of the measures 
the front has been pushing to make the republic economically 
autonomous from moscow 
ms titavs who monitored broadcasts of sundays debate said 
the session was very stormy very democratic and very open 
she said many speakers complained about the latvian communist 
party and government the republics president and communist party 
chief were replaced last week 
speakers also condemned the soviet takeover of the baltic 
republic in 1940 ms titavs said latvia estonia and lithuania 
were absorbed by the soviet union under a pact signed with nazi 
germany 
very many said we should have the right to be free the 
activist said 
the peoples front is similar to organizations formed in 
neighboring estonia and lithuania to make nationalist demands and 
push mikhail s gorbachevs program to reform the economy and 
society 
tass said that among those attending the sessions in riga were 
the new president of the republic anatoly gorbunov who assumed 
his post thursday his presence lent the group some official 
backing 
jan vagris who took over as latvias communist party first 
secretary on tuesday told soviet television in an interview 
broadcast sunday night that he supports the peoples front because 
it is firmly behind gorbachevs reforms 
in other nationalist activity activists campaigning for the 
independence of the republic of georgia in the caucasus mountains 
staged a fourhour sitin sunday 
a witness speaking by telephone from the georgian capital of 
tbilisi said several dozen people sat near the citys kgb 
headquarters and carried the flag that flew in the republic before 
it was made part of the soviet union 
they also held signs demanding freedom of speech and protesting 
police confiscation of an underground journal said the witness 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
plainclothes kgb officers ripped away some of the signs he 
said but the demonstrators dispersed voluntarily after authorities 
promised to return the journal copies

senate democratic candidate brian moss 
says he did not intend to offend anyone when he said that 
polacks spiks wops and the irish are welcome in the 
democratic party 
moss made the comment after criticizing his opponent sen orrin 
hatch rutah for an earlier statement that the democrats are 
the party of homosexuals 
almost immediately after his speech last week at the university 
of utah moss began receiving complaints from students hatch 
campaign aides and others who found his offhand remark offensive 
moss is a salt lake city businessman a former unsuccessful 
candidate for utah state treasurer and the son of former sen frank 
moss dutah whom hatch defeated in 1976 
moss said the democratic party was willing to listen to the 
concerns of diverse groups such as homosexuals and other 
minorities even though it may not agree with them 
we have been the party of the blacks the browns of the 
asianamericans of the young of the old of the poor were the 
party of the of immigrants he said 
you may call us the party of the polacks the party of spiks 
the party of wops the party of the irish any of those names 
because the democratic party has always had a tent large enough to 
welcome all of those groups who are seeking their civil rights and 
their concerns he said 
moss said later he used those words to illustrate the 
harshness of hatchs earlier inflammatory language 
it was rash and for that i have apologized will apologize 
and will continue to apologize moss said 
hatch campaign manager bud scruggs accused moss of focusing on 
peripheral matters instead of dealing with the substance of 
hatchs point that the national democratic leadership is beholden 
to leftwing groups 
scruggs said that for brian moss to try to turn that point 
into a racial slur is kind of one more notch down in his level of 
respectability in conducting the campaign

the walt disney world theme park could 
face thousands of dollars in fines for polluting a creek with its 
sewage treatment environmental protection agency officials said 
theyve had violations ongoing for quite some time said 
peter mcgarry who heads the epas water management compliance unit 
for florida fines certainly are a possibility 
for years treated wastewater dumped by disney into reedy creek 
often has carried more phosphorus than allowed by epa and 
sometimes there hasnt been enough oxygen mcgarry said the creek 
flows into lake russell about 10 miles south of kissimmee 
but since disney started using a new artificial wetlands system 
this summer to help clean its wastewater levels of phosphorus and 
nitrogen have doubled or tripled those allowed by epa thats the 
worst problem mcgarry said 
disneys sewage plant now dumps an average of 5 million gallons 
of treated effluent daily into reedy creek said tom moses 
director of disneys reedy creek improvement district 
moses said he plans to ask the kissimmee city commission for 
help the orlando sentinel reported sunday 
kissimmee is allowed to dump into reedy creek more treated 
wastewater and nutrients such as phosphorus than disney but the 
city decided several years ago to build artificial ponds instead of 
dumping into the creek 
moses wants kissimmee to lend disney the right to dump more 
phosphorus and other nutrients into reedy creek for as long as four 
years 
disney could use that time to build new treatment facilities 
improve oxygen levels in the water and see if its 130acre 
artificial wetlands will start working as expected moses said 
disneys problems with epa come about six months after the state 
accused the company of creating a major potential for harm to 
human health and the environment 
in march the state found seven major violations involving 
spilled or leaked hazardous waste the department of environmental 
regulation later fined the company 150299 the largest penalty 
ever imposed by the agencys eightcounty central florida district 
disney has since begun a cleanup effort 
mcgarry said epas decision on whether to impose fines might 
depend on what disney officials after meeting with kissimmee say 
theyll do to clean their wastewater 
epa administrative fines cant exceed 125000 but epa could 
ask the justice department to seek fines of as much as 25000 a 
day he said 
if kissimmee commissioners dont help disney moses said the 
park could race to build new treatment facilities in a few months 
to meet epa limits

sunday 
citing an unidentified american source the sunday times said 
some of the workers were involved in british projects related to 
star wars the spacebased weapons defense system being 
developed in the united states 
its irrefutable that they were working on projects applicable 
to star wars the source was quoted as saying 
though the newspaper said the us defense department is 
officially not commenting on the deaths one spokesman was 
quoted as saying the case had reached the point where we cant 
ignore it anymore 
the pentagon will also request its british counterpart the 
ministry of defense to launch a comprehensive inquiry the 
newspaper said 
our position has been that there is no connection between 
these deaths a spokesman for the ministry was quoted as saying 
but if the americans ask for explanations then that puts the 
matter on a different plain 
over the past six years at least 16 british men employed in 
defenserelated fields have died or disappeared under unusual 
circumstances 
seven worked for the star wars contractor marconi co ltd a 
subsidiary of britains general electric co plc which recently 
opened an internal inquiry into the case the company is not

the deaths began in march 1982 keith bowden 45 an expert on 
supercomputers and computercontrolled aircraft died when his well 
maintained car veered across a twolane highway and down an 
embankment 
since then 15 more computer engineers communications experts 
scientists and other workers related to the defense industry have 
died or disappeared in a mysterious fashion 
ashaad sharif a computer systems analyst for a marconi unit 
near london was found strangled in a park 105 miles west in 
bristol on oct 28 1986 an inquest ruled he killed himself by 
tying a rope to a tree looping the other end around his neck and 
then driving off at high speed 
five months later david sands 37 drove his car into a vacant 
restaurant in hampshire in southern england gasoline tanks in the 
trunk exploded killing sands a computer expert who worked for 
easams a marconi sister company 
other dead men included employees of the royal military college 
of science british telecoms secret martlesham heath research site 
and the royal air force research center some died of drug 
overdoses in mysterious car crashes or were found dead under 
their cars with the engine running 
one of the most recent deaths took place aug 23 when retired 
brig gen john ferry 60 an assistant marketing director for 
marconi apparently placed wires into his mouth and plugged the

the socalled siege of atlanta antiabortion 
demonstrations are over but the city is still dealing with scores 
of people clogging the jails and courts many refusing to give 
their names 
one john doe inmate jailed since july 19 escaped saturday 
but police know his real name and where he lives 
last weeks five days of protests outside four clinics ended 
saturday with the arrest of 40 demonstrators bringing the weeks 
total to 461 
about 140 of those still jailed have applied for release on bond 
but have not been processed said tom pocock deputy director of 
the atlanta corrections bureau 
some applications were processed sunday and by late afternoon 
the number of protesters still jailed was down to 319 jail 
officials said 
operation rescue the new yorkbased group that organized the 
protests that began during the democratic national convention has 
accused the city of purposely delaying the releases to keep the 
demonstrators in jail until the organizers leave 
the city responds that operation rescue boasted that it would 
clog the citys judicial process with hundreds of arrests and says 
the demonstrators succeeded in doing just that 
the city has refused to separate the paperwork of operation 
rescue prisoners from that of the rest of the jail population 
further delaying processing 
we have asked that operation rescue designate to us who should 
be bonded out first based on family job or health concerns 
pocock said saturday 
many of those arrested identify themselves only as baby jane 
doe or baby john doe in solidarity with aborted fetuses and 
cannot be freed on bond the city says because they could not be 
found if they refused to appear 
baby john doe no 1 arrested at the first operation rescue 
demonstration on july 19 escaped saturday from a mimimumsecurity 
jail annex pocock said the city lacked the resources or the 
apparent need for better security and said the prisoner had assured 
police he would be no trouble 
he said police are seeking joseph roach 50 of broomall pa 
and will charge him with escape he exploited our benevolence 
pocock said 
since operation rescue came to atlanta in july for the 
democratic national convention police have arrested more than 
1200 demonstrators 
city officials said they had spent more than 500000 on 
security arrests jail and court costs for the protests before 
last weeks demonstrations the police academy had to be closed and 
recruits used to help control the demonstrators and keep the 
clinics open 
when last weeks protests started tuesday police used 
rougherthanusual tactics dragging demonstrators to buses if they 
refused to walk they eased up at midweek after several complaints 
operation rescue has called for a nationwide demonstration oct 
29 
the aim of last weeks demonstrations was to block clinic 
entrances to prevent or dissuade women from entering to have 
abortions but many women entered the clinics anyway 
clinic operators said most appointments were kept and some 
patients entered before dawn to avoid the pickets

pope john paul ii on sunday condemned 
antisemitism as being opposed to the principles of 
christianity during a pilgrimage to northeastern france 
john paul made his statement to the jewish community in this 
historic city on the second day of a fourday visit to the region 
his journey to france is his 40th foreign trip since becoming pope 
in 1978 
the speech occurred at a time of tension in france over 
antisemitism and racism ultraconservative catholics count 
heavily among the followers of rightwing politician jeanmarie le 
pen who campaigns on an antiimmigrant platform and has been 
accused of making antisemitic remarks 
also sunday the pope saluted moslems and called on protestants 
to be patient with efforts to unify the roman catholic church and 
other christian churches 
john paul took a cruise on the rhine river to talk to 
shipworkers said mass for the diocese of strasbourg and helped 
celebrate the citys 2000th anniversary addressing thousands of 
citizens in french and in their alsatian dialect 
the jewish community of strasbourg sent a letter to the vatican 
several months ago protesting continuing instances of catholics 
blaming the jewish people for the killing of christ and asked the 
pope to recognize the state of israel said jean kahn president of 
the strasbourg jewish community 
in a meeting at the residence of strasbourgs archbishop the 
pope told the jewish representatives the two religions honored the 
same god and had a common heritage and values 
it is therefore in deep fidelity to the vocation to which 
the god of peace and justice calls us and with us all the 
european peoples that i repeat once again with you the strongest 
condemnation of all antisemitism and of all racism which are 
opposed to the principles of christianity and for which there 
exists no justification in the cultures that would be tempted by 
them the polishborn pope said 
for the same reasons we must discard any religious prejudice 
that history has shown us as inspired by antijewish stereotypes 
the pope spoke to about 30 men in skullcaps who listened 
solemnly to his speech then presented him with a book titled 
jews in france and a painting of the strasbourg synagogue built 
to replace one destroyed by german soldiers who occupied the city 
during world war ii 
the pope in turn presented the jewish delegation with papal 
medals 
some archconservative french catholics particularly those 
inspired by breakaway archishop marcel lefebvre have rejected the 
teachings of the 196265 second vatican council that state the 
jewish people are not responsible for the death of christ lefebvre 
was excommunicated last summer for elevating several followers to 
bishops in defiance of church authority 
the jewish community of strasbourg now with 15000 members was 
subjected to massacres and expulsions in the 14th century and 
persecution during world war ii germans who occupied the city in 
1940 destroyed the synagogue and 800 jews were shot or deported 
the pope praised the jews witness to their faith which he said 
went as far as martyrdom that survived the long shadows of 
incomprehension of the horrible abyss of the shoah holocaust 
he did not discuss israel vatican officials have cited israels 
unsettled borders and the status of jerusalem as obstacles to the 
catholic churchs recognition of the jewish state the vatican also 
says palestinians are entitled to a homeland 
earlier the 68yearold pope heard a challenge from the leader 
of strasbourgs protestant community michel hoeffel who said 
churches were moving too slowly toward unity causing true 
suffering among the faithful especially couples of mixed 
marriage who wanted to receive the eucharist together 
protestants make up 2 to 3 percent of the french population 
which is about 80 percent catholic 
moslems are the secondlargest religious group numbering 28 
million in this country of 55 million many of them immigrated from 
former french colonies in north africa 
on monday the pope was scheduled to visit the dioceses of metz 
and nancy

us attorney general dick thornburgh 
blames congress for problems in the battle against illegal drugs 
saying rhetoric is getting in the way of action 
its hard to remain patient when congress seems to be waging 
only a rhetorical war on drugs denying year after year the 
administrations requests for full funding for the necessary 
resources to carry out our antidrug efforts thornburgh said 
saturday 
he told most of the nations 94 us attorneys gathered for a 
meeting here that the war on drugs is one of the few areas where 
congress has shown budgetary restraint over the last seven years in 
spite of a national consensus to do otherwise 
under fiscal 1989 appropriations congress has reduced us 
attorney positions by 10 percent thornburgh said legislators also 
cut 321 million from president reagans request for new prisons 
providing for only two of seven proposed he said 
i will not be satisfied until we obtain full funding for our 
efforts until we put an end to the situation of a federal law 
enforcement officer having to set aside a citizens complaint 
saying sorry we dont have enough agents to check that out or 
of a us attorney telling an agent sorry we dont have enough 
prosecutors to bring that case to trial or of a judge telling a 
prosecutor that there is no room in a federal prison for a 
convicted drug trafficker 
to that end thornburgh asked federal prosecutors to prepare 
reports for him on the narcotics trafficking business in their 
areas 
drag it out from under the rock where it lives and breeds so 
that we can fully educate the american public as to the size and 
breadth of these illegal and insidious business operations so that 
the public will better understand and more enthusiastically support 
the difficult struggle in which we are engaged he said 
furnish that information to me and i promise you that no one 
will ever again accuse us of waging a phony war on drugs 
thornburgh pledged

the boardwalk is catching up with the 
times and its keeping police busy giving speeding tickets to 
electric rolling chair drivers racing tourists around over the 4 
mph speed limit 
angry locals who like the traditional handpushed wicker 
versions better say the newfangled gadgets arent chairs theyre 
carts and theyre causing a random riot on the oldfashioned 
walkway by the sea 
merchants say the electric transports endanger pedestrians and 
whiz customers right past their doors 
but tourists who find them a quick and inexpensive way to get 
from one end of the boardwalk casino strip to the other are paying 
fares that add up to as 4000 a day and atlantic citys two 
traditional rolling chair companies have been all but pushed out of 
business since the upstarts arrived over the labor day weekend 
it has hurt us bad said larry belfer owner of atlantic 
city famous rolling chairs the traditional threewheeled wicker 
contraptions made famous on the boardwalk although these 
electric carts are a great source of transportation there are 
other people and livelihoods concerned 
the saga began in july when ernest english and stuart mcginnis 
partners in the king la corbliere electric rolling chair co 
purchased all 100 of the mercantile licenses under an ordinance 
that regulated motorized rolling chairs that had been used in the 
1950s the permits were granted before city officials found out 
what type of vehicle the partners had in mind 
theyre golf carts theyre not rolling chairs said city 
councilman arnold orsatti jr 
city officials wanted to revoke the permits immediately but 
decided that arguing over the ordinances vague definition of a 
rolling chair was a losing proposition the traditional chairs 
resemble a threesided wicker basket that rolls on a small wheel in 
front and two larger ones in back 
king la corbliere puts 60 carts on the boards every weekday and 
100 on the weekends the fare is 1 2 or 3 depending on the 
length of the trip 
a ride in a traditional chair costs 5 to 7 and takes twice as 
long 
drivers lease the carts from king in threehour shifts 
you can do 300 a day easy said english who formerly 
pushed the antique wicker chairs 
the electric carts make no noise and carry no horns and english 
said the drivers are not permitted to blow whistles 
i dont think theyre safe orsatti said the boardwalk is 
mainly a pedestrian thoroughfare 
merchants have complained to police and city hall saying a 
number of carts have narrowly missed pedestrians 
its a random riot running all over the boardwalk 
everywhere said frank glaser president of the boardwalk 
merchants association 
english said he will fight in court if city officials try to 
revoke his licenses orsatti said he expected a court battle

colossus and muke have stopped 
fighting but they havent started much else zoo keepers said 
sunday on the third day of a breeding project for the two oversized 
gorillas 
they pretty much just sit on opposite sides of the yard 
said lori layfield of the zoo in this panhandle city they 
havent had much contact 
but she said keepers were pleased that theres been no repeat of 
a firstday fight and that there were signs colossus a 600pound 
male on his first date and muke a 250pound female are at least 
interested in each other 
he peeps at her and she peeps at him if she moves out of his 
sight hell move around until he can see her and she does the 
same ms layfield said 
overall keepers who didnt know what to expect are thrilled 
by the gorillas first weekend together she said 
colossus who has been in the zoo since march and muke 
pronounced mookey there since june got their first look at each 
other friday 
colossus the largest gorilla in us captivity charged and 
flipped literally head over heels in an apparent attempt to injure 
muke he came away with a mouthful of fur and a 5inch gash in his 
neck delivered by muke 
that was a good introduction said pat quinn the zoos 
president and director it was the first time he has touched 
another gorilla since he was an infant over 20 years ago 
both gorillas are age 22 colossus stands at 6 feet 2 inches 
muke is believed to be one of the larger female gorillas in 
captivity 
officials hope the breeding project which will last 
indefinitely will shed new light on how gorillas mate in 
captivity colossus genes could be important because he is not 
related to any other zoo gorillas quinn said 
the two gorillas live in a new complex that includes air 
conditioning sleeping quarters an observation area and the play 
yard they are herded into separate sleeping quarters then back 
into the common yard during the day

more than 3000 people left their homes 
sunday while a hazardous waste crew blew up a corroded tank 
believed to hold up to 30 pounds of deadly hydrogen cyanide 
the explosion occurred at 155 pm and a fire was started to 
burn off the tanks contents environmental protection agency 
spokesman harold yates said that at 201 pm no air readings 
indicated any hydrogen cyanide down wind 
as little as 50 milligrams of the hydrogen cyanide or less than 
onesixth the weight of the average aspirin tablet can kill 
there was no reason to think it was anything other than 
hydrogen cyanide said jerry heston the epas onsite 
coordinator a monitor held directly over the burning cylinder 
indicated 1 part per million of the poison but heston said the 
smoke and burning sandbags may have given a false reading 
epa officials had not been certain of the tanks contents so 
analysts will examine a videotape of the explosion to look for a 
telltale purplish corona which indicates the presence of hydrogen 
cyanide surrounding the main body of the flame yates said 
the 4footlong cylinder was abandoned at the site of the 
defunct artel chemical co plant now a federal superfund cleanup 
site with 3400 other drums and barrels of hazardous materials 
many of them unidentified and most of them rusting 
yates said the hydrogen cyanide burnoff was the most disruptive 
effect so far of a cleanup that began in june but he said 
residents can count on more evacuations when epa officials deal 
with 9000 gallons of methyl mercaptan which is toxic and highly 
flammable and a bunker full of sodium which reacts violently on 
contact with water 
ambulances arrived shortly after dawn to begin taking the 
elderly and handicapped to evacuation centers but city buses from 
nearby charleston that rolled through the town were relatively 
empty as most people chose to go to relatives homes and local 
shopping malls 
this is going to be the best thing thats happened for the 
charleston town center and the huntington mall these people are 
going shopping nitro mayor don karnes said 
traffic steadily increased throughout the morning on west 
virginia 25 the main northsouth route through town but abruptly 
stopped at 1230 pm when state police city police and kanawha 
and putnam county deputies sealed off part of the town 
after the area within 1000 yards of the plant was evacuated 
three men who work for a disposal company hired by the federal 
environmental protection agency carried the cylinder 100 feet to a 
bunker 
there the aging metal tank was ripped open by explosives and 
its contents consumed in a gasolineanddiesel oil fire before 
fumes could drift away 
orange wind socks pointed northeastward toward the more heavily 
industrialized area of nitro the wind was estimated at 10 to 15 
mph 
there was a possibility that the aging chemical in the tank was 
unstable so while the disposal crew carried the cylinder one 
member kept a hand on it to feel for heat that would indicate a 
chemical reaction any reaction could have increased pressure 
inside the morethan20yearold tank and caused a premature blast 
yates said the cylinder never heated up 
the dirt and sandbag bunker 12 feet high with a 12foot by 
12foot base had a metal lid to stop any shrapnel 
the tank was considered one of the most dangerous at the site 
because of its age and because no one was quite sure what it 
contained it was labeled as hydrogen cyanide a basic compound 
used in several industrial chemical processes but in the plants 
35year history there was a chance other materials may have been 
stored in it 
elmer fike who ran the plant as fike chemical co for 33 years 
was sure the tank held hydrogen cyanide one of the most poisonous 
substances known 
the federal government built nitro in world war i for the 
manufacture of explosives and munitions now the kanawha river 
valley through the charleston area is studded with chemical plants

israel began a nationwide campaign sunday to 
vaccinate threequarters of its population against polio after the 
infectious virus was found in sewage in 27 areas panic was 
reported at some vaccination centers 
the health ministry ordered the campaign to vaccinate 32 
million people after 10 israelis were affected by the disease that 
causes muscular paralysis spokesman shmuel algrabli said 
last friday vaccinations began in a few areas where the virus 
was found in sewage the expanded national campaign was decided on 
after the virus subsequently was discovered in other areas 
since september polio has spread from central israel to 
jerusalem the port city of haifa and was found in sewage in at 
least 12 cities from northern tiberias to deir el balah in the 
occupied gaza strip in the south 
but algrabli denied there was a polio epidemic experts say 
its only a local event the situation has not changed for the 
worse we havent had a single polio case since sept 12 and those 
10 were mostly in one area 
about 32 million people under the age 40 are to be vaccinated 
the next four weeks at the cost of at least 25 million those 
over 40 are not included under the theory they would likely have 
been innoculated during the polio scare in the 1940s and 50s 
sunday the ministry began vaccinating infants of up to 2 months 
old but in many areas older children were also vaccinated 
algrabli said about 350000 people were vaccinated sunday 
in many clinics shortages were reported in yehud near tel 
aviv where the virus was found a woman told israel radio 
i have been in the clinic since 8 am we check every hour 
and they still have no vaccines 
at a motherandchild care center in jerusalems mahane yehuda 
market nurses said they ran out of vaccines in the morning but 
later received some supplies 
mothers stood in line with their children one woman brought her 
yet unnamed weekold niece straight from the hospital where she was 
born 
at some clinics panic was reported 
linda cahill who immunized her two children at the misgav ladah 
hospital in jerusalem said many adults crowded around nurses 
asking to be vaccinated some burst into tears when they learned 
they could not be vaccinated with their children 
the polio virus caught israel unprepared israelis are immunized 
as children and the current vaccination is viewed as an additional 
booster there were no polio cases in 1986 and only one case in 
1987 recent cases were blamed on overflowing sewage 
sewage is a timebomb that can explode every moment health 
minister shoshana arbelialmozlino told prime minister yitzhak 
shamir at a cabinet meeting sunday according to israel radio 
meanwhile polio became an issue in israels elections campaign 
as amnon rubinstein head of the centrist shinui movement demanded 
arbelialmozlino resign the health minister is running for 
parliament on the ticket of the leftleaning labor party 
why resign did i bring polio to israel arbelialmozlino 
was quoted as saying in the daily newspaper yediot ahronot 
the tourism ministry expressed concern that reports about the 
disease would keep tourists from israel tourism already has 
dropped dramatically since the palestinian uprising broke out in 
the occupied territories 10 months ago 
there is no problem with visiting israel we welcome every 
tourist those wishing to be vaccinated can do so at the same time 
israeli adults are called in algrabli said

also was taking steroids when he set a world sprint record last 
summer in rome the toronto star newspaper quoted ms issajenko as 
saying 
ms issajenko who also competed in the olympics in seoul south 
korea was quoted as saying she also took the musclebuilding drug 
the olympics which began sept 17 ended oct 2 
later her husband tony said ms issajenko denied saying she and

astaphan provided steroids and monitored the program with the 
knowledge of charlie francis coach of the mazda optimist track

saying im fed up with all the bull ben takes steroids i 
take steroids jamie astaphan gives them to us and charlie isnt

while astaphan has said he has never administered stanozolol the 
banned steroid found in the runners urine sample after his world

republican george bush campaigning in a 
state crucial to his and democratic rival michael dukakiss 
election hopes marched in a slavic parade sunday and declared that 
none of us will ever forget there is not freedom in eastern 
europe 
the vice president and his wife barbara rode in an 
oldfashioned fire truck under cloudy skies and waved at thousands 
of people along the twomile parade route in this western chicago 
suburb 
bush participated in the citys annual houby day parade a 
czechoslovakian celebration of bountiful mushroom crops houby is a 
czech word for mushroom 
this is the day we celebrate family we celebrate faith and we 
celebrate freedom the gop nominee said in brief remarks before 
the parade began and none of us will ever forget there is not 
freedom in eastern europe and i have pledged as president to 
never forget that 
bushs declaration was a reversal of former president fords 
celebrated misstatement during his october 1976 debate with jimmy 
carter when ford declared there was no soviet domination of 
eastern europe that remark is widely believed to have 
contributed to the republican presidents election defeat that year 
although those carrying probush signs were clearly in the 
majority sunday a group of demonstrators some carrying dukakis 
banners marched alongside the vice president chanting the 
democratic refrain where was george 
bush pointed to himself as if to say here i am and called 
out where is mike 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff said the campaign views 
cicero as a community where there are a lot of swing voters 
both candidates are focusing attention on illinois and its 24 
electoral votes recent polls show a near dead heat between bush 
and dukakis in the state 
dukakis campaigned here last week the vice president has been 
in illinois five times since he was nominated by the gop national 
convention in midaugust 
my guess is its dead even at best in illinois fuller 
told reporters 
the congressional district that includes cicero is largely 
democratic but president reagan carried it by 58 percent of the 
vote in 1984 
in chicago state union leaders challenged bush to stop the 
parade of illinois jobs to foreign markets instead of throwing 
waves to parades 
carl alessi legislative director of the chicago federation of 
labor issued a statement challenging bush to explain to illinois 
workers why they lost wellpaying manufacturing jobs in the 1982 
recession and why they should be satisfied with a hole in a swiss 
cheese economy instead of foreign markets to sell the products they 
have the skills to produce 
bush was the only one of the national candidates who campaigned 
sunday aides said he spent several hours at his washington home 
sunday morning preparing for the second nationally televised debate 
with dukakis in los angeles 
the debate will begin at 9 pm edt in the pauley pavilion on 
the campus of the university of california at los angeles the date 
will be thursday unless rainouts extend the national league 
baseball series dukakis spokesman mark gearan said sunday 
dukakis spent much of sunday closeted with a dozen aides at the 
park plaza hotel in boston discussing debate strategy he flies to 
new york on monday to meet with students at a levittown high school 
on long island and to march in the columbus day parade in manhattan 
with gov mario cuomo 
bush planned a light week of campaigning with a morningonly 
event planned in trenton nj on monday he will fly to los 
angeles on tuesday and remain in california until after the debate 
aides said 
bushs running mate dan quayle embarks monday on a sixday 
crosscountry tour that will take him to michigan ohio indiana 
south dakota montana oklahoma arkansas louisiana new mexico 
and wisconsin 
quayle has told reporters he doesnt believe he is a liability 
to the bush campaign despite his poor showing in public opinion 
polls after his debate last week with democratic vice presidential 
candidate lloyd bentsen 
but kevin phillips a conservative republican political analyst 
said in nbcs meet the press show that voters including many 
republicans are nervous about quayle 
democratic pollster peter hart said on the same program that a 
comparison of public and private polls before and after the 
quaylebentsen debate showed a shift of 2 or 3 percentage points in 
favor of the democratic ticket 
bentsen returning to washington after three days of postdebate 
campaigning in texas and new mexico said sunday he thought there 
was still time for the democratic ticket to overcome the 
republicans 
its soft on both sides he told reporters referring to 
some national polls showing dukakis trailing bush 
the texas senator expressed relief that the dukakis campaign 
finally is going on the air with tough political ads to counter 
republican attacks where have they been bentsen asked 
bentsen said the democrats should have responded immediately 
when the republicans first began what he called distortions of 
dukakis record and attacks on his patriotism during the summer

president gen augusto pinochet late 
sunday again rejected opposition demands that he step down from 
power saying he will not leave office before march 1990 
the situation is very simple pinochet said in a surprise 
television appearance from his country home at bucalemu we 
fulfilled the constitution that was set up so now that the 
opposition has triumphed why should we change 
i acknowlege the oppositions victory but i am not going to 
change what the constitution says pinochet said march 11 
1990 is going to be the day that the government is handed over 
the comments of the 72yearold commanderinchief of chiles 
armed forces came during a threeminute tv newscast pinochet was 
dressed in a shortsleeve blue shirt he appeared relaxed and spoke 
clearly and firmly 
last wednesday nearly 7 million chileans went to the polls to 
vote on the armed forces proposal that pinochet legally be allowed 
to remain president until 1997 
pinochet who ousted elected marxist president salvador allende 
in a 1973 coup lost by about 800000 votes precedence for the 
balloting was established under the 1980 constitution 
in that constitution elections for president and congress wont 
be held until december 1989 with the winners taking office the 
following march 
opposition leaders including patricio aylwin spokesman for the 
16party coalition that urged chileans to vote no in the 
referendum have pressed the military government to move up the 
date of elections among other constitutional changes 
we will formally call on those holding power now to talk to 
reach an agreement aylwin said in an interview published sunday 
in the newspaper la epoca we will take the initiative by making 
a proposal and call to the armed forces 
a 4man military junta acts as the legislature of this south 
america country which has been ruled by freely elected democratic 
governments for most of its 178year history as an independent 
nation 
the junta is empowered to change the constitution but pinochet 
emphasized in aspeech broadcast nationwide the night after the 
referendum that he had no intention of doing so 
interior minister sergio fernandez the head of pinochets 
16member cabinet and director of his losing referendum campaign 
urged pinochet supporters to remain united and mobilized around 
our president he did not address opposition demands for changes 
opposition proposals include move up the date of national 
elections eliminate a constitutional ban on marxist groups and 
allow the entire senate not just twothirds to be elected not 
appointed 
also opposition leaders want to streamline the process by which 
future constitutional changes can be made 
ricardo lagos a prominent moderate socialist acknowleged that 
negotiations if they take place would take time the people are 
mature enough to understand that 15 years of dictatorship dont end 
in 15 hours 
but other pinochet opponents already have served notice they 
dont intend to wait peacefully or long on saturday a coalition 
of leftist parties publicly called for pinochets immediate 
resignation 
the situation sets up potential clashes between the government 
and its opponents in the two days following the election tens of

on a jewish temple a jewish community center and a mosque 
extending a yearlong string of vandalism at religious institutions 
i think its fairly clear that all three episodes are related 
and done roughly within the same time period said mark briskman 
regional director of the antidefamation league of bnai brith 
thats clearly a rising of the level of the incidents that a 
weapon was used to fire into the facilities 
the mosque of richardson the jewish temple shalom and the 
jewish community center were attacked sometime saturday night 
police said 
vandals shot out windows and spraypainted red nazi 
antisemitic and antiislamic slogans on all three buildings 
police said 
briskman said jewish leaders believe a small group of white 
supremacists called skinheads because they shave their hair may 
be responsible for the attacks police are investigating 
since last november at least eight minor antisemitic attacks 
on jewish institutions in dallas have been reported to the 
antidefamation league

procedures for disposing of industrial waste

chairman of the monsanto co said sunday 
societys telling us to change said richard mahoney we

you and me 
mahoney spoke to a gathering of chemists and chemical engineers 
at the annual meeting of the council for chemical research he said 
current efforts to minimize wastes are laudable but need to be 
speeded up even though the majority of discharges now are made 
under strict permits and do not pose a hazard 
society makes the rules reducing wastes is about to become a 
rule he said we have a chance now to do that our way the 
science and technology way rather than have some other way 
dictated to us later 
mahoney said some of the technology needed to reduce air 
emissions and other industrial wastes exists now but other 
technologies will have to be developed chemists and engineers will 
be at the center of that work he said 
were asking you to still keep the costs down and improve 
yields but at the same time generate little or no waste as a 
central part of your effort not just a welcome byproduct he

shrouded in secrecy computer industry 
pioneer steve jobs finally is ready to launch what could become one 
of the biggest booms or busts in silicon valleys short but 
meteoric history 
jobs the father of the apple ii and macintosh two of the 
biggest selling computers of the pc generation unveils his next 
inc computer workstation on wednesday its a year late prompting 
critics to dub it eventually 
being shown before 3000 people in san franciscos posh louise 
m davies symphony hall the 2hour product demonstration is 
designed to thrill the analysts convert the doubters and confound 
the competition 
there has been a strong poohpoohing of the next computer for 
a long time a feeling jobs company could not come up with 
anything that could make an impact said jonathan seybold a 
leading los angelesbased trade publisher 
seybold who has seen the next adds they are all going to 
change their minds 
from a hardware and software standpoint this is a remarkable 
achievement and will have a significant impact that will spread 
well beyond the number of computers next will sell 
although the shroud is being lifted after three years of 
development and an exceptionally successful media blackout the 
computer wont immediately be available next will not say when the 
machine will be on the market 
at stake not only is the future of jobs second startup company 
he cofounded apple computer 12 years ago with steve wozniak 
but also jobs reputation as a genius entrepreneur he shaped apple 
into the worlds largest and most profitable company specializing 
in personal computers in the world before being resigning under 
pressure in 1985 
nexts machine is designed with the power of an engineering 
workstation the kind that normally sells for upwards of 30000 to 
50000 jobs has promised to offer it for considerably less but 
just how much less is unknown 
analysts early on speculated the machine would range from 3000 
to 5000 but estimates now range up to 7000 to 10000 
jobs has said the next computer was initially designed for 
college students and academic researchers although analysts 
believe he now envisions a wider market 
its been speculated his machine will be capable of competing 
with such hotselling technical workstations as those from sun 
microsystems inc apollo computer inc and hewlettpackard co 
evidence of that are reports that ibm is paying 10 million for 
the right to use the distinctive symbols and commands with which 
the user will interact with next 
industry executives last month told the new york times that ibm 
plans to use the jobs technology on computers that run the unix 
operating system the standard for technical workstations 
ibms use of nexts software technology expected to be 
announced wednesday could solve one of jobs biggest potential 
problems the difficulty in getting software developers to spend 
time converting their programs for the next alone 
not everyone is convinced the next will appeal to large audience 
the expectations are out of touch with reality trip 
hawkins president of san mateos electronic arts told the san 
jose mercury news it will be a miracle if it is what people 
say 
some details of the computer have leaked out the most reliable 
one being its unusual visual design with a black magnesium case and 
17inch monochrome monitor 
dazzling color display postscript software and other software 
are widely expected to give exceptionally vivid graphics possibly 
offering photolike realism and numerous type fonts and sizes a 
laser printer also is expected to be offered which would vastly 
improve industry reproduction quality standards 
according to numerous published reports the software is so 
revolutionary or at least jobs computer designers hope so that 
even nonprogrammers should be able to create software on a next 
machine 
that would allow professors for example to illustrate complex 
math and science ideas with their own graphics 
in hardware the mercury news reports next is expected to come 
with an erasable optical disk drive which could increase current 
computer storage as much as 50 times and allow the storage of 
detailed images such as photographs 
optical drives also can give computers the ability to play 
stereo digital music 
jobs himself has indicated the computer will have a 32bit 
motorola 68030 chip one of the industrys fastest a connector to 
an industry standard network called ethernet that will allow next 
to share files with other types of computers and mathematica 
software of special use for sophisticated math equations 
other reports indicate the system also may feature a highspeed 
modem allowing it to work with facsimile machines optional digital 
audiotape storage and the ability to display televisionquality 
video signals not now available on any other personal computers 
jobs founded next in 1985 after leaving apple in a power 
struggle with apples chief executive officer john sculley 
in early 1987 h ross perot the flamboyant founder of general 
motors corps electronic data systems inc unit invested 20 
million in next and holds a 16 percent stake in the company jobs 
has invested 12 million of his own money and holds a 63 percent 
stake 
seybold says the next will prove to a skeptical industry that 
the past success of the 33yearold jobs once dubbed the 
accidental millionaire by an author who dismissed his alleged 
business acumen as luck was not a fluke 
the next clearly shows that there is no question that steve

the government expressed extreme regret and 
astonishment sunday at britains demand it more than halve its 
stake in british petroleum co and said it has taken steps to 
protect its foreign investments 
but an official statement did not say what those measures were 
the statement was the first official comment by kuwait since 
britains trade secretary lord young told kuwait on tuesday to 
reduce its holding in bp from 2169 percent to 99 percent over the 
next year 
the statement was announced by the minister of state for cabinet 
affairs rashed abdulaziz alrashed after the weekly cabinet 
session chaired by kuwaits crown prince and prime minister sheik 
saad alabdullah alsabah 
in response to a reporters question after the cabinet session 
alrashed said the cabinet has discussed this subject and 
decided to take all necessary steps to protect kuwaits economic 
interests in britain 
kuwait expressed its extreme regret and astonishment at the 
decision of the british government to reduce the stake of kuwait in 
bp from 216 to 99 percent he said 
the government studied all suitable measures and at all levels 
with a view to protecting its economic interests and its 
investments abroad he said 
kuwait has an estimated 85 billion of accumulated petrodollars 
from the oil boom years of the 1970s in overseas holdings 
onefifth of that is invested in britain 
britains monopolies and mergers commission had advised that the 
kuwaiti investment might operate against the public interest 
and the trade secretary acted on that recommendation 
the investments are placed through the stateowned kuwait 
investment office the londonbased kio bought 1316 billion bp 
shares after the british government sold off its onethird stake in 
the oil giant last year 
the kio stands to lose an estimated 676 million at current 
market prices if it cuts its bp holdings to the level the british 
demand

the economy of the 1990s may get off to a shaky 
start but in the longerterm it could feature steady growth 
higher taxes high employment and low interest rates according to 
a forecast by money magazine 
the magazine in a special fall 1988 edition also predicted 
that while the 1990a economy would not necessarily boom it would 
provide a good background for another bull market in stocks and 
bonds 
money said its forecast was based on observations by a panel of 
six economic and social experts plus interviews with about 300 
economists demographers investment analysts futurists and others 
who monitor trends and forecast change 
the magazine indicated its experts generally expected no 
economic recession during this election year it also predicted 
that when a recession did occur it should be mild by historical 
standards tempered by the continued steady demand for services 
which now account for 67 percent of the gross national product and 
90 percent of new jobs 
furthermore the increasingly deregulated global economy tends 
to be more selfregulating the magazine stated with interest 
rates rising in overheated economies to help choke off inflation 
and economic booms thus lessening the severity of booms and busts 
among other predictions for the 1990s 
following recession the economy will enjoy moderate inflation 
and steady moderate growth 
unemployment could fall as low as 4 percent due to the expected 
baby bust that will see workforce growth slow sharply 
the dollar will decline slightly but will bottom out helping 
further trim the us trade deficit 
the next president whoever it is will raise taxes within 
two years 
longterm interest rates will peak at 105 percent to 11 
percent and later fall to as low as 5 percent due to lower credit 
demand during the recession 
the dow jones industrial average now at about 2150 will 
hit 3000 early in the next decade as falling interest rates on 
bonds encourage investors to switch to stocks 
investors increasingly will invest for the longterm amid 
sagging confidence in social security and increasing awareness of 
rising future costs such as college 
pessimists among the magazines experts warned the 1990s 
scenario could be bleak with the recession possibly deepening into 
a depression a worstcase scenario could be set up by 
faulty us government policy such as a tax increase that 
might stifle economic growth by forcing debtburdened consumers to 
cut their spending reducing a key gnp component 
a surge in bank failures that also might prompt consumers to 
cut spending drastically 
protectionism combining with a recentlystronger dollar to 
widen the nations trade deficit 
a crash of the highflying japanese stock market which could 
cause huge japanese investment firms to dump us stocks and bonds 
forcing interest rates here to skyrocket

prices of orange juice futures traded on the new york cotton 
exchange closed friday at 1707 a pound for january delivery up 
about 100 percent in the past two years the orlando sentinel 
reported sunday 
but there is continued legal wrangling over the canker 
eradication program an investigation into the export practices of 
processors that could give the industry a black eye and an unknown 
impact on the global orange juice market from brazil which in 1982 
surpassed florida as the worlds largest orange producer 
the citrus industry is in good shape economically but those 
who have fruit are doing very well and those who dont have fruit 
are struggling financially bobby mckown executive vice 
president of florida citrus mutual in lakeland told the newspaper 
the 40yearold trade group is the states largest citrus 
growers association with more than 12000 members 
mild weather prevailed for the past three winters spurring 
florida growers to plant a recordhigh 125000 acres of fruit trees 
in 1986 and 1987 but growers on the northern edge of the citrus 
belt hit hardest by the earlier freezes accounted for about 30 
percent of the new plantings 
members of the florida citrus commission which oversees the 
state citrus department say they expect about 1477 million boxes 
of oranges and 544 million boxes of grapefruit to be picked this 
season a box equals 90 pounds 
that would be almost 50 percent more oranges and 22 percent more 
grapefruit than were harvested during the freezeshortened 198485 
season 
growers reaped a record 13 billion for their fruit during the 
198788 season eclipsing a record 103 billion set in the bumper 
crop season of 197980 according to a preliminary report released 
nine days ago the wholesale value including the cost of 
harvesting and transportation was estimated at about 33 billion 
although high prices are lifting the spirits of growers the 
industry is facing severe tests on a number of fronts 
the us supreme court last week let stand a florida court 
ruling that requires the state to pay full market value for healthy 
trees destroyed in the canker eradication program about 20 million 
trees were burned and growers were reimbursed about 17 million as 
partial compensation full compensation might cost more than 200 
million 
officials of the state agriculture department say it would be up 
to the legislature to decide any additional compensation but 
legislators have shown little enthusiasm for taking such action 
another controversy threatens to spill into courtrooms us 
customs officials in tampa last week announced that criminal fraud 
charges had been filed against allsun pure juice corp the polk 
county juice processor is charged with defrauding the government of 
at least 750000 in import fees by mislabeling products to obtain 
import fee refunds 
an investigation of the practices of other processing companies 
is continuing said brad knutter a customs fraud investigation 
supervisor 
obviously we cant guarantee other indictments but if we 
didnt think there was more fraud out there we wouldnt say that 
we consider this just the beginning said knutter 
brazil is the final question mark 
if brazilian crops are large and juicy that can mean lower 
prices for florida fruit but if the brazilians decide to export 
more orange juice to europe as they did last year that can mean 
higher prices in florida 
while florida growers and processors have a difficult enough 
time keeping track of the state of their own industry divining the 
situation in brazil is even tricker brazil does not conduct its 
own scientific surveys to make monthly crop forecasts as does 
florida 
brazil is definitely the wild card said phil herndon 
president of alcoma packing co a citrus processing company in 
polk county

libya on sunday called for an extraordinary meeting 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to restore 
falling oil prices 
according to the official libyan news agency jana monitored 
here libya called for a urgent conference of the opec ministerial 
council as soon as possible 
it said the council should take the necessary measures to stop 
the fall in prices restore stability to the oil market and to take 
prices up to levels which are fair to both consumer and producer 
oil prices tumbled last week to their lowest levels since 1986 
and now are just under 13 a barrel in the us futures market 
some analysts blamed the sharp decline on indications that more 
saudi arabian crude will be flowing into the market the saudis 
have indicated they may hike production unless other members of the 
13nation opec adhere to production quotas aimed at supporting a 
benchmark price of 18 a barrel 
jana said libyas decision to call for the extraordinary meeting 
was made after consultation with some opec member countries

saudi arabian oil minister hisham 
nazer has denied reports that the kingdom intends to pull out of 
the 13nation opec because some of the cartels member states were 
violating set production quotas 
in a statement distributed late saturday by the official saudi 
press agency nazer stressed that the kingdom would push for 
adherence to the quotas assigned by the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
the kingdom of saudi arabia has not thought of pulling out of 
opec he said the media have been giving unjustified 
explanations of the cabinet statement which was worded carefully so 
as to avoid any interpretations 
last monday following a regular cabinet meeting chaired by king 
fahd saudi arabia said it would not accept that some members of 
opec cheat on their production quotas at its expense 
it said the kingdom was prepared to abide by its quota of 4343 
million barrels a day provided the others adhered to their quotas 
it also stressed it was not prepared to reassume the role of 
swing producer committing the kingdom to curtail its output 
when others exceed theirs 
saudi arabia nazer said is not satisfied with the current 
market situation nor does it consider it of its making and it 
still calls for a return to the defined production levels and will 
be the first to abide by them 
nazer said opec states which were disturbed by the current oil 
market situation should return to quota levels and help restore 
stability to the oil market 
overproduction by some of the cartels member states has 
generated a glut on the world oil market forcing prices to drop 
about 5 below opecs benchmark of 18 a barrel 
the kingdom the worlds largest oil exporter and the leading 
member of the cartel produced more than 10 million barrels a day 
at the peak of the oil boom in 1982 
oil industry reports have estimated that saudi arabia has 
exceeded its quota producing about 6 million barrels a day the 
reports speculated the kingdom was deliberately boosting its 
production to enforce discipline within opec

children around the world have played 
with springy slinkies for 43 years but the 70yearold woman who 
helped invent the wire toy says it hasnt been all fun and games 
betty james president of james industries inc says her late 
husband richard james a mechanical engineer and naval architect 
came up with the idea of the toy in 1943 while aboard a ship he 
saw a torsion spring fall from a table and bounce 
mrs james took control of the business in 1960 when her 
husband lost interest and left the family to join what she called a 
religious cult in bolivia he died there in 1974 
to this day she said i dont know what a torsion spring 
is 
james industries is a spartan nononsense firm that turns out 
slinkies by the millions in this small central pennsylvania town 
it employs 120 people who manufacture package sell and ship 
slinkies from a single building 
a grandmother of 10 mrs james says shes basically a doting 
mother devoted to her six adult children and their families 
according to her oldest son shes also a demanding and assertive 
boss 
she expects a lot out of you she expects you to produce and 
so you do produce said richard james ii 46 he is slinky sales 
manager and the only one of three sons and three daughters to join 
the family business 
mrs james who is known as big betty is not too big to 
take telephone messages for her staff and do many other tasks 
when we first moved into this building i used to clean the 
toilets too she said 
shes been involved in every aspect of production and promotion 
slinky was put on the market in 1945 after the jameses spent 
two years experimenting with various types of steel 
after receiving a patent they demonstrated the toys at a 
gimbels department store in philadelphia they gave us the end 
of a counter so we could show how it walked mrs james recalled 
i was so scared that no one would buy them i called a friend 
and asked her to come along i thought we would each buy one if 
nobody else did she said 
she neednt have worried after a quick demonstration the first 
400 slinkies sold out in 90 minutes at a dollar each 
i was so taken aback when i saw this crowd of people and 
everyone was waving dollar bills 
each night mrs james took the days production home from the 
manufacturer and wrapped the slinkies by hand with yellow paper 
richard james meanwhile came up with other inventions but 
none were successful 
he was a dreamer she said he developed a refrigerator 
that would dispense soft drinks but we took it out because we were 
drinking so many soft drinks we were getting fat he also wanted to 
work on an amphibious car 
when her husband left mrs james struggled to keep the business 
alive to feed herself and her children 
to me my family is the most precious thing in life i 
always wanted a family because i was an only child she said 
you do what you have to do for them i did what i had to do 
the first slinky plant was in philadelphias germantown section 
mrs james moved to hollidaysburg 180 miles away 23 years ago 
because she had family and friends in the area who could help care 
for her children 
the family moved a year and a half before the companys move was 
complete and mrs james commuted to philadelphia each week she 
drove to philadelphia on sunday evenings returning home on 
thursdays 
it was hard to see her crying because she had to leave the six 
of us her son richard said 
today james industries sells millions of slinkies around the 
world mrs james who with her children owns all company stock 
declined to release the number of units sold annually or annual 
sales figures slinkies usually retail for less than 2 
the company produces other toys including building blocks 
plastic rings games and pin wheels but slinky outsells them 
all mrs james said 
its simple its a universal toy its a toy that doesnt 
need any explanation it has intrinsic play value her son said 
there are very few other toys like that 
james industries began producing brightly colored plastic 
slinkies in 1979 to appeal to younger children especially infants 
mrs james and her son gasp at the thought of updating the 
television commercial jingle that declares slinky slinky 
everyone loves a slinky the song was written in 1963 
well just stick to something thats good she said
