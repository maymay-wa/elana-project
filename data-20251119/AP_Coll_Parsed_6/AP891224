wilkesbarre pa ap larry and leona cottam are trying to 
resume a normal life while they fight their murder convictions in 
the starvation death of their teenage son nearly a year ago the 
couples attorney said 
under the circumstances theyre doing quite well said al 
flora jr luzerne county first assistant public defender of larry 
and leona cottam i dont know that theyll ever come back to 
normal given what theyve been through 
free on bail the cottams have found a permanent home since 
their thirddegree murder convictions sept 8 and larry has taken 
a job as a laborer flora said 
the couple recently sold the modest home where their 14yearold 
son eric died in an upstairs bedroom last january his 5foot 
10inch frame wasted to only 69 pounds 
erics death ended the reclusive familys sixweek fast 
undertaken despite nearly 4000 in savings kept as a religious 
tithe to god and in hopes god would rescue them from their plight 
cottam a former seventhday adventist pastor reported his 
sons death to police jan 4 
larry and leona cottam were charged with thirddegree murder a 
day later while they were still undergoing treatment for 
malnutrition at mercy hospital in wilkesbarre 
district justice ronald swank read the charges to mrs cottam as 
she lay in her hospital bed and to her husband in a hospital 
visiting room as he sat in a wheelchair with an intravenous tube in 
his arm 
laura cottam the couples other child also received treatment 
for malnutrition and later was placed in foster care 
the cottams financial problems began in march 1988 when cottam 
lost his job as a truck driver in a dispute with his boss over the 
safety of the vehicles tires 
cottam then refused to sign up for government assistance and 
neighbors said the family declined offers for help and withdrew 
into their home on a deadend street in nuangola a community of 
700 residents south of wilkesbarre 
already the cottams were teaching their children at home and 
had stopped attending church 
in a sevenweek trial luzerne county prosecutors claimed larry 
and leona cottam should have taken steps other than prayer to 
prevent erics death and lauras malnourishment 
a jury deliberated less than two hours before finding the 
cottams guilty sept 8 of thirddegree murder and other charges 
thirddegree murder defined as a killing that is not premeditated 
but is done with malice carries a maximum sentence of 20 years 
judge gifford s cappellini allowed larry cottam now 40 and 
leona cottam 38 remain free on 50000 bail each which was 
posted by a bail bondsman under the conditions of the bail one of 
their attorneys must see the couple once a week to ensure their 
health 
theyre keeping their spirits up under the circumstances 
flora said their religious beliefs are still very firm would 
they ever get into a situation like that again i dont think so 
mrs cottam has had a harder time than her husband flora said 
because she does not have a job and stays at home most of the time 
laura cottam who turned 13 last month has entered school with 
the support of her parents who even sold christmas cookies to 
raise money for the school flora said 
flora and cocounsel joseph cosgrove claim the cottams were 
denied a fair trial in part because the couple were not allowed to 
raise their childrens right to freedom of religion 
at the trial laura cottam testified that her parents didnt 
force her to take part in the fast she said she had used her own 
tithe money on food if she wanted 
flora and cosgrove have filed posttrial motions seeking either 
a new trial or dismissal of the charges 
flora said these motions will be supplemented when the 3000 to 
4000page court transcript is completed by the end of january or 
early february a decision by cappellini on the posttrial motions 
isnt expected until summer he said 
if the motions are denied the cottams have 30 days to file an 
appeal the case to state superior court 
its a long process flora said

major cities nationwide

uprising on friday after a week of protests nationwide 
fighting eased briefly in the capital after daybreak sunday and 
some citizens were seen lugging christmas trees and carrying 
shopping bags as some merchants briefly opened their shops but 
renewed sniping and hitandrun attacks by ceausescu loyalists 
cleared the streets again 
romanian radio said sunday that soldiers had found a vast 
network of safe houses and secret tunnels crisscrossing the city 
that ceausescu forces stocked with arms ammunition and electronic 
monitoring equipment in recent years

subway stations run for miles linking ceausescus palace with 
party headquarters and extending as far as a lake in the northern 
part of the city said the radio

massive protests and hundreds perhaps thousands more have died in 
the armed struggles for control since ceausescu fled his palace on

are essentially fighting for their lives against the 
revolutionaries many of whom have vowed revenge for the massacres 
of unarmed citizens during the massive proreform protests

the fighting friday and saturday that could not be confirmed but 
a head count at one of 14 bucharest hospitals tallied 100 dead

the us embassy in bucharest on sunday was evacuating 
dependents and some staff in a convoy to sofia said spokeswoman

robbed him saturday night the yugoslav consulate said he was 
hospitalized in satisfactory condition it could not immediately be

firefights raged well into saturday night in bucharest with the 
routes once traveled by ceausescu between his guarded private villa 
and the communist party headquarters the scene of intense battles 
the university library and nearby buildings believed to be the 
stronghold of the ceausescu loyalist forces were burning out of

against the securitate terrorists stephan andreescu spokesman 
for the national salvation committee said referring to the 
security forces

dangerous andreescu told the associated press but he claimed 
the army was in complete control of the situation in the 
country 
the terrorists are believed to be hiding in the subway and in 
secret underground passages below the former presidential palace 
andreescu said it will take days before it is all over 
the soviet news agency tass reporting from bucharest said the 
resisting securitate units were retreating to cemeteries where 
there are rumored to be hideouts among burial vaults and 
entrances to a system of secret underground tunnels 
ceausescu ruled romania with an iron fist for 24 years refusing 
the soviet bloc reforms that this year swept through hungary 
poland czechoslovakia bulgaria and east germany with relatively 
little violence 
in switzerland the justice minister said sunday that a 
precautionary freeze has been placed on any assets that may be 
held in switzerland by ceausescu and his family the action came 
after romanian exile groups claimed the ousted dictator had stashed

defense by a few hundred people of a defiant pastor threatened with 
arrest in timisoara turned into a mass protests that swirled the

the losers in a medical malpractice 
trial claim in a request for a new trial that an episode of the tv 
series la law influenced the jurors to vote against them 
in a motion filed friday a lawyer representing a man whose wife 
died after a 1981 gallbladder operation suggested jurors were 
influenced by the dec 7 episode which portrayed a doctor 
wrongfully accused of malpractice 
the jury in the case of widower jacob klein vs drs harvey o 
kaiser and theodore d aylward decided on dec 8 that the doctors 
were not at fault in the death of lillian klein 
the show was pure and simple propaganda for doctors defending 
malpractice cases said the motion filed on kleins behalf by 
miami lawyer david f ennis 
in effect the defendants had substantial additional time 
for argument made through trained sympathetic wellliked 
wellknown actors the motion said 
it is highly probable and more likely than not in light of 
la laws nationwide popularity that one or more jurors viewed 
this segment or even discussed same among them ennis 
concluded 
tampa lawyer william hahn who defended aylward said he thought 
the motion was humorous 
three members of the jury reached friday by telephone said the 
show had no effect on their verdict the tampa tribune reported 
saturday all said the show was not mentioned by others during 
deliberations 
i started to watch it and i fell asleep said juror 
christine wallace 
pat schultz corporate spokeswoman for nbc in los angeles said 
company officials know of no court case that had to be retried 
because of la law

there was no indication who was responsible for the shooting 
communist rebels operate in davao city 600 miles southeast of 
manila 
but government troops have been on alert in the davao area 
because of reports that military mutineers who tried to topple

missions to support government forces dec 1 the first day of the

thousands of west germans passed through the 
berlin wall on sunday after east germany marked the holidays by 
lifting visa and currency requirements on visitors from the west 
a spontaneous festival erupted on the east side of the walls 
brandenburg gate shortly after midnight as west berliners poured 
through the border crossing 
the east german government forced to give in to a prodemocracy 
uprising opened the berlin wall on nov 9 and lifted most 
restrictions on east germans who want to travel to the west 
earlier this month the government lifted currency exchange and 
visa requirements on west germans traveling to the east fully 
opening the border between the nations 
the new rules went into effect at midnight saturday and there 
was no shortage of west germans curious about the east 
east berliners tried to return the warm welcome they had 
received in west berlin in november when bars and cafes stayed 
open all night in a riotous celebration of freedom 
six weeks later smiling east germans rolled out a large keg of 
beer others passed out cognac in the cold drizzle and still others 
served as guides for west berliners many of whom had crossed into 
east berlin for the first time 
they strolled down unter den linden the most elegant boulevard 
in east berlin 
berliners from both sides of the crumbling wall broke out in a 
chorus of old songs and couples twirled around to the steady beat 
of an organ grinder winding his way around the brandenburg gate 
merrymakers handed flowers to police who grinned in response 
others shook metal cans to collect money for medical supplies 
for battlestricken romania while the familiar clink of souvenir 
seekers chipping away at the wall continued in the background 
until sunday west germans were required to obtain a visa to 
travel into east germany and were obliged to change 25 marks about 
15 each day a hefty sum for young people and the elderly 
now west germans simply must show an identity card and fill out 
a short form so that the east germans are able to keep track of the 
number of visitors 
west german border police reported that east germans greeted 
their west german neighbors with flowers and a welcome drink in 
numerous villages along the border even before the new rules became 
official 
at many border crossings east german border guards simply 
ignored the rules and allowed west germans in before the new 
regulations went into effect 
still border police reported sunday morning that the number of 
east germans heading west outstripped the number of west germans 
using their new travel freedoms in the other direction 
but the number of east germans traveling to west germany had 
fallen sharply in comparison with previous sundays border police 
attributed the drop to the fact that the stores were closed for 
christmas

a regional party congress 
slovenias communists under milan kucan the regional partys

six republics where communist leaders are opposed to any form of 
pluralism 
numerous independent political movements and opposition parties 
including the social democratic and christian democratic parties 
have been established in slovenia and are preparing to compete in 
the regions first free legislative elections scheduled for march 
the decision to implement radical reforms makes it 
possible for slovenes to be proud ribicic said 
croatia yugoslavias secondlargest republic has also 
announced that free elections will be held next spring 
only the leadership of serbia has remained consistently opposed 
to pluralism last month serbias central republic broke off all

the unraveling of communism in 
eastern europe should serve as a warning to marxist rebels who for 
20 years have tried to topple the philippine government newspapers 
said sunday 
the insurgents waging southeast asias last major marxist 
rebellion should consider a complete and permanent cessation of 
hostilities the philippine daily inquirer said in an editorial 
for its part congress should think seriously about legalizing 
the communist party of the philippines to give its leaders and 
members an opportunity to participate freely and legally in the 
politics and government of the country the newspaper added 
it said the historic changes sweeping the soviet union and its 
allies had undermined the ideological foundation of marxism 
several major newspapers and a political columnist urged an end 
to the insurgency just days before the 21st anniversary of the 
creation of the maoist communist party of the philippines which 
was founded dec 26 1968 
columnist jesus bigornia writing in the manila bulletin noted 
the bloody overthrow of the 24year regime of romanian president 
nicolae ceausescu the last warsaw pact holdout against reform 
the fate of ceausescu and his romanian communist party could 
serve as a warning to the philippines bigornia wrote 
possibly the time has come for the communist party of the 
philippines to dissolve its new peoples army lay down their arms 
and join the mainstream of philippine society 
on thursday the rebel national democratic front hinted it would 
be willing to resume peace talks which broke off in february 1987 
the front an umbrella organization of 12 marxist groups declared 
a christmas and new years ceasefire but expressed no willingness 
for a peaceful settlement of the insurgency 
let the silence of our guns this christmas deliver this 
message loud and clear the front said similar statements were 
issued by the front during the christmas seasons of 1987 and 1988 
the communist and government forces have declared unilateral 
ceasefires during the holiday season said the manila chronicle 
but come january its back to mutual destruction tough luck for 
whomevers in the way 
president corazon aquino has repeatedly insisted that the 
communists and their estimated 19000strong new peoples army lay 
down their arms before talks can begin 
the governments hardline position may reflect a perception 
that the rebels do not constitute as great a threat as they 
appeared to in the months following the 1986 ouster of president 
ferdinand marcos 
in the last three years the greatest immediate threat to the 
aquino government has come not from the communists but from 
soldiers who have launched six armed coup attempts most recently 
this month

moslem leaders from around the nation are 
meeting in an annual conference on the prophet mohammed some 
american buddhists are giving new stature to bodhi day and 
lighting hanukkah candles has become the second most widely 
practiced observance among american jews 
it must be christmastime 
while christian leaders bemoan the commercialization of 
christmas other religious groups are reporting revived interest in 
their own traditions in reaction to the relentless secular presence 
of the holiday 
what that reflects frankly is the attempt to compensate 
for the overwhelming presence of christmas in american society 
said rabbi a james rudin national interreligious affairs director 
of the american jewish committee 
rudin said there has been a mismatch because the jewish and 
christian holidays fall near each other but are not equal in 
importance 
one is a minor jewish holiday one is a major christian 
holiday rudin said the truth is christmas is not the 
christian hanukkah and hanukkah is not the jewish christmas 
but that has not stopped hanukkah the eightday jewish feast of 
lights that began friday evening from becoming an important 
tradition in the united states surveys showed more than twothirds 
of all jewish people in the united states light hanukkah candles a 
ritual surpassed only by attendance at a passover seder 
among many buddhists special emphasis has been placed on the 
dec 8 celebration of bodhi day the day they believe the buddha 
became enlightened 
the rev carol himaka education director of the buddhist 
churches of america in san francisco said bodhi day is being more 
widely observed because of the need to have our own young people 
recognize our own tradition 
still she said many buddhists celebrate christmas the way a 
lot of nondevout christians mark the holiday with trees and 
presents and little regard for the religious significance of the 
birth of the person christians believe is the son of god 
its more difficult to explain to young children especially 
why they should not celebrate christmas she said 
the bahais who say jesus was a prophet sent by god do not 
believe there is a spiritual conflict in observing christmas 
according to katharine bigelow deputy director of the bahai 
national office of external affairs in washington 
i dont observe christmas with my bahai friends but with my 
family who is all christian i look forward to celebrating with 
them she said 
some moslem leaders attending the seerah conference sponsored by 
the council of masajid of united states over christmas weekend said 
that while jesus also is a respected figure in their faith all 
trappings of christmas should be avoided 
we want our children to know about our religion and an islamic 
perspective said habib malik a teacher with the muslim world 
league in philadelphia 
we are concerned when we see some moslem families bringing 
christmas trees home 
imam shamsher ali director of the islamic religious center of 
long island said moslem religious leaders emphasize at friday 
prayer sessions before christmas that their faith teaches jesus was 
a prophet of god but not the son of god 
competition with christmas is not always a positive thing other 
religious leaders said 
rudin remembers being told as a child to be thankful he was 
jewish and receiving gifts for eight days during hanukkah while 
those quote poor christians were only going to get gifts for 
one day 
his advice let hanukkah be hanukkah 
some celebrations this time of year are not tied to any religion 
kwanzaa a holiday modeled on traditional african harvest 
celebrations is observed by some black americans it begins 
tuesday and runs through jan 1 
and the southern california wing of atheists united exchanged 
gifts thursday afternoon to mark the winter solstice 
basically its a time to party said atheists united

the government sunday approved a draft 4667 
billion budget for fiscal 1990 that for the first time in 15 years 
does not rely on deficitfinancing bonds 
the cabinet held a special meeting to accept the finance 
ministrys draft budget for the fiscal year beginning in march the 
budget represents a 97 percent increase over current spending 
it calls for increases of 55 percent in defense spending to 
291 billion 59 percent in aid to developing countries to about 
56 billion and 62 percent in social security spending to 815 
billion 
the increases reflect growing tax revenues flowing from japans 
booming economy which just entered its fourth year of continuous 
expansion 
further negotiations will finetune specific allocations for the 
final version of the budget which is expected to be approved 
friday 
the cabinet also approved a supplementary budget for the current 
fiscal year the 415 billion budget is the largest stopgap 
budget ever 
the greatest thrust of this years budget is the desire of the 
government to end its dependence on deficitfinancing bonds a 
foreign ministry official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
since they were first introduced in 1975 we have made earnest 
efforts to end this dependency we were finally able to rid 
ourselves of this unhealthy system 
the government issued 93 billion worth of deficitfinancing 
bonds last year to cover the budgets red ink that amount will be 
made up in part by an infusion in fiscal 1990 of 915 billion from 
government sales last year of its shares in nippon telegraph and 
telephone corp as well as increased tax revenues the official 
said 
defense spending will rise to 291 billion but because of 
economic expansion the defense budget will dip below 1 percent of 
japans gross national product for the first time in four years 
standing at 0991 percent of the gnp 
in the mid1970s japan adopted a policy of keeping defense 
spending to within 1 percent of the gnp but since 1986 it has 
hovered just above that figure 
spending on public works will rise 03 percent to 438 billion 
next fiscal year although the united states has urged japan to 
increase such publicly funded projects to help ease tokyos trade 
surplus with washington the marginal increase is sufficient 
the finance ministry official said 
the draft budget was compiled on the basis of government 
estimates that the economy will grow an inflationadjusted 4 
percent next year a brisk pace despite a slowdown from the 
estimated 46 percent growth in fiscal 1989 
an unusual addition to the fiscal 1990 budget was 39 million 
for the formal enthronement ceremonies of emperor akihito and 
958000 for the wedding of akihitos second son prince aya

black and white children helped each 
other build sandcastles their older brothers played soccer 
together white lifeguards shouted warnings in zulu 
after years of debate protests and occasional violence south 
africa has opened all its beaches to all races and buried one of 
its most visible and resented apartheid practices 
as recently as august police used whips and dogs to keep blacks 
off segregated sand but at durbans hotellined beachfront the 
busiest in the country the attitude sunday was swim and let swim 
i preferred segregated beaches said charles erasmus a 
vacationing white but what am i going to do spite myself and 
not go swimming the laws been changed and well have to accept 
it 
president fw de klerk last month declared an end to 
whitesonly beaches settling a conflict that arose every december 
when hundreds of thousands of south africans travel to the coast 
for vacation 
for authorities opening the beaches has proved far easier than 
keeping them segregated in the face of mounting black protest 
shortly before de klerks declaration the durban city council 
spent six hours debating whether to open the last remaining 
stretches of segregated beach 
their solution remove the embarrassing whites only signs 
but keep the law in effect days after de klerks announcement the 
council voted 245 to integrate the beaches 
morris fynn a mixedrace man who was arrested several times for 
cutting down whites only beach signs ceremoniously buried his 
saw in the sand to mark the formal death of beach apartheid 
three years ago allan hendrickse the first mixedrace member 
of the cabinet invited reporters to watch him take a dip at a 
whitesonly beach at port elizabeth 
one of his next public acts was to apologize for his swim after 
being rebuked by thenpresident pw botha 
antiapartheid groups targeted beaches along with other 
segregated facilities when they launched a nationwide defiance 
campaign in august 
when protesters arrived at a beach near cape town it was 
cordoned off and accompanied by signs saying police dog training 
in progress 
when the demonstrators proceeded they were met with tear gas 
whips and police dogs several people were injured 
local authorites have complied with de klerks proclamation 
though under protest in some cases but there have been no reports 
of racial violence or even serious overcrowding since the beaches 
were opened 
look there are thousands of people here and no 
confrontations said walter buthelezi 19 who was visiting the 
beachfront with his sisters there was never any need for 
segregated beaches 
but durbans mayor derrick waterson disagrees 
this wouldnt have happened easily five years ago 
conservative whites werent ready for it he said 
waterson and his council have received more than 400 complaints 
from whites in the town of mossel bay about 2500 whites signed a 
petition asking for a return to segregated beaches 
many whites insist they are not racist and say they want 
separate beaches because of cultural differences 
some blacks swim in their underwear and strip naked when washing 
off under the shower nozzles at the beach the whites complain 
its mostly older people that get offended but when we talk 
to the blacks they always cooperate lifeguard liam halforty said 
halforty and his colleagues have been taking a crash course in 
zulu to help them communicate with black bathers roughly 15 
percent of the beach crowd was black over the weekend 
traditionally one of the busiest of the year in durban 
im sure some whites stayed away said carol cilliers it 
will take about two or three years before they will come back to 
these beaches 
de klerk has promised to remove all discriminatory laws and 
most socalled petty apartheid measures already have been 
scrapped 
the major remaining areas of segregation are public schools 
residential areas and public hospitals de klerk has pledged to 
keep these separate for whites who want them and many do 
beaches are one thing schools and neighborhoods are 
another said leo kotze a vacationer

the name doesnt matter any democratic 
heavyweight will do theyre all professing no interest whatsoever 
in taking on president bush in 1992 
i have no plans to run for president in 1992 declares sen 
sam nunn of georgia 
im focusing on my reelection next year says sen al gore 
of tennessee 
im not running and im not making any plans to run chimes 
in sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
ditto for sen bill bradley of new jersey gov mario cuomo of 
new york and civil rights leader jesse jackson 
so is it bush and quayle unopposed for reelection in 1992 
no chance 
while there is remarkably little overt activity among the 
potential democratic challengers there is always something 
stirring in presidential politics even those who deny any interest 
find their hearts beat a little faster when they breathe the cool 
clean air of iowa and new hampshire 
bradley was in des moines over the summer to speak at a 
fundraiser for sen tom harkin diowa who faces a tough 
republican challenge in 1990 while he was there he met with tony 
bisignano a union official and state legislator 
bisignano was impressed 
he said they didnt talk about 1992 but hed be eager to start 
a lowkey grassroots organization to drum up support for 
bradley 
bentsen meanwhile was the featured speaker at the iowa 
democratic partys jeffersonjackson day dinner this fall 
new hampshire the state which has the quadrennial distinction 
of holding the first presidential primary has had visits in 1989 
from rep pat schroeder of colorado and gov richard celeste of 
ohio both came close to entering the 1988 presidential race 
sen robert kerrey of nebraska had a long lunch in boston this 
fall with a group of political operatives who have had extensive 
experience in democratic presidential campaigns 
he just wanted to know what was on peoples minds said 
larry rasky a public relations executive who worked on sen joe 
bidens 1988 campaign 
cuomo has said an indication that he is planning a presidential 
bid would be an announcement that he will not run for a third term 
as governor of new york hes not giving that signal at least not 
now 
in a telephone interview he said hes leaning toward another 
gubernatorial campaign 
theres just nothing i can do thats as important as this 
he said 
but somehow cuomo finds it impossible to stop thinking about 
running for president 
an example of his ambivalence came last summer when he invited a 
reporter to ask him about the possibility that he might seek the 
presidency 
i want to talk about it because i want to dispose of it he 
said declaring that he was tired of speculation about his plans 
and so he said for the time being im not going to 
discuss it

leonardo da vinci long ago drew a 
flying machine powered by a man cranking levers that could take off 
vertically and hover above the earth 
five centuries and thousands of inventors later da vincis 
dream of a humanpowered helicopter was realized this month by 
students at california polytechnic state university san luis 
obispo 
the dec 10 flight of the da vinci iii powered by an olympic 
bicyclist lasted just a few seconds and got the craft only a few 
inches off the ground 
even so it was the first ever flight by a humanpowered 
helicopter and was hailed as a historic aviation achievement 
as a result the cal poly students are spending christmas break 
raising money and designing the da vinci iv 
until this point nobody had ever broken the pull of the 
earth this is a great leap forward said mark paris spokesman 
for the american helicopter society in alexandria va an 
organization of engineers 
the 97pound da vinci iii completely designed and built by 
undergraduate engineering students officially flew for 68 
seconds rising eight inches off a gym floor on this campus halfway 
between los angeles and san francisco 
the dec 10 flight made before an official from the national 
aeronautic association and a cheering crowd and two november 
practice flights left the inventors feeling like orville and wilbur 
wright must have felt at kitty hawk 
i was very surprised said neal saiki a 23yearold senior 
and the guiding force of the project since 1987 the time it 
first took off i wasnt really expecting it to tell you the 
truth then it was just all kinds of emotions going through me 
the project has been in the works off and on since 1980 with 
much of the work done in a cluttered workshop the whole project 
has cost about 100000 money donated from aerospace companies and 
private contributors 
it has taken several versions of the helicopter hundreds of 
hours behind a computer scores of crashes and other mishaps and 
lots of oldfashioned head scratching before the students came up 
with a workable design 
in the end they found they didnt so much have to refine 
helicopter technology as virtually reinvent the machine what they 
have created is a craft that looks more like a spinning wing than a 
helicopter 
the da vinci iii has a 100foot rotor made of carbon graphite 
fiber the stuff in expensive golf clubs heavyduty foam and a 
covering similar to the plastic that dry cleaners put around 
clothes 
the pilot sits in a contraption made of lightweight metal and 
balsa wood that hangs from the rotor on a swivel bicycle pedals 
rather than the levers in da vincis design operate the cal poly 
helicopter 
even at top speed the rotor moves slowly taking about six 
seconds for one rotation 
one key change from earlier helicopters was having the rotor 
support a dangling driver instead of the drivers compartment 
propping up the rotor the change shaved 35 pounds off previous 
designs 
even though this seems like an obvious solution it took years 
to come up with it said saiki 
the students hope to save more weight in the next design saiki 
said wed like to have someone other that greg mcneil be able to 
drive this thing 
mcneil is a cal poly student and member of the us olympic 
cycling team who had to pedal as if it were the final lap for the 
gold medal before the helicopter got off the ground 
even a new and improved human helicopter the students and their 
faculty adviser concede will have few if any practical 
applications but that doesnt seem to bother them as they go back 
to the drawing board 
saying this isnt practical is like telling the wright 
brothers sure you flew but you didnt make it to europe 
said the adviser engineering professor bill patterson just 
proving the skeptics wrong was enough

the ouster of romanian strongman nicolae 
ceausescu is proving to be the bloodiest phase so far in the 
revolution that has ended all six hardline communist regimes in the 
warsaw pact since the summer 
security forces loyal to ceausescu battled rebels through the 
weekend in contrast to neighboring nations where reform forces 
have come to power relatively peacefully 
the conflict was part of the heritage of ceausescus 
quartercentury rule which virtually destroyed the nations 
economic and political fabric and makes romanias future cloudier 
than those of other eastern european countries emerging from the 
darkness of dictatorship 
the fact that ceausescu is gone in itself is fantastic but we 
are not out of the woods by any means said juliana geran pilon 
who was born in romania and now directs the national forum 
foundation a conservative washington lobbying group 
when the fighting ends romania promises to be in worse shape 
than the other soviet nations 
romania more than any other of the eastern europe countries 
needs direct western help in the form of food said james brown 
a specialist on the region at the rand corp in santa monica calif 
winters can be harsh in romania which is as far north as maine 
or minnesota and the land is desperately short of food and heating 
fuel brown said 
moreover thousands of romanians reportedly died in fighting 
before and after ceausescus ouster in contrast to the nearly 
bloodless revolutions in poland east germany czechoslovakia 
bulgaria and hungary 
ceausescu was replaced by the national salvation committee 
transitional government composed of civilian and military leaders 
some of whom had fallen into disfavor or been jailed under the old 
regime 
the leading figure in the new government appeared to be former 
foreign minister corneliu manescu 73 who has been under house 
arrest in bucharest since he and seven other top communists wrote a 
highly critical letter to ceausescu last march 
another civilian in the leadership was ion iliescu who was 
ousted as secretary of the communist party central committee in 
1971 and is reputed to be a strong advocate of reforms iliescu 
attended moscow state university with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev according to ms pilon and another romanian emigre 
michael radu 
he is the closest you can get to a reformer of the gorbachev 
type in the romanian communist party said radu who is now a 
resident scholar at the foreign policy research institute a think 
tank in philadelphia 
manescu already has promised elections although it was not 
clear when or under what circumstances they would be held or who 
would run 
ceausescu eliminated not only the two former political parties 
the national liberals and the peasants but rival communists as 
well said petre nicolae a former romanian communist party member 
who emigrated in 1981 
equally pressing for the new government will be the economic 
recovery of romania which is by natural resources the richest in 
eastern europe but under ceausescu developed the worst economy 
with the lowest living standard said brown only albania a 
communist nation not allied with moscow is poorer he said 
ceausescu collectivized onceproductive romanian farms driving 
peasants into the cities to work on heavy industry which he was 
simultaneously building said radu 
romania was forced to import raw materials for its industry 
however building up a huge foreign debt that ceausescu paid off 
through austerity that forced the people to live on a 
semistarvation diet with inadequate heating oil and 
electricity said radu 
another rock may lie hidden on romanias course to recovery 
said brown and pilon the population of the neighboring soviet 
republic of moldavia is composed 65 percent of ethnic romanians 
and the republic one of 15 in the soviet union was seized by the 
soviet union in one of the nazistalin pacts at the dawn of world 
war ii 
any popular movement to reunite romania and moldavia could cause 
friction with the soviet union 
romania is the last domino to fall of the soviets east 
european allies said brown the demise of ceausescu means that 
all of eastern europe is farther along on the path to democracy 
than the soviet union 
that could inspire ethnic groups in the soviet union to increase 
their campaigns for greater freedom 
the leaders of the national front in moldavia have been rather 
shy of seeking to rejoin romania as long as ceausescu was alive 
but the greater freedom in romania may embolden them and that 
will present a problem for the integrity of the soviet union 
said brown 
for the time being however any new regime that emerges in 
bucharest will have other things on its mind

the day before christmas panama city 
sits in a pile of its own wreckage where a week earlier christmas 
lights glittered sunlight now shimmers off glass shards in 
shattered shop windows 
more people than usual walk about with bandaged hands three 
more looting days until christmas one visitor observed 
christmas music still filters from a few homes in this mostly 
roman catholic country but with shops looted bare and no new 
supplies imminent monday will be just another hungry day for most 
people here 
at night there is the occasional hollow thump of mortar fire a 
spark ignites against the sky and a flare lights up the tropical 
dark swaying lazily on a parachute invisible from the ground 
it fades away leaving a puff of white smoke

driving from place to place involves negotiating roadblocks set 
up every few hundred feet in some neighborhoods by armed residents 
protecting their property 
there are piles of tree limbs old oil barrels broken furniture 
and miscellaneous rubbish and in several places christmas trees 
there is so much rubbish that driving even short distances 
frequently results in a flat

there are a few hints of christmas left in the capital but they 
are tattered 
these days white flags flutter from antennas of the few 
vehicles still on the usually snarled streets 
at a destroyed police station in the former panama canal zone 
cardboard cutouts of two of the three kings still stand the third

how much to fill the tank asked one driver

when the phone rang the other day in joe 
shanahans office he wasnt surprised to find an aide to sen 
lloyd bentsen on the line looking to trade gossip about a 
political consultant 
i have a lot of newfound friends in bentsens office said 
shanahan spokesman for the iowa democratic party 
bentsen the texas senator who was the democrats vice 
presidential nominee in 1988 isnt the only prominent democrat 
keeping tabs on iowa the state with the first caucuses in the 
presidential sweepstakes 
those mulling a run for the white house in 1992 or consultants 
looking to align themselves with a presidential campaign are 
keeping an eye on 1990 elections in iowa which has tough contests 
for governor and senate 
anybody who is looking down the road to 1992 has a good reason 
to visit the state said phil roeder political director for 
democratic sen tom harkin who is being challenged next year by 
republican rep tom tauke 
indeed many potential 1992 democratic candidates have been 
stopping in iowa of late 
new jersey sen bill bradley came to raise money for harkin and 
activists on hand said there was some informal talk about the 
possibility of a bradley presidential bid 
bentsen was the featured speaker at the state democratic partys 
annual fundraiser this past fall denying any interest in running 
for president in 1992 but nonetheless taking time to talk to 
reporters about his ideas for national election strategy 
house majority leader richard gephardt winner of the 1988 iowa 
caucuses visited recently and jesse jackson was on hand the day 
after the last election and since to speak at a funeral 
those people have been out here under the auspices of helping 
the democratic party said shanahan you can read whatever you 
want into that but were glad theyre here 
and although president bush is expected to be unopposed for the 
republican nomination should he seek reelection democrats havent 
had the state to themselves 
texas sen phil gramm and television evangelist pat robertson 
an unsuccessful 1988 gop presidential candidate who finished second 
in iowa last year behind sen bob dole have dropped in for quick 
visits fueling speculation they might be looking down the road to 
1996 
iowa political operatives arent surprised at the early 
attention presidential candidates who have done well here often 
began their caucus campaigns a year or more before the vote 
said roeder 
if we get by with 12 to 15 hours of down time between the 1990 
elections and the beginning of the 1992 caucuses that will be a 
pretty liberal amount of time

about 200 deputies stormed out of the soviet 
congress on sunday to protest a defense of the armys brutal 
crackdown on ethnic unrest in the republic of georgia it took a 
personal appeal by president mikhail s gorbachev to bring them 
back 
the discussion also implicated conservative politburo member 
yegor k ligachev in the decision to send troops against georgian 
protesters in april nineteen protesters died when soldiers armed 
with shovels clubs and gas charged them another person was shot 
to death later for violating a curfew 
delegates condemned those violent tactics on sunday 
georgians balts progressive deputies and others left the hall 
to protest a speech by the chief military prosecutor alexander 
katusev who defended the soviet troops 
katusevs speech followed a congressional commissions report 
blaming the army local party leadership and ligachev for the 
incident 
ligachev chaired a meeting of top party leaders two days before 
the clash that decided to back georgian party leaders request for 
military help in breaking up the longrunning protest commission 
chairman anatoly sobchak said 
sobchak read a letter from ligachev admitting that when the 
leadership discussed the protest in the georgian capital tbilisi 
interior and defense ministry officials were informed of the need 
to provide forces and means in case of dangerous and 
lifethreatening events 
but ligachev said in the letter he went on vacation the next day 
and only learned the extent of the violence from a television 
report afterward 
if some leader makes a decision id like to say he bears 
responsibility for that decision whether he finds out about its 
results on television or in his office sobchak said 
the georgians and other deputies left the 2250member congress 
of peoples deputies after katusev portrayed the georgian 
proindependence protesters as armed subversives who provoked the 
violence 
minutes later gorbachev surrounded by security men and 
reporters emerged into the lobby and sought out the georgian 
delegates some of them in tears near the cloakroom 
why are they persecuting the georgian people a georgian 
teacher natella bokuchava asked gorbachev defend us our 
children are watching us 
gorbachev soothed the georgians with general remarks about 
ethnic tolerance and after they returned to the hall he made a 
conciliatory speech assuring them of the high respect of the 
congress and the country 
congress later passed a resolution condemning the use of 
violence against the georgian protesters 
historian yuri afanasyev a leader of a fledgling opposition 
group said he thought the walkout illustrated the further 
consolidation of democratic forces 
several dozen baltic deputies have walked out of the congress 
occasionally to protest their helplessness as a vastly outnumbered 
minority but this was by far the largest walkout since the 
congress opened its first session in may 
in other action on the last day of its 12day session congress 
followed the lead of gorbachev and foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze in condemning the kremlins decision to send soviet 
troops into afghanistan 10 years ago the panel that examined the 
decision said only four people were involved all of them now dead 
thenleader leonid brezhnev defense minister dmitri ustinov 
foreign minister andrei gromyko and kgb chief yuri andropov one 
deputy proposed the commission consider stripping all privileges 
from their widows and families 
was told that the health ministrys network of hospitals and 
sanitariums reserved for the top party and government elite would 
be abolished and given to the public by jan 1 yevgeny primakov 
head of the panel on privileges also said the number of country 
houses and cars used by officials would be cut 
passed a resolution condemning the 1939 sovietnazi pact that 
led to the parceling up of much of eastern europe including the 
baltic states 
legislatures in the baltic republics have already condemned the 
pact

gen manuel antonio noriega allegedly 
earned millions helping colombias cocaine lords launder drug 
profits but if thats true he didnt put too much of it into his 
house 
compared to the extravagant mansions customary among latin 
american dictators the noriega house is modest a twostory 
affair in a neat upper middleclass neighborhood its walls are 
painted white and topped by a red tile roof classic tropical 
architecture 
he would only say hello very respectfully said german 
sanchez 53 who was the military leaders nextdoor neighbor 16 
years but was never formally introduced to him 
you may think what you like of noriega but we cant say he 
was anything but respectful toward his neighbors he said 
sanchezs house is between noriegas and a smaller house on a 
corner that noriega also owned the servants and guests stayed 
there sanchez said 
reporters allowed into the house saturday did not find any 
evidence of voodoo or black magic which noriega was rumored to 
have practiced 
but the general apparently admired napoleon bonaparte and hung 
two pictures of the french emperor in his secondstory study 
the house wraps around three sides of a 45squarefoot courtyard 
where a stone fountain was bubbling water 
a small room had been converted into a chapel a sixfoot 
crucifix hung on a wall behind an altar an oil painting of st 
george slaying the dragon hung on another wall 
noriega seemed to be in the christmas spirit an eightfoot 
christmas tree trimmed with stuffed dolls and other adornments 
stood in a back terrace next to a manger 
about two dozen cardboard boxes and black plastic garbage bags 
were stuffed with toys games and gifts for children 
us troops stormed the noriega family home wednesday using 
stun grenades that shattered glass jalousies and handpainted vases 
and flowerpots 
all the windows in noriegas bedroom were blown away as was 
most of the ceiling over his kingsize bed 
one of two walkin closets held a combination safe and a locked 
metal strongbox the safe was open and empty with two plastic bags 
of dehumidifying crystals inside a bullet destroyed the keyhole of 
the metal cabinet 
a us soldier assigned to guard the house picked up a wooden 
plaque with battalion 2000 painted on it that is the elite 
unit noriega named in honor of the year panama is to take over the 
panama canal 
it is not clear how much noriega used the house recently he was 
reportedly sleeping in different locations every night fearing 
coup attempts little is known of his personal life 
sanchez a lawyer and member of the board of directors of the 
panamanian chamber of commerce said he had just arrived home from 
a cocktail party early wednesday when the us attack began 
about five minutes before that two small cars with armed men 
inside rode up to the house and then everybody left right away 
sanchez said

theres no christmas tree to brighten jesse 
crabtrees living room and the disabled coal miner has no holiday 
cheer this season 
he says why get a tree if we dont have any gifts to put 
under it said crabtrees wife edith 
crabtree 68 suffers from black lung disease caused by 
breathing coal dust and has been hospitalized for two heart 
attacks and prostate gland surgery he also was hurt in a 1976 
mining accident and now spends his retirement money on medicine 
rather than christmas 
now jesse just sits there in the bedroom day in and day out 
looking out the window thats his life mrs crabtree said 
crabtree blamed their economic plight on the bitter battle 
between the united mine workers and the pittston coal group inc a 
union poster is taped to the wall near his bed 
nearly 1700 miners struck pittstons coal subsidiary in 
virginia west virginia and kentucky on april 5 after working 14 
months without a contract the walkout was prompted by pittstons 
refusal to participate in an industry agreement on how to fund 
costly miners retirement and health plans 
the umw and pittston failed saturday in a lastditch effort to 
reach a prechristmas settlement negotiations recessed with an 
agreement that both sides would return to the bargaining table 
wednesday 
mrs crabtree said she and her husband get 911 a month through 
retirement benefits and black lung program payments their mortgage 
and medical bills alone exceed that 
were making it from hand to mouth were poor but were 
proud mrs crabtree said we had a little bit of savings put 
away 
for a while the couples christmas dinner was uncertain 
i dont even know if im going to have a turkey or a ham 
mrs crabtree said just before the president of a umw local arrived 
with a 15pound turkey 
she said she needed a turkey for christmas i told her it 
would be no trouble said bethel purkey from umw local 5815 
crabtree is upset pittston changed its pensioner health policy 
after the old contract ran out the policy began providing 80 
percent coverage after a 200 deductible it had been 100 percent 
pittston owes him and should pay his medical bills they are 
the ones that caused his problems his wife said 
pittston spokeswoman susan copeland said 80 percent coverage is 
a nationwide standard 
cheryl van tilburg a spokeswoman for blue crossblue shield in 
chicago the nations largest health insurer said 8020 is 
definitely the norm for group coverage 
crabtree a union miner for more than 37 years also is upset 
the umw worked for pittston for 14 months without a contract he 
said its possible the company would have continued full coverage 
for pensioners if a contract had been reached 
if they had gone on strike then theyd have a contract now 
crabtree said no contract no work if a fellow strike breaker 
wanted to go on in you keep him from going you cant have anyone 
going in while others are staying out 
mrs crabtree said a 100 percent health plan would give her one 
less thing to worry about 
im 4 feet 11 inches tall hes 230some pounds and i handle 
him alone she said i take him to the doctor alone pull the 
car up to the garage dont ask me how i do it 
one way she does it is by letting christmas pass virtually 
unnoticed 
he needs me and he knows ill be there mrs crabtree said 
mister ill never let him down

did it seem like a script for a movie former 
president reagan showed up on the southern cal practice field for a 
pep talk and a short but snappy pass with the rose bowlbound 
trojan squad 
win one for the gipper reagan said repeating pat obriens 
line from the 1940 film knute rockneall american in which 
reagan starred as the doomed george gipp 
reagan wearing blue jeans a checked shirt open at the collar 
and track shoes spent about 20 minutes saturday chatting at the 
50yard line with the players 
reagan who was a right guard in college for the eureka golden 
tornadoes has shed his presidential neutrality since leaving 
office and is a big trojans fan coach larry smith said 
hes in southern california now so hes a fan of the southern 
california football team said smith whose squad will meet the 
michigan wolverines in pasadena for the jan 1 rose bowl game 
reagan was asked to throw a football to uscs top receiver john 
jackson who ran about 10 yards and cut to his right 
i think at my age you better keep it a very short pattern 
said reagan 78 as he cocked and fired a bullet right into 
jacksons grip 
ill take him jackson 22 later said hes got a nice 
tight spiral 
reagan was presented with a largesized cardinal and 
goldcolored sweatsuit and he slapped highfives with the 
players and crouched on one knee for a team photo 
then he strolled off 
everybodys familiar with the president but few get to catch 
a pass from him jackson said im going to go call my mom

sting says the idea that rock n roll music is 
rebellious is totally dead 
it has the semblance of rebellion but all these bands with 
their long hair wearing their sisters clothes and playing heavy 
metal music they strike me as being very close to las vegas 
bands he told street news a newspaper sold by the homeless for 
its january edition 
theyre not rebellious at all theyre conforming to very 
obvious norms and im not particularly impressed by that i just 
dont think rock and roll is dangerous at all its everywhere on 
all the airwaves day and night theres nothing new or unusual 
about it he said 
the 38yearold musician left his band the police after it 
became one of the most popular groups 
sting says it doesnt always make sense even to him that he is 
starring in 3 penny opera a broadway musical closing at the 
end of the year 
from a commercial point of view theres no benefit whatsoever 
for anybody its just a way of saying i want to try something 
else he said what i try to do in my life is kind of throw 
curves all the time

the dramatic events of 1989 so many of them events about freedom 
democray mans quest to determine his own destiny 
you know chancellor kohl of germany called me just after the 
berlin wall came down and he told me that this incredible event 
could not have occurred without americas resolve demonstrated in 
europe and around the world over the last 40 years you the men 
and women of our armed forces you are the embodiment of americas 
resolve 
i have talked with you before tonight during this past year at 
elmendorf or rhein main and pease and on the landing decks of 
the america and the forrestal or the bridge of the belknap and 
seen first hand the job you do for our country and ive seen you 
at the times when america remembers her fallen sons and daughters 
at the cemetery in nettuno italy last may at the iwo jima 
memorial in june or at the texas vietnam memorial just last month 
and finally ive been with you when we must share our grief for 
those more recently lost in defense of freedom in april with the 
men behind the guns of the proud battleship iowa 
now brave americans have died again in combat just last week 
in panama as in every other such test in our history americans 
put their lives on the line for the basic values of liberty and 
decency on which our nation is founded 
our hearts and those of every american go out to the families of 
those who fell to all those who mourn a husband a son a brother 
a father or a friend i can only offer the thanks of a grateful 
nation your loved ones served a noble and just cause with honor 
and distinction 
not long ago i shook the hand of a woman who had lost two sons 
in war shed said that it would be an honor to shake the hand of 
the president of the united states but in truth i was the one 
honored to shake her hand for it is she and millions of other 
mothers and fathers daughters and sons whose decency service 
and courage embody the spirit of america 
wherever you are whatever your rank or branch of service i 
want you to remember something about america we are a people with 
the endurance to work day and night for peaceful solutions when we

when we must general noriega is the latest one to learn that 
lesson 
it is christmas eve fortyfive years ago to this very day i 
arrived home from the pacific history has long since passed 
judgment on those years of conflict but that war did not end all 
wars and today we still live in times of great challenge and 
there are still times when america must sacrifice in the cause of 
peace 
years from now let it be said that america used her strength 
for good and let it be known that she honored her defenders of 
freedom

hearts and wallets opened all over the world for 
the embattled romanian people sunday and the united states and 
france said they would not oppose soviet bloc military intervention 
the international red cross led new efforts to send in food and 
medical aid but fighting prevented most relief flights from 
landing in bucharest and many convoys were stalled at the borders 
france said it was willing to help muster a brigade of 
volunteers if asked to aid romanians fighting security forces 
loyal to ousted dictator nicolae ceausescu 
foreign minister roland dumas said on radio station rtl that he 
told soviet officials if moscow decided to intervene france not 
only would not object to it but would support this action 
us secretary of state james baker iii said in a television 
interview that the romanians were fighting a repressive 
dictatorship so i think that we would be inclined probably to 
follow the lead follow the example of france who today has said 
that if the warsaw pact felt it necessary to intervene on behalf of 
the opposition that it would support that 
the dutch government said military intervention would support 
the aspirations of the romanian people but it recognized the 
enormous dilemma over the issue given the bitter memories of 
past soviet interventions in east bloc countries 
but soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov on saturday all but ruled out 
military soviet intervention moscow has mobilized humanitarian 
aid and the soviet news agency tass reported sunday that trains 
were massing on the sovietromanian border with medical supplies 
food and clothes 
hungarian radio said 250 trucks and an equal number of cars 
loaded with medicine bandages and food reached romania from 
neighboring hungary but that little was getting through the 
countrys other borders 
an east german aircraft carrying medical supplies landed at an 
unidentified romanian airport sunday the east german news agency 
adn reported 
public collections went up in virtually every country of eastern 
and western europe 
in sofia the bulgarian capital communist party officials 
donated party membership fees for the month of december to 
suffering romanian families 
the british red cross said it collected 80000 in just 24 hours 
sweden pledged 31 million in assistance 
the portuguese red cross said it collected donations over the 
weekend and would send 30 aid workers with a planeload of food and 
medicine to romania 
queen margrethe ii of denmark decided to return decorations she 
received from ceausescu news reports said on friday britains 
queen elizabeth ii stripped ceausescu of his honorary knighthood 
in tripoli libya students marched in support for and 
solidarity with the romanian peoples revolution the official 
news agency jana said 
they handed a petition to the romanian embassy saying events in 
romania show the falsehood and failure of the goverment idea 
parties the tyranny and oppression as well as dictatorship jana 
said 
grigor gysi the east german communist leader welcomed the 
ceausescu governments ouster saying in a statement carried by 
adn its monstrous antihuman terrorism slaughter and bloodshed 
prove once again that the regime of the ceausescu clan has nothing 
absolutely nothing to do with socialism 
at least 23 romanian embassies switched allegiance to the new 
provisional government and three states recognized the national 
salvation committee that claimed to control romania 
romanias first deputy prime minister gheorghe oprea who was 
in turkey on an official visit when ceausescu was toppled told 
reporters in istanbul saturday night that he rejoiced in romanias 
liberation 
as a romanian citizen i will do everything i can for my 
country i support the freedom movement and will return to my 
country to fight and work for the success of the new system the 
anatolia news agency quoted him as saying 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie spiritual leader of the 
church of england and head of the 70 million member anglican 
communion asked all congregations to pray for the romanian people 
at christmas services 
prince carol of romania halfbrother of king michael of romania 
who lives in switzerland was in the congregation at a special 
service for londons romanian community at the russian orthodox 
church in kensington 
we are here to remember those who have fallen he said 
it hurt me to see the pictures of violence coming out of 
romania where they are trying to get rid of a madman who is only 
there for his own benefit 
in hong kong hundreds of people put wreaths in a downtown park 
on saturday to mourn romanias dead and held a candlelit rally 
the genevabased international committee of the red cross said 
an eightmember team that flew to bucharest on friday night 
remained trapped in the airport vicinity with four tons of urgently 
neeeded medical supplies spokesman joerg bischof said members have 
cared for at least 600 wounded civilians and military since their 
arrival 
on christmas day a dc10 chartered by the netherlands red cross 
was to stop over at geneva to pick up 60 tons of medical supplies 
provided by the swiss red cross 
the french government sent two planeloads of medical supplies 
and emergency medical teams to romania

in this northern city rejoicing that 
the rat ceausescu had fallen was tinged with fear rumors of 
retribution and an almost crazed desire to talk after 24 years of 
dictatorship 
oradea about 10 miles from the hungarian border saw no 
fighting in the revolution that toppled the countrys autocratic 
leader nicolae ceausescu 
revelers with a foot on the gas pedal and hands on the horn 
honked and screamed their joy as they careened down streets in a 
wild outburst of euphoria 
in the local city hall a group of intellectuals communists who 
fell from ceausescus favor and students was in session 
continuously from friday when word of the dictators fall in 
bucharest reached oradea about 300 miles northwest 
thousands of people milled outside listening to speaker after 
speaker grab a microphone to repeat how bad the old regime was 
proclaim the new freedom and and urge everyone to remain vigilant 
but jubilation was tempered with the creeping fear that the 
dreaded securitate secret police forces loyal to ceausescu would 
attack the city of 198000 
in oradea hospital there were no wounded in fact there 
seemed to be no patients at all but scores of soldiers 
outnumbered hospital staff manning windows and exits in case the 
securitate arrived 
a nurse said people were afraid even to enter the hospital after 
hearing that ceausescu forces had entered a hospital in another 
city and shot the wounded as they lay in bed 
residents throughout the region warned visitors against picking 
up hitchhikers they might be security men dressed in dirty clothes 
trying to move west toward the hungarian border they claimed they 
will leave unpinned grenades in your car they warned 
the fear swirled everywhere amid the small joys such as eggs 
being available for the first time in weeks 
on the road toward cluj a truck driver stopped his windshield 
shot through by a bullet dont go on he warned theres fighting 
he heard that a car had sped down a main street in cluj with 
plainclothes men shooting indiscriminately from its window twelve 
people died he heard 
tyrant and rat were the only words anybody used for 
ceausescu here 
the rat is finished the crowd yelled outside city hall 
saturday timisoara bucharest they chanted honoring the two 
cities where thousands of people died in the revolt 
toekes toekes was another chant in honor of laszlo 
toekes the ethnic hungarian pastor whose attempted arrest dec 15 
sparked the revolt 
the privations ceausescu imposed on his people while himself 
living in opulent homes were evident in oradeas sparse food stores 
one large shop saturday had virtually nothing but shelves and 
shelves of jam of uncertain vintage 
crowds of ethnic hungarians gathered around two visitors from 
hungary after almost 25 years of dictatorship it was as if the 
floodgates had opened for them 
you know they dont let kids speak hungarian in the schools 
yelled one man 
such discrimination has been well known and publicized for years 
in hungary but this crowd chronicled it regardless talking as if 
everybody in the outside world knew nothing of romania because they 
themselves had been kept silent for years 
only younger ethnic hungarians voiced any hope that the revolt 
would mend torn relations between their community and ethnic 
romanians 
dezsoe kovacs a man in his 60s recounted years of humiliation 
imposed not only by authorities but also ordinary romanians he 
was never promoted from his job as a factory engineer he said 
while much less qualified romanians climbed the career ladder 
the area used to be almost 100 percent ethnic hungarian now it 
is only 33 percent 
dozens of people besieged troops and civilian guards protecting 
city hall entrances one who identified herself as julia sz 
wanted only one thing her husband 
in august she said the couple tried to flee across the border 
to hungary with their four children aged four to 10 they were 
caught 
at securitate headquarters she said she and her husband were 
severely beaten as their weeping children watched her husband was 
hauled off to jail and she wants him back 
that she said would make this the most beautiful 
christmas ever

labyrinth of safe houses and tunnels used by police forces loyal to

airports communist party headquarters and ceausescus palace in 
downtown bucharest 
army units siding with proreform protesters have been battling 
ceausescus secret police for control of the country the highly 
trained and heavily armed security forces have been making 
hitandrun guerrilla attacks mostly at night 
the radio report went into stunning detail about the hundreds of 
safe houses and miles upon miles of underground tunnels stuffed 
with weapons 
ceausescus downtown palace contained a bunker designed to 
resist nuclear attack and was outfitted like a war room with 
sophisticated command operations the radio said 
the tunnels also linked his socalled spring palace in the 
north of the capital and the old royal palace downtown near the 
party headquarters the radio said 
one tunnel from the party headquarters ran to a lake north of

who ruled for 24 years was captured saturday along with his wife 
elena on sunday staterun soviet television reported that the 
couple was found hiding in an underground bunker it gave no

the tunnels contained huge weapons caches and were designed for 
ceausescus most loyal security troops the radio said 
romanian radio broadcasts monitored in vienna have appealed 
repeatedly in recent days to architects involved in building the 
web of tunnels to divulge the layout to the army and other forces 
behind the revolt

in the capital and in all major cities but few imagined their size 
and scope

fire from the army retreated to cemeteries where they had hideouts 
among burial vaults and entrances to the tunnels

the revolutionary government pleaded 
for peace on christmas eve as soldiers and citizens waged a savage 
war in the streets with secret police loyal to ousted dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
sniper fire paralyzed the capital and bodies piled up in 
morgues as anarchy seemed to grip this nation struggling to break a 
quartercentury of stalinist rule 
the embattled revolutionary government issued a ceasefire call 
in a bid to disarm not only proceausescu secret police but 
vigilante groups that plucked weapons from dead soldiers and sought 
personal revenge against the fallen regimes supporters 
a few families carried freshly cut christmas trees through the 
capital during a morning lull in the fighting but sniper fire by 
proceausescu forces quickly cleared the streets 
secret police infiltrated the television station building 
headquarters of the revolutionary governing coalition and three 
people were reported killed before army units subdued the attackers 
fighting between secret police and soldiers backing the revolt 
continued in the capital but the army appeared to be winning in 
the western city of timisoara where the revolt began a week ago 
four western journalists including associated press correspondent 
john daniszewski were shot and wounded there over the weekend 
romanian radio said secret police used scores of secret safe 
houses and vast networks of tunnels in bucharest and in timisoara 
to store weapons and launch attacks 
ceausescus downtown palace was connected to the maze of tunnels 
and contained a bunker designed to resist nuclear attack bucharest 
radio said 
the revolutionary government said the communist dictator who 
ruled for 24 years was captured saturday along with his wife 
elena soviet television said they were found hiding in an 
underground bunker 
his son nicu was reported arrested friday and on sunday a 
daughter zoiaelena appeared dazed as she was shown on romanian 
television after she was caught at one of her bucharest apartments 
the television also showed jewelry and cash it said totaled 
nearly 100000 in us currency that was allegedly seized from the 
family ordinary romanians are not allowed to hold foreign currency 
the bush administration and the french government both said they 
would not object if the soviets or other warsaw pact nations use 
their militaries to assist the revolution in romania 
thousands of people were believed killed as ceausescu tried to 
stop the massive protests that began on dec 15 in timisoara 300 
miles southwest of bucharest the protests spread to the capital 
forcing ceausescu to flee his palace friday 
since then army units backing the revolt have battled the elite 
secret police and security forces loyal to ceausescu hundreds and 
perhaps thousands have died 
offers of emergency aid poured in from around the world but 
east bloc media said few supplies were able to get through because 
of the fighting some of the worst street battles europe has seen 
since world war ii 
ceausescus secret police and security guards are essentially 
fighting for their lives against the revolutionaries who have 
vowed revenge for the massacres of unarmed citizens during the 
protests 
the us embassy in bucharest on sunday evacuated dependents and 
some staff members in a convoy to sofia bulgaria said spokesman 
agi kuperman 
the british ambassadors residence in bucharest was set on fire 
saturday night and burned until sunday morning

christmas eve looking for lost loved ones victims included a 
pregnant woman 
it is horrible murder said dr stepshan miliesescu he said 
victims came in with single shots to the head from welltrained 
snipers 
doctors had to sedate and strap down one security guard who 
raved that the revolution had upset ceausescus socialist paradise 
several heard him repeat you are criminals and we will kill 
you all 
ceausescu was the lone east bloc leader to resist a wave of 
democratic reforms sweeping the region he imposed harsh austerity 
programs rationing and other hardships on the nations 23 million 
people to pay off the nations 11 billion foreign debt 
the national salvation committee said in was in control of the 
nation and pledged in a communique sunday that the courts would 
mete out punishments of the greatest severity to the dictator 
and his former lackeys 
ion iliescu a leading figure in the committee appealed for 
unity 
may the first free new year bring to romania together with 
the joy of liberation the quiet and calm enabling us to assume all 
the responsibilities of a people asserting its dignity he said 
the group called for a ceasefire and urged civilians and 
proceausescu forces to disarm by 5 pm christmas day people who 
violate it will receive the strictest punishment 
in timisoara the yugoslav news agency tanjug reported that

terrorists said national salvation committee spokesman stephan 
andreescu 
these forces are trying to escape and are extremely 
dangerous andreescu said of the secret police but he claimed 
the army was in complete control of the situation in the 
country 
the terrorists are believed to be hiding in the subway and in 
secret underground passages below the former presidential palace 
andreescu said it will take days before it is all over 
the doctors at bucharest emergency hospital said proceausescu 
forces were holed up in secret apartments firing at targets in the 
street the army could not respond with heavy weapons without 
blasting neighboring apartments 
they are fighting like hitlers people at the end of world war 
ii just to kill in desperation said a romanian news agency 
editor who did not want to be identified 
they killed thousands and thousands of people he said 
recounting the last years of ceausescu they killed young people 
children you cannot imagine how awful it was we must write about

state supreme court justice louis peck 
turned 71 on sunday putting him a year beyond the state 
constitutions retirement age for judges but he still sits on the 
bench making decisions and waging his battle against a rule he 
says is age discrimination 
pecks case which goes before a federal appeals court next 
week pits him against the state of vermont which argues that a 
federal antidiscrimination law cannot supersede a states power to 
choose its judges on his side are others who believe that people 
should be judged on their ability not on the calendar 
the right of an able person to work regardless of his or her 
age is among the most basic in our society the american 
association of retired persons which has more than 30 million 
members said in its legal brief siding with peck 
it is the people of each state who establish the states 
judiciary the state of new mexico countered in a brief filed on 
the side of vermont 
peck won the first round of his case last july when a federal 
judge also 70 ruled that the federal agediscrimination law 
protects appointed state judges but federal judges in neighboring 
massachusetts have ruled the other way 
the federal law exempts elected officials and top appointed 
policymakers but does not specify whether appointed judges fit in 
the latter category 
the state has appealed the ruling favoring peck to the 2nd us 
circuit court of appeals oral arguments are scheduled for jan 5 
in new york 
peck who was appointed to the bench in 1981 said he never 
expected his fight to attract such attention and has said he would 
consider retiring after proving his point in court 
when this first started i didnt want any publicity i just 
wanted this to be settled quietly he said recently i must 
admit the publicity it has received has stimulated my own interest 
in the case and my determination to see it through 
under the vermont constitution peck should have retired last 
dec 31 at the end of the year in which he turned 70 but he 
stayed on refusing an order to step down 
the state attorney general sided with peck but a series of 
rulings in federal judges in neighboring massachusetts supported a 
states right to impose mandatory retirement on state judges the 
state court administrator placed peck on retirement status 
effective june 30 
peck filed an age discrimination charge with the federal equal 
employment opportunity commission challenging the retirement order 
the eeoc picked up pecks case and filed a complaint in federal 
court that resulted in the ruling in favor of peck last july 
the states rights argument however found favor with the 1st 
us circuit court of appeals in a ruling on massachusetts 
mandatory retirement provision the court ruled it could not find 
a sufficiently clear statement by congress that it intended to 
overrule the clear intent of the people of a state in an area 
intimately and fundamentally related to that states 
selfgovernance 
the 1st circuit ruling has meant judges in massachusetts must 
retire at age 70 
with the conflicting rulings lawyers on both sides are eager to 
see a decision by the us supreme court 
i think thats what we hope for said peck until we get 
that you are going to have courts ruling different ways 
rep peter smith a vermont republican has introduced 
legislation designed to amend the age discrimination in employment 
act to clarify that appointed state judges are covered under the 
act 
his bill if enacted would not be retroactive

elena ceausescu often was praised as 
the best mother of romania and a scientist of world fame 
insiders say she was illeducated arrogant had a taste for 
furs and expensive jewelry and referred to ordinary romanians as 
worms 
official biographies even shaved two years off her age to make 
her one year younger than her husband nicolae ceausescu mrs 
ceausescu actually is 72 a year older than the deposed dictator 
a member of the politburo and the virtual secondincommand of 
the country she was one of the dozens of ceausescu relatives who 
held influential positions in the government she often was at 
ceausescus side in public 
they acted much like a royal family traveling together abroad 
conducting wellstaged visits to farms and factories and making a 
regal promenade to greet linedup guests at state receptions 
mrs ceausescu was said to be a trained chemist and works by 
her filled romanian bookstores and were translated into foreign 
languages but they were believed to be ghostwritten by other 
scientists 
gen ion pacepa chief of romanian intelligence operations 
abroad until 1978 when he defected to the united states said in a 
book published last year that among his duties was to collect 
classified technological information to be used in the books by 
mrs ceausescu 
as chairman of the national council for science and education 
mrs ceausescu was in charge of all curricula from elementary 
schools to higher education 
the marxist indoctrination and the official adulation amounting 
to public worship of the ceausescus have poisoned the soul and 
mind of our children and deprived them of the genuine values of 
romanian and universal culture bucharest radio quoted a romanian 
writer as saying sunday 
official biographies listed mrs ceausescu as being born in 
1919 in fact she was born in petresti a village in southern 
romania in 1917 
she met and married her husband when both were teenage 
revolutionaries 
her celebrated competence in science was less than genuine 
during her time as director of the central institute of chemical 
research she took the floor at several national conferences and 
meetings but spoke on general matters whenever a specific 
scientific theme arose she deferred to a comrade engineer who 
then had to explain the details 
she joined the communist party in 1937 in bucharest where she 
worked in a textile factory 
after ceausescus takeover in 1965 she rapidly rose in the 
party hierarchy she was named a member of the party executive 
committee in 1973 and also was a member of the politburo and first 
vice premier 
she once was elected queen of a workers parade on may 1 
1939 and mrs ceausescu lived like one once she and her husband 
ruled romania 
pacepa said he was ordered to ensure mrs ceausescu could shop 
for jewelry whenever she wanted 
he also said he reported to her once a week with tapes secretly 
recorded at the residences of their children two sons and a 
daughter and other high officials so she could keep tabs on them 
romanian tv on sunday showed footage from one of ceausescus 
residences displaying some of her jewelry and western currency 
allegedly prepared in a bag for escape 
they had a mountain retreat in the carpathians a villa at the 
black se resort of neptune and a marblefloored mansion by a lake 
on the outskirts of bucharest at the time of the uprising work 
was being completed on the huge presidential palace 
one of her many expensive fur coats was found at the communist 
party headquarters friday and paraded in front of photographers 
after she and her husband fled the capital by helicopter they are 
both in detention and awaiting trial 
sources close to her entourage said she was cynical and paid no 
attention to the real needs of the 23 million romanians whom she 
despised 
the worms never get satisfied regardless of how much food you 
give them she was once overheard saying referring to their 
complaints about food shortages that have plagued romania for a 
decade

under international law embassies are sacrosanct ground an 
embassys territory belongs to the country it represents not to 
the country where it is situated forces from the outside cannot 
legally enter embassy territory to seize a person the embassy wants 
to shelter 
but an embassys right to grant sanctuary to someone does not 
mean that person has a right to free passage out of the country a 
refugee may have to wait inside the embassy for years until 
political conditions permit his departure 
gen manuel antonio noriega took refuge sunday in the papal 
nunciate or vatican embassy in panama city and asked for 
political asylum it was not clear what action the vatican would 
take 
in june chinese dissident fang lizhi took refuge inside the 
us embassy in beijing although talks since then between us and 
chinese officials have reportedly touched on fangs case he 
remains holed up in the embassy liable to arrest if he comes out 
 
perhaps the longest instance of political refuge in an embassy 
involved hungarian cardinal josef mindszenty who hid for 15 years 
at the us embassy in budapest he was arrested by hungarys 
communist rulers in 1948 as an enemy of communism and sentenced to 
life in prison 
hungarian revolutionaries freed him during the 1956 uprising 
but mindszenty took refuge in the us mission in budapest after 
warsaw pact forces crushed the revolt he lived there until the 
vatican arranged for his release to the west in 1971 
elsewhere in the east bloc seven pentecostalists claiming 
religious persecution lived for five years in a cramped room at the 
us embassy in moscow leaving in 1983 
 
thousands of east germans seeking to go west took refuge in 
various west german embassies in september leading to a 
prodemocracy campaign that forced the lifting of travel 
restrictions toppled the communist government and ultimately 
spread across the east bloc 
the largest number of people to seek refuge at a foreign embassy 
at once may have been in cuba in april 1980 when 10000 cubans 
entered the grounds of the peruvian embassy seeking to emigrate 
cuban authorities finally persuaded the crowd to go home and 
eventually almost all of them received exit visas 
in 1973 after salvador allende was overthrown as president of 
chile and died in a battle in the presidential palace his widow 
and her children received refuge in the mexican embassy in 
santiago the mexican government then flew them out of the country 
in south africa some 20 prisoners and antiapartheid activists 
have taken refuge in the us british west german and dutch 
diplomatic missions in recent years most were eventually allowed 
to go free with south african government assurances that they 
would not be punished

gen manuel antonio noriega was a 
shrewd and ruthless survivor and it was often said that he would 
prefer death to losing power 
even after us troops invaded panama last week he broadcast a 
defiant message from hiding vowing to win or die not one step 
back 
on sunday noriega came out of hiding and sought political 
asylum at the vatican embassy in panama city 
during his tenure as ruler of panama he eliminated political 
opposition nullified the may 7 elections when they were going 
against him and repeatedly defied the united states which indicted 
him on drug trafficking charges in february 1988 
in a speech after the indictments in floria noriega brandished 
a machete above his head and slammed it down on the podium again 
using the phrase not one step back 
it had long been known that tony noriega enjoyed a crisis 
and it was widely said he would prefer death to losing power he 
reveled in thumbing his nose at the united states which he called 
the colossus of the north 
noriega who comes from el chorrillo the panama city district 
where the panamanian defense forces headquarters is located 
created a mystique that won him the nickname the man the 
english word his initials spell 
noriega wrapped himself in nationalism saying it was part of 
the historic mission of his generation to take control of the 
panama canal under an accord with the united states panama is to 
take over the canal by the year 2000 noriega claimed his enemies 
were plotting to abrogate the canal pact 
he said washington wanted to oust him to make it easier for the 
united states to renege on the canal treaties 
on oct 3 elements of the 15000man defense forces he 
commanded rebelled and claimed they had deposed him but troops 
loyal to him suppressed the rebellion and he personally accepted 
the rebels surrender 
during his last crisis in may after the opposition swamped his 
candidate the annulled presidential elections noriega was seen 
standing alone before the tomb of his patron gen omar torrijos 
the epitaph on the tomb is i dont want to enter heaven i 
just want to enter the canal zone 
torrijos who seized power in a 1968 signed the 1977 accord 
with former president carter to turn over the canal torrijos died 
in a plane crash in 1981 and noriega became commander of the 
defense forces in 1983 giving him de facto control of the 
government 
noriega was raised by foster parents and joined the defense 
forces in 1962 his ascent began when he caught the attention of 
torrijos then an ambitious young officer 
in his climb to the top he dealt with everyone from the cia to 
colombian cocaine cartels 
less than a year after torrijos took power in 1968 coup he made 
noriega then an obscure major chief of intelligence with the rank 
of lieutenant colonel 
it was like having the keys to the city noriega immediately 
began compiling dossiers on everyone who counted in panama the job 
also gave him close contact with us intelligence agencies and he 
formed powerful alliances 
one us official who dealt with noriega at the time on drug 
enforcement efforts said noriega was polite but when it came to 
something he wanted he was the coldest man i ever met 
after noriega became the defense forces commander he acquired a 
fleet of expensive cars and a home in an exclusive neighborhood 
his financial interests reportedly included a vast array of 
businesses including hotels casinos a television station radio 
stations maritime services dutyfree liquor stores and 
prostitution 
rumors about his personal life were plentiful but there were 
few facts even his age was disputed the general has said he is 
51 but the date in his high school yearbook would make him 54 
he is married and has a daughter who lives in the dominican 
republic 
although wealthy he worked hard to develop a populist image 
modeled on the revered torrijos spending weekends meeting with 
residents of towns and villages in this nation of 22 million 
noriega often speaks of his humble origins and characterizes his 
domestic opponents as rich and white the humble the poor and 
the blacks they are the utmost authority of the people he once 
said 
as the standoff with the united states dragged on noriega 
enjoyed underlining what he termed washingtons helplessness 
despite the 12000 troops it stationed in panama 
noriega exercised power with ruthless assurance he closed 
newspapers for months at a time presidents served at his pleasure 
rumors of opposition inside the defense forces were met with 
purges and reorganizations kisses was how he described the 
bullets fired in an attempted coup in march 1988 
the united states long his ally began to distance itself after 
the headless body of one of his opponents hugo spadadora was 
found in a us mailbag in costa rica in 1985 
a full break came in february 1988 when two federal grand 
juries in florida indicted noriega on drugtrafficking and 
moneylaundering charges 
the domestic opposition began to intensify its campaign against 
noriega and washington imposed crippling economic sanctions but 
noriega didnt budge 
an intelligence source in washington said that in the months 
leading up the october coup attempt there had been reports of a 
deterioration in noriegas mental state including increased 
paranoia and constant drinking 
through his control of the defense forces he was named chief of 
government on dec 15 by a rubberstamp assembly it said his 
leadership was needed to confront a state of war caused by us 
economic sanctions and other efforts to oust the general

and selfishness were obstacles to peace the optimism of hope is 
not naive 
later in his homily the pope said on this bethlehem night 
all of us are called once again to rejoice in the work of 
creation 
the church which on this night proclaims a great joy knows 
that this joy comes completely from god it is the gift of his

in groups or alone with or 
without their weapons members of the panamanian defense forces are 
surrendering 
even before ousted dictator gen manuel antonio noriega went to 
the vatican embassy sunday to ask for political asylum hundreds of 
his troops were giving up the fight 
the baseball field at rodman naval station on the west bank of 
the panama canal is one of several detention centers the us 
military has set up to process those who turn themselves in or are 
captured 
about 1400 surrendered or were caught in the first 24 hours of 
the us invasion early wednesday they continue to trickle in and 
more than 100 have passed through rodman by sunday 
they sit in brightly colored tents on the baseball field 
waiting to be questioned and sent elsewhere for processing the 
barbed wire and police dogs are reminders that its a war not a 
picnic 
they tell us what they have to say and we make a 
determination said eugene richley the masteratarms in charge 
of the center he said some of those who appear at the gate are 
refugees and some are allowed to stay on the base if they are 
perceived to be in danger 
but most just walk up to a checkpoint they appear friendly 
he said 
richley said most are former members of the defense forces who 
expressed interest in joining a new security force being formed 
under president guillermo endara he said these men are being 
screened further 
col roberto armijo who switched allegiance from noriega to 
endara and was put in charge of the new police corps appealed 
saturday to the former defense forces members to join the new 
government and reestablish harmony as soon as possible 
i ask all members of the defense forces to come to the nearest 
garrison he said 
vice president and interior minister ricardo arias calderon the 
man in charge of domestic security said he holds no rancor or 
desire for revenge against the military under noriega 
i offer you the absolute respect of the civilian authority but 
we have the right to demand that you be loyal to your oath arias 
added he asked for reconciliation 
naval and marine officers said those suspected of being 
criminals or looters are kept in jail 
a marine corps spokesman chief warrant officer charles rowe 
said panamanians are held if they are caught in combat with us 
forces if they give themselves up or if they are turned in by 
people believed to be reliable 
most of them just walked up to a checkpoint and say they want 
to avoid more problems richley said he said the detainees 
the us military here is not using the term prisoner of war 
are treated in accord with the geneva convention 
those who surrender their arms along with themselves receive a 
bonus depending on the weapons the united states is paying 150 
for an automatic rifle a princely sum to many panamanians 
government tv runs a message on the screen almost constantly 
notifying watchers of passports to freedom usissued 
documents given to people who turn themselves in the announcement 
said the passports assure the bearer of safety food medical 
attention and eventually another job 
remember you dont have to suffer any more the message 
concludes 
at the us militarys westernmost checkpoint on the pan 
american highway about 15 miles west of the capital marine lt 
dan krauss of portland ore said several members of the defense 
forces had presented themselves including one lieutenant with his 
sovietmade ak47 assault rifle a pistol and all of his uniforms 
he said his people there were about 25 men wanted to give 
up he told us that they had waited a long time for this that they 
were just laying low in their barracks kraus said 
he had a full seabag issue of uniforms it was clear that he 
didnt want to resist he added 
krauss said three soldiers surrendered before the us takeover 
began 
we understand there was already some shooting and they didnt 
think that was a very good idea he said adding that the three 
eventually were freed 
krauss said dozens of residents have given information as to 
where to find rigoberto paredes a noriega crony and former member 
of panamas national assembly who owned much of the property in the 
area and wielded power ruthlessly

the foreign minister sunday offered to help put 
together a brigade of volunteers to help romanians fight forces 
loyal to ousted communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
if the soviet union thought it necessary to intervene in romania 
on the side of the anticeausescu forces france not only would 
not object to it but would support this action foreign minister 
roland dumas told soviet officials 
there was no indication however of imminent military 
intervention by soviet or other forces soviet premier nikolai i 
ryzhkov said saturday that sending the red army to romania would be 
impermissible and a repetition of past mistakes 
in a later interview sunday on french tv dumas said the soviets 
have just now let us know today that they are in agreement to 
begin with us to coordinate all our aid 
he did not elaborate but it was clear he meant humanitarian 
rather than military aid 
the french army said it will provide 10 trucks and 30 soldiers 
to help deliver medical aid to romania 
in a short statement sunday the foreign ministry said france 
recognizes the national salvation committee as the legal authority 
in romania 
so far france has only been asked for humanitarian aid but it 
stands ready to respond if asked to go beyond humanitarian 
measures dumas said on french radio 
if other requests are made i dont know how the events will 
unfold if another demand is made we will appraise it i can tell 
you we are ready to respond to any new situation he said 
the foreign minister then added myself i could very well see 
the constitution of a brigade of volunteers france could help in 
it 
interviewed by agence francepresse dumas recalled the 
volunteers who participated in the spanish civil war and in the 
liberation of france from nazi occupation in 1944 
many people talk but dont take enough action he said 
in an interview on french tv however dumas said western 
participation in military intervention in romania would pose 
problems because the region is a zone of the warsaw pact 
romanianborn playwright eugene ionesco who lives in france 
urged the west to provide military aid in arms and ammunition to 
the regular romanian army so it can defend the people against the 
agents of the security police 
france has sent two planeloads of medical supplies and emergency 
medical teams to romania in a mission led by bernard kouchner 
minister for humanitarian action in the socialist government

president bush had just returned from a 
pentagon briefing on the situation in panama on christmas eve when 
he learned that gen manuel antonio noriega had sought refuge from 
vatican authorities 
bush had interrupted his holiday vacation to fly by helicopter 
from the presidential retreat at camp david md for 90 minutes of 
briefings from pentagon officials on panama and he had called gen 
maxwell thurman commander of the us southern command in panama 
at the time he said he had no idea when us troops might 
accomplish one of the key goals for their invasion of panama early 
wednesday the capture of the deposed panamanian dictator who is 
under us indictment on drugtrafficking charges 
if i knew that why both of us would be a lot smarter bush 
told reporters after the pentagon sessions 
just a few hours later thurman announced in panama city that 
noriega was at the papal nunciate there and was seeking asylum 
bush through white house spokesman marlin fitzwater announced 
a few minutes later i am pleased that the general is now under 
the control of diplomatic authorities his reign of terror is 
over 
it was not immediately clear whether the us government would 
be able to bring him to the united states to stand trial the 
italian news agency ansa quoted the papal nuncio in panama city 
monignor sebastiano laboa as indicating he would not hand over 
noriega to the united states or usinstalled government in panama 
after the pentagon sessions earlier sunday bush told reporters 
outside the pentagon that the emphasis now is on cleaning up the 
last parts of resistance seeing that civilian government take 
over restoring tranquility in the city and then moving on food 
and medicine 
noting the holiday bush said he wanted to express my 
gratitude to the fine military officers and men who are taking part 
in this operation its been outstanding 
i must say that the military having fulfilled a major 
objective knocking out the panamanian defense forces almost 
entirely is now putting a great deal of proper emphasis on 
humanitarian concerns he said 
bush said defense secretary dick cheney was on his way to 
panama where the president said a real turnaround had occurred 
in restoring order 
its a very good prechristmas report that i have received 
bush said after his briefing by gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff and national security advisor scowcroft 
bush also commented briefly on the tumult in romania saying he 
had just spoken to the us ambassador in bucharest 
he called the events there a very traumatic prechristmas 
uprising but said it appeared that prodemocracy forces which 
include the nations army appeared to be gaining ground 
he said the romanian military had gained a little more 
control of the country in fighting with remnants of the secret 
police who remain loyal to deposed dictator nicolae ceausescu 
while at the pentagon bush taped a radio message to us troops 
around the globe offering a special salute to those in panama 
and a tribute to us servicemen who died in the fighting there 
in panama as in every other such test in our history 
americans put their lives on the line for the basic values of 
liberty and decency on which our nation is founded he said 
our hearts and those of every american go out to the families 
of those who fell to all those who mourn a husband a son a 
brother a father or a friend i can only offer the thanks of a 
grateful nation your loved ones served a noble and just cause with 
honor and distinction

manuel antonio noriega is the perfect villain 
but there are drawbacks in a policy heavily hinged on the capture 
of one man whatever his crimes 
one nagging administration problem was resolved on christmas eve 
when noriega turned himself in to vatican diplomats in panama city 
seeking asylum 
in power and in hiding the panamanian strongman had been 
taunting the united states for nearly three years 
that dilemma was resolved sunday night after a fiveday us 
manhunt in panama complete with a million dollar bounty 
the us commander in panama then the white house announced 
that noriega had turned up and turned himself in not to us 
forces but to envoys of the roman catholic church 
the white house said the demise of general noriega was a 
signal that the forces of democracy and freedom in panama were on 
the rise 
noriega apologists are certain to note that he was not captured 
and did not surrender to the american troops sent to panama 
theyll call it sanctuary not surrender 
it also leaves open the question of whether noriega ever will 
stand trial on us drug indictments 
but those are technicalities the administration already had 
indicated a willingness to spare him prosecution if he would yield 
power and get out of panama 
and it hardly seems likely that a man like noriega would have 
surrendered himself even to the sanctuary of the church had his 
position not become impotent and impossible 
noriega had slipped away when the us intervened early last 
wednesday and had eluded american forces for five days as the most 
wanted of men 
the plot in the panama story has taken bizarre turns before and 
the crafty elusive target of a manhunt ordered by the white house 
could have gained a sort of a perverse popularity among some latin 
americans had he remained at large evading the yankees 
the united states posted a 1 million bounty for information 
leading to his arrest president bush said he wouldnt be satisfied 
until noriega was brought to justice 
noriegas capture was a major objective from the moment the 
american troops moved in at 1 am last wednesday 
his picture will be in every post office in town bush said 
thursday thats the way it works he is a fugitive drug dealer 
and we want to see him brought to justice 
noriegas pockmarked face brandished machete and defiance of 
his own countrymen when they voted for his opponents all add to the 
image of the prototype dictator us officials say there is 
evidence he meant to attack unarmed american civilians that he was 
involved in voodoo or satanism that he admired adolf hitler that 
he plotted a terrorist takeover of the panama canal 
overall hardly a sympathetic figure 
but there was a risk in a superpower policy centered on one man 
even a man such as noriega 
the white house bounty had made him a milliondollar man 
american troops by the thousands couldnt take him although the 
likelihood is that unless they had been closing in noriega would 
not have turned in his hand 
one man against all that might was one man who could become a 
latin legend as outlaws sometimes do 
noriegas decision to seek refuge with vatican authorities 
should ease the crisis in panama he and his henchmen prolonged the 
agony with sniping raids looting urban guerrilla warfare had he 
escaped to sanctuary with his nicaraguan allies it could have 
pointed to a war of words even raids against the new government 
in panama 
now that danger has eased 
stripped of power and confined to an embassy sanctuary noriega 
should fade to insignificance 
in the first pentagon briefing on the panama operation gen 
colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said noriega 
had been decapitated as the leader of panama yesterdays maximum 
leader is todays fugitive secretary of state james a baker iii 
said later 
bush said thursday that noriega controls no forces and hes 
out 
if all of that is so and noriega is powerless his arrest would 
seem a side issue one that could wait 
the capture of that one elusive fugitive had remained a major 
declared objective in the biggest military operation since the 
united states withdrew from south vietnam 
he wasnt captured by the americans who sought him but he is no 
longer at large and that is a major break for the bush 
administration

disruptions of everything from bus 
service to church services made life a chore sunday while this 
northeastern florida river city fought record cold and treacherous 
ice 
its a winter wonderland in jacksonville its a beautiful 
sight for a city that doesnt get snow very often and its also a 
very dangerous situation for the same reason said mayor tommy 
hazouri 
throughout late saturday and early sunday most of 
jacksonvilles bridges were closed to traffic police responded to 
dozens of traffic accidents most fenderbenders from skidding cars 
for the first time since hurricane dora in 1964 the 
jacksonville transportation authority suspended bus service 
worrying that heavy use of electricity might force power 
reductions to some neighborhoods electric utility officials asked 
that outdoor christmas lights and hot water heaters be shut off 
that may not sound like much but if you multiply that several 
thousand times it can make a difference said clyde 
montgomery a spokesman for the jacksonville electric authority 
the authority had a record for power use for the year saturday 
at 2100 megawatts montgomery said 
interstate 10 between jacksonville and tallahassee was closed 
for hours 
all flights were cancelled at jacksonville international airport 
on saturday and sunday 
many passengers were stranded while carrying colorfully wrapped 
christmas packages intended for friends and relatives elsewhere 
some hospitals were short on nurses because many could not get 
to work 
numerous churches canceled sundays regular and special 
christmas eve services 
an 8yearold boy died after a malfunctioning kerosene heater 
started a fire in a bedroom where he his mother and three other 
children were sleeping authorities said 
cindy mosling operator of beaks a bird emergency care center 
said she had received more than 100 calls from people who had 
sighted birds injured by the cold and ice 
however icy bridges to her bird sanctuary prevented her from 
rescuing any of the birds

the temperature was only 40 and the 
wind was blowing but sundays record cold was accompanied by good 
waves that attracted diehard surfers 
its not often to find waves that big said paul 
meccariello 27 its something to do with the weather usually 
the big waves are blocked by the bahamas islands 
more than 50 surfers clad in insulating wetsuits gathered in the 
67degree water waiting for good waves earlier in the day miami 
had cooled to a record low of just 31 degrees 
meccariello couldnt estimate how high the waves were there 
were swells that appeared several feet high in a small area 
he had called a recorded surf report from his home in hollywood 
fla 
they said this was the spot to be this is where theyre 
breaking he said i guess they all called there too he 
said of the other surfers 
in spite of the good surf ben alloche 17 was going home 
its too crowded he said 
it was too cold to work on a tan so tourists with coats 
buttoned and hands thrust into their pockets watched the surfers 
from the beach 
marcus lemmler 23 arrived thursday from switzerland which he 
said has had record high temperatures 
theres no snow in switzerland so we came to miami to find

defense secretary dick 
cheney arrived in panama on sunday to share christmas dinner with 
us troops and celebrate gen manuel antonio noriegas decision to 
seek asylum 
i am delighted that general noriega has finally been run to 
ground said cheney after being told as his plane approached 
panama that noriega had sought political asylum at the vatican 
embassy 
i think it is clear at this point that the panamanian people 
have no use for him that he has had to take sanctuary in a foreign 
embassy said cheney 
he spoke to reporters shortly after his plane landed at howard 
air force base four miles west of panama city 
he no longer is a factor in panama now it is up to the 
lawyers and the diplomats to figure out what is next cheney 
said as far as im concerned the military has done its job 
although there were 26000 us military personnel in panama 
there were none around the embassy when noriega arrived there an 
informed military source said noriega the ousted panamanian 
strongman drove himself or was driven to the embassy at about 3 
pm and entered unaccompanied 
gen maxwell thurman chief of the us southern command said 
he ordered the embassy surrounded afterward because i have the 
security responsibility for all of panama so i dont want digbats 
dignity battalions loyal to noriega blowing into the place i 
would not want them to come with an armored car and blow their way 
into the embassy 
i can imagine all the vatican lawyers are going to be up at 
this hour he added 
it was unclear whether noriegas decision will hasten the 
withdrawal of us troops from panama said col miguel monteverde 
a pentagon spokesman military officials hoped noriegas decision 
to seek asylum would take the spirit to resist out of scattered 
noriega loyalists who were still fighting monteverde said 
cheney went to panama to spend christmas with troops in the 
field and of course to celebrate noriegas surrender 
monteverde said 
he is very interested in how theyre doing but i think he 
wants to show in a very real way that he appreciates their 
sacrifice in giving up christmas and putting themselves in harms 
way monteverde said 
cheney will return to washington either monday evening or 
tuesday morning monteverde said 
president bush announced the surprise cheney trip after a 
briefing at the pentagon on sunday the fifth day of the us 
invasion that drove noriega from power

downtown plaza sunday to show their support for democratic change 
in romania

the rest of the bandits said ionel mikleu who emigrated from 
romania 20 years ago they ruled romania for 40some years its 
enough

the communist emblem torn out burned portraits of deposed dictator 
nicolae ceausescu and sang the countrys national anthem 
earlier sunday hundreds more chicagoans with eastern european 
roots wore black armbands at church services for victims of the

from the romanian mission to the united nations 
princess margaret daughter of exiled king michael told the 
crowd in english of her support for the popular movement in 
romania then said thank you in romanian according to the rev 
aurel radulescu head of the coalition romania 21 
romania 21 has organized daily demonstrations outside the 
mission since the uprising in romania began more recently to 
celebrate and appeal for international aid 
in portland ore more than 125 people gathered in downtown 
pioneer square to sing christmas carols and light christmas

ousted dictator gen manuel antonio 
noriega sought refuge at the vatican embassy sunday after five days 
on the run and he requested political asylum to evade us troops 
sent to capture him 
as word spread that noriega had surfaced hundreds of people 
converged on the twostory embassy which was surrounded by us 
troops and armored vehicles a helicopter hovered overhead some 
young men yelled that noriega should be lynched 
although us officials expressed relief and pleasure noriegas 
move may have thwarted a main purpose of the invasion launched last 
week the capture of the elusive leader so he could stand trial in 
the united states on drug charges 
the italian news agency ansa quoted the papal nuncio in panama 
city monignor sebastiano laboa as indicating he would not hand 
over noriega to the united states or usinstalled government in 
panama 
sources familiar with the situation said the papal nuncio had 
mentioned to other diplomats the possibility of noriega going to 
spain or cuba 
the papal nuncio is the vaticans diplomatic representative in 
panama and under international law embassies are sacrosanct 
ground 
word that the elusive noriega had resurfaced came first from 
gen maxwell thurman chief of the us southern command president 
bush announced later in washington that noriega had surrendered and 
his reign of terror is over 
noriega turned himself in just hours after three highranking 
members of his army surrendered and another pledged loyalty to the 
usbacked government 
in a dispatch from panama city ansa quoted unidentified sources 
as saying noriega sought political asylum to negotiate his transfer 
to another country 
the report also said there were 32 people in the embassy 
formally known as the papal nunciatura including high officials of 
the panamanian defense forces and political parties of the noriega 
regime 
the rev joseph esspeteri the nuncios secretary confirmed 
that noriega was at the embassy but refused to say whether he had 
been granted asylum or anything else on his status vatican 
secretary of state agostino casaroli leaving midnight mass at st 
peters basilica in rome declined to comment on noriegas action 
noriegas move appeared to put the vatican in a delicate 
position with a choice of offending the united states by refusing 
to turn noriega over or appearing to condone the us invasion by 
doing so 
its a very complex problem said a senior vatican official 
early monday the official who works in foreign policy issues and 
spoke under the usual ground rule of anonymity noted that the 
vatican has no tradition or policy of accepting asylum seekers 
i dont think they could directly hand noriega over to the 
americans who are an invading army the official said they 
would be recognizing the americans as the local authorities 
instead they could hand him over to the government there on 
condition of a fair trial 
noriega arrived by car at the embassy about 3 pm said an 
informed military source at the time there were no us troops 
around the building which occupies about half a city block in a 
welltodo paitilla neighborhood 
witnesses said they saw several former officials of the 
noriegacontrolled government entering the vatican embassy this 
afternoon including manuel solis palma who was acting president 
on sept 1 
in panama city shattered after five days of fighting between 
us troops and noriega loyalists people banged pots and pans 
together cheered and honked horns when they heard the news about 
noriega 
now we can have christmas said one man who grabbed a friend 
and hugged him i dont have a turkey in the house we dont even 
have any hamburger all we have is a can of sardines but what the 
hell 
is it true yelled a woman on a balcony she squealed with 
delight when told it was 
mission accomplished said a passing cab driver that 
coward 
noriega had been at large since us troops invaded panama at 
midnight tuesday in an effort to capture him the bush 
administration offered a 1 million bounty for the military 
strongman 
ironically opposition leader guillermo endara installed as 
president shortly after the invasion obtained shelter at the papal 
nuncios residence in october after being beaten and thrown out of 
his office by noriegas soldiers 
there was no immediate comment from the vatican there was no 
answer at the phone number of vatican spokesman joaquin navarro in 
vatican city 
us defense secretary dick cheney who flew to panama said he 
was delighted at the news on noriega 
he no longer is a factor in panama cheney said now it is 
up to the lawyers and the diplomats to figure out what is next as 
far as im concerned the military has done its job 
thurman said he had the embassy surrounded because i have the 
security responsibility for all of panama so i dont want dignity 
battalions blowing into the place i would not want them to come 
with an armored car and blow their way into the embassy 
the 26000member us force bolstered by reinforcements sent 
in saturday made headway earlier sunday in its fight to put down 
the resistance of noriega holdouts after three highranking members 
of noriegas army surrendered and another pledged loyalty to the 
usbacked government 
us authorities said about 1800 of noriegas original 15000 
defense force members were still fighting us troops it was not 
immediately clear how noriegas move sunday would affect them 
since the invasion 25 us soldiers and two american civilians 
have been killed according to the pentagon one soldier was 
missing and 281 were wounded us officials said 
the us military said 154 panamanian soldiers had died 113 
were wounded and 2969 had been captured 
dr elmer miranda director of santo tomas hospital put the 
panamanian death toll at 260 and said many victims were civilians 
many families in the capital of 1 million had nothing to give 
their children on the usually joyous holiday in this predominantly 
roman catholic nation 
what am i going to tell my 6yearold daughter i cannot tell 
her santa claus was killed by a bomb said one woman in a 
middleclass neighborhood 
a few christmas lights twinkled in some homes but most shops 
and supermarkets were looted bare food and medical supplies were 
dwindling and officials were arranging to fly in fresh supplies 
three more looting days until christmas observed one 
visitor 
many neighborhoods formed groups to clean up streets littered 
with glass and trash and put up christmas lights 
we have to forge ahead and not be thinking this country is 
sinking without a chance to make a better future said a man who 
lost about 100000 when his furniture store was looted 
at his first presidential news conference sunday endara said he 
wished the foreign army could leave soon but that it probably 
would take panama longer to return to normal 
i wish it were a month he said but i dont think so i 
do not know when 
col luis del cid a key military commander charged with drug 
smuggling along with noriega said he would turn himself in to us 
military authorities because he was worried about the safety of his 
10 children 
del cid commander of the 5th military zone in the provincial 
capital of david about 200 miles outside panama city had ordered 
davids airfield blown up wednesday to prevent the landing of 
american aircraft he said he would surrender when us troops 
reached the city 
noriega del cid and 14 others were indicted on drug charges in 
us federal court in miami in february 1988 
also sunday lt col daniel delgado lt col arnulfo castrejon 
and lt col carlos arosemena turned themselves in to us troops 
in panama city 
us troops discovered a cache of arms in a rented house near 
noriegas family home in an uppermiddle class section of the city 
found were 300 g3 rifles 72000 rounds of ammunition at least 
360 concussion grenades about 300 ak47 assault rifles with 20000 
rounds of ammunition and 30 light antitank weapons 
neighbors said the house had been rented by noriega said sgt 
john stowe 
the house was sparsely furnished with two bunkbeds a sofa tv 
and vcr with a supply of tapes including two copies of rambo 
iii tougher than leather messenger of death midnight

an attorney representing deposed panamanian leader 
manuel antonio noriega said sunday there was little chance he would 
be returned to the united states for trial on drug charges 
noriega ended an intense manhunt sunday when he drove to the 
vaticans mission in panama city and asked for sanctuary it 
remained unclear that night what the vaticans response would be 
im really quite surprised i was sure hed die in panama 
said raymond takiff noriegas attorney in miami honest to god 
i am really surprised im glad hes alive 
takiff said he tried without success to contact noriega on 
sunday but an ambassador from a third country arranged for them to 
speak by phone early christmas morning 
takiff said the papal embassy is so well known as a sanctuary in 
panama that he found it hard to believe noriega could arrive there 
unobserved 
maybe it was a setup that us troops would look the other 
way takiff said 
the attorney said he doubted the vatican would turn noriega over 
to the united states 
the roman catholic church has been sanctuary forever he 
said an individual who comes to seek sanctuary will be given 
sanctuary that goes back to the very roots of the catholic 
church 
takiff said prosecuting noriega who has a long association with 
the central intelligence agency would reveal so much sensitive 
information about us foreign policy that a trial is unlikely 
ive always said they will never want to try him i always 
thought the only option was to kill him takiff said i never 
was clever enough to think of sanctuary in the vatican in either 
event he doesnt get tried

theres no christmas tree to brighten jesse 
crabtrees living room and the disabled coal miner has no holiday 
cheer this season 
he says why get a tree if we dont have any gifts to put 
under it said crabtrees wife edith 
crabtree 68 suffers from black lung disease caused by 
breathing coal dust and has been hospitalized for two heart 
attacks and prostate gland surgery he also was hurt in a 1976 
mining accident and now spends his retirement money on medicine 
rather than christmas 
now jesse just sits there in the bedroom day in and day out 
looking out the window thats his life mrs crabtree said 
crabtree blamed their economic plight on the bitter battle 
between the united mine workers and the pittston coal group inc a 
union poster is taped to the wall near his bed 
nearly 1700 miners struck pittstons coal subsidiary in 
virginia west virginia and kentucky on april 5 after working 14 
months without a contract the walkout was prompted by pittstons 
refusal to participate in an industry agreement on how to fund 
costly miners retirement and health plans 
the umw and pittston failed saturday in a lastditch effort to 
reach a prechristmas settlement negotiations recessed with an 
agreement that both sides would return to the bargaining table 
wednesday 
mrs crabtree said she and her husband get 911 a month through 
retirement benefits and black lung program payments their mortgage 
and medical bills alone exceed that 
were making it from hand to mouth were poor but were 
proud mrs crabtree said we had a little bit of savings put 
away 
for a while the couples christmas dinner was uncertain 
i dont even know if im going to have a turkey or a ham 
mrs crabtree said just before the president of a umw local arrived 
with a 15pound turkey 
she said she needed a turkey for christmas i told her it 
would be no trouble said bethel purkey from umw local 5815 
crabtree is upset pittston changed its pensioner health policy 
after the old contract ran out the policy began providing 80 
percent coverage after a 200 deductible it had been 100 percent 
pittston owes him and should pay his medical bills they are 
the ones that caused his problems his wife said 
pittston spokeswoman susan copeland said 80 percent coverage is 
a nationwide standard 
cheryl van tilburg a spokeswoman for blue crossblue shield in 
chicago the nations largest health insurer said 8020 is 
definitely the norm for group coverage 
crabtree a union miner for more than 37 years also is upset 
the umw worked for pittston for 14 months without a contract he 
said its possible the company would have continued full coverage 
for pensioners if a contract had been reached 
if they had gone on strike then theyd have a contract now 
crabtree said no contract no work if a fellow strike breaker 
wanted to go on in you keep him from going you cant have anyone 
going in while others are staying out 
mrs crabtree said a 100 percent health plan would give her one 
less thing to worry about 
im 4 feet 11 inches tall hes 230some pounds and i handle 
him alone she said i take him to the doctor alone pull the 
car up to the garage dont ask me how i do it 
one way she does it is by letting christmas pass virtually 
unnoticed 
he needs me and he knows ill be there mrs crabtree said 
mister ill never let him down

the holidays are prime time for the 
nations retailers but theyre also high season for the 
storeowners nemesis the shoplifter industry officials say 
thirtyfive percent of store losses happen from thanksgiving 
to jan 15 said glenn ricker a former sears roebuck and co 
loss prevention security manager and now a district manager of 
investigations for pinkerton the nations oldest private 
investigative and security agency 
shoplifting is a 40 billion a year scourge for retailers and 
it is becoming increasingly lucrative for criminals such as 
burglars said lt james hughes head of the tucson police 
departments major offenders unit and burglary task force 
its newer merchandise easier than breaking into homes and it 
has better resale value when the burglars take it to their fence 
hughes said 
uniform crime report statistics compiled by the fbi based on 
information from 12019 law enforcement agencies reflecting a 
population of 2116 million americans showed 982552 shoplifting 
offenses in 1988 39 percent more than the 945671 reported in 
1988 the average value of stolen property was 104 
there was a 35 percent upswing in shoplifting between 1984 and 
1988 the fbi said 
according to hughes for every shoplifting incident reported 
another three to four go unreported 
the national retail merchants association said a study shows 
stock shortages largely a combination of shoplifting and 
employee theft account for nearly 2 percent of net retail sales 
in department stores 
the spectrum of shoplifters cuts across age class and gender 
lines and their methods vary widely said ricker 
ive caught 5yearolds and ive caught 75yearold ladies 
ive caught guys in wheelchairs he said you dont find too 
many 70 or 80yearolds breaking into houses or cars but trust 
me you find 70and 80yearolds shoplifting 
among shoplifters schemes 
working in teams allowing one person to distract a clerk while 
the other steals merchandise 
sneaking empty store bags inside the store and filling them 
with goods 
detaching electronic alarm tags from merchandise 
loading items into falsebottom bags coats or loosefitting 
clothing 
razorcutting the top off a cereal box emptying the contents 
and filling the box with more expensive items such as cigarettes 
then retaping the top and going through the checkout line 
an items size doesnt deter shoplifters ricker said he caught 
one man who tried to steal a chainsaw 
ricker estimated that 75 to 80 percent of all such crime is 
drugrelated 
attempts to combat the problem are almost like trying to dam a 
river with sand he said 
many retailers are turning increasingly to security firms for 
help 
were getting more and more calls from retail sales asking 
both for uniform security and for undercover investigative 
services said ronald janick pinkerton senior vice president of 
investigations in suburban philadelphia 
said ricker a lot of corporations now are going to contract 
loss prevention agents rather than their own inhouse staff 
because its a lot more costeffective 
agencies such as pinkerton take on responsibility for hiring 
screening and training agents insurance turnover and paperwork 
pinkerton also supplies undercover operatives who blend in with 
regular shoppers and the shoplifters 
one such is dianne ruhl a private investigator who previously 
worked as a security agent in department stores in tucson 
ms ruhl said suspicious or unusual behavior is a tipoff to a 
trained observer 
frequently those caught shoplifting ask if they can just pay 
for the items but increasingly merchants are prosecuting 
ms ruhl said she recently caught a 25yearold unemployed man 
who had stuffed two packs of camels between a liner and the outside 
part of his coat 
and so hes got a record now for 270 she said isnt 
that stupid

connecticut officials are reconsidering a 
possible investment in the buyout of colt industries incs 
firearms division because of uncertainty in the market for guns 
state treasurer francisco l borges said 
the states hesitation is causing concern among the investor 
group seeking to buy the firearms division the group cf holdings 
corp sees connecticuts investment as the last hurdle before new 
owners can take over the troubled gunmaker 
borges said state officials have several concerns about joining 
the buyout including a declining world market for handguns and the 
possibility of new gun control legislation that could hamper the 
new company 
however borges said this does not mean we wont get to a 
point where we have something acceptable and he added that talks 
were continuing 
colt industries put the firearms division on the market last 
spring and agreed in late november to sell the division to cf 
holdings in a deal that was to include the state as a shareholder 
cf holdings includes anthony autorino former president of 
united technologies hamilton standard division and now president 
of shared technologies in wethersfield conn richard f gamble 
another former hamilton standard president and ronald f stilwell 
colt firearms vice president for military sales 
the price of the deal was never disclosed but analysts estimated 
it could range from 50 million to 200 million the state has 
refused to disclose the size of its possible investment in the 
project 
autorino said the investor group was becoming anxious about the 
states hesitation 
we have a firm price and an agreement and times getting 
short he said 
one obstacle to completing the sale was removed earlier this 
week when the united auto workers and the investors who would run 
the plant agreed to a full settlement of the 3yearold uawcolt 
strike and endorsed a contract to return to work 
the union was supposed to be the last hurdle in the deal 
said philip wheeler chief negotiator fo uaw local 376 that was 
the agreement and everybody was happy the union settled this deal 
should be done now 
wheeler would not disclose the details of the strike settlement 
and the new union contract friday because financing for the deal 
is still pending 
this is a difficult situation but as far as we are concerned 
we had an agreement with the state wheeler said we are still 
confident borges will finalize the deal the deal is still 
sound

boeing cos computer services division is under 
investigation for allegedly overcharging the federal government 
about 25 million for research work a published report said sunday 
boeing confirmed that it was being investigated by the defense 
criminal investigative service and air force office of special 
investigations but disputed the results of a pentagon audit that 
said it had exceeded government limits on billable research costs 
the seattle times reported 
an investigation is ongoing said boeing chairman frank 
shrontz in an interview with the times we dont think theres 
been any evidence uncovered to date of any kind of willful fraud or 
mischarging 
the investigation could result in felony or lesser charges 
administrative action or no action at all 
there was no answer at the offices of boeing spokesman when a 
reporter called for further comment sunday 
the government allows companies to charge some research costs 
within limits even if the research is used to develop and sell the 
companies own products 
but auditors from the pentagons defense contract audit agency 
said in an april 1988 report that boeing had exceeded those limits 
and improperly charged the expenses to a different account paid by 
the government the times said 
about 59 million of the 25 million in alleged research 
overcharges was publicly revealed in july when rep john conyers 
jr dmich chairman of the legislation and national security 
subcommittee released an audit of boeing computer services by the 
general accounting office a congressional watchdog agency 
parts of the investigation also have been previously revealed 
including a subpeona last summer for documents 
if boeing has to repay the costs it would be a major setback 
for the companys moneylosing military side boeing has faced 
numerous allegations of fraud and overcharging related to its 
military contracts this year 
boeing has agreed to pay 11 million for overstating aluminum 
prices in wichita it paid more than 5 million in restitution and 
fines after pleading guilty to receiving classified pentagon budget 
documents in virginia 
boeing also is facing a critical audit and criminal 
investigation of 20 million in charges related to leases with 
developer david sabey in seattle 
shrontz told the times his company emphasizes ethics and blamed 
boeings trouble on a significant resentment by both the 
public and maybe some of the procurement people toward the 
defense contracting business 
boeing was the countrys 10th largest defense contractor last 
year with 479 billion in government contracts military work 
accounted for only 25 percent of boeings total sales this year 
the subpoena concerned both boeing aerospace and electronics and 
boeing computer services documents boeing spokesman paul binder 
has confirmed 
binder told the times the criminal investigation into billing 
practices was not new but there has been no previous official 
acknowledgement of it 
maj gen charles skipton commander of the air force contract 
management division based in new mexico wrote in a letter to the 
seattle regional gao office in september that he had been told 
collection of the overcharged amount was being held up for two 
reasons the times said 
he wrote that he had been told the investigation was holding 
payment up and also that a recent analysis by the air force plant 
representative office or onsite contracting officials did not 
totally support the findings of the final gao report 
kent godfrey defense contract audit agency manager in charge of 
the boeing audit work in seattle and phillip rogers the agencys 
executive officer in alexandria va declined any comment
