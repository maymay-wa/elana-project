they swallow deadly drugs plunge out of 
windows smash their cars and hang or shoot themselves at an 
alarming rate and they do it because suicide seems better than the 
alternative dying of aids 
you have no control over this illness at all so it gives me 
some kind of control when i can say i can end my life any time i 
want to said chuck sporeman a 43yearold nurse who has aids 
sporeman tried to kill himself twice in december 1988 two 
months after his male companion of 13 years died of aids he said 
he might try again when the disease leaves him unable to care for 
himself but participation in a support group helps at least for 
now 
there are days where i wish i had done it but there are other 
days when its a beautiful day the wind is blowing through the 
trees i can go watch the waves crashing on the beach and im glad 
i didnt do it he said 
the author of a 1988 cornell university study estimates about 
1000 aids patients in the united states will kill themselves by 
1991 the study found people with aids are 66 times more likely to 
commit suicide than the general population 
it definitely happens all the time said andrew weisser 
spokesman for aids project los angeles a service agency where five 
of 2100 aidsinfected clients killed themselves in december 
the relatively small number of aidsrelated suicides reported 
publicly is just the tip of the iceberg weisser said 
theres no way for us to keep track said los angeles county 
coroners spokesman bob dambacher if someone comes off a 
building we dont know if they have aids if they shoot 
themselves we dont know 
such suicides graphically illustrate that mental health budget 
cuts and discrimination leave many aids patients without adequate 
counseling weisser asserts many aids patients who discuss suicide 
are calling out for help he said but hopelessness makes 
others kill themselves 
a 28yearold aids patient in san diego drank all day stole a 
car swerved down the highway without headlights then triggered a 
sixcar accident that killed him and injured three others in april 
1988 paul james curry was dying slow i think he chose to die 
fast a friend said 
two men who authorities said had aids tied themselves 
together then jumped 35 floors off their new york apartment 
building in 1985 
philip saylor 40 took a revolver into los angeles 
cedarssinai medical center on jan 2 shot and killed his longtime 
companion 35yearold aids patient steven jenkins then killed 
himself police said saylor also was infected by the aids virus 
after that tragedy several experts said suicide can be a 
reasonable alternative if aids patients are thinking clearly and 
fully informed of all options 
people have a right to kill themselves not early on when 
people first find theyre infected but when they have become 
sufficiently sick that the quality of their life is not 
satisfactory to them said dr neal schram a member of the 
california medical associations aids task force 
rabbi allen freehling a member of the los angeles county 
commission on aids advises aids patients against killing 
themselves saying suicide is a selfish act that can compound the 
grief of family and friends 
in ecclesiastes it says there is a time to live and a time to 
die and i dont think the author of that statement meant we should 
decide when that time is freehling said 
a cornell university study published this month found that 
people who have just learned they are infected by the aids virus 
but dont yet have symptoms are no more likely than other people to 
have suicidal thoughts if they receive proper counseling 
dr peter marzuk author of the earlier cornell study found 
patients face the greatest risks just after they are diagnosed and 
again when aids effects on the brain cause depression delirium or 
other treatable psychiatric disorders 
if you treat the depression frequently these people will feel 
better and not feel driven to suicide said dr geoffrey 
newstadt a cedarssinai psychiatrist 
marzuks study published in the journal of the american medical 
association in 1988 found 12 suicides among 3828 aids patients in 
new york city in 1985 he called it striking that three of them 
jumped from hospital windows an act repeated in 1986 by aids 
patients at hospitals in eureka calif and dallas a cedarssinai 
aids patient jumped to his death a year ago newstadt said 
two other suicides in marzuks study had lovers who earlier died 
from aids which newstadt said can spur the depression that leads 
to suicide 
sporeman said he took care of his companion for the last year 
and a half of his life and when he died i being ill saw no 
reason to go on after the funeral everybody goes back to 
their lives and youre left all alone 
a study similar to marzuks found california men with aids are 
up to 21 times more likely than other men to kill themselves the 
study conducted by californias department of health services 
counted 13 aidsrelated suicides in 1986 
marzuk wrote that many aidsrelated suicides go uncounted 
because some people kill themselves without revealing they have the 
disease while others might be cloaked as overdoses of prescribed 
medications or illicit drugs 
sporeman tried to inject a fatal air bubble and overdose of 
medicine in his first failed suicide attempt days later he 
swallowed valium and percodan pills and downed alcohol as he walked 
around his house writing a will a friend walked in and stopped him 
before he could swallow a fatal amount 
schram said it still is more common for aids patients to refuse 
heroic medical treatment to let themselves die than to commit 
suicide 
there is a very thin line between maintaining a life and 
taking a life freehling said that line can be hard to define 
especially when aids patients often recover from repeated 
infections before they die 
some aids patients ask friends or lovers to help them commit 
suicide 
in august john cleaves 43 of san diego was sentenced to 15 
years to life in prison after being convicted of seconddegree 
murder for strangling dennis eaton 40 cleaves contended he helped 
eaton commit suicide 
the development of azt and other lifeextending drugs may change 
the way aids is viewed from a fatal disease to a manageable 
chronic disease like some cancers that could lower suicide 
rates schram said 
aids patients have a right to decide to commit suicide newstadt 
said but the problem is whether they have all of the information 
available to them about treatment possibilities 
of suicide sporeman said before the virus hits my brain or 
im unable to do things for myself i want to be able to do it i 
still have a plan to do it even if i dont do it i feel i got 
control over the disease because i can say stop

garage mechanics listen for pings piano 
tuners are alert for plunks donald e marlowes job is to wait for 
the next pow to shatter the silence of his laboratory 
marlowe is the governments chief condom tester and the 
explosions come from an air burst test he is perfecting to 
measure sample condoms resistance to pressure 
working in a low nondescript building that the food and drug 
administration shares with a furniture store in this washington 
suburb marlowe demonstrates by slipping a latex condom onto a 
machine equipped with gauges dials and the squiggly needle of an 
instrument that looks like a seismograph 
then he inflates the condom with air it swells to the size of a 
goodsized watermelon before it bursts the instruments record that 
it withstood 30 liters or about 7 gallons of air and pressure of 
threetenths of a pound per square inch well above the 
governments exacting standard 
pretty tough says marlowe a 49yearold mechanical 
engineer who runs the division of mechanics and material science 
for the fdas center for devices and radiological health 
in another room marlowe takes a circular section cut from the 
middle of a condom similar to a wide rubber band and stretches it 
on a machine to test its tensile strength how far it will stretch 
before it snaps 
besides condoms marlowes laboratory tests a wide variety of 
medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers artificial hearts and 
valves false eyes syringes pumps and bone joint and ligament 
implants 
nearly four dozen of these prosthetic body parts are attached to 
yorick the fdas bionic skeleton which greets visitors to the 
laboratory where all the devices have been tested over the years 
the fda is responsible for the safety and effectiveness of 
medical devices and condoms are a medical device marlowe said 
marlowe is accustomed to the snickers and jokes he sometimes 
hears about condoms he chuckles indulgently about the time his 
staff in a playful holiday mood inflated some condoms with helium 
and tied them to the office christmas tree they looked great 
he said 
but marlowe says that with widespread public concern over the 
aids epidemic and former surgeon general c everett koops highly 
publicized campaign to promote safer sex condoms are no laughing 
matter 
since the early 1960s fda agents at a winchester mass 
laboratory north of boston have been conducting random unannounced 
tests of sample condoms from domestic and foreign manufacturers for 
possible water leakage 
during the year ended in april 1988 the fda tested 115000 
condoms for possible pinholes or tears in this way resulting in 
rejection of more than 30 million imported condoms as defective and 
the recall of 3 million domestic condoms from store shelves 
marlowe said his laboratorys air burst and tensile strength 
tests for condoms form the basis for an industrywide testing 
standard that was first published in 1973 and was revised most 
recently in november 
that standard is recognized voluntarily by manufacturers the 
government and consumer interests including the us agency for 
international development which supplies condoms for third world 
population control projects compliance is determined during the 
fdas regular quality assurance inspections of manufacturers 
someone new coming into the lab gets over the bathroom humor 
about condoms very quickly marlowe said this is serious 
business

a cold windswept plain in tibet populated with 
scores of birds plants and animals found nowhere else on earth has 
been proposed as the worlds largest nature reserve 
the chang tang reserve named from the tibetan words for 
northern plain would encompass an area the size of california 
the proposed territory covers onesixth of the tibet autonomous 
region and adjoining parts of the chinese provinces of qinghai and 
xinjiang said george schaller an american biologist who has 
explored the region and helped negotiate an agreement signed just 
days ago 
its one of the last almost unexplored places on the face of 
the earth said schaller of wildlife conservation international 
in new york it survives intact almost as it was 100 years ago 
schaller one of the worlds leading wildlife biologists has 
done pioneering studies on gorillas pandas snow leopards and 
other endangered animals 
he is one of the very few westerners to have entered the chang 
tang region few local people have been there either despite its 
size it has a human population of no more than several hundred 
wandering herdsmen who live there for only a few months each year 
when he returned from chang tang in late january he brought 
with him an agreement with the tibetan environmental protection 
agency that outlines the steps to be taken to establish the reserve 
an area of 100000 square miles about the size of colorado 
will be set aside in tibet the tibetan epa will coordinate the 
effort with funds from wildlife conservation international and 
tibetan and national agencies proposed additions in adjoining 
provinces would bring the size of the reserve to about 150000 
square miles an area the size of california 
we want to in the next few years find out whats there and 
the areas of particular importance schaller said he plans to 
return in july the research will be conducted with the tibet 
institute of plateau biology 
the agreement calls the area a unique animal and plant 
community which includes such spectacular creatures as wild yak 
tibetan wild ass tibetan wild sheep tibetan gazelle tibetan 
antelope and tibetan brown bear all of which occur only on the 
tibetan plateau 
when asked to describe the region he paused searching for 
comparisons to convey the vastness and austere beauty of an area 
unlike any other 
it has the aura of the serengeti in east africa he said 
you travel and travel toward a distant horizon and the world 
seems to expand in front of you 
the reserve is a highaltitude steppe at an elevation of about 3 
miles it is covered with scrub grasses no more than 6 inches high 
lakes too salty to drink from and jagged inhospitable mountains 
winter temperatures can drop to 40 or 50 degrees below zero 
snow can fall any day of the year and the winds schaller 
said oh how the winds can howl across there 
four hundred species of plants have been found on the plateau 
along with 60 species of birds wild yak gather in herds of 100 or 
150 its a real desert area but it has oases around which 
animals congregate by the thousands he said 
access to the reserve is normally by way of lhasa the tibetan 
capital a weeks drive south of the proposed reserve ive gone 
in from the north by camel caravan but you cross such desolate 
country its difficult schaller said 
the trip from lhasa isnt a simple excursion either you need 
two cars and a truck to carry gas he said because of the need 
to carry gas expeditions normally last no more than three months 
he said 
my preference would be to just have a herd of yak animals and 
live in there for a few years he said but politically thats 
not feasible schaller is willing but most of the local people 
have families and they dont want to be out he said 
in an area so remote is the establishment of a nature reserve 
really necessary 
there is no such thing as a remote area any more schaller 
said its known there are minerals there near there oil has 
been discovered 
recalling the bison that once roamed the american plains in 
uncounted numbers he said they destroyed the bison in 15 
years

a massive influx of soviet jews is reawakening 
a sense of national pride among israelis who are volunteering to 
help the newcomers and even furnishing whole apartments for them 
the outpouring of good will has surprised government officials 
and immigration activists who just weeks ago were having trouble 
shaking israelis out of their attitude of suspicion toward new 
immigrants 
its as though a revolution has struck israeli society in 
many places we have more volunteers ready to help the immigrants 
than we have immigrants said yuri stern a russian immigrant and 
an adviser to parliaments committee on immigration absorption 
for the first time in many years israelis are seizing this 
chance to fulfill their destiny and their major reason for being 
said stern referring to israels founding as a homeland for all 
jews in 1948 
the dream of ingathering the exiles was popularized by 
israels first prime minister david bengurion who spoke of 
aliyah a biblical word for moving up to the holy land as 
a top national priority along with building an army 
as the immigrant flow rises israelis also are realizing the 
numbers of jews in their country is being significantly enhanced 
a welcome prospect with figures showing the arab population growing 
faster than the jewish population 
the demographic issue bothered israeli society in a way that 
many people just submerged and now they see another halfmillion 
jews may arrive its a historic development for us said michael 
kleiner a member of prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing 
likud bloc who chairs parliaments immigration committee 
kleiner said the immigration wave also provided a psychological 
lift after more than two years of the palestinian uprising that has 
divided israelis and damaged the countrys image abroad 
i dont remember this rise in spirits since the six day war 
of 1967 when israel defeated three arab armies kleiner said 
the influx began last year when 12000 soviets arrived more 
than five times the total in 1988 the pace quickened in january 
with 4800 arrivals and the government predicts up to 100000 
soviets will immigrate by years end 
in the next decade officials say 500000 soviet jews could 
settle in israel because of liberalized kremlin exit policies 
growing unrest in the soviet union and tighter us visa 
restrictions 
with the israeli government too financially strapped to handle 
the rush of arrivals at least 50 voluntary organizations are 
working nationwide along with dozens of neighborhood councils to 
encourage israelis to adopt soviet families 
thousands of individual citizens also have organized projects 
in jerusalems gilo neighborhood for example meir and rachel 
monsonego helped furnish an apartment across the hall when 
immigrants victor and katya savitsky moved in 
we need these immigrants and we want them to stay so we have 
to help said meir monsonego an electric company worker who 
emigrated from morocco at the age of 10 
the savitskys who have an infant and an 8yearold daughter 
lena arrived with only an old green trunk full of clothes victor 
40 an engineer and translator of scientific documents said he 
left moscow because he feared growing antisemitism 
savitsky said he considered trying to join relatives in the 
united states now he said he would prefer to land a job in 
israel 
as his 11monthold daughter sophya crawled on the floor 
savitsky gestured toward gifts from neighbors a crib and a childs 
bed a new gas range an electric heater and a living room armchair 
i like the openness of people that i have found here its an 
important thing especially when you are new savitsky said 
across town in jerusalems neve yaacov suburb retired traffic 
safety official tuviah diamant took asya eisenstadt an economist 
from minsk to israels bank leumi to try to get her a job despite 
her broken hebrew 
we need to encourage as many immigrants as possible he told 
the bank manager who said he would consider the application 
elitzur mordechai a social worker who is organizing volunteers 
in jerusalems east talpiot quarter said many israelis empathized 
with the newcomers who must deal with red tape and infighting 
among government agencies this week their plight was worsened by 
a walkout of 350 immigration employees in a labor dispute 
we get involved emotionally when we see people put in 
unpleasant circumstances arriving at empty apartments mordechai 
said 
contrasting with the warm welcome from most israelis is 
lingering resentment among many sephardi jews those from arab and 
asian countries they claim the newcomers are better treated than 
their relatives were during the 1950s wave of immigration they 
worry that soviet immigrants will be given jobs and welfare funds 
that would otherwise go to sephardis 
a typical complaint came from jerusalem shopkeeper nahum cohen 
whose parents were from syria he went into a tirade in his dusty 
clothing store as he heard shamir quoted by the radio as saying the 
russians can live anywhere they choose 
im glad theyre coming to fill the country with jews but why 
do the russians get to live in the big cities while many of our 
families were forced to help settle the negev desert this is 
discrimination cohen said

women will be at sea in british warships by the 
end of this year ending a longstanding ban on women in combat 
roles because there is a shortage of male recruits the government 
says 
women will also be eligible to join the royal marines and fly 
navy aircraft but will be barred from submarines where privacy 
cannot be provided in cramped conditions the defense ministry said 
in mondays announcement 
the ministry said ships will be modified to allow women to live 
in them and aircraft carriers will be among the first to have women 
in their crews it said women will initially be employed as radio 
and radar operators and in engineering work on aircraft 
archibald hamilton armed forces minister told the house of 
commons that the admiralty was unanimous in the decision and 
expected that women would be quickly accepted after initial 
opposition from some sailors and their wives 
the navy army and air force have recruited women for many years 
but not for combat roles and the army and air force will continue 
that ban 
the ministry said the difference is in the nature of naval 
operations and the fact that combat at sea is different to that on 
land or in the air 
the dutch navy has had women among its crews for several years 
a few women with a taste for the rough life joined the royal 
navy disguised as men in the 18th century days of adm horatio 
nelson and several served at the battle of trafalgar in 1805 
navy records indicate that when discovered some of the women 
were allowed to stay on board as long as they continued to wear 
mens clothes

the battle between rebel gen michel aoun 
and militia chief samir geagea is one of the bloodiest episodes in 
the long power struggle among maronite catholics lebanons 
dominant christian sect 
since the lebanese civil war began in april 1975 the christians 
have sought to present a united front against moslems and leftists 
who have had support from syria iran and libya 
disputes among moslems factions frequently turn into armed 
confrontations but the christians usually have been able to avoid 
open war among themselves 
lebanons maronites are the only christians to hold power in the 
middle east maronites have dominated the army government and 
judiciary since independence from france in 1943 and before aoun 
the military generally stayed out of the civil war 
its first serious involvement came last year when aoun then 
army commander went to war with syrian troops in lebanon and 
fought sporadic actions against geageas powerful lebanese forces 
the main christian militia 
president amin gemayel appointed aoun interim prime minister in 
september 1988 when his sixyear term ended with parliament unable 
to agree on a successor and the general considers himself the only 
legitimate authority in lebonon 
he does not recognize elias hrawi a fellow maronite who was 
elected president in november and fired him as army commander 
the christian power struggle has centered on the three most 
powerful maronite dynasties gemayels chamouns and franjiehs 
each family had its private army lucrative interests and 
political influence and each produced presidents of lebanon by 
unwritten agreement since independence lebanons president has 
been a maronite the prime minister a sunni moslem and the speaker 
of parliament a shiite moslem 
rivalries between the christian clans has claimed hundreds of 
lives in the last 15 years 
the rightwing phalangists of the late pierre gemayel fought the 
tigers militia of former president camille chamoun in february 
1976 10 months after the civil war began 
as the war dragged on the gemayels tried to become supreme 
among the maronites gemayels charismatic youngest son bashir 
emerged as their military leader and in 1978 he began trying to 
eliminate his rivals 
his first target was the franjiehs who had allied themselves 
with the syrians and had a fiefdom in north lebanon centered on the 
mountain town of zghorta scores of militiamen were killed in 
shootouts 
on june 13 bashir gemayel sent 100 men to attack former 
president suleiman franjiehs summer palace at ehden 65 miles 
north of beirut the assault was led by samir geagea a young 
former medical student and policemans son who had impressed bashir 
the raiders killed franjiehs oldest son tony his wife vera 
their 3yearold daughter jehane and 30 bodyguards 
tony franjieh was his fathers heir apparent a member of 
parliament and commander of the clans militia the marada or 
giants 
in february 1980 a car bomb killed bashir gemayels daughter 
maya and seven phalangists more more than 300 phalangists were 
killed in the months that followed 
by 1980 bashir had merged the phalange militia and other 
christian groups into the lebanese forces and taken over interests 
that produced an estimated 100 million a year 
on july 7 his militia defeated chamouns tigers a force of 
2000 men in one of the bloodiest showdowns in the christian 
enclave north and east of beirut 
gemayels fighters showed no mercy in one chamounist coastal 
resort they cut power to the elevators and worked their way 
through the building hurling people from the upper floors and 
shooting at them as they fell to their deaths 
police said more than 300 people were slain chamouns son dany 
claimed the total was 530 
bashir gemayel was elected president in september 1982 after 
the israeli invasion of lebanon and moslems appeared ready to deal 
with him he was killed by a bomb at phalange headquarters nine 
days before inauguration and his brother amin became president 
instead 
after bashirs death phalangist militiamen slaughtered hundreds 
of palestinians in beiruts sabra and chatilla refugee camps 
in january 1986 geagea teamed up with amin gemayel to oust the 
militia commander elie hobeika who had signed a treaty with 
moslem militia chieftains arranged by syria more than 350 people 
were killed 
a year ago aoun attacked the lebanese forces to curb geageas 
growing power at least 82 people were killed in three days of 
fighting in christian east beirut 
aoun won the battle but could not crush the lebanese forces and 
the ultimate result was the battle that began jan 30

at the beer barrel saloon the talk was 
uncharacteristically sober no super bowl reminiscing no dreaming 
of spring fishing patrons talked of tanks and president bush 
bushs proposal last week to end orders for the limabuilt m1 
tanks was a direct hit on their jobs they work at the lima army 
tank plant and his plan could put them and thousands of others out 
of work 
i got this bad feeling that the plant is going to close for 
good said pat sample a 31yearold welder who has worked at the 
northwestern ohio plant since 1982 a lot of people feel the same 
way 
samples friend wayne thomas shook his head saying it 
doesnt make sense we make the best damn tanks in the world and 
now the government says it doesnt want them 
in the presidents 1991 budget proposal the plant would close 
along with a sister general dynamics corp tank plant in warren 
mich 
some believe the lima factory allen countys largest employer 
will never reopen after its scheduled march 1993 closing others 
are more optimistic saying the factory will keep operating even 
if on a smaller scale 
i think what our workers have to remember is that this is just 
a proposal its not the bottom line and congress hasnt acted on 
it yet said darrell cole president of united auto workers union 
local 2075 which represents 1800 production and maintenance 
workers at the plant 
i think there are some people around in congress that think we 
need some tanks 
more than 13000 ohio workers depend on the plant for their 
jobs including 2600 employed by general dynamics and 11000 by 
suppliers 
us rep michael oxley a republican whose district includes 
lima has promised to urge fellow house members to modify the 
proposal general dynamics also promises to lobby against the 
proposal 
oxley said tank production should not be reduced when the soviet 
unions tanks outnumber the united states by 31 he also said one 
option to keep the lima plant operating was to export tanks 
army spokesman lt col dick bridges said plans call for the 
factory to be idle until the military begins production of its next 
generation of the armys main battle tank and other heavy vehicles 
the starting date probably wont be before 1994 
bridges said the proposed pentagon budget of 303 billion 
provides for production of 163 m1a1 tanks and 62 m1a2 tanks he 
said the lima plant now in m1a1 production would be closed after 
completing production of the tanks in the 1991 budget 
this city of 50000 once a manufacturing hub carved out in the 
middle of rich farm land has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs 
in recent years many of the laid off workers found jobs at the 
plant 
mayor david berger said closing the plant would be devastating 
the community would be really hurt he said those are 
very highpaying positions and to replace those would be very 
difficult 
a plant closing though is not without precedent 
it was opened in 1942 by united motors service a general motors 
corp division during word war ii it handled nearly every type of 
vehicle in the amrys motorized fleet including amphibious landing 
craft cargo carriers and tanks 
but after the korean war its importance declined and in 1959 
it closed it didnt reopen until 1976 with the production of the 
m1 tank the army spent 40 million in plant renovations 
chrysler corp ran the plant until 1982 when it sold its 
defense subsidiary to general dynamics which renamed it the lima 
army tank center 
general dynamics fouryear 35 billion contract with the army 
to produce 3299 m1 tanks is in its final year the 67ton tank 
has a top speed of 45 mph and is considered the worlds most 
advanced battle tank 
some dont see the closing as all bad 
i hate to see it happen said don downhour 72 a production 
control worker at a westinghouse plant before he retired it will 
hurt lima but we dont need tanks if were going to have peace 
and thats what weve been praying for

two months after mutineers nearly 
toppled president corazon aquino there have been few signs of 
steps to combat the social economic and political problems that 
contributed to the coup attempt 
instead most efforts have been directed at tracking down those 
behind the bloody dec 19 uprising and at presenting a facade of 
normalcy to lure back foreign investors and tourists 
bold words about swift punishment for enemies of the people 
and a new beginning have bogged down rumors of a new coup 
attempt fill the capitals newspapers despite the arrests of 
several key conspirators 
mrs aquinos declaration of a 60day national state of 
emergency has made little difference except to allow the state to 
set price controls on rice and other essentials and to assume 
operation of some transport companies 
the pattern is similar to the governments response to the 
august 1987 coup attempt then mrs aquino declared herself a 
committee of one to ride herd over a bloated inefficient 
bureaucracy 
a few months later it was business as usual garbage went 
uncollected telephones broke down and transport deteriorated 
the political situation remains unsettled us deputy 
assistant secretary of defense carl ford told the house 
subcommittee on asia and the pacific last week many wonder 
whether the government can recover from the blow sufficiently to 
restore popular confidence and make lasting strides toward 
stability 
some observers fear the military has become so politicized that 
mrs aquino can do little to end the coup attempts which have 
plagued her since she took power in the february 1986 uprising 
against ferdinand marcos 
what can mrs aquino do to stop more coups nothing wrote 
teodore locsin jr publisher of the philippine daily globe and 
mrs aquinos sometimes speechwriter 
that presents a formidable challenge to president bush who is 
committed to supporting mrs aquino and ordered us warplanes to 
help crush the december coup 
since the coup attempt in which 113 people were killed and more 
than 600 injured an appearance of normalcy has returned 
most of the nighttime roadblocks near the presidential palace 
have been removed there is no evidence of largescale flight of 
capital but the peso is weakening against the dollar inflation 
reached 14 percent in december and is expected to remain in 
doubledigits this year 
private economists predict economic growth will slow to between 
4 percent and 5 percent from 55 percent last year 
during the coup attempt rebel leaders cited a failure of 
leadership corruption inefficiency rising prices and 
deteriorating infrastructure as reasons for removing mrs aquino 
mrs aquino never publicly acknowledged any validity to rebels 
demands and instead branded them powergrabbers and mad 
dogs seeking to restore a marcosstyle dictatorship 
three weeks later however she revamped her cabinet replacing 
secretaries of transport agriculture agrarian reform and other 
departments which had come under the sharpest public criticism 
but personnel shifts have not been matched by dramatic changes 
in policy in some cases stopgap measures to correct one problem 
exacerbated others 
for example in the weeks before the coup attempt manila was 
plagued by frequent electric power outages which the national 
power corporation blamed on the palaces failure to approve 
purchase of new generating equipment 
during the coup attempt the outages ceased and christmas 
lights returned to public streets later the government 
acknowledged that it increased power output by diverting drinking 
water to hydroelectric projects 
now manila faces a critical water shortage 
corruption remains endemic during testimony in washington last 
week us deputy assistant secretary of state david lambertson 
said corruption remains a real problem in the philippines and 
its corrosive effects hamper government operations 
critics blame much of the governments inefficiency on a 
bureaucratic presidential staff that fails to coordinate and 
prioritize policy 
cabinet members and department heads are retained or fired 
because of loyalty to mrs aquino critics say 
miriam defensor santiago who was removed as agrarian reform 
secretary in december complained that weekly cabinet meetings had 
degenerated into fruitless debating seminars 
what happened is that it became a workshop a seminar where 
everyone could speak off the cuff on subjects where their knowledge 
was only skin deep mrs santiago said 
complaints persist that the government is unable to use foreign 
aid effectively elliot richardson president bushs special 
representative to the international philippine aid plan said 
recently the government must demonstrate it can spend money 
effectively if it expects congress to approve 200 million in aid 
most changes in government policy must be approved by the 
unwieldy bicameral congress established after mrs aquino took 
power even the state of emergency had to be ratified by congress 
which rejected administration requests for curbs on strikes and 
other tough measures 
blas ople an opposition politician and member of the 1986 
constitutional commission said the framers of the charter should 
have forged a more streamlined single chamber 
some observers believe no reforms will satisfy dissidents in the 
military deeply politicized during marcos eight years of martial 
law politicization deepened in 1986 when dissident officers 
mutinied against marcos triggering the people power revolution 
which toppled his administration 
we opened a pandoras box when we admired and lionized rebel 
soldiers in 1986 said brig gen rodolfo biazon who played a 
key role in crushing the december coup 
military sources claim opposition to mrs aquino is broadbased 
in the 160000member armed forces and that many units are ready to 
strike again

rajiv gandhi lost the prime ministry and 
most of his 1800 security guards after national elections but 
death threats from sikh extremists remain as he moves from his 
government compound to a smaller home 
spikepointed fences metal detectors and watch towers are being 
installed outside gandhis new threebedroom bungalow to protect 
him from the sikhs who assassinated his mother prime minister 
indira gandhi 
some say he faces another threat at his new address ghosts 
three former officials including gandhis younger brother 
sanjay died after moving into the 30yearold house previous 
occupants or their servants lit candles every evening under a 
massive banyan tree in a hindu ceremony to try to drive out evil 
spirits 
i personally do not believe that this house is haunted but i 
am told that there is something said krishna kant tiwari its 
last occupant i thought it proper that i should tell mr gandhi 
about it but our leader does not believe in ghosts demons or 
stuff like haunted houses 
tiwari was gandhis minister of information and broadcasting and 
lost his seat in parliament in the november elections 
former prime minister lal bahadur shastri who died in office in 
1965 once lived there a senior government adviser died after 
moving to the house sanjay gandhi had his office at the home when 
he was killed stuntflying his light plane in 1980 
although none of the three died in the house the ghost stories 
persisted and the house remained unoccupied until tiwari arrived in 
1985 
tiwaris wife continued the custom of lighting a candle under 
the banyan tree and often summoned priests to perfom pujas or 
religious ceremonies hindus believe ghosts are scared of fire and 
the flame was meant as an evocation of the hindu fire god agni 
since losing his job to vp singh in novembers election 
gandhi has stayed in the prime ministers compound while his new 
home was being renovated 
in moving to the bungalow gandhi his wife sonia and their 
two children are losing most of their 1800 security guards 
the number of guards assigned to the new residence has not been 
disclosed for security reasons the times of india said sunday that 
the opposition congress party leader would now have about 125 
security men while the sunday observer without giving numbers 
claimed the new contingent of bodyguards would be onesixth the 
size of the old group 
the new government says the 45yearold gandhi a former airline 
pilot will continue to be adequately protected but threats remain 
from sikh separatists who gandhi like his mother sought to quell 
by expelling them from their faiths holiest shrine the golden 
temple in the northern city of amritsar 
gandhi took office on oct 31 1984 the day his mother was 
assassinated 
while in office his entourage included decoy cars and 
ambulances carrying people with the same blood type as gandhi 
should he need it under the security network which cost 176 
million annually flights were diverted whenever gandhi was in the 
air 
we even protected mr gandhi from possible stinger missile 
attack threats will this government do it asked palaniappam 
chidambaram gandhis former internal security minister let 
there be no doubt whatsoever that mr gandhi is and will continue 
to be the target of terrorist groups 
according to a wellplaced source secret service agents foiled 
at least four assassination plots against gandhi after he became 
prime minister 
the only publicly known attempt against gandhi came in 1986 when 
a lone gunman penetrated his security cordon at a public memorial 
and fired at him from a crude 12gauge shotgun gandhi was not hit 
but two other people were wounded the gunman was captured and his 
trial is still underway 
threats develop overnight but do not recede overnight said 
chidambram and in the case of mr gandhi there is no sign that it 
will ever recede

walk into any 7eleven store in this british 
colony look past the slurpee machine to the liquor selection and 
start counting chances are up to a dozen brands of french cognac 
will be on display 
welcome to hong kong where prosperity and an obsession with 
status blend to create what may be the worlds capital of 
conspicuous consumption 
cognac flows like water luxury cars jam the streets pricy 
portable telephones are the rage and droves of people spend small 
fortunes on flashy wristwatches 
theres a lot of ostentatious display among hong kong people 
because the achievement of wealth is such a driving force in 
peoples lives explains sk cheong head of marketing for 
television broadcasts ltd the territorys no 1 television 
station 
a recent international survey conducted by the marketing firm 
backer spielvogel bates worldwide found that nearly half of hong 
kong people say owning expensive cars and jewelry are important 
goals 
only onethird of japanese and onequarter of americans surveyed 
felt the same way 
here are the stats that tell the story 
about 12 percent of the private cars on hong kong roads are 
mercedesbenz which cost from nearly 40000 to more than three 
times that amount according to cp moore managing director of 
the local dealership 
as far as we know that is the highest penetration on earth 
for mercedes he said 
nearly 1000 rolls royce luxury automobiles which can cost 
almost 400000 cruise the local streets giving this tiny british 
colony of 57 million people the highest concentration of rolls 
royces in the world said russell blythe sales and marketing 
manager of the hong kong dealer 
nearly 50 brands of wristwatches most of them among the 
priciest on the market were advertised on hong kongs four 
television channels last year 
bulgari an exclusive italian manufacturer of jewelry has two 
stores in hong kong and eight for the rest of the world the most 
popular bulgari watches cost about 4500 but are often out of 
stock here 
about 100 fur retailers are listed in the 1990 telephone book 
of this subtropical city whose climatic claim to fame is stifling 
heat and humidity for much of the year 
about 70000 handheld portable telephones which generally cost 
1500 or more have been sold in hong kong although pay phones 
and community phones are ubiquitous 
per capita consumption of cognac is widely believed to be the 
highest in the world with 357000 cases of brandy entering the 
colony last year or slightly more than one bottle per person age 
20 or older 
shelves of neighborhood food stands often are stocked with 
bottles priced at 200 
in explaining such sales local analysts note that the rapid 
growth of hong kongs exportled economy in the past decade made 
millionaires of many local entrepreneurs and left countless other 
people with money to spend the low business and personal tax rates 
in the colony have ensured a high level of disposable income 
but the thirst for status or face among the local chinese 
appears to be the main driving force behind the colonys 
conspicuous consumption 
when they have accumulated some wealth they like to spend it 
on visible things to show off says joseph wan finance director 
for dickson concepts ltd which has recorded 50 percent compound 
annual growth for the past five years by selling expensive name 
brands in hong kong and elsewhere in the region 
its an affluent city everybody wants respect agrees james 
js wong host of the popular latenight talk show no 
restrictions tonight 
cheong the television marketing manager believes social 
pressure is intense to acquire possessions that advertise ones 
wealth he acknowledged considering buying a wristwatch for several 
thousand dollars because of peer pressure 
still the local demand for statusenhancing products may not be 
limitless sales of some luxury goods fell after chinese troops 
ruthlessly quashed the prodemocracy movement in beijing and the 
longterm health of the market is unclear with hong kong being 
handed over to communist china in 1997 
although beijing has guaranteed that hong kong can maintain its 
freewheeling capitalist ways until the middle of the 21st century 
many local residents are skeptical of such promises 
but for now capitalism and conspicuous consumption remain very 
much alive in the territory 
i see it as a beauty of hong kong rather than a minus said 
wong you work hard and you make your fortune and now youre 
allowed to show that 
its another form of freedom

after the forms are filled in and the 
computers are whirring away the time will come for one of the most 
controversial political decisions ever for the us census 
whether to adjust the results to make up for undercounting in some 
areas 
none of the 20 prior us censuses has managed to count 
everybody and no one expects this national head count to be perfect 
either 
but this year for the first time some statisticians believe 
they can significantly improve the results by adjusting the final 
numbers 
and since the final figures are used to distribute billions of 
dollars in federal funds and seats in the house of 
representatives forces on both sides of the issue are already at 
war 
a census bureau analysis estimated that the 1980 national head 
count missed more than 3 million people or 14 percent of the 
population 
it wouldnt make much difference if that were spread out evenly 
but it isnt minorities and poor people living in large cities are 
missed more often than others 
its harder to count hispanics too especially those who are 
here illegally 
men are missed more often than women young people more than the 
elderly and overall young black men are missed most often 
new york and a group of other large cities contending the 
undercount cheated them of money and representation sued for an 
adjustment in the 1980 census the government responded that it was 
unable to improve the count and the courts rejected the suit 
but in the meantime statisticians worked out methods they 
believe can make the necessary adjustments and improve the census 
their plan would use an extensive postcensus survey in selected 
areas to check on how many people were missed 
by comparing that survey with the census for the same regions 
they could estimate the undercount the estimate then could be used 
to adjust the figures for all similar areas enough surveys would 
allow adjustment of the whole census statisticians contend 
but in 1987 the commerce department announced there would be no 
adjustment in 1990 department officials contended the methods were 
not proven and that changing the numbers would shake public 
confidence in the figures 
since the blacks and other minorities most often missed are 
mostly democrats there was an outcry that the decision was a crass 
political move by the reagan administration 
barbara a bailer a top census official resigned over the 
action saying the census bureau hadnt been consulted by the 
commerce department 
and new york city new york state california los angeles 
chicago houston dade county fla and several civil rights 
groups filed another lawsuit 
that one was settled with an agreement that the government would 
reconsider adjustment and would publish criteria for deciding 
whether to adjust the figures 
the final decision on adjustment is to be made by july 15 1991 
15 months after the april 1 official count 
but those backing an adjustment say the decision has already 
been made 
the guidelines suggest changing the count only if it can be 
shown that the results would be more accurate on both a national 
and local level and discourage adjustment if it would result in 
confusion disrupt the political process or undermine public 
confidence in the census numbers 
the proposed guidelines so stack the deck against the 
possibility of correction that their adoption will be tantamount to 
a decision not to correct the differential undercount charged 
new york attorney general robert abrams 
michael r darby commerce undersecretary for economic affairs 
said the department hopes to take such an accurate census that 
adjustment wont be needed but if adjustment has to be considered 
he said the guidelines are still under development and can be 
modified 
observed rep william r thomas rcalif the census is a 
political act and there are winners and losers the losers say 
count differently and the winners say leave it alone 
meanwhile the census bureau says it is hiring 315000 temporary 
workers in addition to its usual staff to track down people who 
dont mail back the census forms they will receive in late march 
in april and may 200000 census workers will go into 
neighborhoods small towns and across rural america to interview 
people another 115000 workers will remain in offices tabulating 
information and contacting people by phone officials said

presidentelect rafael angel 
calderon the driven son of a discredited former president plans 
to focus his energies on improving social justice in his 
country 
calderon who founded his social christian party defeated 
carlos manue castillo of the incumbent national liberation party in 
sundays election 
he will succeed president oscar arias who could not succeed 
himself 
calderon 40 is a clear supporter of washingtons policy in 
latin america 
he backs us aid to help el salvador fight its leftist 
guerrilla insurgency and visited panama to congratulate president 
guillermo endara shortly after the us invasion that toppled gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
but focusing on costa ricas domestic problems may affect the 
dynamics of the central american peace process which was driven by 
arias activist foreign policy 
i will support the peace process but i believe the main duty 
of a costa rican president is to deal with costa ricas problems i 
will let my foreign minister focus on foreign policy calderon 
said at a news conference friday 
calderons campaign culminated a long effort to restore the 
memory of his father rafael angel calderon guardia who also 
became president at age 40 and erved from 1940 to 1944 however he 
was exiled after he tried to nullify the results of the 1948 vote 
calderon whose full name in spanish style is rafael angel 
calderon fournier is familiarly known as junior 
during the campaign he agreed that the economy had improved 
under two national liberation governments but that was not the 
problem in his view 
a social breach is opening in this country between rich and 
poor he said 
calderon campaigned on a populist platform that drew comparisons 
to his fathers social reforms which included establishment of 
social security 
he promised a housing program for the poor and alarmed some 
businessmen by saying he would require large businesses to 
establish profitsharing plans 
but he also promised to reduce government deficit spending and 
it was not clear how he would manage both 
his father became an ogre of costa rican democracy by attempting 
to overturn the results of the 1948 election after a 40day 
revolution the army was abolished and calderons father was sent 
into exile 
calderon himself was born in nicaragua on march 14 1949 and 
spent much of his childhood in mexico city he eventually became a 
lawyer but he started working in his fathers old party the 
calderon republicans by the age of 16 
at 21 he became director of social security at 25 he was a 
national assembly delegate and at 29 he became foreign minister 
calderon first ran for president in 1982 for a coalition headed 
by the republicans drawing 33 percent of the vote 
he put some distance between himself and his fathers legacy by 
founding the social christian unity party in 1983 and in 1986 he 
made a strong losing race against arias 
this time he ran a careful campaign trying to take advantage of 
his fathers history as a reformer without raising the specter of 
1948 
calderon said repeatedly that he planned to focus on costa 
ricas problems not the problem of peace in central america 
that stood as an implicit criticism of arias who won the nobel 
prize in 1987 for his efforts to obtain regional agreements to 
bring peace to el salvador and nicaragua 
calderon is seen as likely to maintain close relations with 
salvadors president alfredo cristiani guatemalas vinicio cerezo 
and rafael callejas of honduras 
arias trying to present himself as an honest broker was 
careful to avoid the appearance of ganging up on nicaraguan 
president daniel ortegas sandinistas 
calderon also supports the creation of a permanent 400man 
special police force to deal with emergency situations including 
border incidents 
the proposal is somewhat controversial since costa rica has no 
army and only lightly armed police because of his own fathers 
actions 
calderon a devout roman catholic married gloria bejarano de 
calderon a native of mexico in 1972 they have four children 
rafael angel gloria gabriela and marco antonio

congressional democrats frustrated that 
president bush is winning high approval ratings without addressing 
what they see as the hard problems of governing are ready for an 
electionyear session with a sharp partisan edge 
bushs state of the union speech last week crystallized the 
feelings of many on capitol hill who saw it as a glowing vision of 
america without any substantive support 
the budget bush sent to congress two days earlier largely 
ignored areas like education health care and the environment they 
said and for a democratic party that has lost five of the last six 
presidential elections the frustration is beginning to boil over 
apparently were not getting our message across to people who 
consider themselves to be democrats said rep vic fazio 
dcalif we have to sharpen the message 
one way to do that according to a growing number of house 
democrats is to be more willing to take bush on directly rather 
than seeking compromise and accommodation 
use democratic power in congress to send the president popular 
legislation and let him veto it if he disagrees the reasoning 
goes that will draw sharper ideological lines between the parties 
and more clearly tell voters what democrats stand for 
the subject was a frequent topic at a private retreat last week 
attended by about 160 members of the house democratic caucus the 
twoday issues conference in suburban columbia md was a 
chance for lawmakers to listen to pollsters talk about voters 
wants and fears and to talk to each other about how to get the 
party back on the track to the white house 
we think theres a growing anxiety about our drifting as a 
nation said house speaker thomas foley dwash our drifting 
toward a lower standard of living our drifting toward less 
competence in education in science and mathematics our growing 
problems in international competition americans want something 
better than that 
its clear that bush is personally popular foley said but we 
do have a difference over the emphasis we should be giving to some 
of these problems and were going to try to speak about those more 
clearly and more dramatically in the days ahead where we have 
disagreements the american people expect us to raise our voices 
and take our stand 
democrats at the conference took broad philosophical looks at 
topics like the role of government economic opportunity and the 
role of the united states in the world members came up with a 
series of bold ideas for party initiatives that will continue 
to be refined said caucus chairman steny hoyer dmd adding that 
most address voters concerns about future security 
people think theyre doing pretty well but theyre concerned 
about their children theyre not as optimistic as they were 
hoyer said the better democrats address those fears the better 
were going to do electorally he said 
hoyer acknowledged that democrats must overcome lingering 
perceptions that they are softer than republicans on national 
defense and crime we want to make sure america stays strong we 
havent conveyed that as well as we should have he said 
it remained unclear which issues democrats will choose for 
confrontations with the white house and where the party could 
find the cohesion to make such an attack work 
the proposal by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny to cut the 
social security payroll tax has divided the party moynihan 
contends republican administrations have been using surplus funds 
from the tax to mask the size of the budget deficit instead of 
putting the money aside for future social security payments 
there was no consensus among democrats at the retreat and 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo conceded it was hard to 
find quick agreement in such a large group this proposal is very 
farreaching in its implications we dont think its a trivial 
matter were going to take our time he said

slovenias liberal communists have 
broken with the national party over its resistance to swift 
democratic change further eroding the authority of the institution 
that has ruled yugoslavia since 1945 
slovenias determination to chart its own course raises the 
possibility of the disintegration of the loose yugoslav federation 
which is riven by disputes arising from ethnic tensions and 
economic troubles 
the dispute over the pace of reform has led to the outbreak of a 
virtual trade war between the relatively affluent northern republic 
of slovenia and archrival serbia the largest and most populous of 
yugoslavias six republics 
last month slovenias communists stormed out of a national 
party congress dominated by hardliners led by serbia 
yugoslavs increasingly criticize the apparent inability of the 
partys fractious regional leaderships to take steps to deal with 
the worst economic and political crisis under communist rule 
the break from the national party by the slovenian party is the 
first such rift in the 45year rule of the communists whose 
authority is in decline 
by contrast the authority of federal premier ante markovic and 
his government which is undertaking a radical economic reform 
program is rising 
in sundays emergency meeting the slovenian party also changed 
its name and called for the release of all political prisoners an 
end to all political trials and immediate talks between yugoslav 
communists and leaders of newly formed opposition parties 
it demanded that opposition political parties be legalized 
throughout yugoslavia 
slovenias communist party president ciril ribicic said the 
new party is not seeking secession from yugoslavia but rather the 
establishment of a yugoslav confederation that restricts central 
authority 
this is the end of the league of communists of yugoslavia in 
which slovenian communists had the status of an unequal minority 
said ribicic using the formal name of the national party 
the national party doesnt exist any more for us said petar 
bekes another slovenian party leader 
slovenian communists aware of rising criticism of communism in 
their westwardlooking region have moved quickly in the past three 
years to create a more democratic political system in the republic 
they have scheduled multiparty elections for april and at last 
months national party congress told those resisting reform that 
the communist party risks a hasty demise if it does not address the 
peoples democratic yearnings 
the slovenes have also criticize serbia for its handling of 
unrest in the southern province of kosovo where at least 25 ethnic 
albanian protesters have been killed in clashes with police since 
jan 24 the albanians the ethnic majority in kosovo are 
demanding more say in how their province is governed 
the slovenian reforms have been criticized harshly in serbia 
where the ruling communist hardliners demand continued national 
communist dominance 
last months national party congress was indefinitely adjourned 
but slovenian leaders said sunday they are not returning 
we do not want to be a part of an oldstyle dogmatic 
organization such as yugoslavias league of communists bekes 
told reporters he said however that the slovenian communists 
will remain open for cooperation with all democraticorientated 
forces in other yugoslav republics 
he said slovenia from now on will have no representatives in the 
national communist leadership but is open to form a coalition with 
the federal leadership on the national level 
the strains between serbia and slovenia have led in recent weeks 
to a virtual trade war on sunday the state news agency tanjug 
said the governments of the republics would enter negotiations to 
try and end their dispute 
yugoslavias communists were the first to break with the 
sovietled communist bloc in 1948 but the country has been slower 
in adopting democratic reforms than other east european countries 
because of its deep ethnic and economic divisions 
yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces each with its own government and party structure 
the decentralized system of government and collective federal 
presidency were devised in 1974 to prevent one republic from 
gaining sway over the others but has resulted in an ineffective 
government by compromise 
the federal government is generally responsible for economic 
policy while the collective presidency which appoints the premier 
dictates defense and foreign policy but the bulk of political 
influence in the country has traditionally been concentrated in the 
communist party 
the slovenian communist party which was formally known as 
league of communists of slovania changed its name to lcsthe 
party for democratic renewal its platform will be similar to 
western european social democratic parties bekes said

sen dave durenberger goes before the ethics 
committee this week to explain his book contract and real estate 
deal making him the first in a long list of lawmakers facing 
scrutiny this year by fellow senators 
durenbergers case while less publicized than those of five 
senators who received contributions from savings and loan owner 
charles keating has led to public disapproval in polls back home 
in minnesota and newspaper editorial calls for him to resign 
theres no question that the issue has filtered down to the 
grassroots level but i also think its still in the questioning 
stage says rep vin weber a fellow minnesota republican i 
didnt have a lot of people damning dave durenberger but i did 
have a lot of people asking me about dave 
durenberger a 55yearold political moderate denies any 
intentional wrongdoing in a case that involves a book contract he 
is accused of using to launder speaking fees numerous 
lobbyistpaid trips to boston to visit a marriage counselor and a 
system under which he charged the government for staying in a 
minneapolis condominium of which he was part owner 
he says he has given no thought to resigning the seat he won for 
a third term a little more than a year ago 
still he has apologized to voters for lapses of judgment 
and repaid the senate 11000 last month after the rules committee 
said he was not entitled to reimbursements for daily expenses while 
using the condo during congressional recesses 
after durenberger appears before the panel the committee must 
decide whether to issue a statement of possible violations similar 
to an indictment that would trigger an investigation similar to a 
trial in which the committee would decide whether violations of 
ethical standards occurred 
if violations are found the committee could recommend 
disciplinary actions ranging from a reprimand to expulsion 
aside from durenberger the ethics committee has a busy work 
load 
also under scrutiny are five senators whose campaigns and 
political causes received 13 million from sampl owner keating his 
relatives and employees the five are accused of improperly 
intervening with federal banking regulators on behalf of keating 
whose lincoln sampl now ranks as the biggest thrift failure in the 
nation estimated to cost taxpayers up to 2 billion 
the senators are john mccain rariz democratic whip alan 
cranston of california donald riegle jr dmich chairman of the 
banking committee dennis deconcini dariz and john glenn 
dohio 
in a separate matter the role of sen alfonse damato rny 
in several housing deals also is being examined 
the house ethics committee also has several cases under review 
durenbergers staff has refused to discuss the senators 
expected appearance on thursday he has turned down requests for 
interviews since telling a newspaper last month that unreleased 
depositions tend to support allegations that he used the book deal 
to launder speaking fees 
the ethics committee hired a special counsel in august to 
investigate allegations that durenberger made 100000 in violation 
of senate honoraria limits through a contract to promote two books 
written under his name 
the rules committee concluded that durenberger was not entitled 
to expense money for staying in the minneapolis condo he has 
reimbursed the money but committee members said other unspecified 
aspects of the deal also need to be examined by the ethics 
committee 
several newspapers in and out of minnesota including the 
mankato minn free press and the boston herald have called for 
durenberger to resign and polls show minnesotans are losing faith 
in him 
more than 70 percent of minnesota adults want durenberger to 
resign if the committee finds significant wrongdoing according to 
two statewide polls published last week 
the case has been costly to durenberger financially as well as 
politically 
in addition to the 11000 he repaid the senate his campaign 
treasury last year paid 160059 in legal fees and he still has 
another 85847 in unpaid bills from his lawyer according to his 
1989 campaign finance report

booming development along the south 
carolina coast has made worried scientists count bills 
nobody knows for sure what toll development has taken on bird 
populations along the states 200mile coastline but researchers 
suspect an 80 percent 10year decline for one kind a little gray 
and white shore bird called the sanderling 
the sanderling which runs with abandon toward water only to 
retreat from rushing waves is being counted by volunteers for a 
consortium of academics and state officials 
scientists suspect south carolina coasts with its wealth of 
estuaries and marshland is an important resting place for some 
migratory birds that spend summers in the arctic and winter in the 
tropics 
but they havent been able to document it yet said john 
tibbets of the south carolina sea grant consortium they havent 
been able to get hard numbers 
about 60 volunteers with more to be hired have been counting 
birds along the coast for two years their census should be 
complete in 1991 
a similar census is under way in north carolina the results of 
both counts will provide a better picture of bird migration 
patterns and be the basis for future surveys to determine if 
populations of certain bird species are declining 
the census also will allow researchers determine the impact of 
hurricane hugo on shore bird populations 
the september storm inundated marsh island for instance 
the island is an important nesting area for egrets herons and 
terns at the cape romain national wildlife refuge north of 
charleston 
the storm leveled all the tall dunes and most birds will be at 
risk for flooding in the spring tides said thomas murphy of the 
south carolina department of wildlife and marine resources the 
pelicans will do all right but it may push other birds nests out 
to areas where they will be flooded 
the census also will pinpoint key nesting areas for coastal bird 
colonies atlases will be compiled to help regulatory agencies make 
sure such areas are protected 
that in turn should help prevent some species from becoming 
endangered murphy said 
about 250 colonies that include perhaps hundreds of thousands of 
wading and sea birds are spread over the states coast murphy 
said he would not venture a more specific estimate of bird 
populations until the census is complete 
a lot of times for nine months of the year there is nothing 
there murphy said then you suddenly might have thousands of 
birds on a twoacre pond 
scientists are concerned about development encroaching on 
colonies while the birds will adapt if they have to go through 
that every three years or so because of development they 
colonies will not be successful murphy said 
volunteers usually go by boat to remote areas and count around 
the time of high tide because birds congregate on sand banks and 
oyster banks left uncovered by the tide 
they move around a lot and its difficult to do the actual 
counting they are so mobile and so fast you have to count them in 
that very narrow window said virginia beach a consortium 
spokeswoman

rafael angel calderon the son of an 
exiled president won sundays presidential election defeating the 
governing partys candidate to succeed oscar arias architect of 
central americas peace process 
i feel very proud of my country tonight this is a victory for 
all of you the people of costa rica calderon a strong 
supporter of us policy in the region said in a statement at his 
social christian party headquarters 
calderon was leading carlos manuel castillo by 178571 votes to 
169352 according to official returns representing about 20 
percent of the vote the count was suspended for the night and was 
to resume at noon monday 
i accept the verdict of the people today we have elected 
liberty and democracy to the presidency of costa rica castillo 
said in a concession statement at the national liberation partys 
election headquarters 
most of the tabulated returns came from castillos stronghold of 
san jose and calderon was expected to expand his lead when the 
votes from his rural strongholds started coming in 
more than 80 percent of the nations 17 million registered 
voters were expected to turn out 
calderon will take office may 8 for a fouryear term 
arias who won a nobel peace prize in 1987 for his efforts to 
bring peace to central america cannot succeed himself 
calderons victory marked the 10th straight peaceful election in 
costa rica since 1948 when calderons father rafael angel 
calderon guardia was president and tried to nullify the result 
when his party lost 
my sympathy goes out to my opponent mr castillo and his 
followers i know what they are going through i went through it 
four years ago said calderon 40 who made losing presidential 
bids in 1982 and 1986 
he asked his followers to celebrate without gloating or rancor 
and called on those who did not vote for me to join us and fight 
for a better future for costa rica 
party faithful were out in force waving flags and honking horns 
in rhythm buses took thousands to the polls where crowds of 
teenagers decked out in colorful tshirts guided voters to their 
precincts 
some who celebrated saturday night were lined up at 5 am when 
the polls opened police blocked streets near hospitals to hold 
down the sound of a festival that jammed streets of the capital 
throughout the day and continued after the polls closed 
the fiesta continued into the night for calderons supporters 
both major candidates ran populist campaigns aimed at the poor 
in this country of 29 million the campaign was devoid of 
specifics however 
castillo was hurt by disclosures about drug trafficking and 
corruption but in keeping with the tradition of costa rican 
politics calderon did not press those issues as hard as he might 
have 
calderon founded the social christian party in part to shed the 
legacy of his father 
but the presidentelect still calls his father who served as 
president from 1940 to 1944 the greatest costa rican president of 
this century the elder calderon was exiled after he tried to 
nullify the 1948 election results an incident that led to the 
abolition of costa ricas army 
calderon has said he supports arias peace efforts but wont try 
to imitate them and will focus on domestic issues and improving 
social justice 
calderon whose father founded costa ricas social security 
system has promised a new housing program for the poor while at 
the same time saying he would reduce the governments deficit 
spending 
he also has proposed requiring large companies to establish 
profitsharing plans something that has made some businessmen 
nervous 
voters also elected 57 national assembly delegates and filled 
525 municipal posts 
prisoners each escorted by a guard were permitted to vote for 
the first time in costa rican history 
its a step towards the perfection of costa rican democracy 
said human rights advocate nancy hernandez 
in an exercise to reinforce the understanding of and commitment 
to democracy more than 9500 children under age 12 went to their 
own polling places in a mock election and castillo won taking 
4885 votes or 506 percent to 4693 or 486 percent for 
calderon 
the voting took place only in san jose where the incumbent 
party is strong 
joao baena soares secretary general of the organization of 
american states praised costa ricas democratic tradition but 
refused to compare it to nicaragua where a controversial campaign 
winds up on feb 25 
he noted however that the oas sent only four observers 
including himself to costa rica on election day in nicaragua 
there will be 400 oas observers he said

president bushs new defense budget doesnt 
offer a longrange vision for the pentagon in a time of 
revolutionary change but it gives some shortterm clues about how 
this commanderinchief wants the military to prepare for the years 
to come 
bush said his 2921 billion defense budget for 1991 offers a 
chance to restructure americas defenses in the wake of 
europes revolutionary changes and he made headlines with last 
weeks proposal to strip hundreds of thousands of us and soviet 
troops from the european continent 
but the budget proposal also reveals a conservative 
takeitslow approach in many areas 
the 1991 plan takes only tentative steps into a new era with a 
modest troop reduction of 38000 in the coming year cutbacks in 
about 20 minor conventional weapon programs and continued funding 
for several futuristic weapons systems from the reagan 
administration such as the strategic defense initiative 
dramatic change is difficult to achieve in one year pentagon 
officials say given the long lead time required to adjust 
hightech weapons programs and to reduce the military force of 21 
million 
we are prepared to cut the defense budget but please let us 
do it in an orderly fashion defense secretary dick cheney told 
the senate armed services committee last week 
cheney appearing sunday on cbstvs face the nation 
program said it makes no sense to cut major weapons programs 
now because we have to deal with soviet military capabilities and 
not just intentions 
there is still enormous nuclear capability and the soviets 
have not shown they are prepared to change that cheney said 
but senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said on 
nbctvs meet the press that continued spending for the mx 
missile was unnecessary i dont think theres any chance that 
the administrations proposal to fund both the mx and midgetman 
will be enacted he said 
the budget opts for continued modernization of the nations 
strategic nuclear forces including funds for more b2 stealth 
bombers mx missiles the midgetman missile a trident submarine 
and trident missiles 
the cuts in conventional weapons came more easily the secretary 
said because fewer such arms will be needed as the military force 
is reduced 
the army has argued that in an era of lessened superpower 
conflict in europe it now must prepare for third world 
lowintensity conflicts that require a lighter more flexible 
force as demonstrated in the panama invasion 
as a result the army procurement budget was cut by 4 billion 
from last year but its research and development programs grew by 
1 billion in the interest of developing such things as a light 
tank 
the announced base closures were designed to accommodate those 
decisions said one army general involved in the planning we 
closed a number of ammunition depots and such because we just dont 
need that much ammunition said the general who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the army is bearing the brunt of the force cutback with a 17000 
reduction while the air force would be cut by 15000 and the navy 
by 6000 men and women the marine corps was spared any major 
personnel cuts 
by most accounts it is a better paid better prepared and more 
heavily armed military force one that gen colin powell chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff warned congress last week must not be 
slashed willynilly amid the calls for foreignbased troop 
withdrawals and tight budgets 
youll start to break the great force weve put together in 
the past 10 years powell warned 
even if bushs call to draw us troop levels down to 225000 in 
europe is agreed upon it would take place over a span of one to 
two years cheney told lawmakers 
in the budget none of the air forces major programs such as 
the b2 stealth bomber or the mx missile system were impaired 
however the service will retire 14 1950era b52 conventional 
bombers based on guam the only such unit based outside the 
continental united states 
despite headlines over the decision to mothball two world war 
iiera battleships the navy eluded some of the major cuts aimed at 
the other services but cheney told reporters that even the 
services 14 aircraft carriers are not sacrosanct in an era of 
declining budgets 
the navy took a major cut in research and development funds due 
in part to cheneys decision to cancel the v22 osprey tiltrotor 
aircraft 
congress expressed some impatience with cheneys lack of 
information on longrange pentagon plans for troop cuts and weapons 
programs with senate armed services committee chairman sen sam 
nunn dga complaining of a number of blanks in the budget 
cheney promised to provide more information when he releases his 
fiveyear plan in april 
the fact of the matter is this is a dynamic world we live in 
we have not made final decisions in many areas because you 
cant cheney said

the bush administration is moving ahead with a 
controversial plan to allow a new cornbased octane enhancer to 
qualify for a 60centsagallon tax subsidy for alcohol fuels even 
though it will cost the treasury an estimated 192 million in lost 
revenue over the next three years 
in addition administration officials acknowledged last week 
that the planned subsidy sought primarily by corn growers and the 
growing alcohol fuel industry likely will be held to be in 
violation of international trade agreements as an illegal subsidy 
nonetheless assistant treasury secretary kenneth w gideon told 
the taxwriting house ways and means committee his department plans 
to make the lead substitute ethyl tertiary butyl ether or etbe 
eligible for the tax credit in the near future 
although the etbe technically is a compound of ethanol and 
petroleumbased isobutylene and not a mixture of alcohol and 
gasoline as required by the 1980 law gideon said the treasury 
did not believe congress chose to use the word mixture in 
its narrow technical sense 
expanding the credit to cover etbe has won the support of 75 
senators however it has raised the ire of the fossil fuels 
industry which has a competing product and several tax writers in 
the house 
rep frank guarini dnj cited administration estimates that 
the etbe tax credit will cost 2 billion over the next 10 years if 
congress votes to continue the alcohol fuel subsidies which now 
are set to expire in 1993 
without consulting congress you decided something that is 
going to cost an additional 2 billion he said joe sixpack or 
the fellows working in the steel mills in ohio are now going to 
have to pay that 2 billion

rep jim jontz dind says he is optimistic 
about the prospects for including his sustainable agriculture 
proposal in the 1990 farm bill 
the jontz legislation which would create a new voluntary option 
in the farm program encourages producers to reduce their use of 
manufactured chemicals and fertilizers by instilling greater 
flexibility into federal farm programs 
regrettably present farm policies particularly the base 
acreage requirements force producers to plant the maximum amount 
of program acreage annually jontz said this inflexibility 
hurts the environment by requiring greater use of manufactured 
chemicals and fertilizers 
the jontz bill has about 20 cosponsors and is the vehicle in 
the house for getting language on sustainable agriculture into law 
this year 
in the senate similar legislation is pending and lawmakers 
there have been vocal about the need for flexibility in the 
upcoming farm bill 
on friday sen robert kerrey dneb told the national grain 
trade council that flexibility is more than this years 
catchword it must be central to our farm bill deliberations 
what a cruel paradox it would be if congress didnt give 
farmers the flexibility they need to rotate crops and reduce 
chemical use but instead saddled them with new regulations 
intended to force a reduction in the chemicals they apply said 
kerrey

masked guerrillas armed with guns and 
grenades attacked a bus carrying 31 israeli tourists on a desert 
road to cairo sunday killing at least nine people and wounding 17 
officials and news reports said 
at least two egyptians on board the bus were among those shot 
according to the reports 
an unidentified man telephoned the cairo bureau of a western 
news agency and said the attack was to punish president hosni 
mubarak and security officials for alleged torture in egyptian 
prisons 
it was the worst attack on israelis in egypt since 1985 and the 
deadliest single act of terror in the nation since moslem 
extremists killed president anwar sadat and seven others with him 
on a parade viewing stand on oct 6 1981 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir speaking in a telephone 
interview with israel tv said the attack proves that hostility 
towards israel still exists and runs amok in the region 
mubarak telephone shamir and issued a statement that said he 
regretted the monstrous aggression against israeli tourists he 
said the attack was aimed at thwarting efforts for middle east 
peace said the governmentrun middle east news agency or mena 
egypt the only arab country to have peace with israel has been 
mediating efforts to get talks started between israeli officials 
and representatives of palestinians who have waged a 2yearold 
uprising against israeli rule of the west bank and gaza strip 
the bus was carrying the israelis to cairo from rafeh a divided 
town on the egyptisrael border in the sinai peninsula when it was 
attacked near the suez canal town of ismailiya 40 miles from the 
capital said a statement issued by the egyptian government 
two men in a white peugeot station wagon stopped the bus got 
out of the car and opened fire with machine guns then hurled four 
hand grenades before fleeing two grenades exploded said the 
statement carried by mena 
the government account was similar to that of a witness miriam 
kadmon who was quoted by israel army radio 
she said the driver of the car signaled the bus to stop and that 
the attackers smashed the cars rear window and opened fire an 
egyptian on the bus began screaming jumped out of the vehicle and 
was shot dead she said

the gruesome death of an elderly woman after 
an attack by two pit bull terriers has revived a legal dogfight 
between pet owners and authorities over the regulation of vicious 
canines 
the issue centers on whether cities should pass ordinances 
specifically citing pit bulls a breed the american kennel club 
says does not exist among its 141 registered varieties 
animal control officers and politicians have adopted an 
iknowonewheniseeone stance and insist the dogs that fit the 
general pit bull description are more vicious than others and need 
to be regulated more closely 
both sides have had victories last year the kennel club 
successfully challenged a new york city law requiring that pit 
bulls be neutered tattooed with a registration number and 
leashed muzzled or confined at all times 
but an overland park kan law requiring the dogs to wear 
muzzles when out of their homes or kennels survived a lawsuit by 
pit bull owners that went to the us supreme court which declined 
to review the case 
in floridas dade county pit bull owners must pay a 50 
registration and keep the dogs indoors or locked in a cage or a 
6foothigh pen outside the dogs must be leashed and muzzled 
after an attack in the happy valley ore pit bull owners 
managed to block an ordinance that would have had the animals and 
other vicious dogs put to death or removed from the portlandarea 
city 
in california a law took effect in january establishing a 
uniform system of review hearing and punishment for owners of 
vicious dogs but the law also bans counties and cities from 
enacting their own regulations if they are specific to breed 
focusing on any one breed is cutesy shortcut politics aimed 
at getting maximum attention said alan j stern american kennel 
club vice president 
you make a dog vicious you beat it deny it affection apply 
electric shock put down its food dish and take it away said 
stern these dogs are bad because of bad people 
he said 21 states and 183 cities have bans that do not mention 
specific breeds 
but los angeles animal control lt michael burns who is 
overseeing the investigation of the dogmauling death of 
70yearold marjee lilly said there are enough specifics about pit 
bulls to adopt a law regulating them 
this is the year of the pit bull ban he said 
he said arguments by opponents of pit bull bans about the 
absence of genetic differences between breeds fall down in the 
reality of backyard breeding used to produce dogs that most people 
accept as pit bulls 
you have a dog that has aggressive tendencies enhanced through 
constant and incestuous breeding burns said if there are some 
recessive genes on the aggressive or psychotic side they will make 
themselves manifest 
mrs lilly of san diego was visiting her grandson at his home 
and was attacked by his two dogs when she tried to feed them 
the 4foot11 inch 130pound woman was alone at the time and 
was mauled by the dogs for a half hour she died jan 17 one day 
after the attack 
her death prompted gov george deukmejian to say he would 
consider legislation restricting the ownership of pit bulls such 
legislation would override the current law he signed 
but stern said the dogs that attacked mrs lilly were 
mixedbreed boxers he called the immediate identification as pit 
bulls typical of the trend by police animal control officers and 
the media to write off all vicious dogs as pit bulls 
pit bulls have been identified at one time or another as 27 
different breeds he said its a handle if theres a dog 
attack then its a pit bull 
pit bull is generally applied to staffordshire bull terriers 
the american staffordshire terrier the american pit bull terrier 
and sometimes the bull terrier 
bred for dog fighting they have a powerful chest neck and jaw 
muscles 
and those are the features that backyard buyers of pit bulls are 
most interested in said burns he said a dog generically called a 
pit bull can be bought for around 15 to 30 in los angeles 
it just has to have the characteristics you talk about when 
you are describing a fighting dog he said 
and they are different burns insisted 
theres an absence of the normal sounds a dog makes when it 
attacks said burns who trained sentry dogs for the military 
its almost a workmanlike way they hold on in an attack its a 
persistence i havent seen in any other breed

a group of people in this southern 
oregon community are saying nyet to establishing a sister city 
with the soviet town of rubtsovsk 
while we feel profound sympathy for the subjugated people of 
the ussr as well as the peoples of the 49 communistdominated 
nations of the world we feel no sisterly kinship with the city of 
rubtsovsk a petition being circulated states 
the petition goes on to say that sister city projects are a 
danger to americas national security and a terrible insult and 
discouragement to oppressed people who live under the communist 
yoke 
gedney webb who drafted the petition says those who sign it 
are opposed to any formal relations with a totalitarian regime 
cindy patterson who has visited rubtsovsk in central siberia 
and who has been active in the sister city campaign said the 
opposition group is ignoring the future 
i really look at this from the aspect of securing a safe 
future for my children said patterson 
she said establishing ties with soviet cities has improved 
relations at a personal level avoiding much of the political 
friction created by the differing systems 
webb plans to present his petition to the city council on 
wednesday when it considers the sistercity proposal

letting your spouses words go in one ear 
and out the other may indicate a happy marriage research suggests 
laura l stafford an assistant professor of communication at 
ohio state university said her study showed that strangers recall 
more of their conversations than married couples 
it appears obvious that at the early stage of a relationship 
you are listening closely to what a person is saying and forming 
impressions and evaluations asking yourself do i like this 
person ms stafford said recently 
by the time you are in a stable marriage you are no longer 
forming impressions and evaluations of your spouse not on a 
routine basis anyway so you dont recall as much detail from a 
conversation 
ms stafford has conducted studies concerning the ability to 
recall conversations 
one study concluded that married couples remembered the general 
topic of their discussion but strangers recalled more detail 
happy couples may be talking for the sake of talking you 
dont really know what you talked about with your wife but you 
know you had a good talk ms stafford said 
unhappy couples may recall more from their conversations because 
they are reevaluating the relationship

banks and other lenders in three years doubled 
the money recovered from delinquent student loan borrowers by using 
aggressive tactics that included garnishing lottery winnings and 
putting liens on real estate a study shows 
lenders in the guaranteed student loan program introduced 
innovative procedures to forestall default and increase 
recoveries from 200 million in fiscal year 1986 to more than 400 
million in fiscal year 1989 pelavin associates a washington dc 
research firm said sunday 
pelavin conducted three national studies on the gsl program for 
a consortium of guarantee agencies in colorado massachusetts 
tennessee texas and washington state 
the program created by congress in 1965 has made higher 
education possible for more than 20 million americans 
government student loan programs have been harshly criticized in 
recent years because of spiralling default rates mainly among 
trade and vocational schools 
the gsl program administered by 56 guarantee agencies that 
protect private lenders against losses from loan defaults had 
516 billion in student loans entering repayment status in fiscal 
year 1988 the federal government is the ultimate guarantor of the 
loans 
according to the new studies eighteen guarantee agencies 
improved their recovery rates by more than 10 percent and 22 
agencies saw improvements between 5 percent and 10 percent

a study says jobs for the unskilled and poorly 
educated are disappearing and future employment will require if 
not higher education at least good communications skills and basic 
ability in math and reading 
radical changes are occurring in the size and composition of the 
work force that will affect the nation for decades to come even as 
us businesses confront the challenge of foreign competition and 
new technology reports the private population reference bureau

development says the 1990s provide a window of opportunity for 
facing the nations human and workplace problems problems which 
if ignored could produce dire consequences 
the 1990s provides a unique opportunity for addressing human 
resource needs if we postpone the choice at hand demographic 
factors in the years ahead could push us to the edge of a 
formidable crisis conclude the authors of the study carol j de 
vita and william p ohare 
the nation is in transition from an industrial to a service 
economy which means most new jobs will require education and

forty years after a copy writer for a small 
advertising agency took a taffylike substance invented by accident 
and called it silly putty the toy in the plastic egg is still 
making an impression 
binney amp smith inc silly puttys maker sells more than 3 
million eggs a year of the bounceable moldable stretchable toy 
capable of lifting images from newspapers 
and this spring the eastonbased company plans to add four 
fluorescent colors of silly putty to the pinkish silicone rubber 
these colors mark the first change in the product since peter c 
hodgson borrowed 147 in 1950 to market a researchers failed 
attempt at making synthetic rubber during world war ii 
dads and moms may get a little jealous because they didnt 
have these things but maybe their kids will share said dennis 
malloy binney amp smiths director of business development 
the privately held company which also makes crayola crayons and 
liquitex fine arts products bought the rights to silly putty in 
1977 a year after hodgsons death 
hodgsons son peter jr said silly puttys simplicity has 
allowed it to stretch over two generations 
it demands something of people so it animates you said 
hodgson a professor of russian literature at the university of 
california los angeles 
it really is what it says it is a liquid solid he said 
its just a paradox a kind of puzzle an enigma you can hold in 
your hand 
the elder hodgson who envisioned silly putty as a therapeutic 
diversion for adults began the business in a converted barn in 
north branford conn and shipped the product to retailers in 
pasteboard egg crates 
since then more than 200 million eggs of silly putty more 
than 3000 tons have been sold 
silly putty which has survived copycats such as nutty putty and 
goofy goo has been pressed into service in some unusual ways 
the elder hodgson gave apollo 8 astronauts silly putty in 
sterling silver eggs for their 1968 trip to the moon and they used 
it to keep tools from floating away in weightlessness 
athletes squeeze it to strengthen their hands and physical 
therapists recommend it for patients recovering from hand or wrist 
injuries 
and new york city artist george horner uses silly putty in his 
work which sells for as much as 5000 
i do consider myself a serious artist even though i work with 
silly putty said horner whose works inside silly puttyfilled 
frames address topics such as homelessness and aids i sort of 
like to fool peoples expectations 
malloy said he expects silly putty to continue to thrive even 
in the age of the video game 
i think a parent is ecstatic when a child requests a toy that 
costs a buck and a half he said 
according to malloy baby boomers children have hatched a silly 
putty sales increase of 15 percent to 17 percent during the last 
four years 
he said he expects sales to grow by 25 percent to 30 percent 
this year as children collect the new blue green yellow and 
magenta colors scheduled to reach retail stores shelves in may 
but larry carlat editor of toy amp hobby world said he didnt 
think children would collect the different colors 
silly putty is more of a onetrick pony he said 
at the modern plant in northeastern pennsylvania binney amp smith 
makes an average of 300 pounds a day of silly putty about 12000 
eggs a day 
to make silly putty silicone rubber is first swirled in 
225pound blobs with ingredients to keep it from puddling 
after the pink goo warm from the stirring is poured from the 
vat designed to mix mortar it is cut up into chunks resembling 
oversized loaves of homemade bread 
these are then fed through a machine designed for cutting taffy 
rows of silly putty drop onto a conveyer and workers place the 
133gram disks resembling chopped hot dogs into red plastic eggs 
malloy said he expected the oldfashioned pink putty to continue 
to sell well despite the bright colors and other innovations on the 
drawing board 
this isnt the last youll see of new things in silly putty 
he promised

the dollar rose moderately against the japanese yen 
monday while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange inched down 
the dollar closed at 14560 yen up 065 yen from fridays close 
of 14495 yen after opening at 14559 yen it moved in a range of 
1454014560 yen 
currency dealers said the dollars firmness carried over from 
its strong showing in new york on friday where it closed at 14550 
yen 
they said investors bought the currency in new york after the 
release of a betterthanexpected us labor department report 
which showed the nations unemployment rate holding steady at 53 
percent in january 
economists say a steady jobless rate will keep the us federal 
reserve board the us central bank from easing interest rates 
higher interest rates tend to support a countrys currency 
dealers also said uncertainty over the situation in the soviet 
union should keep participants from taking large positions monday 
despite bullish sentiment for the west german mark 
now the market is looking to whether soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs position will be consolidated in the meeting of the 
soviet communist party central committee scheduled for monday and 
tuesday a bank of tokyo dealer said 
the tokyo market has fluctuated erratically in past weeks on 
rumors that gorbachev may be resigning from his position as 
secretary general of the soviet communist party 
mondays exchange activity elsewhere is likely to be centered on 
cross trading between the west german mark and the dollar as has 
often been the case in recent weeks said the dealer who spoke 
anonymously 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which gained 44373 points friday fell back 1874 points 
or 005 percent to close at 3763141 yen 
securities dealers said the benchmark index opened bullish but 
uncertainty about the direction of currency rates and falling 
government bond rates sidelined investors causing largecapital 
issues to lose ground

gun regulations have come to oregon in the 
form of a delicately balanced law that the national rifle 
association endorses 
the bill which took effect jan 1 imposes stricter 
requirements for gun ownership but gives urbanarea residents 
greater access to concealed handguns 
i think its a huge step for public safety and i think it can 
show other legislators they can work with the nra said house 
speaker vera katz chief architect of the first major addition to 
oregons gun laws in at least 20 years 
katz began work on the law after an oregon man sprayed a 
stockton calif schoolyard with bullets from a semiautomatic 
rifle and two handguns in early 1989 patrick purdy killed five 
children and wounded 30 people before fatally shooting himself 
purdy bought the ak47 assault rifle at a gun shop in the town of 
sandy about 30 miles east of portland 
in a state where the nra claims 62000 members katz proceeded 
cautiously bringing together key lawmakers police officials and 
gun lobbyists for a series of closeddoor meetings that eventually 
spawned a bill 
banning the sale or possession of semiautomatics or any other 
kind of gun never was on the agenda because of the nras lobbying 
power she said 
oregonians have a state constitutional right to bear arms for 
their own defense and the state supreme court has ruled residents 
are entitled to possess billy clubs and switchblade knives 
katz said she focused instead on having enough safeguards to 
keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldnt have them 
the result katz said is one of the most comprehensive gun laws 
in the nation 
for handgun purchases the law extends the presale waiting 
period from five to 15 days and requires fingerprinting buyers of 
any gun must furnish two pieces of identification including at 
least one with a photograph 
people prohibited from possessing guns include convicted felons 
or people convicted of violent misdemeanors during the previous 
four years or who have been declared by courts to be dangerous 
because of mental illness 
purchases of rifles or shotguns carry no waiting period but if 
a background check later shows the buyer was ineligible police are 
required to confiscate the gun 
but the law also took away much of the discretion given to 
county sheriffs to deny permits for concealing weapons sheriffs 
who once had sole discretion over such permits now are required to 
issue them to applicants that meet the laws criteria and complete 
a handgun safety program 
that change was expected to spark a brisk business in those 
permits in urban areas where few had been issued 
in one recent year multnomah county the states most populous 
with 560000 people had issued 14 permits some sparsely settled 
counties in eastern oregon issued hundreds a year 
gun lobbyists said they support the new law 
im still encouraged said john nichols director of the 
oregon state rifle amp pistol association the state affiliate of the 
nra 
and nra member tex shively who said he lobbied against gun 
control bills during 24 legislative sessions is willing to give it 
a chance 
too many people have guns out there he said

presidentelect rafael angel 
calderon and thousands of chanting honking supporters celebrated 
victory today as costa rica embarked on its second century as 
central americas most stable democracy 
today we have elected liberty and democracy to the presidency 
of costa rica said calderons main opponent carlos manuel 
castillo in a graceful concession statement sunday night 
castillo was the governing partys candidate to succeed nobel 
laureate oscar arias the architect and prime mover of central 
americas peace process arias was barred from running for 
reelection 
i feel very proud of my country tonight this is a victory for 
all of you the people of costa rica said calderon at his social 
christian partys campaign headquarters 
the 40yearold calderon who was born in nicaragua after his 
father was sent into exile had tears of joy in his eyes as he 
entered a san jose hotel to the cheers of a flagwaving crowd 
calderon a strong supporter of us policy in the region was 
leading castillo by 178571 to 169352 according to official 
returns representing about 20 percent of sundays vote 
unofficial returns showed a much wider victory margin for 
calderon with twice as many votes counted 
calderon was also predicting his party would win 33 of 57 
national assembly seats voters also filled 525 municipal posts 
the official count was suspended and was to resume this 
afternoon 
castillo was breaking even in his national liberation party 
stronghold of san jose while calderon was sweeping most of the 
countryside five minor parties were not a factor in the outcome 
both major candidates ran populist campaigns aimed at the poor 
in this country of 29 million people the campaign was devoid of 
specifics however 
calderon made a trip to panama shortly after the us invasion 
in december and supports salvadoran president alfredo cristiani in 
his usbacked fight against leftist guerrillas 
however he has expressed disappointment at us aid to costa 
rica set at about 90 million for 1990 and due to fall about 30 
percent in 1991 just because we are a democracy does not mean we 
dont need help he said 
costa rica celebrated 100 years of democracy in october 
calderons victory marks the 10th straight peaceful election in 
costa rica since 1948 
calderon founded the social christian party in part to shed the 
legacy of his father rafael angel calderon guardia who was exiled 
in 1948 for trying to nullify the presidential vote that year 
calderon who made losing presidential bids in 1982 and 1986 
asked his followers to celebrate without gloating or rancor and 
called on those who did not vote for me to join us and fight for 
a better future for costa rica 
thousands of voters had been celebrating a civic fiesta in the 
streets throughout sunday and the celebration then continued for 
calderons supporters 
cars with redandblue flags raced through the streets early 
today honking to the rhythm of calderons name 
calderon said he owed his victory to party organization and the 
fact that national liberation had won the last two elections 
costa ricans dont like one party to dominate said 
calderon he will take office may 8 for a fouryear term 
calderon has said he supports arias peace efforts but wont try 
to imitate them and will focus on domestic issues and improving 
social justice 
calderon has promised a new housing program for the poor while 
saying he would also reduce the governments deficit spending 
he has also proposed requiring large companies to establish 
profitsharing plans something that has made some businessmen 
nervous 
he inherits control of a country with a 55 billion debt more 
than the annual gross national product of goods and services 
but arias with help from president bush has arranged a debt 
relief package and the economy is improving although a precipitous 
drop in coffee prices has hurt income from the nations largest 
export

mayor sidney barthelemy and his defeated 
challenger donald mintz called for a united effort to move the 
city forward following an election decided along racial lines 
barthelemy 47 who is black overcame a strong challenge from 
fellow democrat mintz 46 who is white 
complete but unofficial returns gave barthelemy 79995 votes or 
55 percent to 65047 or 44 percent for mintz 
two other candidates split the rest of the vote 
pollsters said barthelemy got about 85 percent of the black vote 
and mintz got 75 to 80 percent of the white vote in saturdays 
election 
let all new orleanians come together all of us rich and 
poor black and white and let us move into the 1990s and create 
and build a new orleans like no one has ever seen barthelemy 
said 
together we will make new orleans the greatest city in 
america 
mintz who resigned as head of the citys dock board to make his 
first try for office said he would work to help the mayor 
because we have perhaps elevated campaign practices to a new 
level in this city i ask you to join with me today in pledging 
support for the mayor and the new administration because we 
believe in a better new orleans mintz said 
barthelemy and mintz said repeatedly during the campaign that 
race should be irrelevant and accused each other of exploiting it 
as an issue 
i think it has been a little divisive and im sorry it 
developed that way barthelemy said 
nearly 62 percent of the citys 237000 registered voters turned 
out it was barthelemys sixth victory since 1974 when he won an 
interim election and became the first black state senator since 
reconstruction 
he was elected again to the senate and twice to the city 
council where he was the first black ever elected as an atlarge 
councilman 
barthelemys campaign speeches focused on ending unemployment 
mintz said the mayors predictions were pieinthesky and that he 
could do better 
but there was never much interest in employment or other 
substantial issues including the citys high crime rate and the 
candidates political experience and competence 
the city of new orleans has a little growing to do people 
have to start putting race behind us said us rep bob 
livingston a republican who represents metairie we have to 
start looking at the credentials of the candidate and i think if 
theyd done that donnie would definitely be the next mayor 
but moon landrieu the citys last white mayor said he felt 
that barthelemys extensive political background and mintz lack of 
political experience were the telling factors 
i dont think its a question of color so much as who is this 
person and what are his programs and talents or abilities 
said landrieu

voters in this tiny remote western pacific 
archipelago cast ballots tuesday on whether to accept 
selfgovernment or continue as the worlds last trusteeship 
palaus constitution mandates at least 75 percent approval must 
be given to a proposed compact of free association with the united 
states worth nearly 500 million in financial assistance 
president ngiratkel etpison who has spent most of the past five 
weeks campaigning for the measure believes the pact will be 
ratified 
it will be the seventh vote in as many years on the agreement 
that has become us law and awaits only palaus ratification 
before being put into effect in the previous plebiscites the 
agreement has been approved ranging from 614 percent in the first 
vote in 1983 to 73 percent in 1987 
the us department of interior which administers palaus 
affairs has indicated it will strengthen its presence here if the 
pact is rejected 
however this is not to say that there will not be another act 
of selfdetermination by palaus people at some future date if the 
plebiscite fails said sam mcphetres who is representing the 
department with a united nations team sent here to observe voting 
proceedures 
palau is the last of 11 territories under the un trusteeship 
system formed in 1947 the other territories have achieved 
independence or selfgovernment 
an estimated 15000 people live on eight of its 200 islands 
most in koror the provisional capital the total land area is 
nearly 200 square miles 
the united states captured the volcanic islands about 500 miles 
east of the philippine island of mindanao in 1944 from japanese 
military forces 
under the compact the united states would not be able to test 
store or dispose of nuclear or other unconventional weapons in 
palau 
however the agreement gives the us permission to use palaus 
airport harbor and other lands for military purposes 
under the trusteeship the united states is not restricted in 
any of those activities 
while there is no organized opposition in tuesdays vote there 
are small factions who could send the compact to defeat officials 
said 
on sunday 602 palauans living on guam voted as did 424 at 
saipan in the northern mariana islands palauans living in hawaii 
oregon and california also voted on sunday 
yoich kohama palau election commission chairman said it may be 
friday before the unofficial outcome is known

a leading figure in the revolutionary 
government has quit suggesting discord in its highest echelons 
and criticized the leadership for campaign efforts that try to 
undermine the opposition 
silviu brucan a former communist who became the leading foreign 
affairs specialist in the new regime announced his resignation 
sunday from the national salvation front in a letter to the 
national news agency rompres 
three days earlier the front agreed to share power with 
opposition parties in a new council of national unity until 
elections set for may 20 
the front took control during the bloody december revolution 
that toppled communist dictator nicolae ceaucescu who was executed 
christmas day after a summary trial 
in making his announcement brucan said he considered his 
mission fulfilled and that he believed all those who fought in 
revolution share my conviction that a strong opposition is 
absolutely essential to a real democracy in romania 
however brucan himself had been a target of opposition 
criticism it was he who announced that the front contrary to its 
initial pronouncements would field candidates in the elections 
bowing to public pressure the front last week agreed to share 
power with the opposition until the elections and split into two 
groups one to govern the other to contest the elections 
after his ouster brucan quickly became the national salvation 
fronts ideological beacon and was one its most outspoken figures 
he is a former ambassador to washington and onetime editor of the 
communist party daily scinteia who first openly criticized 
ceausescu after force was used to put down labor unrest in brasov 
in 1987 
today feb 4 i took the decision to retire from the 
leadership of the national salvation front because i consider my 
mission fulfilled brucan said in his letter 
he said he was worried about several weak points of our new 
political life including a certain apathy and a focus in the 
election campaign on adversaries rather than policies 
the stress on trying to undermine the opposition rather than to 
debate how best to solve romanias many problems threatens to 
reduce the contest to the lowest electoral traditions before world 
war ii he said 
in the 1930s romanias prewar democracy became increasingly 
autocratic with political parties being formally banned in 1938 
brucan said he worried that one of the key figures helping to 
form public opinion in romania was formerly in charge of two 
propaganda offices that were constantly promulgating ceausescus 
cult and was a member of the communist partys now defunct 
central committee 
he did not identify the man 
but stelian tanase spokesman for the group for social dialogue 
told the associated press he believes brucan resigned because of a 
misunderstanding within the front 
he said this centered on the rupture between intellectuals 
who demonstrated against the fronts power and the fronts ruling 
council which organized a counter profront demonstration a week 
ago using communist methods such as trucking workers in from 
factories 
brucans theory is that intellectuals are a progressive force 
and the antiintellectual demonstrations were maneuvered by the 
front so these are the probable dissensions that appeared in the 
councils top leadership tanase said 
brucans departure follows the resignation last week of the 
fronts interim vice president dumitru mazilu a prominent 
government critic during ceausescus last years although reportedly 
once a colonel of the securitate secret police mazilu accused the 
revolutionary government of using stalinistic methods 
brucan 73 offered his help to the front in the future but said 
he wanted to get back to my writing desk and do research on 
social and political issues 
romanian television said the front would present its electoral 
platform this week it also said the proposed electoral law under 
debate by all parties will be published this week 
more than 200 people demonstrated outside the television station 
sunday protesting what they said was biased coverage slanted 
against the opposition 
has the tv been free after the revolution asked dumitru 
juga head of a new union of 1200 radio and television workers 
no the crowd shouted some waved placards demanding down 
with censorship on tv down with the ceausescuists from tv 
and dont lie to the people with tv 
more than a dozen armored personnel carriers surrounded the 
station the scene of the heaviest fighting during the revolution

elderly people who learned transcendental 
meditation were more likely than their peers to still be living 
three years later in what experts call the first study to directly 
link meditation to longer life 
transcendental meditation proved more effective than two other 
techniques for longevity lowering blood pressure and improving on 
several measures of mental functioning researchers said 
the study results are rather dramatic i think its very 
impressive said psychologist arthur aron of the university of 
california santa cruz 
two other psychologists who study meditation said they suspect 
the outcome was due to factors other than transcendental meditation 
itself they also suggested that other techniques might do as well 
or better 
the harvard university study is presented in decembers journal 
of personality and social psychology published by the american 
psychological association 
the study included 73 volunteers with an average age of 81 
from eight homes for the elderly they were assigned randomly to 
learn transcendental meditation another technique called 
mindfulness training a simple relaxation program or no training 
at all 
three years later the 20 taught transcendental meditation were 
still alive survival rates in the other groups were 88 percent 65 
percent and 77 percent respectively 
transcendental meditation or tm induces a a distinctively 
deep state of rest while the mind is alert but in a very 
settled quiet state said coauthor charles alexander now an 
associate professor of psychology at maharishi international 
university in fairfield iowa 
students there practice tm as part of the curriculum alexander 
said 
the mindfulness training in the study was not the buddhist 
technique of the same name instead it was designed to stimulate 
creation of ideas or new perspectives through a verbal exercise 
and a challenge to think about topics in new and creative ways 
each technique was practiced for 20 minutes twice daily with the 
eyes closed during the 12week experiment 
alexander attributed the findings to tms combination of high 
wakefulness which he said combats atrophy of the mind and so the 
body and deep restfulness which he said releases stress from the 
nervous system and leads to reduced wear and tear on mind and 
body 
he said the study suggests tm should be combined with standard 
western medicine not replace it 
some other meditation researchers suggested different 
explanations for the outcome 
for example michael maliszewski director of behavioral 
medicine at the diamond headache clinic in chicago said tm 
instructors may have differed from the instructors of the other 
techniques in terms of motivation or other factors that could have 
given their teachings more impact the tm group had fewer dropouts 
than the other groups he noted 
he also said he suspected that chinese taoist meditative 
techniques which he said were designed to increase longevity 
might do so better than tm did taoism has not been studied 
experimentally so far he said 
alexander replied that a survey covering most dropouts found 
their decision had nothing to do with the quality of the 
instructors he also said other studies have found tm superior to 
alternative techniques in improving aspects of physical and mental 
health even though the commitment of the instructors of other 
techniques was presumeably as high as that of the tm instructors

a dramatic new holocaust memorial drew 
thousands of people who came to its dedication to remember and in 
some cases bear witness 
the memorial dominated by a 42foottall bronze hand with 
sculptured suffering figures climbing it is for a tragedy 
beyond words and beyond imagination but not beyond memory 
said elie wiesel the holocaust survivor author and professor 
honored with the 1986 nobel peace prize 
not to remember means to betray them all he said at 
sundays dedication not to remember means to kill the victim a 
second time not to remember means to become an accomplice of the 
enemy 
nearly 3000 chairs in an outdoor ampitheater at the memorial 
were filled more than an hour before sundays dedication 
ceremonies and thousands more stood 
wiesel said not just the past but the present with 
antisemitism revitalized in some countries shows the need for 
these sanctuaries of memory 
the ceremonies had many in tears in this city where thousands 
of eastern european jews moved after world war ii 
i cant stop crying said miriam feigenblat of suburban 
hallandale she showed the number 56035 on her arm from the 
auschwitz death camp and said she lost her parents three sisters 
and other family members we are the witnesses 
its the greatest thing to happen in florida said jacob 
kreitzna who survived other death camps pointing solemnly to his 
number he said its very important to remember 
helen fagin a retired university of miami professor of judaic 
studies who survived a concentration camp but lost her parents at 
treblinka initiated the project five years ago 
from teaching she saw students knew little about the 
holocaust and she was alarmed by historical revisionists who 
contended the genocidal final solution of adolf hitler never 
happened 
more and more survivors are leaving us she said in an 
interview we as witnesses are going to soon disappear 
during trips to washington dc she was impressed by the 
vietnam memorial and the lincoln memorial a small group here led 
by automobile dealer and philadelphia eagles football team owner 
norman braman began a drive that gained donated land from the city 
of miami beach and raised nearly 3 million for the memorial 
kenneth treister a miami beach resident and architectsculptor 
traveled to israel and studied holocaust memorials and records 
before conceiving the memorial here 
there is a reflecting pool in the front of the ampitheater and 
a semicircular black granite wall frames its back a tunnel 
walkway leading to the sculpture has 47 photographs showing scenes 
from the holocaust victims digging their own mass graves before 
their executions people being packed into railroad cars for the 
camps emaciated camp prisoners a small boy raising his hands in 
surrender to nazi soldiers 
the tunnel passes an eternal flame and turns with walls 
carrying the names of the death camps and listing the names of 
victims 
at the end of the tunnel a sculptured small girl weeps and 
beckons leading to the hand with figures climbing it reaching 
for help or for each other 
about 5000 names of the estimated 6 million holocaust victims 
are inscribed in the memorial and more will be continually added 
as they are received organizers said 
the nazis tried to dehumanize them they took away their names 
and gave them numbers braman said were giving them back 
their names

raymond buckey promised to fight to my last 
breath to prove his innocence in a retrial on child molestation 
charges scheduled for next month 
in his first extensive remarks since his acquittal on dozens of 
child molestation counts buckey called the trial a miscarriage of 
justice that destroyed his life and left children in torment 
i saw what the system did i saw how it treated children i 
saw how it treated adults it doesnt work very well buckey said 
in a jan 28 interview broadcast sunday night on cbss 60 
minutes 
its a very safe side to be on saying gee these poor 
children went through hell he said and they did go through 
hell but im not the cause of their hell neither is my mother 
nothing that happened at that preschool is the cause of their hell 
the cause of their hell is the product of the adults who took on 
this case and made it what it is 
on jan 18 a superior court jury acquitted buckey 31 and his 
mother peggy mcmartin buckey 63 of 52 molestation counts 
stemming from alleged attacks on pupils at their nowclosed 
mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach jurors deadlocked on 13 
other counts against buckey 
last week after a vociferous campaign by mcmartin parents that 
included television talk show appearances los angeles county 
district attorney ira reiner decided to retry buckey on the 13 
counts 
i dont want to go through another mcmartin trial buckey 
said but i will because i know im innocent ill fight to my 
last breath to get vindicated in the system in some way because 
theres no end to what theyve done to me 
the trial was the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in 
us history buckey spent five years in jail and his mother nearly 
two before they were released on bail 
on the cbstv program reiner was asked if in retrospect he 
felt buckey and his mother should have been jailed for as long as 
they were 
in retrospect who can tell in retrospect reiner replied 
mrs buckey who also was interviewed said she expected the 
jurors to acquit her but buckey said he was unsure 
i couldnt believe that theyd buy this whole case but i knew 
they were looking for something he said and i just hoped to 
god that there werent 12 people who were blind enough to buy this 
witch hunt 
jurors told reporters after the verdict that they felt some 
children had been molested but that there was insufficient 
evidence that buckey was the attacker 
god knows all of us are innocent and i cant convince other 
people but god knows it mrs buckey said

home buyers last year waited longer to buy their 
dream house because prices rose faster than their incomes the 14th 
straight year the gap has widened a study found 
the chicago title amp trust co said its annual survey of home 
buyers in 18 urban areas showed that the majority of 1989 home 
buyers were twoincome couples who saved for an average of 29 
years the longest period in the surveys 14year history before 
having enough money for a down payment 
the study documents that working couples have been the major 
factor influencing home affordability in this decade said john 
pfister chicago title vice president in charge of marketing 
research 
the study the only national home buyers survey embracing all 
types of home sales throughout the year was based on telephone 
interviews of more than 1500 people according to chicago title 
the countrys largest titleinsurance company 
nationally the median home price which historically reflects 
a price that most closely parallels what most people would pay 
rose 64 percent last year to 129800 while the median household 
income of 1989 home buyers rose 63 percent to 58700 the survey 
found 
the median home price is the midpoint with an equal number of 
homes selling for more and less 
the gap was smaller than in recent years but when considered 
with the gaps since the first chicago trust survey in 1976 the 
difference between income gains and homeprice increases grew a 
total of 65 percent over 14 years 
those buying houses today have noticeably fewer discretionary 
dollars to spend on things other than housing than their 
counterparts did 13 years ago pfister said 
chicago title said 793 percent of all 1989 home buyers were 
twoincome families compared with 733 percent in 1988 and 531 
percent in 1976 
among firsttime home buyers 868 percent were twoincome 
families compared with 855 percent in 1988 and 64 percent in 1976 
the segment of firsttime home buyers purchasing newly 
constructed homes dropped to 17 percent from 23 percent in 1988 
while the number buying existing singlefamily homes rose to 83 
percent from 77 percent 
what this tends to suggest is that the firsttime buyers in 
general were increasingly priced out of the new home market last 
year and opted for older less expensive houses instead pfister 
said 
san francisco remained the most expensive metropolitan housing 
market in 1989 the survey found with a median home price of 
199900 up 112 percent from 1988 
at the low end the median home price in cleveland last year was 
75800 down 13 percent from 1988 
the median home price in memphis jumped 181 percent last year 
to 92000 while the median price of a home in new york city fell 
137 percent to 166200

veterans organizations today said the 
proposed 1991 budget for veterans programs should be boosted by 
11 billion adding the current plan will not solve such basic 
problems as delays in handling benefit claims 
the proposal by amvets disabled american veterans paralyzed 
veterans of america and the veterans of foreign wars said the 
veterans administration needs 11 billion more than the 309 
billion sought by the bush administration 
there are no grandiose concepts in this independent budget 
said frank morrone a health policy consultant to the paralyzed 
veterans group combined the groups claim to represent 3 million 
of the nations 27 million veterans 
the groups want a shift in some spending priorities within the 
va including the addition of 12 billion for medical care over 
the bush administrations request for 122 billion though the 
highest administration request in years the bush proposal for 
health care just meets the bare minimum said morrone 
va is not getting its fair share of federal dollars in terms 
of health care said morrone citing 4 percent growth in 
veterans health spending between 1985 and 1989 compared with 
nearly 7 percent for medicare and 11 percent for medicaid research 
dollars are decreasing he said 
another chief concern of the groups was the handling of claims 
according to the groups the underfunding of the veterans 
benefits administration has caused a 650000case backlog in 
compensation and pension claims the backlog was at 167000 cases 
as recently as 1987 they said 
as a result of underfunding veterans wait six months for 
benefits applicants for vocational rehabilitation wait 100 days to 
be interviewed almost 2 million veterans a year cant get through 
to the va because of busy lines and long waits on hold and home 
loans are being defaulted on unnecessarily they say 
the groups say 734 additional employees are needed at a cost of 
25 million for general operating expenses the category that 
covers benefits work 
the four veterans groups like other critics of the va budget 
blame short staffing in the loan program for a large number of 
defaults that is leading the administration to propose eliminating 
a centerpiece housing benefit 
for the first time the bush administration proposed last week a 
mandatory 4 percent down payment on va loan amounts over 25000 
the veterans groups offering their fourth independent 
budget say they are motivated by a final loss of confidence in 
the office of management and budgets intention or ability to 
objectively address veterans issues

author salman rushdies detailed defense of the 
satanic verses is winning plaudits from fellow writers but has 
failed to placate british moslems who say the novel is blasphemous 
several writers said rushdies 7000word essay was a brilliant 
defense of free speech but moslems said it would not break the 
deadlock over the novel and one reiterated that the death sentence 
passed on rushdie by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini remained 
in force 
rushdies essay published in the independent on sunday was his 
first detailed comment on the furor aroused by the satanic 
verses since khomeinis edict forced him into hiding a year ago 
rushdie 42 wrote of the pain of being cut off from society 
the irony of being condemned by moslems for a novel that sought to 
highlight their plight as immigrants in the west and the anger he 
feels that the labor party which he has always supported failed 
to back him 
the bombayborn briton said his novel sought to create a 
literary language for formerly colonized stilldisadvantaged 
peoples those like himself who straddle different cultures a 
lovesong to our mongrel selves 
to be rejected and reviled by so to speak ones own 
characters is a shocking and painful experience for any writer 
he wrote 
i recognize that many moslems have felt shocked and pained 
too perhaps a way forward might be found through the mutual 
recognition of that mutual pain let us attempt to believe in each 
others good faith 
shabbir akhtar a british moslem welcomed rushdies decision to 
publish the essay calling it thoughtful and unexpected but he 
said the novel remained a calculated attempt to vilify and 
slander the prophet mohammed 
akhtar is a member of the mosque council in bradford the 
heavily moslempopulated city in northern england where 
antirushdie sentiment runs high 
writing today in the independent sister of the paper that 
published rushdies essay akhtar urged rushdie to engage in a 
dialogue with those he has offended he said islam was a merciful 
religion and the magnanimity which has been denied to both 
parties may yet seek an occasion 
but he regretted rushdies insistence that a paperback edition 
be published saying it would fuel extremism in the moslem camp 
there may even be acts of political terrorism it will be seen as a 
further provocation 
rushdies publisher viking penguin says no firm date has 
been set for issuing a paperback 
liaqat hussain general secretary of the council of mosques in 
bradford urged rushdie to be brave enough to face the world for 
his principles 
another british moslem leader sayed abdul quddus said the 
death sentence still stands on salman rushdie it has been passed 
by islamic law 
novelist penelope lively one of several writers who praised 
rushdies essay called it dignified and moving i think sadly 
it points up the basic confrontation here is a novelist trying to 
explain his purpose to fundamentalists who cannot or will not 
understand what fiction is or does 
writer michael ignatieff said the essay would be regarded as 
one of the great classical defenses of the novelists art in this 
country 
in his essay rushdie says the sequences most objected to by his 
moslem critics are actually attempts to express the pain of people 
when their faith is stretched to breaking point to portray a 
soul in crisis to show how the loss of god can destroy a mans 
life 
but he says the passage involving mohammed with three pagan 
female deities an episode that particularly incensed moslems 
was designed in part to ask awkward questions about islams 
attitude to women 
in introducing a character named mahound a medieval european 
term of abuse for mohammed rushdie said he was turning an insult 
into a term of ethnic pride the purpose is not to suggest that 
the koran the moslem holy book is written by the devil it is to 
attempt the sort of act of affirmation that in the united states 
transformed the word black from the standard term of racist abuse 
into a beautiful expression of cultural pride 
to moslems who accuse him of turning against the faith into 
which he was born he replied to put it as simply as possible i 
am not a moslem it feels bizarre and wholly inappropriate to be 
described as some sort of heretic after having lived my life as a 
secular pluralist eclectic man 
responding to those who claim he deliberately set out to provoke 
moslems he likened himself to rape victims who are accused of 
having asked for it 
in a separate interview with the independent on sunday rushdie 
said he has been reading moby dick ulysses tristram shandy and 
great freespeech defenders like rousseau diderot and voltaire 
and watching tv soap operas 
he added having had a lot of late nights by myself ive also 
become an addict of american football one of the newer features 
of british television

ron kovic the disabled vietnam veteran 
whose story is portrayed in the hit movie born on the fourth of 
july has not declared his candidacy but rep robert k dornan 
is taking no chances 
the republican congressman already is on the offensive against 
kovic in mailings that portray the veteran as a draft cardburning 
ultraliberal 
dornan sent out 20000 fundraising letters that reproduce an 
old newspaper photograph apparently showing kovic burning a draft 
card 
the letters received saturday by contributors called kovic the 
favorite of the ultraliberal hollywood left 
kovic whose transformation from patriotic marine to war 
opponent is recounted in the movie said sunday he would announce 
later this month whether he will run as a democrat in dornans 38th 
congressional district 
he called dornans letter a hatred campaign and a 
desperation move that will backfire 
its the false patriots who always attack the real heroes 
said kovic who received the purple heart and is paralyzed from the 
chest down from a combat wound 
while not stating he would run against dornan kovic said his 
time of dedicated service to my country has come again and 
that he was confident of victory if he does run 
dornans letter asks for immediate campaign contributions of 
100 or 150 and mentions the less savory aspects of kovics life 
as recounted in the motion picture 
the movie shows kovic in a panic and mistakenly shooting his 
corporal to death in vietnam visiting prostitutes abusing drugs 
and alcohol and cruelly insulting his parents a postscript said 
and this is a person the liberals want in the us congress no 
way 
the letter said kovic is fast becoming one of the liberals 
best hopes for 1990 and he will have access to hundreds of 
thousands of dollars from the hollywood left and liberals across 
the country 
kovic has said tom cruise who played him in the film will walk 
precincts if kovic decides to run 
i cant waste any time in case this guy is serious dornan 
said saturday hes threatening to bring tom cruise and jane 
fonda and pentagon papers defendant daniel ellsberg to town if 
hes going to bring in these big guns ive got to start building 
up my war chest

eddie murphy and his assistants ran up 5 
million in expenses during the making of the movie coming to 
america which has made no profit despite 350 million in ticket 
sales according to studio records 
last month pulitzer prizewinning columnist art buchwald and 
producer alain bernheim won a lawsuit against paramount pictures in 
which they said the studio took the concept for the 1988 movie from 
an idea by buchwald paramount was ordered to pay buchwald and 
bernheim 19 percent of the movies net profits 
a financial audit is scheduled during a forthcoming phase of the 
trial to determine how much money buchwald and bernheim should 
receive 
the financial documents released to the los angeles times by 
court order saturday were sealed during the trial at paramounts 
request but studio officials had testified that the movie was 
still in the red 
the amount of money paramount absorbed during the making of the 
movie could become an issue in the accounting phase of the suit 
according to the documents weekly charges to production made on 
murphys behalf included 4920 for a limousine and driver kept on 
call around the clock 2200 for a special motor home for murphy 
1592 to the motor homes driver 1500 for a personal trainer 
and 650 for a valet 
none of those expenses came out of murphys 8 million salary 
his 15 percent share of the films gross receipts his own travel 
and hotel expenses or his 5000aweek living allowance according 
to the documents

archbishop desmond tutu who is a member 
of harvard universitys governing board urged the school to 
withdraw its money from south africa until promised changes are 
made there 
tutu told reporters sunday that he had asked the 30member board 
of overseers to sell off 139 million in investments in companies 
that do business in south africa the money could be reinvested 
once it becomes clear that reforms promised by president fw de 
klerk will take place tutu said 
the board of overseers to which the anglican archbishop was 
elected last june had met earlier in the day in a closed session 
the board planned to further consider the divestment issue at a 
later meeting 
last week de klerk said he would release jailed african 
national congress leader nelson mandela and lift government bans on 
30 outlawed opposition groups 
tutu who won the 1984 nobel peace prize for his antiapartheid 
efforts praised de klerk for his announcement but said actual 
advancements would be decided by the south african parliament 
wed like to see these things immediately but lets be 
realistic the parliamentary session has just begun he said 
if de klerk is playing games they would be very odd games and 
the world would know how to act 
when asked why he was in massachusetts rather than in south 
africa at such a critical time tutu said harvard is harvard 
the things that harvard does and does not do have an impact far 
beyond what you would expect from an educational institution 
tutu ran for the harvard board on an antiapartheid slate and 
was elected last june along with labor secretary elizabeth dole 
and actor john lithgow

two masked men ambushed a busload of israeli 
tourists on an isolated desert road and opened fire with machine 
guns and hand grenades killing at least nine israelis and wounding 
20 officials said 
an egyptian tour guide also was wounded in sundays attack 
the bus was carrying 31 israelis the guide and an egyptian 
driver to cairo from rafeh a divided town on the egyptisrael 
border in the sinai peninsula it was attacked near the suez canal 
town of ismailiya 40 miles from the capital the egyptian 
government said 
two men in a white peugeot station wagon stopped the bus got 
out of the car and opened fire with machine guns said the 
government statement it said they hurled four hand grenades two 
of which exploded 
the vehicle became like hell at once there were shots from 
every direction grenades were thrown inside the bus and everything 
was covered with smoke said dr yigal barak a survivor who 
spoke on army radio in a telephone interview from an ismailiya 
hospital 
barak who was not injured said the attack lasted several 
minutes as many passengers lay flat on the floor he said he could 
not see the attackers but could hear they fired both from outside 
and from the open doors of the bus 
there was a terrible fear and the feeling of helplessness 
said barak nobody could protect us nobody carried any weapons 
it was the worst attack on israelis in egypt since 1985 and the 
deadliest single act of terror in egypt since moslem extremists 
killed president anwar sadat and seven others with him on a parade 
viewing stand on oct 6 1981 
the gunmen spoke arabic with nonegyptian accents the egyptian 
government statement said suggesting they were either palestinian 
or from other arab countries 
an unidentified man telephoned the cairo bureau of a western 
news agency and said the attack was in retaliation for alleged 
torture in egyptian prisons the caller claimed responsibility on 
behalf of the organization for the defense of oppressed in egyptian 
prisons a previously unknown group 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel speaking in a telephone 
interview with israel tv said it proves that hostility towards 
israel still exists and runs amok in the region 
president hosni mubarak telephoned shamir and issued a statement 
calling the attack monstrous he said it was aimed at thwarting 
efforts for middle east peace said the governmentrun middle east 
news agency 
a witness miriam kadmon was quoted by israel army radio as 
saying the cars driver signaled the bus to stop and the attackers 
then opened fire an egyptian screaming jumped out of the vehicle 
and was shot to death she said 
rivka betzer another survivor said that during the attack the 
gunmen told egyptian hitchikers aboard the bus to get off and that 
one or two israelis apparently got off with them and escaped 
israeli embassy spokeswoman doreet shavit said today that nine 
israelis were killed and 20 israelis wounded egyptian officials 
said the egyptian tour guide was hurt but the driver was not 
israeli officials in jerusalem said earlier that a 10th israeli 
died of wounds on a flight back to israel but a military official 
later corrected that report saying no one died in flight 
it was unclear if the witness who claimed an egyptian ran off 
the bus and was killed was referring to a hitchhiker or if she was 
in error egyptian officials did not mention any deaths among 
hitchhikers 
ms shavit said israel sent three medical teams to cairo aboard 
a c130 transport three of the wounded flew home overnight and 
the others were being flown back today 
mena quoted an unidentified senior security official as saying 
police found the peugeot station wagon on cairos northern 
outskirts early today he said some bullet casings were found 
inside the vehicle which is owned by an egyptian who rents it to 
tourist agencies 
the official said authorities had found clues as to the identity 
of the attackers but did not elaborate 
authorities tightened security in cairos southern suburb of 
maadi where many israeli diplomats live police threw up 
barricades and checked cars in the suburb where egyptian gunmen 
attacked israeli diplomats in 1984 and 1985 
the bus belonged to an egyptian tourist company called santa 
maria tours 
the tour was organized by ofakim an israeli tourist company 
albert levy an ofakim manager said the israelis had begun an 
eightday tour of egypt he said 12 members of the group lives in 
mevasseretziyyon a jerusalem suburb 
mubarak telephoned shamir to express condolences to families of 
the victims mubarak stressed that nothing should ever obstruct 
the peace process but this incident should be an incentive for 
going ahead to reach a final settlement of the arabisraeli 
conflict mena said 
egypt the only arab country to have peace with israel has been 
mediating efforts to get talks started between israeli officials 
and representatives of palestinians who have waged a 2yearold 
uprising against israeli rule of the west bank and gaza strip 
in washington state department spokesman george malleck said 
the attack represented an attempt by the enemies of peace to halt 
efforts at reconciliation and dialogue

israeli leaders said today an attack on a 
busload of israeli tourists in egypt was designed to harm israels 
peaceful relations with the arab country and ruin chances for peace 
talks with the palestinians 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said there is no doubt that 
those who carried it out planned it in advance in order to harm the 
israelis harm israels ties with egypt and maybe harm the chances 
of achieving peace in the region 
some officials said sundays attack which claimed nine lives 
seemed timed to coincide with a sensitive moment in middle east 
peace efforts 
it came two days before a crucial meeting was scheduled by prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc at which shamir 
was expected to defend his middle east peace plan against assaults 
by influential party hawks 
shamirs plan calls for palestinian elections in the occupied 
territories as a first step toward peace the hawks say the plan 
which has been approved by israels coalition government could 
lead to a palestinian state 
after the bus attack trade minister ariel sharon shamirs 
chief opponent announced on israel army radio that the likud 
session would be delayed to an unspecified date 
shamir said today before the postponement it is clear we dont 
think now about internal struggle and about settling accounts 
if shamir manages to overcome his partys hawks the next step 
would be a washington meeting urged by us secretary of state 
james a baker iii with israels and egypts foreign ministers to 
set the stage for the first israelipalestinian dialogue 
but the emotional climate surrounding the bus attack could 
strengthen the hand of likuds hardliners the hawks who fear 
shamirs plan could give the plo a role in negotiations blamed 
egypts links with the group for the attack 
we should not accept any expressions of sorrow any more the 
egyptians have to prove they are disassociated only by one way a 
total rejection of the plo yehoshua matza a likud legislator 
said on israel army radio sunday 
sharon said there are those who believe that egypt is an 
important contributor to peace but i say that egypt does not 
contribute to peace the positions of egypt and the plo are 
one 
ehud olmert likuds cabinet minister in charge of arab affairs 
said that diplomatic links with egypt are important but 
suggested israelis should stop visiting egypt 
last year about 90000 israelis visited egypt according to 
israeli reports in 1986 israeli tourism to egypt came to a 
virtual halt for a year following the oct 6 1985 attack in which 
an egyptian policeman shot and killed seven israeli tourists in the 
sinai peninsula 
other likud officials including some of shamirs supporters 
were more cautious about blaming egypt the only arab country that 
has made peace with israel 
i hope it would not influence the relations between israel and 
egypt foreign minister moshe arens said 
finance minister shimon peres of the leftofcenter labor party 
shamirs rival and coalition partner said israel should pursue its 
peace plan regardless of the attack 
its clear to me that those who fired wanted to hurt that 
process peres said of course such an attack does not help 
the peace process but it should not be stopped by several mad 
terrorists 
the leftist peace now group issued a statement calling on jews 
and arabs to act together to stop a crazy minority ready to spill 
blood in order to stop the peace process 
faisal husseni a leading proplo activist condemned the 
attack he told the associated press in a telephone interview that 
such violence comes from groups who are fed by the stubbon 
israeli position in the peace process

an unusual study of presidents children 
concludes that having a father in the white house brings more 
problems than opportunity 
almost any enterprise is criticized says the report on 
all the presidents children commissioned by george bushs 
eldest son george w bush while his father was still 
presidentelect 
douglas wead reviewed the lives of presidential offspring from 
john adams to ronald reagan and concluded that history should be 
a sobering warning to any new arrivals at the white house 
being related to a president may bring more problems than 
opportunity wead cautioned in his 44page treatise excerpts 
from which appear in the latest issue of us news amp world report 
if an enterprise is successful its assumed that it is 
because of the relationship if not the public assumes the son or 
daughter is lazy or incompetent wead reported 
wead found a consistent pattern of trouble for the sons and 
daughters of presidents the magazine reported 
there were higherthanaverage rates of divorce alcoholism 
and accidental death a wide variety of scandals over real or 
perceived conflicts of interest and constant frustration over lack 
of independence 
some presidential offspring became prominent in their own right 
john quincy adams became president himself and theodore 
roosevelts four sons were war heroes 
others met tragedy during their fathers term calvin coolidge 
jr died of blood poisoning after a freak accident on the white 
house tennis court abraham lincolns son willie died of 
pneumonia in his fathers arms 
the magazine ran the excerpts as part of a story looking at how 
the five bush children are faring under the spotlight 
george walker bush 43 last year became a part owner and 
managing partner of the texas rangers baseball team he also ruled 
out a race for governor of texas 
another son neil 35 a denver oil executive is currently 
under investigation by federal bank regulators as a former member 
of the board of directors of a major bank that collapsed silverado 
banking savings amp loan association the silverado bailout is 
expected to cost taxpayers 1 billion 
the magazine reports that when neil called his father recently 
to say he wanted to fight the silverado charges rather than accept 
a negotiated settlement the president told him dont worry 
about me dont worry about the presidency do whats best for neil 
bush 
daughter dorothy leblond 30 a tourism official for the state 
of maine recently filed for divorce from her husband of seven 
years 
jeb bush 36 is a miami real estate developer active in state 
gop politics marvin 33 is a business entrepreneur who lives just 
across the potomac in alexandria va 
marvin who had part of his colon removed in 1986 has been a 
prominent supporter of the national foundation for ileitis and 
colitis 
wead spelled out some of the pitfalls of white house kinship for 
the bush children 
try something great and you appear grandiose and 
presumptuous try to lead a quiet normal life and you appear 
lazy or unambitious try something artistic and you will offend 
those who believe in causes wead said 
the presidential child in business faces the pressure of 
enormous scrutiny two things the media and the public wont allow 
success or failure keep the business mediocre maintain a personal 
low profile and you will be left alone said wead a white house 
liaison to conservative groups

the start of parliament on friday in a historic speech opening 
the session de klerk lifted bans on the african national congress 
and other militant opposition groups declared a moratorium on 
executions eased restrictions on the media and pledged to free 
anc leader nelson mandela soon 
de klerk said his intention was to draw black leaders into 
negotiations on a constitution that would extend political rights 
to the black majority he said sunday the government would 
implement major constitutional changes only after white voters were 
allowed to convey their views 
mandelas wife winnie visited her husband sunday and said 
later that the whiteled government still must be pressured into 
further reforms before mandela can go free 
she said those conditions include lifting the 3yearold state 
of emergency and she appealed for renewed pressure on authorities 
to lift it 
unfortunately the obstacles that were in the way which 
prevented his release on friday still exist mrs mandela said 
after the fourhour visit at the victor verster prison farm 
it doesnt depend on him when he will be released she 
said but in answer to repeated questions about the obstacles she 
said mandela still demands the complete lifting of the state of 
emergency 
dullah omar an antiapartheid lawyer who accompanied mrs 
mandela said mandela also demands that the government free all 
jailed members of his african national congress including those 
convicted of violent acts de klerk offered to free prisoners 
convicted of belonging to the anc but not those convicted of 
terrorism or murder 
under the emergency regulations that remain in effect the 
government can detain anyone for up to six months without charge 
police have wide powers to ban meetings or speeches and restrict 
televison or photo coverage of their own actions in dealing with 
unrest 
van der merwe said today that the government was ready to open 
negotiations promptly and contended that some antiapartheid groups 
were looking for excuses not to talk 
the anc has said it will enter negotiations only if mandela and 
other political prisoners were freed the state of emergency was 
lifted outlawed opposition groups were legalized executions were 
halted and troops were removed from black townships 
to a large extent these conditions have now been met de klerk 
has expressed a desire to meet the remaining conditions soon 
de klerk issued a statement through governmentrun radio sunday 
night responding to comments from anc officials that the guerrilla 
campaign would continue if that happened de klerk was quoted as 
saying the world would turn against them 
mandela 71 was jailed in 1962 and is serving a life sentence 
for helping to plan the start of the ancs sabotage and bombing 
campaign against the government 
mrs mandela said her husband was preparing a reaction to de 
klerks speech but she didnt know when it would be made public 
because he remains a prisoner 
on her return to johannesburg she said the document being 
prepared by her husband would indicate the circumstances under 
which he would be released and would indicate when his release is 
expected 
de klerk has said people imprisoned only for membership in 
outlawed organizations or nonviolent support of such groups would 
be freed those convicted of violent crimes including 
participation in the ancs bombing campaign that killed 40 people 
and injured 680 over the past three years would not be freed 
in pretoria sunday assailants shot out windows at the british 
embassy a day earlier rightwing graffiti was spraypainted on 
the building no one was injured and no one claimed responsibility 
for the incidents which may have been in retaliation for britains 
endorsement of de klerks reforms

a woman feeding cattle in a pasture 100 
yards from her home found a plane that had crashed four days 
earlier all four people aboard were dead including two teenage 
children of a congressional candidate 
the pilot and a newspaper publisher also were among the dead 
recovered sunday the four had been on a campaign swing wednesday 
with state rep bill brewster who was kicking off his campaign for 
congress 
police said the crash victims probably died instantly when the 
plane bound for ardmore buried its nose in a pasture in coal 
county shortly after taking off from nearby mcalester in stormy 
weather 
we believe it crashed within 30 minutes of departure but that 
wont be known for a while highway patrol lt mike grimes said 
were basing that estimate on the distance the plane was from its 
departure point 
the victims were kecia brewster 16 and kent brewster 13 who 
had accompanied their father on his campaign for the 3rd district 
congressional seat herb pate 32 publisher of the madill record 
and pilot jack kirkpatrick 43 of broken arrow 
brewster and his wife were in another plane because he was 
heading to oklahoma city to attend a legislative session while the 
children were heading home to marietta near ardmore a third plane 
carrying brewsters other daughter and campaign workers landed 
safely at ardmore 
the crash site was about 7 miles north of coalgate in 
southeastern oklahoma roughly halfway between mcalester and 
ardmore

transportation safety board will investigate 
freda rogers who lives about 100 yards from the crash site was 
feeding cattle on her property about 4 pm sunday when she saw 
something shiny highway patrol lt stewart meyer said ms rogers 
called coal county sheriff joe stone who confirmed the plane was 
the missing aircraft meyer said

an attack on the british 
embassy has increased fears that white extremists may begin lashing 
out in anger at the sweeping political changes proposed by 
president fw de klerk 
assailants shot out windows at the embassy in pretoria on 
sunday a day after rightwing graffiti was spraypainted on the 
building the graffiti said the struggle begins order of the 
boer afrikaner people 
police said they have never heard of the group but are 
investigating 
it is suspected that the attack by the right wing might have 
come about because we the british government have emphasized our 
support for the decisions announced by president de klerk 
embassy spokesman john sawyer said today 
de klerk in a speech friday legalized or lifted restrictions 
on more than 60 antiapartheid groups including the african 
national congress and promised to release jailed anc leader nelson 
mandela 
rightwing whites accused the president of capitulating to the 
countrys black majority and have vowed to resist the changes 
robert von tonder leader of a group that seeks a whitesonly 
homeland said de klerks changes could lead to the formation of an 
underground guerrilla movement for whites 
several other rightwing groups have said repeatedly they will 
take up arms if they believe the government has abandoned white 
privilege 
the proapartheid conservative party which won 31 percent of 
the white vote in last years elections is planning a major rally 
feb 15 in pretoria the capital to protest against the 
revolutionary leftwing announcements by de klerk 
most rightwing whites are afrikaners primarily of dutch 
descent they began settling in south africa more than 300 years 
ago and now account for about 3 million of the countrys 5 million 
whites 
in school they are taught that their role as rulers was ordained 
by god until several years ago the main afrikaner church taught 
that the foundations of apartheid were found in the bible 
de klerks legalization of the anc has outraged many 
rightwingers who for years have been told by the government that 
the black guerrilla movement was communistcontrolled terrorist 
group 
several recent incidents suggest a growing militancy among 
rightwing groups 
police brig floris mostert said in court last month that 
authorities had uncovered the existence of a secret organization 
with members from all levels of society which strives to 
terrorize leftwing radicals with the aid of violence and 
intimidation he declined to elaborate 
police in december announced the arrest of five men suspected 
of planning attacks against de klerk and other government leaders 
as well as antiapartheid activists the men allegedly broke away 
from the neonazi afrikaner resistance movement because they felt 
the group was not taking decisive measures to oppose de klerks 
reforms 
rightwing whites continue to champion the cause of barend 
strydom a selfprofessed white supremacist who shot dead seven 
blacks and an indian in pretoria in 1988 supporters held a service 
in november to commemorate the first anniversary of the shooting 
strydom is on death row for the killings 
the mayor of welkom a conservative mining town was tarred 
and feathered last year after he granted permission for a 
multiracial running race

construction starts 
the buildings owners eventually withdrew their hud application 
and obtained the mortgage insurance elsewhere newsday said

gen michel aouns troops drove a rival 
christian militia from a key coastal town north of beirut today and 
prepared for a final assault to dislodge the militia from the 
capital police said 
police said 64 more people were killed and 95 wounded in both 
christian and moslem neighborhoods since sunday 
the latest casualties raised the toll to at least 274 people 
killed and 1030 wounded in the weekold fighting between aouns 
forces and the christian militia of samir geagea the factions are 
battling for control of the christian enclave 
in beirut already devastated by fighting between the christian 
factions a fourhour gun battle broke out sunday between rival 
shiite moslem factions in the southern slums police said four 
people were killed and seven wounded before syrian troops moved in 
to separate the iranianbacked fundamentalist hezbollah or party 
of god and the syrianallied amal militia 
a committee representing maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah 
sfeir called a ceasefire for 215 pm today the seventh in a 
week of fighting between the christian forces 
but the lebanese forces charged in a communique that aouns 
forces mounted a largescale attack on the militias strongholds in 
east beiruts ein rummaneh district at the very moment the 
ceasefire was slated to start pitched battles are raging 
earlier today aoun began to regroup armored forces at the 
northern and northeastern entrances to beiruts eastern christian 
sector after helicopterborne paratroopers seized the strategic 
coastal town of dbaye in closequarter combat sunday authorities 
said 
a police spokesman said aouns soldiers mostly trained by us 
marines are mopping up geageas lebanese forces militiamen from 
a few remaining pockets of resistance in dbaye before turning to 
the beirut battle 
the latest casualties included 59 fighters killed and 70 wounded 
in the battle for dbaye 
dbayes capture was aouns first meaningful victory in the 
showdown for mastery of lebanons christian enclave 
shelling duels slackened at dawn allowing tens of thousands of 
residents to venture out from basements and underground bomb 
shelters for the first time in six days to take stock of the 
destruction 
however the civil defense department said fire brigades had no 
water to battle fires raging out of control because all pumping 
stations had been knocked out of action 
i am stunned said youssef khazen 35 whose electrical tool 
shop in east beiruts residential district of ashrafiyeh was gutted 
you cannot believe what those monsters have done to us they 
simply ruined us ashrafiyeh looks like it was struck by a 
hurricane khazen told the associated press by telephone 
a lebanese forces statement today conceded the loss of dbaye 
saying the 80man militia garrison which was outnumbered and 
outgunned made a tactical retreat of 200 meters 
dbaye five miles north of beirut sits at a strategic traffic 
junction of the coastal highway that links beirut and north 
lebanon the road has been closed since the outbreak of the 
fighting 
it also has a harbor that would enable aouns forces to disrupt 
maritime supplies to geageas command headquarters in east beirut 
lebanese forces defenders had held off repeated tank attacks in 
east beirut by aouns forces 
they might not be able to hold longer the general is now in a 
stronger position said the police spokesman who cannot be 
identified under standing regulations 
both aoun and geagea are maronite catholics the dominant 
christian sect 
the general appointed head of an interim military cabinet in 
september 1988 by outgoing president amin gemayel considers 
himself the sole legitimate authority in lebanon 
geagea has been the christians standard bearer in the nearly 
15yearold civil war against the moslems 
aoun has 20000 troops geageas heavily armed militia has 6000 
fighters and 30000 reservists 
aouns inability to crush geagea has led to speculation that he 
risks being ousted by his troops if he does not deliver a quick 
victory 
at least 1000 of his fighters have defected 600 to the 
lebanese forces and 400 to gen emile lahoud the army commander 
named by syrianbacked president elias hrawi military sources 
reported 
hrawi another maronite was elected by parliament nov 24 with 
a mandate to oversee a peace plan brokered by the arab league in 
october he fired aoun as interim prime minister and army 
commander but aoun refused to quit 
aoun rejected the peace accord because it fails to guarantee the 
withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops from lebanon aoun considers the 
syrians who entered lebanon in 1976 under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate to be an army of occupation 
in damascus syria us ambassador edward djerjian today blamed 
aouns personal quest for power for the christian battles 
aoun should step aside and all parties including the lebanese 
armed forces should support president elias hrawi now in urgent 
work for restoring legal authority he said

the 5yearold girl tossed her hair twisted around 
in the chair rolled her head raised her arms stood up and sat 
down again all the while dutifully answering questions from the 
nice lady with the rag doll 
a camera rolled behind a twoway mirror as the two went through 
a delicate procedure that has become vital in prosecution of child 
abuse cases 
the lady told the girl that sometimes unpleasant things happen 
to little children and maybe they could talk about it she pulled 
out a clothed rag doll with hair of yarn and anatomical details 
such as breasts and genitals 
together the child and interviewer pointed to the different 
body parts no no one had ever touched her there said the child 
pointing she was sure despite physical evidence of abuse the 
little girl wasnt talking that day 
in recent years the use of anatomical dolls has grown as more 
child abuse cases are prosecuted but a new study shows that the 
dolls effectiveness in aiding a childs memory may be overrated 
these dolls have become very popular because some 
psychologists believe they do something magical eliciting 
information they otherwise couldnt get at said bruce forman a 
university of miami psychologist but our findings indicate 
thats probably not so 
anatomical dolls became available in the late 1970s and early 
1980s and now are common in social workers and prosecutors 
offices and police agencies the dolls costing up to 75 have 
evolved from crude unclothed figures to lessthreatening more 
realistic ones with underwear and bright clothes 
experts agree that the dolls can help some children tell what 
happened to them especially those who are very young or are 
embarrassed to talk about the incident but the evidence is less 
clear in terms of what interview tool helps get the best 
information from an abused child and what is normal behavior 
clinically many believe the dolls have a place in evaluating 
suspected abused kids that cannot be taken over by another tool 
said mark everson a psychologist and codirector of the clinical 
research program on childhood maltreatment at the university of 
north carolina at chapel hill 
in a study of whether dolls anatomical explicitness would lead 
a nonabused child to act out in a sexually suggestive manner 
everson found that 6 percent of more than 200 children aged 25 
showed fairly clear sexual acts with the dolls during an interview 
even when there was no history of abuse 
in the miami study 45 children aged 8 and 9 viewed a 
12minute film often used in sexualabuse awareness programs one 
group later told what they remembered verbally another by drawing 
pictures and a third with the dolls 
we found no significant difference in accuracy or completeness 
of information recalled forman said the results of the study 
will be published in the journal social behavior and 
personality 
in another study of 32 girls aged 58 the miami researchers 
found that abused girls showed somewhat more aggression and sexual 
play with the dolls if an observer was not in the room than did 
nonabused girls with an adult in the room there was little 
difference between the two groups forman said 
however not all of the abused girls showed increased agression 
and sexual play indicating a need for more research on what is 
normal behavior he said 
from our work we know that children who have not been abused 
display some curiosity about sexual body parts and thats normal 
and healthy when it appears at the appropriate age it is 
important he added that aggression shown by a child doesnt 
necessarily imply a history of sexual abuse 
weve only scratched the surface of how children react there 
are still a lot of questions he said 
although much has been made of the potential for 
overinterpretation of childrens interaction with anatomical 
dolls they have become an integral part of childabuse 
investigations and the prosecution of mass child abuse cases 
videotaped interviews of children with the dolls was among 
evidence used to convict frank fuster escalona in 1985 in one of 
floridas most notorious cases involving the abuse of children at 
a babysitting service in dade county the story was retold 
recently in the tv movie unspeakable acts 
fuster is serving six consecutive life sentences his wife 
ileana was also convicted in the socalled country walk case 
which involved allegations of nude sex games and satanic animal 
sacrifices she served about four years of a 10year sentence and 
was deported to her native honduras 
among defense criticisms was that children had been manipulated 
during the interviews and that using the dolls was inappropriate 
said john hogan lead prosecutor obviously the jury didnt put 
much credence in that 
in california defense attorneys also made an issue of how 
children were interviewed in the mcmartin preschool molestation 
case peggy mcmartin buckey was cleared and son raymond buckey was 
acquitted on most charges last month in the alleged molestation of 
11 children at the nowdefunct school in manhattan beach a suburb 
of los angeles prosecutors last week said they will retry raymond 
buckey on the 13 counts on which the jury deadlocked 
mary emmons executive director of childrens institute 
international where the children were interviewed said defense 
attorneys were just doing their job in attacking the methods for 
the most part the methods used by mental health professionals are 
wellstablished clinical methods designed to aid children in 
telling what may or may not have happened she said 
others in the field echo that sentiment 
i have seen some criticism of use of the dolls and frankly 
it all gets blown out of proportion said patricia toth of the 
national center for prosecution of child abuse a nonprofit group 
based in alexandria va 
people latch onto the dolls as if theyre responsible for 
conviction of innocent people toth said i truly dont think 
they have the impact people attach to them dolls in and of 
themselves dont make the case 
at the childrens center in miami run by the dade state 
attorneys office dolls play a prominent role in interviews they 
are primarily used for showing exactly what happened after a child 
has already talked about an incident said teresa pooler an 
assistant state attorney and director of the center 
the center founded in december 1986 after the country walk 
case has about 18 dolls in adult child and toddler size the 
females have vaginas and breasts and the males have penises an 
average of 70 children are interviewed a month 
we use the dolls for demonstrative purposes not for diagnosis 
as to whether something in fact occurred said pooler adding 
children often have different names for body parts and difficulty 
with spatial relationships 
i think anything that can be used to elicit a statement from a 
child is a positive thing she said provided its used 
properly

doctors at a hospital where the worlds 
first implant of a lung assist device has taken place say it may be 
years before they can assess its potential 
last week a 16yearold girl became the first human recipient 
of the intravascular oxygenator known as ivox the girl whose 
name was not released remained in critical condition at lds 
hospital early today 
dr alan morris director of pulmonary research and dr terry 
clemmer director of criticalcare medicine said it may be months 
or even years before they can assess the medical significance of 
ivox which has received approval by the us food and drug 
administration for up to 10 experimental implants 
ivox is an inchwide bundle of plastic fibers that mimic the 
lungs task of supplying oxygen to the body it was implanted 
during a twohour operation friday 
it was unclear how long doctors hope to keep the device in the 
patient in september guidelines approved by the food and drug 
administration limited implants to seven days in people with acute 
respiratory failure who have little or no chance of survival 
however hospital spokesman tim madden said sunday the seven 
days is considered to be a rough guideline by doctors 
its not hard and fast although there is a limit they think 
they can use it for and that is about a week he said 
hospital officials have released little information about the 
operation or the patients status madden said he was unable to 
discuss how doctors would decide when to remove the device that 
would get into an area i just cant he said 
ivoxs developer dr jd mortensen of salt lake city says 
while it cannot be called an artificial lung it represents an 
important step toward eventual development of one 
implantation involves insertion of the device via the neck or 
groin into the inferior vena cava the large vein that brings blood 
to the heart 
two tubes the diameter of a soda straw are attached to the ivox 
bundle consisting of 9001200 hollow porous fibers each about 
the diameter of a human hair one delivers oxygen to the body from 
an oxygen system or tank the other removes carbon dioxide a waste 
product of breathing 
mortensen said the initial fdaapproved human experiments will 
involve only patients with acute lung disease such as pneumonia or 
smoke inhalation not longterm chronic disorders such as cystic 
fibrosis or emphysema 
the only alternative for people with acute lung failure is an 
extra corporeal oxygenator a large machine that requires pumping 
the blood outside the body

east germanys parliament today added eight 
members of prodemocracy groups to communist premier hans modrows 
government giving the opposition seats in the cabinet for the 
first time in the countrys 40year history 
the communists now hold less than half of the 36 cabinet seats 
also today parliament banned the ultraright republican party 
of west germany from operating in east germany the party had been 
hoping to attract major voter support during upcoming elections 
on sunday the communist party changed its name and promised to 
hand over 600 million in assets to the government in an attempt to 
refurbish its image before the elections the first free balloting 
in the countrys history is set for march 18 
in an address to parliament modrow said today that german 
reunification is inevitable although many obstacles need to be 
overcome because the two german nations have vastly different legal 
and financial structures he said his proposal last week that a 
united germany be neutral was not meant to be the final word on the 
matter 
i never believed that all points of my proposals would be 
accepted by everyone he said 
the united states and other nato countries insist that a united 
germany be a part of the western alliance west germany has said 
that while it seeks german unity it will not leave nato 
i made my proposals on unification to create conditions 
for the inevitable process of unification of the german states 
modrow said 
modrow asked west germany to provide immediate shortterm 
financial assistance to help stabilize east germanys flagging 
economy which has been further worsened by strikes and an exodus 
of more than 50000 east germans to west germany this year 
the communists are widely blamed for the nations economic 
problems 
modrow told parliament that east germany needs a government of 
national responsibiity to lead it away from the brink of 
economic disaster and toward the free elections which were made 
possible by a prodemocracy revolution last year that ousted 
hardline communist party chief erich honecker 
following modrows address parliament approved his 
recommendations that the eight opposition officials be added to his 
cabinet 
the communist party now holds 17 of 36 seats in the new 
government besides those given to the prodemocracy forces the 
other seats are held by parties once aligned with the communists 
the eight newly appointed opposition officials are tatjana boehm

the treasury department said today that 
beginning next oct 1 it will not issue 50 and 75 series ee 
savings bonds through payroll savings plans making 100 bonds the 
minimum denomination for plan participants 
this step is one of several initiatives that will assure the 
longterm strength of the savings bonds program by reducing 
administrative costs richard l gregg commissioner of the 
public debt said in a statement 
the change does not affect overthecounter sales at financial 
institutions where 50 and 75 bonds will still be available 
the treasury said employees who currently buy 50 and 75 bonds 
will not be required to complete new bond authorizations instead 
current allotments will automatically be applied to the purchase of 
100 bonds 
the treasury began phasing out 50 and 75 bonds from payroll 
savings in february 1988 by no longer offering them to new 
enrollees 
payroll savings allows employees to buy savings bonds on the 
installment plan through regular payments withheld from their 
paychecks bonds are issued when the price of a bond is accumulated

ethnic albanians today mourned 25 
activists killed in clashes with police and leaders of both the 
albanian majority and slav minority said they see no hope of talks 
to end the ethnic violence 
several thousand ethnic albanians assembled in the center of 
this provincial capital for a moment of silence called by newly 
formed opposition groups at 2 pm car horns sounded throughout 
the city and pedestrians stopped on sidewalks raising their hands 
in the v for victory sign 
planes flew overhead and riot police stood by but did not 
interfere as the moment ended people applauded then returned to 
their daily routine 
we are not terrorists were just paying homage we didnt 
kill anybody we want every nation to live in equality and 
freedom one ethnic albanian participant said 
in their quest for more autonomy the ethnic albanians have 
taken up calls sounded elsewhere in eastern europe for multiparty 
democracy free elections and the release of political prisoners 
throughout the countryside today cars stopped on roads people 
filled village streets and workers put down their tools in fields 
and factories to observe the moment of silence 
on a hillside outside pristina 200 mourners stood silently at 
the grave of one of the 25 demonstrators who have been killed in 
clashes with police since jan 24 a security forces helicopter 
hovered overhead 
on friday federal authorities brought at least a temporary halt 
to the killing they sent army tanks into kosovo and staged a show 
of force with military jets flying low over pristina and other 
cities 
but leaders of both kosovos ethnic albanians who make up 90 
percent of the provinces 19 million inhabitants and its slav 
minority of serbs and montenegrins said today there was little hope 
for a peaceful resolution 
the peace is just a cover said bogdan kecman leader of the 
serb minority group bozur inside war is raging 
ethnic albanian leader ibrahim rugova a writer who chairs the 
newly formed democratic union of kosovo echoed kecmans pessimism 
the ethnic albanians have been seeking more autonomy since 
serbia the yugoslav republic that administers kosovo last year 
imposed greater control over the provinces police judiciary and 
schools 
the serb minority says the move was necessary to protect slavs 
in kosovo from alleged harassment by ethnic albanians that is 
driving them out of the region the cradle of serbian culture 
there cannot be any talks with albanian nationalists kecman 
told the associated press the serbs allege that the ethnic 
albanians seek union with neighboring communist albania 
also today the trial of kosovos former leader azem vllasi 
and 14 other ethnic albanians resumed in titova mitrovica north of 
pristina 
vllasi a political archrival of serbian president slobodan 
milosevic and the others are accused of counterrevolutionary 
activities and of inciting last years unrest

mikhail s gorbachev told the communist party 
leadership today that the time has come to loosen the partys iron 
grip on power and compete with others for the right to rule the 
soviet union 
his landmark speech to the partys central committee came a day 
after perhaps the largest protest in moscow since the bolshevik 
revolution at least 200000 impassioned citizens marched to the 
kremlin demanding that the party embrace reform and end exclusive 
control of the government 
at the opening session of a pivotal twoday central committee 
meeting gorbachev made essentially the same proposal 
the party intends to struggle for the role of ruling party 
but do it strictly in the framework of the democratic process 
rejecting any kind of legal or political advantage gorbachev 
told the policymaking body 
the party will present its own program put it out for 
discussion cooperate with other publicpolitical forces the 
soviet leader said in remarks distributed by the tass news agency 
the meeting comes at a time of growing dissatisfaction with the 
communist leadership by the populace plagued by chronic shortages 
and ethnic unrest 
the tass news agency reported that gorbachev urged the party to 
move up the next communist party congress theoretically the 
partys highestranking body to late june 
presumably it would be to allow him to choose a new central 
committee and further advance radical reforms in the party 
the 251member central committee despite extensive changes made 
by gorbachev in recent years is still regarded by reformers as a 
bastion of party conservatives who worry that gorbachevs reforms 
are leading the country to economic collapse and ethnic strife 
the proposed changes by gorbachev would meet some of the demands 
of the reformers who rallied an estimated 200000 people just 
outside the kremlin on sunday 
one of their leaders communist reformer boris n yeltsin said 
the central committees plenary meeting represented the partys 
last chance 
tass said yeltsin who remains a central committee member 
despite his populist campaign against party privilege was one of 
those who spoke after gorbachev during the opening session of the 
central committee meeting 
gorbachevs statement to central committee meeting which had 
been anticipated for weeks and expected to turn into a battle 
between conservatives and reformers pushed the party toward 
elimination of its constitutionally guaranteed position as the 
leading and guiding force of soviet society 
the former soviet satellites of eastern europe abd party leaders 
in the soviet baltic republics already have given up their 
exclusive right to power 
the political reforms through which he has strengthened the 
government at the expense of the party apparatus have been 
accompanied by a growth in political pluralism gorbachev said 
this process can lead to the creation of parties at some stage 
gorbachev declared that the party now was ready to act taking 
into account these new circumstances cooperate and carry out a 
dialogue with all organizations that stand on constitutional 
grounds and the social structure established in it 
earlier last week gorbachev denied a us broadcast report that 
he was considering stepping down as party chief but remaining 
president in such a scenario gorbachev would continue to run the 
country with the decisonmaking power once concentrated in the 
party transferred to legislative bodies 
some demonstrators on sunday carried signs warning communist 
officials who resist change to remember romania where 
communist dicatator nicolae ceausescu was toppled in a bloody 
december revolution 
others called for the ruling party politburo to resign 
it served notice on the central committee that a disgruntled 
populace expects radical changes the people are angered by the 
dismal state of the economy which has wrought worsening consumer 
shortages and they resent that many communist officials exploit 
their power and enjoy comforts and goods denied the populace 
a wall of protesters 60 wide and more than a halfmile long had 
marched from gorky park through some of moscows widest streets 
to a rally at the steps of the moscow hotel across from red square 
they demanded that the communist party give up its 
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on political power 
we need a free society with a free economy a society of 
free people declared economist gavriil popov 
the crowd waved huge whiteredandblue flags of 
prerevolutionary russia 
long live the beginning of the peaceful nonviolent 
revolution of february 1990 historian yuri afanasiev told the 
cheering crowd 
the rally united reformers from the peoples front organizations 
of moscow and russia the association of moscow voters the 
memorial group dedicated to remembering the victims of stalin and 
other reformers it marked another step in a rapid solidification 
of the reformers movement 
the radio moscow news service interfax also said gorbachev was 
planning structural reforms that would reduce the size of the 
central committee and possibly eliminate the politburo he also was 
expected to give tacit approval to the concept of private property 
however he cautioned that a retooled political system could not 
be considered a solution for all the countrys problems 
the soviet union is the last warsaw pact country where the 
communists still have a guaranteed lock on power 
however in the countrys baltic republics the party already 
has given up its claim to exclusive power and many small local 
parties are forming to compete in local elections scheduled for 
later this month 
many moscow observers expected the central committee meeting to 
develop into a pitched battled between reformers who want quicker 
change and conservatives who feel that reforms are wrecking the 
economy and causing ethnic strife 
the twoday central committee meeting is likely to be the last 
before local elections most of the voting is scheduled to take 
place in the next six weeks 
many prominent local party officials were embarrassed by defeat 
in the last national elections in march

it is the federal governments newest 
nuclear reactor a gleaming showcase amid aging cold warera 
plants and it is about to be closed 
the department of energy in a costcutting move announced last 
week it will shut the hanford nuclear reservations fast flux test 
facility 
the 8yearold test reactor largest of its kind never had a 
permanent mission supporters hoped to win the assignment of 
producing plutonium for the space program instead of using the 
reactor here doe will rely on reactors more than 30 years old at 
the savannah river project near aiken sc 
the department says that project costs far less to maintain and 
operate than the 1 billion flux 
savannah river has been shut down because of safety problems 
however and hanfords supporters say its hypocritical for the 
department supposedly committed to safety to cast its fate with 
the south carolina project 
this is a reactor that meets every standard and they dont 
want to pay for it said rep sid morrison rwash who is 
leading a fight in congress to restore operating funds for one of 
the biggest employers in his district 
flux is the only defense reactor that meets federal standards 
for commercial nuclear plants said sen brock adams dwash and 
it has an operating record commercial reactors would envy running 
98 percent of the time it was supposed to in 1986 the energy 
department said 
but the department facing billions of dollars in replacement 
costs from decades of mismanaging its reactor complexes here in 
south carolina in colorado and elsewhere decided to shut flux 
during the next four years 
that will cost 1000 jobs at hanford which lost 2000 jobs 
during the past two years when plutonium production for nuclear 
weapons ended 
unfortunately the message people get out of this is they may 
be praised for their work ethics and attitudes but the jobs will 
go somewhere else that is cheaper morrison said 
built as a prototype for the clinch river breeder reactor 
program flux began life in 1982 without a permanent mission when 
congress decided to kill that expensive experiment to design a 
reactor that could generate and burn its own plutonium 
but the hanford test reactor was started up and has been 
performing experiments on the durability of reactor parts and fuel 
producing radioactive isotopes for medicine and carrying out other 
functions 
fast flux refers to the speed of neutrons on the reactor 
core during the fission process the neutrons are not slowed down 
as in conventional reactors which makes the production of nuclear 
fuel quicker 
lacking a permanent mission the test reactor faced annual 
funding battles but last year energy secretary james watkins 
offered encouragement that production of plutonium238 for the 
nations space reactor program would be transferred from savannah 
river to hanford after extensive modifications 
but a budget analysis prepared for the department showed that 
modifying and operating the hanford reactor for plutonium 
production would cost more than 1 billion through fiscal 1995 
versus 172 million at savannah river 
in addition the department said once savannah rivers reactors 
are restarted they would be the only ones able to produce 
plutonium in the early 1990s in time to meet national aeronautics 
and space administration and pentagon needs 
hanford supporters say the energy departments budget concerns 
did not factor in the costs of writing off the 1 billion 
investment in flux it also didnt take into account that the 
savannah river plants will have to be replaced soon anyway if 
restarted at all 
the flux shutdown is scheduled to begin in april and conclude by 
fiscal 1994 at a cost estimated at 275 million 
though members of the states congressional delegation 
unanimously promised to fight the shutdown some conceded privately 
that they face an uphill battle 
for one thing the savannah river plants are much cheaper to 
operate 
for another the energy department cushioned the blow to hanford 
by boosting the sites total budget request by 217 million to a 
record 12 billion and adding 300 jobs to a workforce of more 
than 13000 most of the increases will go toward the 30year 
cleanup of the nuclear wastes at the departments most polluted 
site 
but morrison argues that cleanup funds are owed because of past 
federal abuses of the environment 
hanford was created as part of the manhattan project to beat 
nazi germany to the atomic bomb during world war ii and residents 
are proud of their history of making something useful for the 
nation morrison said 
we want to produce something morrison said thats born 
in us

the senior republican on the senate armed 
services committee said today his panel will look into a report 
that the pentagon has stockpiled 30 billion worth of unnecessary 
supplies and equipment 
sen john warner of virginia said that he and sen sam nunn 
dga the armed services committee chairman will go to work on 
the problem described in a senate budget committee staff report 
disclosed over the weekend 
warner however said he did not believe the value of 
unnecessary supplies was as high as 30 billion saying he thought 
it was more like 10 billion he said he based the lower estimate 
on discussions he had with an assistant secretary of defense whom 
he did not identify 
the report said that the defense department has roughly 100 
billion in supplies and equipment stockpiled at various 
installations and that as much as 30 billion worth of the material 
is going to waste 
they have a 13000year supply of a particular part for an 
f14 fighter aircraft sen james sasser dtenn chairman of 
the budget committee said today there are a number of other 
instances similar to that 
the budget committees findings were based in part by staff 
aides visits to military bases around the country and on 
interviews with pentagon officials 
the committee staff found among other things that there was a 
glut of supplies and that in many instances equipment was stored in 
the open and was deteriorating 
the reports release came as congress is beginning to weigh the 
bush administrations proposed 295 billion budget for fiscal 1991 
which begins next oct 1 
appearing on nbctvs today show sasser said the 
pentagon has over 100 billion in spare parts about 30 billion of 
those spare parts would be characterized as excess as not needed 
the senator said the excess supplies included among other 
things a female dress shirt that was prepared and tailored for 
the military and this is a result of a study that cost 32 
million 
they studied the number of sizes they needed and they 
concluded 40 sizes of the shirt werent enough so they went up to 
120 sizes sasser said now 3 million of these shirts are 
still gathering dust in pentagon warehouses and now theyve shifted 
over to a different shirt style entirely 
so this is an example of the kind of problems we have in 
pentagon procurement practices he said 
sasser also said the defense department has spent over 700 
million in the past six to eight years for additional warehouse 
space and now with the troops on the verge of returning from 
europe were going to have just a glut of material that were 
going to have to store or deal with some way he said so i 
predict were going to see war surplus stores bulging at the seams 
again just as they did after world war ii

a defense lawyer today asked the jury hearing 
john gottis assault trail to acquit the reputed mob boss charging 
that prosecutors suffered from a disease that compelled them to 
chase gotti 
gerald shargel said there was absolutely no proof that gotti 
49 and a reputed mob associate anthony guerrieri 61 had ordered 
the revenge shooting of john f oconnor the former vice president 
of carpenters union local 608 
shargel ridiculed the prosecutions two key pieces of evidence 
testimony of convict james mcelroy and audio tapes secretly 
recorded in 1986 at gottis queens hangout and in the visiting room 
at the rikers island jail 
when the smoke clears you will realize one thing that there 
is no proof let alone proof beyond a reasonable doubt that john 
gotti and anthony guerrieri had john oconnor shot shargel said 
he said prosecutors are afflicted with an illness a disease 
that will cause them to do anything to get john gotti gotti is 
reputed to be the boss of the gambino crime family 
mcelroy a member of a criminal gang called the westies who is 
serving a 60year prison sentence testified that he went to the 
funeral of a reputed gambino underboss frank decicco and was 
introduced as the westie who was going to whack oconnor 
james mcelroy is saying what he knows the prosecutors want to 
hear shargel said 
the tapes in question were difficult to hear and the defense 
pointed out that transcripts of the same conversations used in a 
federal court trial differed from transcripts used in this trial 
in state court 
youve seen time and again that they misinterpreted on the 
tapes shargel said they prosecutors know full well that the 
tapes dont prove the case 
a second defense lawyer bruce cutler and assistant district 
attorney michael cherkasky also were scheduled to give summations 
today the jury could get the case tuesday 
the prosecution maintains the defendants had westies gang 
members shoot oconnor in retaliation for vandalism at a restaurant 
that which is controlled by an alleged gotti associate philip 
modica 
oconnor allegedly had the restaurant trashed because 
construction there was done by nonunion workers 
the prosecutions summation was expected to focus on testimony 
by mcelroy who said he was part of the group of westies gang 
members who shot oconnor as a favor to gotti 
the defense maintains mcelroy is not credible because he 
testified that prosecutors said his cooperation in the case could 
help his girlfriend who faces drug charges 
the principal evidence against gotti was a series of secretly 
recorded tapes 
in one gotti allegedly told an associate were gonna gonna 
bust him up 
the defense maintains this section of the tape is largely 
inaudible and that the transcription by law enforcement officials 
is inaccurate 
although jurors will be allowed to hear the tapes during their 
deliberations acting justice edward mclaughlin said he was not 
sure he would allow them access to the transcripts 
the state supreme court jury has been sequestered in a hotel 
oconnor who was shot in the buttocks may 7 1986 appeared as 
a surprise witness for the defense he admitted that the union was 
plagued by intercine troubles and said it was possible that someone 
within the union could have arranged to have him shot

corrosion caused by the failure of 
controversial protective coating and tape wraps has weakened parts 
of the 800mile crude oil transalaska pipeline triggering a 
federal probe according to a published report 
alyeska pipeline service co the oil industry consortium that 
operates the pipeline has already started making repairs on the 
line the los angeles times reported sunday alyeska officials 
maintain the corrosion poses no immediate danger to its operations 
or to the environment 
the pipeline carries crude oil from alaskas north slope to 
valdez where the crude is transferred to tankers for shipment to 
refineries 
if left unchecked corrosion could eventually weaken the 
halfinchthick steel wall of the pipe which is pressurized and 
could rupture conceivably spawning an oil spill requiring a costly 
pipeline shutdown 
we have sufficient early warning in this case said bill 
howitt alyeskas manager for engineering we dont have pipeline 
integrity problems 
but jack overly western regional division chief for the federal 
office of pipeline safety said the extent of it corrosion we 
dont know but its big enough that it could affect the integrity 
of the pipeline 
alyeska may have violated federal safety regulations by failing 
to adequately maintain portions of its systems designed to retard 
corrosion according to office of pipeline safety staff reports 
the newspaper said 
the office of pipeline safety part of the department of 
transportation could decide by spring whether to cite alyeska for 
violating federal guidelines the story said 
pipeline inspection reports show that safeguards against 
corrosion often were incomplete or faulty to begin with the times 
reported 
before pipeline operations began in 1977 preparations for 
laboratory tests of corrosion were set up at the national bureau of 
standards but those tests were never conducted the newspaper 
said adding that most of the corrosion was caused by the failure 
of a protective coating and tape wraps which many critics earlier 
had warned were flawed 
alyeska has said repairs on weakened portions of the line can be 
completed without disrupting oil flow for more than 2 days over 
the next 18 months until repairs can be completed pressure in the 
line has been reduced by 20 percent in key locations 
the pipeline rehabilitation plan could cost operators 15 
billion over the next five years and under a complex formula used 
to determine royalties paid to alaska the state could lose 22 
million this year alone said alaska attorney general douglas b 
baily 
federal inspectors also blamed corrosion in storage tank bottoms 
at the valdez terminal on salty sand used as landfill beneath the 
tanks 
alyeska officials however maintain that the tanks were 
constructed on an asphalt base

universities in seoul but did not confront police and dispersed 
voluntarily after less than two hours 
presiding judge hwang sanghyun pronounced miss im and moon 
guilty of traveling to north korea last summer in violation of 
national security laws 
he said they had instructions from north korea to foment 
protests against the united states and the south korean government 
when they returned to seoul through the border village of panmunjom 
on aug 15 
these days war is a total war which involves politics 
economics and other help the judge said by providing the north

showed them denouncing the government in seoul as a lackey of the 
us imperialists 
radical students dissidents and north korea demand withdrawal 
of the 43000 us troops stationed in south korea the radicals 
are a small vocal minority among south koreas 42 million people

tactics and extreme views 
in another legal action monday a seoul appeals court accepted a 
defense argument and released dissident leader lee buyoung on a 
stay of a oneyear sentence imposed by a lower court 
lee a leader of south koreas largest dissident group the 
united national democratic movement was arrested in april 1989 on

a former hud official invoked his 
constitutional rights and refused to testify before a house panel 
today as it reopened its investigation into alleged widespread 
abuses in federal housing programs 
james hamernick former director of the office of insured 
multifamily housing became the fifth former official of the 
department of housing and urban development to refuse to testify 
before congressional investigators 
hamernick cited fifth amendment protections against 
selfincrimination in refusing to testify 
rep tom lantos chairman of the house government operations 
subcommittee on housing said he had decided to resume a hud probe 
despite attorney general dick thornburghs decision thursday to 
seek appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate former 
secretary sam pierce and other former top housing officials that 
appointment by a federal court is now automatic under the law 
pierce is among the other former officials from the reagan 
administration who have refused to testify 
as has happened in the past most notably in the watergate 
investigation and the irancontra investigation there is 
occasionally a compelling need for simultaneous parallel 
investigations by congress and by law enforcement lantos said 
explaining his decision to proceed further after holding more than 
20 hearings last year 
the subcommittee is dutybound to proceed with its 
investigation of abuses at hud he said this is particularly 
true since in recent weeks the subcommittee staff has uncovered a 
good deal of relevant new information 
he declined to say what that information was 
hamernick refused to answer when lantos asked him what hud 
programs he discussed when he was entertained by lance wilson a 
former top aid to pierce who later became a housing consultant with 
the wall street firm of paine webber wilson reported spending more 
than 2000 in that job on meals and other entertainment for 
hamernick in expense accounts filed with his employer 
hamernick invoked a house rule allowing subpoenaed witnesses to 
ban cameras and recording equipment from his appearance 
the subcommittee questioned carol crawford former associate 
director of the office of management and budget in the reagan 
administration who acknowledged that omb shared some 
responsibility for what lantos said was gross mismanagement at hud 
during those years 
i would say we have to accept a certain amount of 
responsibility she said 
lantos said he had postponed the scheduled appearance of one 
principle witness former hud assistant secretary for housing 
thomas demery who first appeared before the panel in may 1989 
demerys attorney jerris leonard said he was told over the 
weekend that lantos decided he wanted to discuss with the 
independent counsel the question of whether or not mr demery 
should appear because he is at least a witness into the 
investigation of mr pierces activities 
stuart weisberg the panels chief counsel said demery would 
have been questioned about pierce he said lantos postponed 
demerys testimony until an independent counsel is named and they 
can discuss demerys appearance 
lantos said new information caused him to change his mind since 
last fall when he told reporters it was time to turn the case over 
to the courts and end the congressional probe of alleged fraud 
mismanagement and influencepeddling at hud during the reagan years 
lantos said he was pleased with thornburghs application for a 
special counsel but i disagree with him on the scope of the 
counsels investigation 
congressional investigators are interested in pierces assertion 
at a voluntary appearance last spring that he took no direct role 
in contract awards a point disputed in subsequent testimony by 
other former hud officials 
additional witnesses including hud inspector general paul 
adams are set to appear before the panel on tuesday and lantos 
said a number of additional hearings were being scheduled 
thornburgh sought an investigation of pierce and others in the 
awarding of grants under huds section 8 moderate rehabilitation 
program which provided subsidies for developers to do moderate 
amounts of renovation to housing for lowincome people

the covenant house runaway shelter apparently 
used the birth and baptismal certificates of a child who died at 
age 10 to provide a new identity for a former male prostitute the 
childs mother said today 
betty anne warner said by phone from her home in jamestown 
ny that she and her husband knew nothing of the alleged use of 
their sons identity until they learned of it from a reporter last 
week they since have been interviewed by a new york city 
prosecutor she said 
when i first heard it i thought it was a joke ms warner 
said i thought oh golly whats happening in this cruel world 
the warners son timothy died of leukemia in 1980 at age 10 
the rev bruce ritter covenant houses founder has said he gave 
the name timothy warner to kevin kite a former male prostitute to 
protect him from enemies 
kite alleged in december that ritter gave him money housing and 
gifts in trade for sex and manhattan prosecutors have said they 
are investigating covenant house finances ritter has denied kites 
charges and kites father has described him as an emotionally 
troubled liar 
the new york post reporting on the warners in todays edition 
noted that ritter said in a december newspaper column that he gave 
kite the name of timothy warner on a new birth certificate so 
that he could get his life started again 
moreover kite has said that covenant house officials gave him 
birth and baptismal certificates in timothy warners name and told 
him warner was a child from jamestown who died of cancer at age 10 
the post reported jamestown is about 300 miles northwest of new 
york city 
it was unclear how covenant house may have obtained timothy 
warners birth and baptism records mrs warner said she has the 
originals 
stanley arkin ritters lawyer said he did not know if timothy 
warners records were used but maintained that it is legal to use 
such records so long as they are not used for illegal purposes 
while ritter has acknowledged providing kite with the name of 
timothy warner i dont know that father ritter has any knowledge 
where that name came from or anything like that arkin said 
mrs warner said she and her husband terry learned of the 
matter in a call from a new york times reporter they called an fbi 
agent and discussed it with him then were called by a manhattan 
assistant district attorney last week she said 
gerald mckelvey spokesman for the manhattan prosecutors 
office declined to comment in the case covenant houses spokesman 
did not return a call 
i am mad to think that somebody got a hold of these two 
documents and did use them mrs warner said in a telephone 
interview the poor kids dead he suffered so i wish he was 
still here and heres somebody going around using his name i 
dont think its fair

the trial of us district judge robert 
aguilar charged with using his office to do favors for convicted 
felons began today after a ruling that allows the prosecution to 
use wiretape evidence 
prosecutors are relying heavily on courtapproved wiretaps from 
late 1987 and early 1988 to provide evidence that aguilar tried to 
influence the outcomes of cases by approaching two fellow judges 
and assisting in criminal appeals 
in todays ruling just before jury selection began us 
district judge louis bechtle said wiretaps on aguilars 
codefendants in september and october 1987 were valid those taps 
were the basis for courtapproved monitoring of aguilars 
telephones beginning in january 1988 
besides the wiretap ruling bechtle denied motions by aguilars 
codefendants for separate trials 
aguilar 58 is charged with eight felonies including the first 
racketeering charge against a federal judge he faces up to 55 
years in prison if convicted 
his codefendants are rudy tham 66 a former teamster leader 
and convicted embezzler and abe chapman 83 a selfstyled former 
mobster who is related to aguilar by marriage 
aguilar a 1980 appointee of president carter is the fourth 
federal judge indicted during the last decade harry claiborne of 
nevada alcee hastings of florida and walter nixon of mississippi 
were all later impeached and removed from office by congress 
although hastings was acquitted of the criminal charge against him 
none of the charges in a june grand jury indictment against 
aguilar relate to cases in his court 
he is accused of obstructing justice by trying to use his office 
to benefit friends and acquaintances 
other allegations say he approached two other federal judges to 
seek favorable treatment for tham and ronald cloud a former 
aguilar law client who was convicted of bank fraud of trying to 
help tham get a new trial while tham arranged a job for aguilars 
brother and of tipping chapman that his phone was being tapped 
aguilar also is accused of helping his former secretary vera 
hoff remain a fugitive in mexico where she fled after being 
convicted of tax evasion the judge is additionally charged with 
lying to the fbi and advising one of thams lawyers to lie to the 
grand jury 
several of the accusations are combined in a charge that aguilar 
used his office as a racketeering enterprise in the words of 
one prosecution brief that he infiltrated the court and 
perverted its functioning to the benefit of criminal elements 
defense lawyers have suggested that aguilar had made some 
mistakes in judgment out of loyalty but have said the governments 
motives are political 
before bechtle imposed a gag order in the case aguilars 
lawyers repeatedly called the charges political an attempt to 
wipe out a frequent vocal opponent of the conservative doctrines 
of the reagan and bush administrations as attorney patrick 
hallinan put it 
since his appointment aguilar has curbed immigration raids on 
factories and restricted aerial surveillance of marijuana fields 
and prohibited the government from blocking a homosexuals entrance 
into the country 
one of 11 children of poor mexican immigrants aguilar worked 
his way through college and law school and practiced law in san 
jose for 19 years before thengov edmund brown jr appointed him 
to the superior court in 1979 after his federal appointment the 
next year one of his first acts was to swear in his father as a 
us citizen

the bush administration said today a massive 
rally in moscow demanding that the communist party surrender some 
powers was a measure of the new oppenness in the soviet system 
with secretary of state james a baker iii due in the soviet 
capital for talks beginning wednesday night the administration 
refrained from assessing prospects for change in the communist 
party which is holding its central committee meting 
but margaret d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman 
praised the demonstration sunday that drew some 100000 people to 
the kremlin walls to demand that the party surrender its monopoly 
of power over the life of the nation 
yesterday marked the largest demonstration in soviet 
history ms tutwiler said it is a measure of the new openness 
in the soviet system that soviet people felt free enough to march 
for the rights for greater political participation in the political 
process 
her statement added our dream for all people including the 
soviet people is political pluralism and free market economies 
as for the party proceedings specifically ms tutwiler said at 
this point there was only speculation which she did not discuss 
baker was due to leave tonight for czechoslovakia for a 27hour 
visit that will include a meeting with president vaclav havel and a 
foreign policy speech endorsing a 35nation summit meeting next 
year to ease tensions in europe

shevardnadze in moscow wednesday evening through saturday when 
baker also is scheduled to make an unprecedented appearance before 
the international affairs committee of the soviet parliament 
baker will meet with president mikhail s gorbachev on friday 
in testifying last week before the senate foreign relations 
committee baker endorsed the reformers in eastern europe and 
said he would offer technical cooperation and trade benefits to the 
soviets if their human rights record continued to show improvement 
but he also stressed the issue was not whether or not 
president gorbachev will or will not succeed baker said the 
issue ought to be whether or not we can take advantage of the fact 
that he is there now reforming things and lock in agreements 
that are mutually advantageous that are good from the standpoint 
of the united states

the pips and peeps of bbc radio became a shade 
more precise monday after the corporation moved its timekeeping 
operations from the countryside to its london headquarters 
not that radio listeners were likely to notice the difference 
is that inaccuracies will be only one 1000th of a second instead 
of five 1000ths the bbc said 
bbc newscasts recognizable worldwide by their hourly pip pip 
pip pip pip peep have been getting the time from the royal 
greenwich observatory since 1924 
but that service ended with mondays 1 pm 8 am est time 
signal and the bbcs own equipment installed in a basement at its 
london headquarters took over 
the bbc started broadcasting its time checks 66 years ago 
relying on data from the original observatory in the london suburb 
of greenwich 
in 1957 the observatory moved to herstmonceux south of london 
and started using atomic clocks but even these could not prevent 
occasional inaccuracies as the signal traveled from herstmonceux to 
london 
now that the pips come directly from the bbc the time should be 
accurate to within one 1000th of a second said simon shute

a dentist was acquitted monday of 
indecently assaulting seven women patients after a judge ruled that 
a sedative administered to them could have caused sexual fantasies 
neil larah 32 was accused of fondling six of the women in his 
office and sexually assaulting another after following her home 
but the judge sir derek hodgson ordered the jury to acquit him 
after hearing evidence from a leading anesthetist thomas healey of 
manchester university that the sedative valium injected as a 
relaxant could have caused the women to believe in unreal 
experiences 
the judge said he did not doubt the women were telling what they 
believed to be the truth 
the danger is not that they are lying or exaggerating but 
that they are mistaken that their recollection honestly 
believed in is of an unreal and not a real experience he said 
it is also clear there is a mounting body of evidence that 
patients under sedation from this class of drugs do sometimes 
experience sexual or erotic fantasies he said 
the lancet a respected british medical weekly reported last 
month on research suggesting some drugs administered by dentists 
could induce sexual fantasies

americas teenage girls seem to be having sex 
sooner according to early reports from a federal survey of 
childbearing and sexual practices 
a 1988 survey of young women 15 to 19 found that 54 percent had 
had intercourse at least once according to researchers with the 
national center for health statistics that compares to 47 percent 
in a similar survey in 1982 
a larger percentage of teenagers are initiating sexual 
intercourse at younger ages than in 1982 the atlantabased 
centers for disease control said in its report this week 
commenting on the nchs research 
thats a fair conclusion to draw from this said dr william 
pratt chief of the nchs family growth survey branch in 
hyattsville md were quite sure its real 
and while sexual activity was somewhat more widespread among 
young black women than their white counterparts the increase from 
1982 to 1988 apparently was fueled by increased sexual activity 
among whites 
for example among 15yearolds 18 percent of whites had had 
sex in the 1982 survey rising to 29 percent in 1988 pratt said 
among blacks the results actually fell slightly from 28 percent 
to 26 
for 16yearolds the results rose from 29 percent to 32 among 
whites while the percentage for blacks rose from 42 to 46 
for whites at 17 the percentage rose from 40 to 46 for blacks 
the jump was from 55 to 69 
for whites at 18 the increase was from 55 percent to 67 for 
blacks the percentage fell from 77 to 69 
and for 19yearolds the results rose from 69 percent to 81 
among whites while the percentage for blacks dropped slightly 
from 82 percent to 81 
those yearbyyear findings may be skewed by sampling 
variability pratt said the smaller survey samples are more 
prone to statistical quirks 
small jumps in the white population have more influence on the 
total because of the greater number of whites racial breakdowns on 
the total survey are not yet available 
still pratt said the pattern is clear 
all that change was due to the changing behavior of white 
teenagers he said black teens were statistically speaking 
unchanged 
the nchs family growth survey questioned 8450 young women 
representing a national sample interviews were conducted 
oneonone in the participants homes nchs plans further reports 
on the findings

indian border guards opened fire on 
pakistani protesters who swarmed into indian territory in the 
northern state of jammukashmir on monday officials said 
at least 10 people were believed injured in the shooting the 
governments chief spokesman said pakistani officials said one 
protester was killed and 13 others were shot in the legs 
the episode occurred near ranbirsinghpura in jammu region 310 
miles north of new delhi said the spokesman who cannot be 
identified under briefing rules 
the demonstrators who shouted antiindia slogans were protesting 
a recent indian government crackdown on moslem separatists in the 
kashmir region of jammukashmir said a pakistani police official 
in sialkot about three miles from the border 
the indian spokesman said about 4000 demonstrators gathered on 
the pakistani side and tried to cross the border despite efforts 
by the pakistani rangers some people crossed over and the indian 
security forces had to fire to control the situation he said 
without elaborating 
a foreign ministry spokesman said pakistans top diplomat in 
india rashid babar was summoned to the foreign office and was 
told of indias concern and deep regret at the unprovoked 
incident 
the pakistan government did not immediately react to the 
incident 
in jammu a senior official of the indian border security force 
which guards the area said the trouble started around noon when 
about 500 people gathered near the border and shouted provocative 
slogans 
he said the commander of the border security force outpost then 
called pakistani officers into the indian territory to discuss the 
situation following which the pakistani forces dispersed the crowd 
but the crowd regrouped and despite the pakistani guards many 
swarmed across the border he said pakistans official tv said 
there were about 30000 demonstrators 
the intrusion was an apparent fallout of a strike monday in 
major pakistani cities to support the kashmiri secession at least 
76 people have been killed in kashmir since jan 20 in clashes 
between curfewbreaking protesters and security forces 
india accuses pakistan of aiding the militants with a view to 
annexing kashmir a predominantly moslem region claimed by 
pakistan the charge is routinely denied but pakistan says it 
supports the separatism calling it a movement for 
selfdetermination 
jammukashmir is part of a larger kashmir that was divided into 
indian and pakistani territories after a war in 1948 a united 
nations monitored ceasefire line separates the smaller slice of 
pakistan kashmir from the indian state another war in 1965 over

theyre going into churches and schools 
theyre advertising in foreign languages and dialects theyve 
hired professional athletes in chicago and a former gang member in 
los angeles the census bureau is going all out to count you 
census day is april 1 the day every 10 years when the 
government takes a snapshot of the american public 
to make sure everyone is included in the picture no fewer than 
five advertising agencies and businesses across the country have 
been enlisted to spread the word serving as publicity 
ambassadors will be the 50 state titleholders from the miss 
american pageant 
participation is one of the most important activities each one 
of us can do as citizens said commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher who joined miss america debbye turner in completing 
sample census forms at a news conference monday 
mosbacher said a good turnout also saves the government some 
money 
more than 100 million census forms will be mailed march 23 with 
a request that they be completed and sent back after april 1 
people who dont return their forms will be contacted personally 
mosbacher estimated that every 1 percent increase in mail 
responses saves the government 10 million 
reaching some americans is no easy task however and special 
efforts are being made to track them down 
brenda august a census field coordinator in los angeles said a 
former gang member has been hired to work with census enumerators 
to try to ease distrust of government officials in gang territories 
census workers wont be accompanied by police but will receive 
safety training travel in groups and wear special vests to 
identify themselves she said 
widely known athletes including members of the white sox 
baseball team will be used to count people in chicago said 
regional census director stan moore enumerators are being hired 
from among residents of public housing projects 
census volunteers will go into local churches and schools to 
promote participation officials said 
the ad council a public service arm of the advertising 
industry will conduct a national publicity campaign ads will 
appear on the goodyear blimp and be mailed by jc penney and 
sears roebuck and co space will be set aside in many 7eleven 
stores for census workers to answer customers questions 
the ad campaigns theme is answer the census it counts for 
more than you think ads will stress the importance of census 
data in determining the location of new public facilities 
apportioning state legislatures and allocating federal funds to 
localities 
special advertising appeals will be aimed at blacks hispanics 
asians american indians and native alaskans the asian ads 
available in english vietnamese korean chinese and japanese 
feature an abacus with the theme any way we add it it makes 
good sense to answer the census 
a big selling point in the hispanic ads which will be published 
in mexican cuban and puerto rican dialects as well as english is 
that census answers are confidential 
census director barbara e bryant said records are kept secret 
for 72 years and information about individuals is not given to any 
government or private group

a new commission has been asked to figure out what 
would happen to florida if cubas communist regime lost power gov 
bob martinez said monday 
martinez said he has no information that change is imminent but 
he believes the state should be ready in case fidel castro in 
power since 1959 follows other communist leaders out of power 
its pretty hard to believe that he can continue to get 
support from a system that no longer exists martinez said 
referring to the reforms in the socialist bloc countries that have 
helped sustain cubas struggling economy 
the governor added that it would be bad planning for florida 
not to prepare for cuba after communism 
there are an estimated 700000 cubans in the miami area 
the 14member commission will be chaired by jorge mas canosa a 
prominent cubanamerican businessman and leader of the influential

on the eve of his 79th birthday and a year 
after leaving the white house former president ronald reagan says 
the cold war isnt over despite events in eastern europe and the 
soviet union 
in an exclusive interview friday reagan focused on such topics 
as the american hostages in lebanon soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev and his private life in his beloved california 
he declined to discuss aspects of the irancontra scandal other 
than his concern for the hostages citing pending litigation 
i think we see something on the horizon reagan said when 
asked if the cold war was over but we also have to remember this 
is the work of a man who can be dismissed by the communist party if 
they see their way clear to do it 
we have to know that permanent changes have been made before 
we can say everything is in the clear and the cold war is over 
but we have to make sure that the deeds are permanent 
nevertheless reagan said the choice of gorbachev as time 
magazines man of the decade was appropriate some 
conservatives have argued that reagan should have been chosen 
as a matter of fact i have to think anything that will help 
gorbachev succeed in the changes hes trying to make in the soviet 
union then well fine reagan said he added that he has always 
expected internal opposition to gorbachev 
i knew his opposition wouldnt come from the people it would 
come from that fixed bureaucracy he said adding as i 
describe it the russian revolution simply wiped out an inherited 
aristocracy and has replaced it with an inherited bureaucracy 
reagan who celebrates his birthday on tuesday began the 
interview by pointing to the pacific ocean and channel islands 
visible from his 34thfloor office in century city a highrise 
business district he marveled at the view 
ive always said that a californian who is forced to live away 
from california lives in a state of perpetual homesickness he 
said adding it isnt a place its a way of life 
age hasnt diminished reagans love of a selfdeprecating joke 
i prefer to think of it as the 40th anniversary of my 39th 
birthday reagan quipped 
reagan keeps in shape by pumping iron daily in his basement gym 
and trimming trees with a chain saw during his monthly visits to 
his santa barbara county ranch 
he also remains active on the mashed potato speaking 
circuit delivering speeches on issues he cares about such as a 
balanced budget amendment and lineitem veto power for the 
president in dealing with budget issues 
reagans hair has grown back still black but with a more 
pronounced touch of gray since brain surgery last year following 
a throw from a horse in mexico hes riding again on his trips to 
the ranch 
the former president proudly reported that he and wife nancy now 
own the 25 million home in the exclusive belair community that 
was first purchased by friends for the couples return to 
california 
its ours and we enjoy it very much we are very fond of it 
reagan said there was a twinkle in his blue eyes as he told of the 
first time he saw the house from the floor of a sedan while he 
was still president 
if i went any place the press would have been in attendance 
and we didnt want that publicity at the time he said it was 
mrs reagan who persuaded him to sneak up to the house 
she said if i was willing to get down on the floor of the car 
and go there the press wouldnt be following or any photographers 
or anything so i did i didnt get up until we were in the 
driveway reagan said

for seven hours before he boarded the 
exxon valdez for its disastrous trip former tanker skipper joseph 
hazelwood sat in a bar drinking vodka a prosecutor told the 
superior court jury today in his opening statement 
assistant district attorney brent cole maintained that hazelwood 
was noticeably intoxicated when he returned to his ship after a day 
ashore in valdez 
he also maintained it was the captains sole responsibility to 
ensure that the tanker arrived safely at its destination 
this catastrophe represents the largest us oil spill cole 
told the jurors who listened attentively to his outline of the case 
he would present against hazelwood it left in its wake a path of 
destruction and death it removed a part of prince william sound 
that will never be replaced 
as hazelwood sat a few feet away stroking his beard cole 
directed blame at the captain 
joseph hazelwood the captain of the exxon valdez was in 
charge and responsible for that tankers safety he said he 
was in charge and responsible for the tankers cargo 
because of circumstances surrounding his failure to perform 
his responsiblity on that evening he has been charged with four 
crimes the prosecutor said 
the swearingin of jurors today and beginning of opening 
statements came nearly a year after the tanker ran aground and 
spilled about 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil into 
prince william sound 
superior court judge karl johnstone warned jurors that the 
hazelwood case is of interest to many people and will atrract wide 
media coverage he instructed them to ignore reports on the case 
and told them its important you decide this case solely on what 
you see and hear in this courtroom and not on anything you hear 
outside 
johnstone instructed the jurors briefly in the rules of 
evidence telling them they would be the sole judges of the 
credibility of witnesses who come forward to describe the 
disastrous accident and the events that followed 
hazelwoods attorney dick madson lost a bid to bar the 
prosecution from mentioning hazelwoods bloodalcohol level in 
opening statements he contended it might not be admissible 
evidence and should not be mentioned now but the judge said it was 
likely to be the subject of testimony and give the prosecution the 
goahead 
the captains blood alcohol reading 10 hours after the accident 
was 061 which madson said was below state limits but above coast 
guard limits for operating a vessel 
the jurors 12 regular members and three alternates were 
selected last week from among more than 60 candidates who were 
screened through questions about exposure to pretrial publicity and 
other factors that could lead to bias in the trial 
hazelwood was not on the bridge of the 987foot tanker when it 
struck bligh reef part of the defense involves his contention that 
he left sound orders for crew members and cannot be held criminally 
responsible for the way they did their jobs 
the exxon valdez was under the control of third mate gregory 
cousins when it ran aground early the morning of march 24 after 
leaving designated shipping lanes 
cousins is among more than 100 potential witnesses in 
hazelwoods trial on a felony charge of criminal mischief and on 
misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment negligent discharge 
of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated 
if convicted of all charges hazelwood 43 of huntington ny 
would face up to seven years three months in prison and 61000 in 
fines 
preparations for the trial took months originally scheduled for 
valdez the port from which the tanker sailed on march 24 with its 
cargo of californiabound oil the trial was moved to anchorage in 
an effort to obtain an impartial jury

president bush cautioned an international 
gathering of scientists today against seeking solutions to global 
warming that would burden major industries 
in a speech one environmentalist called a gross 
disappointment bush said he is convening a meeting at the white 
house this spring of top environmentalists economists and 
ecologists to grapple with the issue 
he promised us support for aggressive and thoughtful 
action to solve problems caused by global warming but he sounded 
a note of caution against scientists and environmentalists who 
believe the warming of the earths atmosphere is already serious 
enough to warrant severe antipollution controls 
wherever possible we believe that market mechanism should be 
applied and that our policies must be consistent with economic 
growth and free market principles in all countries bush said in 
his address before the intergovernmental panel on climate change a 
united nationssponsored group opening a threeday meeting at 
georgetown university 
environmentalists from the united states and europe were quick 
to criticize bush for not making a clear commitment for immediate 
action aimed at dealing with global warming 
it was a gross disappointment there was more talk in the 
speech about economics than about the environment said daniel 
becker of the sierra club 
stewart boyle of the association for the conservation of energy 
in great britain said bushs remarks demonstrated a leadership 
crisis on the global warming issue at the white house about 
the only thing we can say about it is he turned up at the 
conference said boyle 
the crosssection of environmentalists are attending the 
conference as observers they said they would have liked to have 
seen bush present specific us commitments toward energy 
conservation and specific goals on reductions in carbon dioxide 
pollution which is the major contributor to global warming 
global warming is the gradual increase in the earths 
temperature due to buildup of heattrapping gases emitted into the 
atmosphere by burning oil and gas 
in his speech bush said we all know that human activities 
are changing the atmosphere in unexpected and in unprecedented 
ways 
he said some may be tempted to exploit legitimate concerns for 
political positioning 
where politics and opinion have outpaced the science we are 
accelerating our support of the technology to bridge that gap 
bush said 
white house chief of staff john sununu reportedly ordered 
changes in the text to mute us concerns about global warming 
sununu acknowledged sunday he made some changes but said they were 
simply to make the speech reflective of administration policy 
sununu also criticized faceless environmental bureaucrats he 
said want to force americans to give up their cars 
if we hope to promote environmental protection and growth 
around the world it will be important not to work in conflict but 
with our industrial sectors bush told the scientists 
youre called upon to deliver recommendations which strike a 
difficult and yet critical international bargain a convergence 
between global environmental policies and global economic policies 
a bargain where both perspectives benefit and neither is 
compromised bush told the scientists 
the speech drew restrained applause from several hundred 
delegates 
there was no step forward in his speech remarked brooks 
yeager of the national audubon society 
later at the white house presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater asserted scientists disagree on the issue of global 
warming and the people who think this is a problem that needs to 
be solved today dont understand it theyre wrong 
fitzwater was asked if bush had changed his position since the 
1988 presidential campaign 
during the campaign bush said he would convene a global 
conference on the environment in his first year in office on global 
warming and other environmental problems and that it was time to 
act on these problems 
if thats true then he has changed his view i dont know if 
he said those words during the campaign but if so hes changed 
his mind fitzwater said 
in a major speech on enviornmental policy in michigan on aug 
31 1988 bush said that those who think were powerless to do 
anything about the greenhouse effect are forgetting abvout the 
white house effect as president i intend to do something about 
it 
bush also greeted the presidentelect of uruguay luis alberto 
lacalle he also met with a delegation of 24 us jewish leaders 
who urged him to prod soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to 
speak out against rising antisemitism in the soviet union 
sununu speaking on abcs this week with david brinkley 
said sunday the speech would focus on our commitment to deal with 
the international environmental issues in such a way that we dont 
end up not being able to use our coal oil and natural gas 
resources 
theres a little tendency by some of the faceless bureaucrats 
on the environmental side to try to create a policy in this country 
that cuts off our use of coal oil and natural gas said sununu 
a nuclear engineer by training 
i dont think thats what this country wants i dont think 
america wants not to be able to use their automobiles said the 
former governor of new hampshire who has clashed with 
environmental protection agency head william k reilly on this and 
other issues 
white house officials said the president is seeking to 
underscore environmental steps he is taking including 
a proposal to spend 1 billion in fiscal year 1991 an increase 
of 57 percent for global change research 
plans to spend 175 million to plant 1 billion trees annually 
for a decade 
major revisions in the clean air act to attack smog and other 
pollution still pending in congress

two bush administration energy nominees 
breezed through senate confirmation hearings monday although one is 
under heavy attack from nevadas two senators over the choice of 
their state to host a nuclear waste dump 
the senate energy committees chairman sen j bennett 
johnston dla used the occasion to declare he will not allow 
nevada to defeat politically congress choice three years ago 
of yucca mountain as the site for an underground highlevel 
radioactive waste repository 
nevade senators harry reid and richard h bryan both democrats 
want president bush to withdraw his nomination of john w bartlett 
a chemical and nuclear engineer to head the program after the 
energy department sued the state last month over its denial of 
environmental permits to study the site 
however bartlett a former nuclear waste specialist at battelle 
pacific northwest laboratories in richland wash received nothing 
but support monday from johnston and the committees ranking 
republican sen james mcclure of idaho 
the attitude of some people in the past has been to take the 
path of least resistance to let the program drift said 
johnston i would hope nevade would recognize that it is a 
scientific challenge and one that cannot be defeated on a 
political basis 
bartlett came under attack from reid and bryan after writing a 
technical paper last year asserting that scientific research alone 
cannot provide the proof that yucca mountain will be an absolutely 
safe geological barrier around the radioactive wastes for 10000 
years 
i do not apologize for that bartlett said monday in the 
face of imperfect information its a very common situation that 
rules are developed using good information and sound judgment 
reid has accused bartlett of wanting to rush full speed ahead 
on the nuke dump regardless of the scientific consequences 
johnston however complained monday that the energy department 
is moving too slowly citing a decision in november to delay until 
1993 the drilling of a 1200foot test shaft at the site and to 
postpone from the year 2003 to 2010 that target date for completing 
and opening the dump 
were spending hundreds of millions of dollars year after year 
and theres not even a shaft just paper studies he said 
some people claim thats bureaucracy at its best i think its a 
waste at the rate were going it will be the 22nd century before 
we get it done 
the committee spent only 20 minutes questioning robert h 
gentile a former ohio coal operator to head the energy 
departments fossil fuels program 
gentile who headed the interior departments office of surface 
mining in the last year of the reagan administration and is a 
champion of a 6 billion governmentindustry program for developing 
cleancoal technologies was bushs second choice for the job 
coal state lawmakers led by senate appropriations committee 
chairman robert c byrd dwva had objected to the nomination of 
michael mcelwrath a friend of bush with a background in the oil 
and gas business for the post 
both nominations could be voted on by the committee as early as 
thursday

even in new york where a new scam comes along 
about as often as a puff of pollution from new jersey this is one 
for the books theyre scalping lox 
more precisely welltodo customers are paying as much as 20 
for tickets to get to the fish counter at zabars 
zabars is a gourmet food market on manhattans upper west side 
but that is an understatement zabars is a kind of secular 
cathedral to new yorkers who want the most wonderful whitefish the 
cream of caviars the best bagels 
on saturday and sunday mornings and on holidays 100 people or 
more line up outside when the doors open at 8 am they make 
tracks for the dispenser that spins out numbered tickets first 
come first served 
but not always 
zabars officials say they have learned that some of the early 
birds are phantom shoppers they grab several numbers and then 
go outside and sell them to other shoppers who want to jump the 
line 
some people pay 20 for a number said kenneth kuss head 
man at the fish counter but i can understand it i have 
customers who come in here regularly and what with sturgeon and 
caviar spend maybe 500 they dont care about an extra 20 bucks 
if itll save them an hours wait 
an hours wait is not unusual says murray klein one of zabars 
owners sometimes it stretches to two hours on weekends these 
are big customers sometimes they tie up a clerk for 10 minutes 
an hour is nothing 
klein says a look at the limousines parked outside attests to 
the wealth of some customers they can easily afford to pay 20 to 
the scalpers time means a lot to them i guess they go play golf 
or meet someone klein said 
occasionally police ticket cars that are doubleparked outside 
and klein tries to warn his customers some of the people 
wouldnt go out he said preferring to risk a 40 ticket rather 
than lose their places in line 
so for these people 20 is cheap klein said 
police say selling anything fraudulently in a public place at an 
inflated price is a misdemeanor punishable by fines and up to a 
year in jail but no one has been busted for the zabars scam 
yet klein says hes keeping an eye out for scalpers and will stop 
them if he can 
its not fair to the people who do stand in line he says

a former official of the reagan 
administrations department of housing and urban development 
refused to testify monday before a congressional panel that resumed 
its hearings on the hud scandals 
james hamernick former director of huds office of insured 
multifamily housing development became the fifth former housing 
official from the reagan administration including former hud 
secretary samuel pierce to refuse to testify on grounds of 
selfincrimination 
hamernick had been questioned about his dealings with another 
former hud official lance wilson an aide to pierce who quit to 
become a housing consultant for a wall street investment firm in 
that position wilson wined and dined hamernick 
hamernick appeared before the house government operations 
subcommittee on employment and housing whose investigation last 
year prompted attorney general dick thornburgh to ask a federal 
court recently to name a special prosecutor to investigate pierce 
and other top officials 
rep tom lantos dcalif the subcommittee chairman said last 
fall he was ready to end the hearings and turn the hud scandal over 
to the courts but he changed his mind and said he would continue 
the house hearings while a special prosecutor yet to be named 
conducts a parallel investigation 
lantos asserted that there are still many unanswered 
questions in the hud scandal which involves allegations of gross 
mismanagement influencepeddling political favoritism and fraud 
the subcommittee is dutybound to proceed with its 
investigation of abuses at hud he said this is particularly 
true since in recent weeks the subcommittee staff has uncovered a 
good deal of relevant new information 
he refused to say what that information was 
lantos cancelled the scheduled appearance monday of a key 
witness thomas demery a former assistant secretary for housing 
who has been cooperating with investigators 
demery was prepared to testify about his involvement with pierce 
in administering the scandalplagued section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program which provided subsidies to developers to 
fix up lowincome housing 
lantos said he would meet with a special prosecutor before 
calling demery to testify 
hamernick also invoked a house rule allowing subpoenaed 
witnesses to ban cameras and recording equipment at a hearing 
congressional investigators say that after wilson left his job 
as pierces aide he reported spending more than 2000 on meals 
and other amenities including a limousine for hamernick in 
expense accounts filed with his employer paine webber 
congressional investigators speaking on condition of anonymity 
said that wilson and not hamernick was the real object of the 
panels line of inquiry 
the subcommittee also questioned carol crawford former 
associate director of the office of management and budget in the 
reagan administration who said we have to accept a certain 
amount of responsibility for what lantos called gross 
mismanagement at hud during those years 
ms crawford underwent a sometimes contentious questioning by 
the panel when lantos and another member rep barney frank 
dmass complaining that her lengthy replies did not answer the 
questions 
you are really wasting the committees time lantos told her 
at one point 
she denied lantos suggestion that omb received lists of 
projects and the developers pushing for them which hud had 
selected for assistance under the urban development action grant 
program 
she said she did not recall seeing such lists and said she had 
met or talked with pierce not more than half a dozen times 
except for her offices concern that former hud assistant 
secretary june koch was spending too much time on a building trade 
exhibition in the soviet union ms crawford said she was unaware 
of other management problems that have since been uncovered at hud 
the committee said last fall that ms kochs involvement in the 
soviet project after she left hud and joined a private company 
appeared to violate ethics laws

president bush still considers the soviet 
challenge very much real and during his upcoming threeday 
western trip will defend his budget proposal to continue to pump 
billions of dollars into nuclearweapons programs his spokesman 
said monday 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said bushs trip 
to california nebraska and ohio which begins tuesday will focus 
on defense issues 
the president thinks its important to talk to the american 
people about the changes that were seeing in eastern europe and 
the soviet union ftizwater said 
in a series of speeches and stops at militry installations the 
president will argue for his proposal to close or change dozens of 
military installations while continuing to commit resources to 
nuclear weapons programs 
despite the reduction of eastwest tensions over the past year 
the soviet challenge remains very much real fitzwater said 
there have been reductions in troop strength there are promises 
of other reductions that we havent seen but this is not a time to 
lay down our arms 
bushs first stop tuesday will be the armys national training 
center at fort irwin in barstow calif where he will view combat 
exercises 
on wednesday he will tour the lawrence livermore national 
laboratory in livermore calif where extensive research is 
underway on the administrations strategic defense initiative 
bush will also give a broadbased discussion of defense 
policy in a speech wednesday to the commonwealth club in san 
francisco fitzwater said on thursday he will visit strategic air 
command headquarters in omaha neb 
the president will stress his continued support for strategic 
modernization despite the lessening of tensions in many areas of 
the world the united states must continue to maintain a robust and 
credible nulcear deterrent fitzwater said 
asked whether the president saw any irony in beginning his visit 
in california the state that would be hardest hit by baseclosings 
in his budget the spokesman said 
this trip represents several aspects of the changing world we 
find one is the ability to make reductions in us forces to 
close down some bases that are obsolete and arent needed 
the fact that some of those are in california simply points 
out the changing nature of the defense situation fitzwater said 
the administration has called for the closure or realignment of 
more than 72 military installations and has called for ending 
operations at 12 us installations overseas 
democrats in congress have complained that the administrations 
budget calls for continued highlevels of financing for 
sophisticated strategic systems while making deep cuts at us 
bases most of them in democratic districts 
the spending plan sent to congress jan 29 seeks total military 
spending of 3033 billion thats about 2 percent or 31 
billion less than this years pentagon budget after inflation 
however the budget calls for about a 6 percent increase after 
inflation in key weapons production activities plus a 19 percent 
jump in spending authority for development of a new generation of 
reactors to make weapons materials

school was suspended for three days an action that the girls

daughter haley also must undergo counseling for illegal 
possession of an alcoholic beverage for taking a can of billy beer

and substance abuse policy to which any child is subject if caught 
in possession of drugs or alcohol regardless of age 
suspending young people is not what we are about said 
henrico school superintendent william c bosher jr but we want 
to help young people understand that alcohol and drugs are not 
appropriate

treat a thirdgrader the way you would a teenager mrs woodfin 
said 
bosher acknowledged that the suspension of an elementary school 
pupil was unusual he said suspension is a way to get the attention 
of parents and bring parents educators and the pupil together to 
discuss a potential problem 
haley was back in school monday after serving her suspension 
mrs woodfin said she was awaiting word from police about what 
legal steps would be taken 
sgt james price said the girl would be referred to juvenile 
intake proceedings which is nothing more than a counseling 
session 
mrs woodfin said police returned the can of billy beer and it 
is back in the display case where it will remain

central american nation depends on economic assistance from 
washington

immediate moment 
noriega surrendered to us troops on jan 4 after the military 
invasion of panama on dec 20 mcgrath said the church never

help his country get back on its feet he said unemployment is 
about 32 percent and there are 14000 people homeless

december to be pulled out immediately 
the extra troops should leave as soon as possible so the new 
government can take over he said 
the fledgling new government should be allowed to make all 
decisions concerning panama and the military should let it test its 
wings he said 
we need to develop a new generation of leaders mcgrath said

american workers productivity rose just 09 
percent last year their worst showing since the 198182 recession 
while hourly labor costs sped upward the government said monday 
the labor department said that the 09 percent increase in 
nonfarm productivity defined as output per hour of work was 
less than half the 2 percent gain recorded in 1988 
while blaming part of last years poor performance on an overall 
slowdown in economic growth analysts worried that the combination 
of weak productivity growth and rising labor costs would further 
weaken americas ability to compete internationally 
thats a recipe for trouble said allen sinai chief 
economist for the boston co its very distressing its 
symptomatic of an economy that is near the end of expansion 
the report showed that while productivity was slumping hourly 
labor costs a major inflation measure for businesses escalated 
significantly jumping by 55 percent up from 47 percent in 1988 
and the biggest increase since 1982 
labor cost increases are probably the scariest part of the 
report said david wyss chief economist at drimcgraw hill 
for the octoberthroughdecember quarter nonfarm productivity 
rose a barely perceptible 02 percent the report said hourly 
labor costs rose at an annual rate of 69 percent in the fourth 
quarter 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater pinned the slight 
productivity increase on the overall slowdown of the economy the 
pace of economic expansion as measured by the gross national 
product grew by a rate of 05 percent in the final three months of 
1989 the slowest growth for any quarter since 1986 
the small productivity gains last year probably reflect the 
transition to a more moderate pace of economic growth rather than a 
general weakening in productivity fitzwater said productivity 
gains often fall off sharply when output growth slows 
output in the nonfarm sector was up 33 percent in 1989 while 
the number of hours worked rose by 24 percent giving the 09 
percent increase in productivity 
the report was certain to revive the debate over americas 
lagging productivity 
since the end of the 198182 recession productivity growth has 
averaged 18 percent a year while a slight improvement over the 
12 percent average growth rate in the 1970s it was still far 
below the 33 percent rate of increase posted in the two decades 
following world war ii when american workers enjoyed healthy wage 
gains and a rising standard of living 
increasing productivity is considered basic to boosting living 
standards because it allows businesses to pay workers more as their 
output rises without risking higher inflation 
in addition to the large hike in hourly compensation the report 
showed that unit labor costs another key determinant of future 
price inflation shot up 46 percent for the year compared with a 
27 increase in 1988 unit labor costs reflect changes in 
compensation as well as changes in productivity 
productivity gains have been anemic for several years it 
means that our standard of living isnt increasing anymore said 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm 
however robert dederick chief economist for the northern trust 
co of chicago said productivity growth has been slow in part 
because the labor market has been growing rapidly in the 1980s 
absorbing record numbers of unskilled workers 
theres sort of a kneejerk reaction that this is a negative 
and im not sure i agree with that he said adding that it would 
be worrisome only if productivity failed to rebound in the 1990s as 
the workforce matures and gains job skills 
analysts were cheered by the reports findings on manufacturing 
productivity which continued to show better gains than the rest of 
the economy 
manufacturers reported a 28 percent productivity gain in 1989 
close to the 27 percent gain of 1988 manufacturing output rose 
37 percent last year down from the 61 percent increase of 1988

the serbian president monday 
threatened to send hundreds of thousands of serbs to take over the 
province of kosovo the scene of a fierce ethnic feud 
serbian president slobodan milosevic who backs the minority 
serbs also accused two rival republics of aiding ethnic albanians 
in the strifetorn province 
the serbian republic has administrative control of the kosovo 
where 90 percent of the population is ethnic albanian 
on monday milosevic called for hundreds of thousands of 
serbian settlers to move to kosovo to aid their countrymen 
every man in serbia is ready to head for kosovo if the terror 
is continued there milosevic added 
at least 25 ethnic albanians have died since jan 24 when the 
latest wave of unrest broke out 
albanians in kosovo oppose control of their province by serbia 
which considers kosovo the cradle of serbian culture 
the ethnic and political divisions are part of a larger tapestry 
of conflict that threatens to dismember this diverse nation that 
once was held together by the dominating presence of josip broz 
tito who died in 1980 
the communist party in the relatively liberal slovenian republic 
on sunday voted to break away from the national party pushing the 
nation closer to dissolution 
yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces each with its own government and party structure serbia 
is dominated by hardline communists slovenia and croatia are 
reform oriented and have backed the ethnic albanians in their 
conflict with serbia 
albanians are demanding free elections and an end to emergency 
restrictions in place in the province for the past 12 months and 
the release of jailed ethnic albanian political activists 
serbias leadership showed little sign of compromise monday 
those who support terror in kosovo are lashing out at 
serbia and yugoslavia milosevic said in comments carried by the 
state tanjug news agency every serbian citizen feels fury in his 
heart because of the support for terror from slovenia and croatia 
but tanjug also reported that serbia had decided to end a 
twomonth economic boycott of slovenia which was imposed dec 1 
after slovenian authorities banned a planned rally of serbs 
protesting slovenian support for kosovo albanians it gave no 
explanation 
the provincial capital pristina was the scene of a brief rally 
on monday with several thousand kosovo albanians assembling to 
observe a minute of silence for the dead 
as the hour struck car horns sounded through the city and 
pedestrians stopped on sidewalks hands raised and fingers spread 
in the victory sign 
riot police stood by as the minute ended there was applause 
before participants returned to their daily routine 
thousands again gathered in pristina at 7 pm for a march by 
candlelight except for occasional shouts of long live democracy 
long live freedom the protest was eerily silent 
federal authorities brought at least a temporary halt to the 
violence friday by sending tanks into the province and ordering 
military jets to fly low over pristina and other cities 
but leaders of both kosovos 16 million ethnic albanians and of 
the slav minority of serbs and montenegrins expressed pessimism 
about the chances of peace in the long term 
bogdan kecman leader of the slav minority group bozur described 
the calm in kosovo as temporary the peace is just a cover he 
asserted inside war is raging 
albanians continued to hold wildcat strikes in the province

program 
the loan program is administered by 56 guarantee agencies that 
protect private lenders against losses from loan defaults if a 
borrower defaults and the lender is unable to collect the account 
is turned over to one of these special agencies which in turn goes 
after the delinquent funds

the bush administration voiced support monday 
for prodemocracy demonstrators in moscow and for political 
pluralism as secretary of state james a baker iii headed for 
wideranging talks in the soviet capital 
while refraining from any direct appraisal of the power shifts 
contemplated by the central committee of the communist party the 
state department said the demonstrators who called on the party to 
relinquish some of its powers were asserting a right to participate 
in the nations political process 
with baker due in moscow for talks beginning wednesday night 
administration officials shied away from making any judgments about 
the partys deliberations which began on monday with a call from 
president mikhail s gorbachev for a loosening of control 
his landmark speech followed perhaps the largest protest in 
moscow since the bolshevik revolution at least 200000 impassioned 
citizens marched to the kremlin on sunday demanding that the party 
embrace reform and end its exclusive control of the government 
margaret d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman called 
the turnout a measure of the new openness in the soviet system 
and said the soviet people felt free enough to march for the 
rights of greater political participation in the political 
process 
she added our dream for all people including the soviet 
people is political pluralism and free market economies 
similarly marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said 
we welcome political pluralism but its difficult to say exactly 
what the demonstrations yesterday meant but there again we 
arent going to offer any comment that might be disruptive in terms 
of the communist party plenum that theyre just starting today 
asked about a potential change in the soviet constitution 
ending the partys iron grip on power fitzwater said thats an 
internal matter we will not comment on it 
baker headed first for shannon airport in ireland and a meeting 
with foreign minister roland dumas of france while his plane is 
being refueled 
the meeting follows talks in the last two weeks with two other 
european foreign ministers douglas hurd of britain and 
hansdietrich genscher of west germany the idea is to compare 
notes among the allies before bakers talks with gorbachev and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze talks held in the 
shadow of burgeoning sentiment for germany reunification 
the united states insists that a united germany must remain in 
nato 
last week shevardnadze proposed that the issue be put to a 
international referendum while gorbachev cautioned that forcing 
passions and simplified approaches to the problem could be 
pernicious west germany chancellor helmut kohl immediately 
rejected the referendum idea 
before going to moscow baker is paying a 27hour visit to 
czechoslovakia where a velvet revolution smoothly transferred 
power last year from a hardline government to reformers headed by 
playwright vaclav havel 
baker will meet with havel on tuesday and make a speech 
wednesday supporting gorbachevs call for a 35nation european 
summit meeting to lessen tensions in europe 
he will hold talks with shevardnadze in moscow wednesday evening 
through saturday when baker will make an unprecedented appearance 
before the soviet parliaments international affairs committee to 
answer questions 
baker will meet with gorbachev on friday 
in testifying last week before the senate foreign relations 
committee baker endorsed the reformers in eastern europe and said 
he would offer technical cooperation and trade benefits to the 
soviets if their human rights record continued to show improvement 
the issue is not whether or not president gorbachev will or 
will not succeed baker said the issue ought to be whether or 
not we can take advantage of the fact that he is there now 
reforming things and lock in agreements that are mutually 
advantageous 
bakers initial purpose in scheduling the moscow talks was to 
prepare for the summit meeting president bush will hold with 
gorbachev in washington in june a meeting aimed at signing a new 
treaty that would sharply reduce each sides arsenals of longrange 
missiles and bombers 
regional issues are also on bakers agenda 
the united states and the soviet union have been aiding opposite 
sides in the civil war in angola both sides support the principle 
of a negotiated settlement but the bush administration has charged 
that peace prospects were set back in december by a major 
government offensive in southeast angola 
in afghanistan an 11yearold war rages on between the 
sovietbacked marxist government and usarmed guerrillas even 
though the red army concluded its occupation of the country last 
february 
the future of president najib is central to a solution 
our goal continues to be a transfer of power from the najib 
regime to a broadly representative government state department 
spokeswoman tutwiler said adding our policy has not changed we 
have consistently said we support the afghan resistance and najib 
must go

firemen fought a blaze monday that 
has burned 40 percent of the poco das antas wildlife reserve in 
southeastern brazil which shelters the last 250 golden lion 
marmosets in the world officials reported 
thousands of the small goldishmaned monkeys also called 
tamarins once lived along the 3000 miles of brazils coastline 
the number of golden lion marmosets fell to about 70 in the 
early 1970s but the catsized monkeys have made a comeback at poco 
das antas which has financial support from the smithonian 
institution world wildlife fund and canadian government 
rare sloths alligators monkeys and jaguars also live at poco 
das antas which means watering hole of the tapirs in 
portuguese 
we wont know if any of the tamarins perished as a result of 
the fire until the situation is under control but i fear the 
worst said vicente moreira conti acting superintendent of the 
rio office of brazils federal environmental protection agency 
he said more than 100 firemen and volunteers were trying to 
control the blaze at the the 12300acre reserve 80 miles northeast 
of rio but faced serious obstacles 
the reserves terrain is composed of very dry tall grass that 
is extremely combustible and the fire is located in a part of the 
reserve to which there is only difficult access conti said 
the fire is nearly impossible to put out 
firemen carried only limited supplies of water in portable tanks 
and were trying to smother the blaze with rubber mats he said 
what we really need is a few days of heavy rain but 
unfortunately thats not in the forecast conti said we expect 
to have the fire under control within the next 48 hours but there 
could be a great deal more damage 
the fire started saturday probably spontaneously he said it 
is summer in brazil and temperatures have been around 100 degrees

here are excerpts from the text of mikhail s 
gorbachevs report to the communist party central committee meeting 
monday the english translation was provided by tass the official 
soviet news agency 
comrades i think you will agree that we have gathered for a 
very important plenary meeting a meeting that communists and all 
society have been waiting for with immense interest and impatience 
the central committee has received thousands of letters with 
suggestions and wishes from party members and nonparty people 
from party organizations and committees from work collectives 
factory workers and farmers intellectuals scientists veterans 
and youth 
telegrams continue to pour in you too have seen rallies and 
meetings at which the most vital problems were discussed often from 
various positions in an acute and interested way their 
participants also wanted to make their viewpoint known to the party 
central committee 
all this combined is a phenomenon that reflects profound changes 
that have already occurred and are occurring in our society along 
the tracks of perestroika and in conditions of democratization and 
glasnost 
the main thing that now worries communists and all citizens of 
the country is the fate of perestroika the fate of the country and 
the role of the soviet communist party at the current probably 
most crucial stage of revolutionary transformation 
society wants to know the partys position and this determines 
the entire significance of our plenum 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
having assessed the entire situation and examined petitions from 
communists and party organizations the politburo submits the 
following proposal for your consideration to hold the 28th 
communist party congress late in juneearly in july this year we 
are convinced that the proposal will be approved at this plenum 
the congress should be preceded in our view with a full 
reportandelection campaign in all links of the party with a broad 
debate on the platform and the draft new rules of the soviet 
communist party overdue personnel issues will be resolved and new 
elected party bodies will be formed 
at this plenum we are to adopt the central committees draft 
platform for the congress in a month or better three weeks from 
now not later we will probably have to gather again for a 
plenary meeting to consider the draft new rules and have them 
published for public discussion

the soviet communist party initiated perestroika and generated 
its concept and policy profound revolutionary changes encompassing 
all spheres of life and all sections of the population have been 
launched on this basis in the country 
this has paved the way for renewing society and tapping 
socialisms potential the party has succeeded in expressing in 
theory and policy the countrys acute needs and realities of 
presentday world development 
rapid changes unusual in scope and originality are taking 
place within the framework of perestroika this makes ever new 
demands on state and public institutes and of course on the 
soviet communist party 
as a matter of fact we have approached the moment when the 
party should enrich its policy with due account for changes that 
have already occurred during perestroika and problems that have 
recently emerged 
any delay threatens a lag and the loss of the initiative which 
would in turn inevitably affect the party itself and the future 
of its revolutionary undertakings 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
of no less importance is the understanding of the fact which 
is the other aspect of the problem that also demands the bringing 
forward of the congress is that the party will only be able to 
fulfill the mission of political vanguard if it drastically 
restructures itself masters the art of political work in the 
presentday conditions and succeeds in cooperating with all forces 
committed to perestroika 
the crux of the partys renewal is the need to get rid of 
everything that tied it to the authoritarianbureaucratic system a 
system that left its mark not only on methods of work and 
interrelationships within the party but also on ideology ways of 
thinking and notions of socialism 
the platform says our ideal is a humane democratic socialism 
expressing the interests of the working class and all working 
people and relying on the great legacy of marx engels and lenin 
the soviet communist party is creatively developing socialist 
ideals to match presentday realities and with due account for the 
entire experience of the twentieth century 
the platform states clearly what we should abandon we should 
abandon the ideological dogmatism that became ingrained during past 
decades outdated stereotypes in domestic policy and outmoded views 
on the world revolutionary process and world development as a whole 
we should abandon everything that led to the isolation of 
socialist countries from the mainstream of world civilization we 
should abandon the understanding of progress as a permanent 
confrontation with a socially different world 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the party in a renewing society can exist and play its role as 
vanguard only as a democratically recognized force this means that 
its status should not be imposed through constitutional endorsement 
the soviet communist party it goes without saying intends to 
struggle for the status of the ruling party but it will do so 
strictly within the framework of the democratic process b giving up 
any legal and political advantages offering its program and 
defending it in discussions cooperating with other social and 
political forces always working amidst the masses living by their 
interests and their needs 
the extensive democratization currently under way in our society 
is being accompanied by mounting political pluralism various 
social and political organizations and movements emerge this 
process may lead at a certain stage to the establishment of parties 
the soviet communist party is prepared to act with due account 
for these new circumstances cooperate and conduct a dialogue with 
all organizations committed to the soviet constitution and the 
social system endorsed in this constitution 
at the same time we openly state that at this crucial period the 
soviet communist party is able to play the consolidating 
integrating role and ensure progress of perestroika for the benefit 
of the entire nation

president bush called monday for balancing 
economic and environmental concerns when dealing with global 
warming prompting environmentalists to accuse him of siding with 
industry and avoiding a pressing world problem 
bush speaking to an international conference on the threat of a 
world greenhouse effect said our policies must be consistent 
with economic growth and he suggested that in some areas of the 
debate politics and opinion have outpaced the science 
environmentalists at the conference suggested the problem was 
not scientific but a lack of us leadership in dealing with the 
issue one participant called bushs comments a gross 
disappointment 
on capitol hill sen albert gore jr dtenn a frequent 
critic of bushs stand on global warming said the president was 
moving as slow as molasses on the issue when many scientists 
already are convinced decisive action is needed 
but the president addressing the intergovernmental panel on 
climate change said nations must strike a bargain between curbing 
pollution that is causing a warming of the earth and maintaining 
economic growth 
arguing that key scientific questions have yet to be answered 
bush suggested it was too early to unleash an action plan aimed at 
specific pollution reductions as many environmentalists and some 
european countries have said is required 
later at the white house presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said bush does not believe it is time for a call to 
arms on the global warming issue but time for a call to 
research and to find out more about it 
our goal continues to be matching policy commitments to 
emerging scientific knowledge and a reconciling of environmental 
protection to the continued benefits of economic development 
said bush 
the remarks brought a subdued reaction from many of the 
participants at the international conference sponsored by the 
united nations and attended by representatives from some 60 nations 
delegates from some european countries including norway 
denmark and sweden have argued that enough scientific knowledge 
has been accumulated to warrant a commitment from industrial 
nations to at least stabilize carbon dioxide pollution at current 
levels over the next decade 
scientists are concerned that the accumulation of manmade 
pollutants largely carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil 
fuels is creating a serious global problem 
like a greenhouse the pollution traps heat and reflects it back 
to earth causing a warming of the globe while there is little 
dispute that greenhouse gases are increasing there remains 
disagreement within the scientific community as to how severe the 
warming will become and what effect it might have on the earth 
if the pollutants are left unchecked many scientists expect the 
earths temperature to rise by 4 to 9 degrees by the middle of the 
next century perhaps causing coastal flooding and droughts in 
interior regions 
on the other hand reducing greenhouse gases would require major 
shifts from the use of coal oil and natural gas which are 
mainstays for a broad range of industries industrial leaders have 
raised concerns that if pollution controls are imposed too quickly 
there could be severe economic disruption 
daniel becker of the sierra club said of bushs speech it 
was a gross disappointment there was more talk in the speech about 
economics than about the environment 
stewart boyle of the association for the conservation of energy 
in great britain said bushs remarks demonstrated a leadership 
crisis on the global warming issue at the white house about 
the only thing we can say about it is he turned up at the 
conference said boyle 
in his speech bush said he is determined to produce policies 
that work and suggested some of his critics may be tempted to 
exploit legitimate concerns for political positioning 
bushs address became a focus of controversy even before the 
conference opened when white house chief of staff john sununu was 
reported to have ordered changes in the text to mute us concerns 
about global warming sununu acknowledged making changes but said 
the final version reflected the views of the president 
during a campaign appearance in michigan on aug 31 1988 
thencandidate bush endorsed unilateral action to deal with 
greenhouse pollution declaring those who think were powerless 
to do anything about the greenhouse effect are forgetting the white 
house effect 
he continued in his campaign remarks as president i intend to 
do something about it in my first year in office i will convene a 
global conference on the environment at the white house we 
will talk about global warming and we will act 
no such conference has been held although bush on monday 
announced he is calling a meeting at the white house this spring to 
bring together top environmentalists economists and ecologists to 
grapple with the global warming issue

panamas former president expressing support 
for president bushs proposed 1 billion economic aid package said 
monday his country needs immediate economic help to rebound from 
the noriega era 
panamanians want to do the job but to be successful we need 
your economic support over the next two years to recover from the 
devastation of panamas economy nicolas ardito barletta told the 
international economic policy and trade subcommittee of the house 
foreign affairs committee 
barletta an economist who served as panamas president for 11 
months in 19841985 said panamas economy is highly depressed 
barletta now a consultant in panama was ousted as president by 
gen manuel antonio noriega overthrown in the dec 20 us 
invasion 
among the problems panama faces are unemployment of 25 percent 
loss of 600 million in business inventories to looting after the 
invasion an external debt 1 billion in arrears and a heavy 
physical damage to public facilities 
bush has proposed a economic package of 1 billion in aid for 
panama 
rep sam gejdenson dconn chairman of the trade panel 
questioned the amount of the bush package 
this country is going to have to help he said perhaps 
not the 1 billion that the president has proposed but certainly a 
good deal 
gedjenson said much of panamas economic damage stems from the 
two years of us economic sanctions and the largescale 
military operation to dislodge noriega 
barletta stressed the need to act swiftly a delay in support 
will prolong stagnation and create despair he said 
as the economy begins to recover with public works projects to 
employ people and credit programs to revive trade the private 
sector will proceed with sustainable growth he said 
on a positive note barletta said the dissolution of the 
panamania defense forces which noriega headed will save the 
country roughly 70 million annually the military will be replaced 
by a newly trained police force

defense secretary dick cheney responding to 
charges the pentagon has stockpiled 30 billion worth of unneeded 
supplies and equipment questioned the figure monday but said a 
fouled up acquisition system contributed to excess 
cheney disputed the senate budget committees findings that as 
much as 30 billion worth of material is going to waste in a 103 
billion inventory and said the pentagon is taking steps to improve 
the system 
they have a 13000year supply of a particular part for an 
f14 fighter aircraft said sen james sasser a tennessee 
democrat and chairman of the budget committee there are a number 
of other instances similar to that 
the committees findings were based in part on staff aides 
visits to military bases around the country and on interviews with 
pentagon officials 
cheney testifying before the panel on his 2921 billion 
military budget request said there is a debate over the amount of 
excess inventory but a lot of that has to do with the way the 
system works the system is fouled up 
if the system is not very efficient or if theres long lead 
time between when you order something and you actually get it what 
youre going to do is order enough so that you can rathole 
whatever extra you need cheney said 
the defense secretary said among the changes under way is having 
the army and air force adopt the navy system that reduces the 
overall demand for spare parts by 20 percent 
an individual will know what it costs him up front to order a 
part it wont be a freebie it will come out of his budget 
cheney said 
the report said among the excess supplies was a female dress 
shirt in 126 sizes the army wanted to add 100 more sizes to the 58 
sizes of the longsleeved dress shirt in then had its inventory 
but after warnings from the defense logistics agency that the total 
was unnecessary settled for adding 68 sizes 
more than 200000 of the shirts priced at 14 apiece are in 
the army inventory far in excess for the 86000 women in the 
active service 
were moving in the direction of using commercial 
specifications to reduce the total number of clothing sizes 
cheney said the clothing purchases have been out of control in a 
sense 
the committee staff found among other things that there was a 
glut of supplies and that in many instances equipment was stored in 
the open and was deteriorating the defense department has spent 
over 700 million in the last six to eight years for additional 
warehouse space the report said 
sasser said that with past pentagon efforts to improve 
management congress runs into the same procedures the same cast 
of characters and when it bubbles to the surface theres 
embarrassment 
in the final analysis were going to have to institute some 
kind of incentives he said 
cheney and the pentagon also were criticized by democrats on the 
committee for a military spending plan for fiscal 1991 that moves 
ahead several bigticket projects such as the b2 stealth bomber 
and the strategic defense initiative 
democrats believe that revolutionary changes in eastern europe 
and the lessening soviet threat to the west should be reflected in 
the us defense budget 
why are we going forward and spending these very large sums of 
money on things like the b2 the railmobile mx nuclear 
missile sasser asked cheney why dont we wait and see what 
kind of world were going to be living in 
the bush administrations proposed defense budget calls for 55 
billion for five b2 stealth bombers and an increase of nearly 1 
billion for a total of 45 billion for sdi popularly known as 
star wars 
cheney said the pentagon is studying the programs and will 
decide at a later date whether to scale them back 
the defense secretary said it was unlikely he would cancel the 
b2 program but changes are possible in plans for a 132aircraft 
fleet at a cost of 70 billion

senate tax writers spared no rhetoric monday 
in criticizing the use of surplus social security taxes to hide the 
size of the federal deficit but they and their expert witnesses 
disagreed on what to do about it 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny whose bill to cut social 
security taxes by up to 300 a year for higherincome workers set 
off the debate said it is thievery to use those taxes for other 
purposes sen donald riegle dmich termed it looting 
sen john heinz rpa called it embezzlement but said 
moynihans proposed remedy is worse a sugar coating hides a 
twin toxic menace poison that will bankrupt social security and 
burden the many to the benefit of the few 
two former government officials who are among the foremost 
authorities on the pension system offered conflicting advice as the 
senate finance committee held the first congressional hearing on 
whether social security taxes should be cut to keep surpluses out 
of government hands 
robert j myers who helped create the system in 1934 and was 
its chief actuary for 23 years endorsed the tax reduction the 
time has arrived when the financing of the old age survivors and 
disability insurance program should be rationalized stabilized and 
made crystal clear by going to a payasyougo basis as proposed 
by senator moynihan myers said 
robert m ball social security commissioner from 1962 to 1973 
said nothing justifies an immediate reduction in payroll taxes if 
congress decides to eliminate social security surpluses the money 
should be transferred into the medicare hospitalization fund which 
also is financed through payroll taxes he said 
the bush administration vigorously opposes the tax cut as a 
threat to social security benefits and an opening for increases in 
other taxes nevertheless social security commissioner gwendolyn 
s king told the hearing the administration is open to every 
reasonable alternative so long as any change does not upset the 
sound financial footing of the last seven years 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas and chairman of the finance 
committee sought to reassure future beneficiaries today the 
social security system is sound thats my no 1 priority the no 
1 priority of this committee bentsen said 
the social security tax on 132 million workers and their 
employers is bringing in 1 billion a week more than is being paid 
out in benefits this surplus is invested by law in federal 
securities and the money mixed with other federal revenues to 
finance general government programs 
moynihan and some other democrats find that galling for two 
reasons 
first they say it requires lower and middleincome workers to 
pay an unfair share of the cost of government unlike the income 
tax the social security tax rate is the same for rich and poor and 
it applies from the first dollar earned the tax ends once income 
passes 51300 
second democrats say president bush and his predecessor 
ronald reagan have been able to run on pledges not to increase 
income taxes because they knew the mounting social security surplus 
would hide the true size of the deficit in other government acounts 
this is thievery moynihan says and the only solution is to put 
social security on a payasyougo basis eliminating the surplus 
moynihans bill would repeal the tax increase that on jan 1 
boosted the rate for employees and employers to 765 percent of the 
first 51300 of wages that would drop the rate back to 751 
percent next jan 1 the rate would be cut to 655 percent where 
it would remain until 2011 
starting in 2012 when the postworld war ii generation begins 
retiring the tax rate would resume a gradual increase peaking at 
81 percent in 2045 
bush told a news conference last month that moynihans bill is 
a disguise for increased taxes around the corner treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady called the proposal goofy and the 
height of folly 
the administration has acknowledged that it is unfair to future 
retirees to use social security surpluses for other purposes 
however the presidents solution is to do nothing about it until 
the federal budget is balanced and then to use surplus social 
security taxes only for debt reduction

prime minister margaret thatcher and jesse 
jackson the black us civil rights leader argued about sanctions 
against south africa during a a 90minute meeting monday but 
smiled for photographers afterward 
mrs thatcher gave jackson a message for jailed black leader 
nelson mandela saying many hopes rest with him said a spokesman at 
her official residence 10 downing street who asked that his name 
not be used jackson is on his way to south africa 
we agreed to disagree jackson told reporters referring to 
mrs thatchers opposition to sanctions he added i feel we have 
a better feel for each other 
jackson said mrs thatcher expressed belief that president fw 
de klerk of south africa was committed to reforms he announced 
friday which include legalizing the african national congress 
guerrilla movement and the speedy release of mandela an anc leader 
when he went to jail nearly 28 years ago 
she happens to believe for the most part that the courageous 
steps taken by mr de klerk will continue jackson said i 
believe they will continue with encouragement with stimulation to 
go forward with deterrence to go backwards with economic 
incentives if and when apartheid is dismantled 
both jackson and the thatcher spokesman said the unexpectedly 
long meeting was friendly and jackson promised to telephone with a 
report on his south african visit 
the prime minister asked mr jackson to give mr mandela a 
message said the british spokesman tell mr mandela how many 
hopes ride on him for the future of his country 
jackson flew to zambia on monday night and goes to south africa 
on wednesday for his first visit in more than a decade he has been 
refused a visa since 1979 
we committed ourselves to remain in dialogue as both of us 
search in our own way for a new south africa and a new equation 
jackson said of the meeting with mrs thatcher 
at a news conference held for him earlier monday by three black 
members of the house of commons jackson said sanctions and 
apartheid should end on the same day and it ought to be soon even 
mr de klerk did not make ending sanctions a precondition for 
negotiations with black leaders 
jackson urged white south africans outnumbered by blacks 5 to 
1 not to fear losing power 
there has been no evidence of any kind of retaliatory schemes 
by blacks against whites once they become involved politically 
he said the quest must be for a nonracial state where all can 
share power and responsibility 
mrs thatcher been criticized by opposition parties and 
antiapartheid groups in britain for lifting restrictions on 
academic and cultural contacts immediately after de klerk announced 
the reforms friday 
jackson was invited to south africa by walter sisulu an african 
national council leader freed last year and the south african 
council of churches

improperly installed protective 
wrapping may have caused most of the corrosion threatening the 
transalaska oil pipeline and repairs may cost nearly 1 billion 
over the next five years officials say 
whether it will affect the integrity of the pipeline remains 
yet to be seen said jack overly western regional division chief 
for the federal office of pipeline safety we have not run into 
anything to cause concern about its integrity 
the 48inchdiameter pipeline was completed in 1977 at a cost of 
about 8 billion and carries 19 million barrels of crude oil daily 
from sprawling north slope oil fields to a terminal in valdez 800 
miles to the south 
it is operated by the alyeska pipeline service co for a 
consortium of the seven oil companies that own the line 
there are no known leaks in the transalaska oil pipeline 
overly said 
nearly all of the corrosion is located on the outside of the 
halfinch thick pipe wall and nearly all of it occurs on buried 
pipe 
overly said corrosion is common on buried pipelines ive seen 
them cause leaks but i dont know of any that youd say failed 
because of corrosion he said 
most of the serious corrosion was found in a ninemile stretch 
of pipeline buried in the atigun flood plain about 160 miles south 
of prudhoe bay marnie isaacs spokeswoman for alyeska said monday 
that is quite an active flood plain she said there is a 
lot of flowing water there is a constant supply of oxygen but 
corrosion is always to be expected in buried pipe 
the pipeline generally operates about 1100 pounds per square 
inch isaacs said but thats been reduced by about 17 percent in 
the atigun flood plain 
the repair tab on the pipeline for this year alone is expected 
to total 150 million with expenditures over the next five years 
estimated at just short of 1 billion 
partly because of the corrosion expenses alyeska has asked the 
federal energy regulatory commission and the alaska public 
utilities commission for permission to sharply increase the tariff 
it charges to move oil through the line 
increased tariffs mean less income for the state and alaska 
officials filed an objection with the federal agency about 85 
percent of the revenue received by alaskas treasury comes from oil 
isaacs said the corrosion was discovered last year by a 
mechanical pig a device that moves through the line and 
measures pipe wall thickness with ultrasound 
so far 800 anomalies in thickness have been pinpointed isaacs 
said 
the corrosion found has been given priorities based on its 
possible effects on the lines operation 
there are 116 priority one anomalies which could affect pipeline 
pressure isaacs said weve investigated all of those we 
finished last week she said 
she said wrapping designed to protect the line has failed in 
several spots but most of them are in the ninemile stretch at 
atigun more than 75 percent are in a 13mile stretch with most of 
that in the atigun flood plain she said 
she said the outer wrapping in the atigun area may have failed 
because the installation was difficultthat section of pipe was 
installed in extremely adverse conditions it was a winter 
installation in the bitter cold and wind there is some thought 
that may have compromised some of the wrap 
alyeska plans to replace the troublesome ninemile segment in 
1991 isaacs said a new pipe will be buried next to the old line 
she said and the pipeline should be shut down no more than about 
two days

american jewish leaders asked president bush 
on monday to appeal to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to 
speak out against what they said was a resurgence of antisemitism 
in the soviet union 
two dozen jewish leaders at a white house meeting also 
appealed to bush for us help to resettle the soviet jewish 
refugees now flooding into israel by the thousands 
seymour d reich chairman of the conference of presidents of 
major american jewish organizations praised bushs own 
denunciation of racism antisemitism bigotry and hate in last 
weeks state of the union address 
it would be helpful for gorbachev to share those same 
concerns with the soviet people said reich a new york lawyer 
who is also president of bnai brith the jewish fraternal 
organization 
i had a sense that he would clearly encourage president 
gorbachev to speak out to still the fears of soviet jews and 
others who are torn by ethnic strife said reich 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said later i suspect 
bush probably will communicate the jewish leaders concerns to 
gorbachev 
reich said the issue may very well be on the agenda of 
secretary of state james a baker iii who arrives in moscow later 
this week for talks with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze 
reich said jews in eastern europe have been haunted for 
centuries by fears of pogroms such as the organized persecution 
and massacres of jews that occurred in czarist russia 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost in loosening state controls 
on everyday life in the soviet union has also opened the lid on 
old ethnic rivalries in azerbaijan and elsewhere and triggered an 
upsurge of antisemitism soviet refugees say 
nearly 4600 soviet jews emigrated to israel last month and 
israeli officials are preparing for as many as 100000 refugeees 
this year 
israel will welcome them with open arms said reich but he 
added the united states may be called upon to give assistance to 
that settlement process 
on foreign aid reich said the jewish leaders acknowledged 
that the united states will be called upon to assist the blossoming 
democracies in europe but that aid to those countries should stand 
on their own 
aid to israel has to be measured against the fact that 
glasnost has not come to the middle east there are still 20 arab 
countries still in a state of war and belligerency with israel 
armed to the teeth ready to destroy israel if they had the 
opportunity said reich 
he said the israeli government has not adopted a policy of 
resettling soviet jews in the occupied territories but he said 
israeli prime minister yithzak shamir last week told him that 
that israel cannot pass a law to prevent that jews have a right 
to live anyplace in the world in any arab country clearly 
jews should be permitted to live wherever they want 
earlier monday bush called shamir and expressed condolences 
over the deaths of isreali tourists in a terrorist attack sunday in 
egypt at least nine israelis were killed 
this horrible act of terrorism should be condemned by 
civilized people everywhere presidential spokesman fitzwater 
said

along with longterm matters the draft platform puts forward 
urgent tasks connected with the modern situation in the country 
this has paramount importance we hoped to mount the peak of the 
crisis in 1989 but recent events have shown that there has been no 
change for the better 
the recently published results of economic performance of the 
past year revealed once again the contradictory nature of processes 
in the economy on one hand a number of indices posted slight 
growth despite considerable losses caused by strikes ethnic 
conflicts lax discipline and mismanagement more foodstuffs and 
consumer goods have been produced 
on the other hand we can see further disruption of the consumer 
market a growth in shortages and queues and a fall in the 
purchasing power of the ruble the situation is being worsened by 
the activity of shadow economy dealers and criminal elements

nevertheless on the scale of the country no fundamental

yes there are shortages of resources and technology yes 
social transformations must be conducted on a different scale and 
at different rates all this is true but primary importance should 
be assigned to restructuring relations of production in the

should not affect the standard of living especially that of 
lowincome strata 
we can no longer reconcile ourselves with the glaring 
manifestations of mismanagement can we expect any effect from

premier hans modrow of east germany said 
monday his proposal that a reunited germany be neutral was open to 
discussion and indicated he wants fewer soviet soldiers stationed 
in his country 
economics minister christa luft said monetary union with west 
germany must be approached with care rapid introduction of the 
west german mark would solve some immediate problems but create 
others she said 
parliament added eight representatives of prodemocracy groups 
to the government giving the opposition cabinet seats for the 
first time in east germantys 40year history it formally approved 
march 18 for the first free elections and outlawed west germanys 
ultraright republican party 
modrows remarks in the televised parliament session appeared to 
soften his stance on neutrality the reformminded communist said 
his proposal last week was meant as a basis for discussing ways to 
achieve german unity 
about 100000 people rallied in leipzig monday and speakers 
called for quick reunification the official news agency adn 
reported 
one sign said unity now west german flags waved in the 
crowd and many deomonstrators carried anticommunist signs 
leipzig has been at the heart of the prodemocracy movement and 
regular monday rallies in the southern industrial city contributed 
to the downfall of the communist old guard in october in recent 
weeks the rallies have become a focal point of support for 
reunification 
adn said a group of republicans distributed leaflets carried 
signs and used bullhorns to publicize the west german partys 
goals it said they also marched and raised their arms in the nazi 
salute 
republicans have attended recent leipzig rallies the party has 
said it wanted to run in the east germany elections 
the eight new ministers will have no portfolios in the interim 
cabinet that is governing the until the elections with 17 seats 
the communists became a minority in the 36member government for 
the first time 
government and opposition officials spoke out against west 
german politicians making campaign appearances for east german 
parties during the campaign west german party leaders said 
however that they would continue campaigning for sister parties in 
the east 
modrow said monday his proposal of a neutral united germany 
meant military neutrality which appeared to leave open the 
possibility of political ties with the western alliance 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany has rejected the concept 
of neutrality for a united germany as have the united states and 
other kmembers of the north atlantic treaty organization 
hansdietrich genscher the west german foreign minister has 
suggested the united country remain in the alliance but that nato 
military structures not extend to what is now east germany 
in parliament on monday modrow said there is opposition to 
the idea of a military i repeat military neutralization of the 
future joint germany well then we should discuss this point of 
contention so that we can come to an acceptable solution that would 
respect security needs of all those involved 
why not for example start with a reduction of reciprocal 
military presence on the territory of the present two german 
sttes 
the premier said his proposal last week that a united germany be 
neutral was not meant to be the final word on the matter 
i never believed all points of my proposals would be accepted 
by everyone he said i made my proposals to create 
conditions for the inevitable process of unification of the german 
states the german nation despite all attempts to dismantle it 
has never been lost he added 
he said several obstacles must be overcome because the two 
germanys have vastly different legal and financial structures 
mrs luft said at the weekly talks between the government and 
opposition that quick introduction of the west germany mark would 
ease some supply problems broaden the possibilities for travel and 
force companies to become more competitive 
she cautioned however that the flight of east germans would 
not stop because pay would remain below that in the westm 
unprofitable enterprises would have to close workers would be laid 
off and savings would be threatened 
east germans should decide the issue in a referendum mrs luft 
said theo weigel the west german finance minister has 
recommended introduction of the currency 
more than 50000 east germans went to west germany in january 
alone following 340000 who resettled there last year 
the east germans leaving because of the slow progress of reforms 
and the prospect of being paid in valuable west german marks 
instead of east german currency which is not convertible 
west germany also wants to stem the flow because of the strain 
placed on social services by the new arrivals 
mrs luft said west germany should provide east germany with 
immediate interestfree aid of 58 billion to 88 billion

communist party central committee in which he asked the party to 
give up its monopoly on power 
</TEXT>

political power the soviet communist party now given 
exclusive political power by the countrys constitution must prove 
its worthiness to remain the countrys ruling party it will reject 
any political or legal advantages and will struggle for peoples 
support along with other political and public organizations 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
multiparty system political changes fostered by gorbachevs 
reforms already have begun to create political pluralism that may 
lead to competing political parties being formed the communist 
party is ready to work with any organizations that accept the 
soviet constitution and are not intent on destroying its socialist 
structure 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
party reforms the party must move up from october to summer 
its next congress the meeting of its most powerful body that can 
elect a new leadeship it should make its internal workings more 
democratic and must review the key leninist concept of democratic 
centralism that requires strict adherence once a decision is made 
at the top the size of the policymaking central committee should 
be reduced

government and economy the party must no longer dictate to the 
government or to economic managers the soviet economy was expected 
to turn the corner in 1989 but failed to show improvement

thousands of lives were at risk and the danger existed of

at the same time we tried to take into account recent 
developments the precongress platform points to the possibility

people are becoming more and more aware as to where separatist 
nationalist especially extremist slogans may lead and what they 
can entail for people nationalities and the whole country 
we must display principled approaches in opposing nationalism 
chauvinism and separatism and at the same time understand that 
ethnic problems are no fantasy they are real and are waiting to be 
solved by perestroika 
the sooner decisions are taken to delimit the competence of the 
union and that of republics to actually strengthen their political 
and economic independence to broaden the rights of ethnic 
autonomies and to achieve the harmonious development of all 
languages and cultures the sooner people will see the enormous 
advantages of the new soviet federation 
separatists chauvinists and nationalists of all kinds 
understand this well and are trying to use the growth of peoples 
national selfconsciousness for their selfish aims they evidently 
want to deliver a preventive strike at perestroika which threatens 
to thwart their farreaching plans 
this has been patently manifest in the recent developments in 
azerbaijan and armenia 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i would like to draw your attention to the principled aspect of 
the problem the conflict is centred round nagornokarabakh 
serious problems accumulated in the economic and cultural 
development of this autonomous region and the central committee 
and the government took major measures to solve them 
there appeared hope that this tight knot could be undone and the 
situation could be improved but such prospects did not suit 
certain forces in both republics and in nagornokarabakh itself 
those for whom perestroika is a thorn in the side and who are 
afraid of democratization and glasnost ignore laws i am speaking 
about representatives of the shadow economy a veritable mafia 
which is fanning the flames of ethnic strife and putting pressure 
on state bodies under the slogans of national revival 
the conduct of the authorities and party bodies in both 
republics which yielded one position after another under pressure 
does them no credit 
unfortunately many representatives of the intelligentsia in 
azerbaijan and armenia failed to correctly assess the situation to 
find the real causes of the conflict and exert a positive influence 
on developments 
meanwhile corrupted antiperestroika forces managed to take the 
lead and direct misled peoples actions into the destructive 
channel 
i should say that there has been perhaps no other issue in the 
past two years that has been given so much attention in moscow 
the initial position of the center was that the nagornokarabakh 
conflict should be settled in such a way that would leave no 
winners and no losers otherwise new flareups of hostility and 
violence new victims and losses would be inevitable 
we continued to adhere to this position also at the height of 
the conflict and still we failed to check the aggravation of the 
situation 
late last year in a difficult situation the supreme bodies of 
power in both republics took decisions that aggravated the 
situation still more the republics found themselves on the brink 
of allout war 
armed groups from both sides began clashing they began to seize 
weapons and attack troops and law enforcement bodies and tightened 
the blockade of railways and roads 
baku became the scene of brutal pogroms if the state of 
emergency had not been introduced in nagornokarabakh in some 
border areas and then in baku the blood of not dozens but of 
thousands upon thousands of people would have been shed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the main lesson is that all issues connected with the 
development of nations and ethnic relations must be resolved on the 
road of perestroika the renewal of society and democratic dialogue 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
attempts to use force and methods of terror intimidate the 
people and pressure authorities directly lead to chaos with all the 
ensuing consequences 
everything must be done to rule out the possibility of such 
developments in any part of the country 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it must be clear that those who depart from principled 
positions follow in the wake of obsolete sentiments or fall under 
the influence of nationalist passions will find themselves outside 
political life 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we know how hard and painful perestroika processes are 
proceeding in these two republics this is one of the reasons why 
nationalist forces have succeeded in winning over the people 
the center has apparently failed to use all its capacities and 
authority in order to influence more effectively the course of 
perestroika in the republics and support its followers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the key fact is that nationalist antisoviet groups openly 
encroached on the constitutional system strove for power and 
sought to establish a dictatorship not a democracy by naked 
force and through militant nationalism 
this was in fact a coup attempt nothing more nothing less 
all structures above all military ones had been prepared for that 
and the flirtation of some political forces with this wing of 
the azerbaijani popular front only reveals their own goals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it is now up to the peoples of the two republics and their party 
and state leaders their actions will determine how soon normal 
life will be restored and the state of emergency lifted 
surely everything must be done to resolve as soon as possible 
the problems of nagornokarabakh urgent primary ones and those 
problems that have emerged around it given strict observance of 
constitutional principles including azerbaijans integrity 
comrades the logic of the struggle for perestroika has led to 
new major decisions the ussr supreme soviet will soon adopt 
laws on ownership on land on local selfgovernment and local 
economy on the tax system on the delineation of the competence of 
the union as a whole and of the constituent republics and other 
fundamental legislative acts 
the second stage of political reform has been launched 
encompassing the formation of governing bodies at republican and 
local levels 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
indeed society is acquiring a new quality but the processes 
that the party consciously activated which will undoubtedly bring 
forth positive results have not been insured as we already see 
against manifestations of instability weakened management and 
centrifugal tendencies 
the effect is making itself felt on society causing 
misunderstanding of these phenomena and anxiety of the people 
at present from the viewpoint of strategic tasks and in view of 
current realities it is necessary to realign forces in the upper 
echelons of power in order to give more dynamism to perestroika 
processes and ensure more firmly their irreversibility

metzenbaum dohio to require banks and sampls to cash social 
security and other government checks and to offer socalled basic 
banking accounts with low fees 
joe belew president of the bankers group said the poll 
suggests such legislation is unneccessary and indicates 
checkcashing services are not flourishing because banks have 
shunned poor customers 
if high checkcashing fees are a problem congress should 
consider regulating checkcashing outlets he said 
last month consumer advocates released surveys saying that 
checkcashing fees continue to climb that only 14 percent of banks 
quizzed in new york new jersey oregon and california offer

a federal judge monday ordered former 
president reagan to give a videotaped deposition for the 
irancontra trial of john poindexter and to turn over 33 entries 
from his diary immediately to his former national security adviser 
former president reagans testimony will be taken by way of a 
videotaped deposition at an appropriate place and a date 
before the feb 20 start of poindexters trial said us district 
judge harold greene 
reagan promptly invoked executive privilege to avoid turning 
portions of his diaries over to poindexter former president 
reagan hereby asserts his claim to the constitutionally protected 
privacy of his diaries said theodore olson one of reagans 
attorneys 
the judges order gave reagan and the bush administration until 
friday to invoke executive privilege on the matter of videotaped 
testimony 
in los angeles reagan spokesman mark weinberg refused comment 
on the order for a videotaped deposition but said the former 
president was invoking executive privilege regarding the diary 
entries to give his lawyers time to evaluate the need for them 
invoking executive privilege will enable reagan to gain access 
to a secret filing with greene in which pointdexter told why he 
needs the diaries 
after examining poindexters document reagan will be able to 
determine whether the excerpts contain admissible evidence not 
available from other sources if so the former president may 
decide to waive his claim of privilege olson said 
greene ruled that he will allow poindexter to question reagan on 
a wide range of subjects in the irancontra affair poindexter gave 
the court a list of 183 questions he wants to ask reagan and the 
judge said he would be allowed to ask all but 30 of them 
specifically greene said 
poindexter will be permitted to ask reagan whether he approved 
poindexters denials to congress that former white house national 
security staffer oliver l north was raising money and providing 
military advice to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
poindexter is charged with obstruction and conspiracy in 
connection with those denials the responses sent to congress by 
poindexter embraced false denials about norths involvement which 
had been sent to congress in 1985 by poindexters predecessor 
robert mcfarlane 
poindexter will be allowed to ask reagan about the 
presidents knowledge regarding the relationship of oliver north 
with specific individuals involved in irancontra activities 
the president told the investigative tower board on jan 26 
1987 that he did not know the national security council staff was 
engaged in helping the contras the board is aware of no evidence 
to suggest that the president was aware of lt col norths 
activities said the boards final report 
since he first told the american people about the diversion of 
funds from the iran arms sale president reagan has cooperated 
fully with all of the legislative and judicial inquiries into this 
matter including the tower commission which he appointed to 
conduct a thorough investigation reagan spokesman weinberg said 
in a statement 
greene renewed his order that reagan immediately furnish 
poindexter with diary excerpts pertaining to us arms sales to 
iran and the reagan administrations secret assistance to the 
contras 
the justice departments request to push back the deadline for 
surrendering the diary entries is nothing more than an attempt to 
delay and is out of the question greene said 
the justice department had asked greene to order irancontra 
prosecutors and poindexter to attempt to resume negotiations on a 
summary of the diary entries earlier negotiations broke down 
partly because poindexter declined to tell prosecutors what he 
expected to prove through reagans testimony 
poindexter and reagan had objected to having the former 
president give a videotaped deposition poindexter wants reagan as 
a witness in the courtroom reagan is resisting giving testimony in 
any form on the ground that compelling him to testify would have 
an adverse effect on the presidency 
in ordering president nixon to provide white house tape 
recordings to watergate prosecutors the supreme court ruled in 
1974 that the general assertion of privilege must yield to the 
demonstrated specific need for evidence in a pending criminal 
trial 
in endorsing the videotape approach greene said 
there is an absence of a direct precedent in 200 years of 
american history for the compelled testimony in a courtroom by an 
incumbent or former president 
greene said while that fact should not determine whether reagan 
should testify it does call for a sense of caution by this 
court 
videotaped testimony would protect the rights of the former 
president and the privileges of the presidency greene said 
a videotaped deposition will allow evidence to be taken with 
recesses for consultations on invoking executive privilege or the 
handling of sensitive defense information the judge said 
former president ronald reagan is claimed by adm poindexter 
to have direct and important knowledge that will help to exonerate 
him from the criminal charges lodged against him greene said in 
a 54page decision 
in view of the prior professional relationship between the two 
men that claim cannot be dismissed as fanciful or frivolous 
the judge said 
greene said it would be inconceivable to exempt mr reagan 
from the duty of every citizen to give evidence that will permit 
the reaching of a just outcome of this criminal prosecution 
the judge rejected a suggestion by reagans lawyers that the 
former president be permitted to give written answers to written 
questions from poindexter 
poindexter has said reagan took notes at meetings focusing on 
congressional inquiries into norths activities to help the contras 
the former national security adviser also has said that his 
meetings with reagan also dealt with the accuracy of a chronology 
prepared by north on a 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
north was convicted of aiding and abetting an obstruction of 
congress because the chronology falsely stated that no official of 
the us government learned before january 1986 that hawk missiles 
had been shipped to iran in the ciaassisted delivery in november 
1985

federal agents looked over three 
typewriters monday at a piano store in the hunt for a crucial piece 
of evidence in their mail bomb investigation 
store manager dean powers said fbi agents were interested in 
typewriters bought at an auction at nearby fort rucker army base 
the agents examined one electric typewriter and two manual 
typewriters but did not remove them from the store powers said 
a swarm of fbi agents has spent the last two weeks scouring 
southeast alabama for the typewriter used to write letters linked 
to the december mail bomb killings of 11th us circuit court of 
appeals judge robert vance and savannah ga lawyer robert 
robinson 
we are still searching for a typewriter said tom moore an 
fbi spokesman in birmingham 
no arrests have been made 
in atlanta about 200 judges lawyers friends and relatives of 
vance passed through tight security to attend a memorial service in 
a federal courtroom just a few feet from vances chambers 
among those who spoke at the service were us supreme court 
justice anthony m kennedy who supervises the three states of the 
11th circuit alabama florida and georgia 
if we adhere to the law civilized conduct and decent people 
people like robert vance will prevail kennedy said so in 
the midst of grief and our sympathy we reaffirm the duty and 
dignity of the law 
two mail bombs were intercepted at the jacksonville fla naacp 
office and the 11th circuit courthouse in atlanta the threat to 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
aroused fears that the bombings were racially motivated that 
concern was heightened by a letter from an obscure group claiming 
responsibility for them 
ken holder a spokesman for fort rucker said typewriters are 
sold at periodic auctions on the army base 
the fbi searches in enterprise have focused on a salvage store 
owner robert wayne oferrell and print shop operator brian joseph 
fleming who has been a member of the coffee county naacp chapter 
for three years 
holder said oferrell was a registered bidder at the fort rucker 
auctions but the spokesman said anyone who has a junk business 
probably would show up at the bidding 
oferrell has denied any knowledge of the bombings he came 
under scrutiny because he had an employment compensation case that 
he lost on appeal before a threejudge panel of the 11th circuit 
including vance and because of alleged similarities in oferrells 
typed correspondence and typewritten material sent by the apparent 
mail bomber 
i hope someone will pinch me and awaken me from this 
nightmare oferrell said monday 
oferrell said he has been to at least three sales at fort 
rucker and has purchased typewriters 
an attorney for fleming said that his clients print shop and 
home were searched friday probably because of flemings indictment 
on charges of conspiring to export weapons reportedly to northern 
ireland fleming has pleaded innocent to the charges and is free 
on 50000 bond

the energy department is in no position now to 
seek foreign funds to build the super collider and no one overseas 
is in a position to make such a commitment texas gov bill 
clements said monday 
clements whose state will be host to the 53milesaround 
machine said after meeting with energy secretary james watkins the 
energy department is not prepared to request foreign help until 
congress has completely endorsed the collider and foreign 
countries have been assured of its total costs and design 
rep tom bevill dala chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee with jurisdiction over the collider however was 
adamant last year that the department come up with a plan to share 
the cost of the collider with foreign countries 
that plan is still being drafted but has been classified said 
department spokesman jeff sherwood 
sherwood said the draft had been classified because it 
represents the governments negotiating position with potential 
contributors 
clements said foreign participants however should not be 
sought until our plans are very definitive and until the congress 
is totally on board with the whole project 
were not in a position to ask for foreign help certainly 
no one overseas is in a position to make a commitment for x 
dollars until they know what y cost is and until congress has 
completely endorsed the program and so foreign participation 
which everybody likes to talk about is premature to talk about at 
this point clements said 
only india has publicly announced it was willing to contribute 
to the collider up to 50 million 
president bush is seeking a 318 million appropriation for the 
collider in next years budget bush last year requested 250 
million and congress voted 225 million for the current fiscal year 
the collider when completed late in the decade will allow 
scientists to test theories about the fundamental nature of matter 
by smashing together beams of protons at 20 times the energy now 
possible 
the original cost estimate at 59 billion will rise by 1 
billion to 2 billion if the original design is maintained a 
course watkins has indicated he favors

an explosion blasted out the roof of a thermal 
power plant in azerbaijan and disrupted electricity in the troubled 
republic tass reported monday without explaining if the damage 
was accidental 
ethnic and nationalist violence has wracked azerbaijan for 
weeks soviet army troops sent into azerbaijan last month to 
restore calm after bloody attacks on ethnic armenians are supposed 
to be guarding key industrial points including power plants 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev spoke of the unrest there 
at a meeting in moscow monday of the communist party central 
committee he said the soldiers were sent to protect thousands of 
lives and prevent a seizure of political power 
the official soviet news agency said the blast occurred sunday 
in one of the power plants four generating units outside 
mingechaur 280 miles northwest of baku tass said the unit was 
just going into operation when the explosion ripped off the roof 
and started a fire workers and firemen contained the blaze but 
shut down the other three units it said 
a special commission has been set up to investigate the causes 
of the incident tass said it said the plant is one of the 
biggest in the southern trancaucasus 
it said two generators have been restarted and a third is 
nearing operating condition each has a capacity of 300 megawatts 
baku the capital of azerbaijan remained quiet monday tass 
said a general strike apparently continues however tass said 
more than 50 percent of the workforce in light industry is showing 
up 
a reduced curfew runs from midnight to 5 am reported 
interfax a service of radio moscow it said a stolen t34 tank was 
recovered in armenias artasat district on saturday 
interfax quoted ashot manucharian a spokesman for the armenian 
national movement as saying talks with representatives of the 
azerbaijani peoples front may resume after a situation in 
azerbaijan is clarified negotiations being held in riga latvia 
between the two broadbased political movements broke off over the 
weekend when it was reported that azerbaijani peoples front 
activists were forcing armenians from their homes in two villages 
gorbachev obviously stung by criticism of his handling of 
ethnic unrest in the caucasus mountain region said monday 
the key fact is that nationalist antisoviet groups openly 
encroached on the constitutional system strove for power and 
sought to establish a dictatorship not a democracy by naked 
force and through militant nationalism 
he said the blood of not dozens but of thousands upon 
thousands of people would have been shed if the central 
government had not declared a state of emergency 
in an address in which he told the partys policymaking body 
that communists must yield their monopoly on political power 
gorbachev spent a surprising amount of time defending his actions 
to control an ethnic hotspot 
soldiers moved into baku on jan 20 about a week after attacks 
began against ethnic armenians 
more than 100 people died after the army moved into baku the 
death toll in the latest outbreak of ethnic violence centered on 
control of the nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan has reached at 
least 214 
azerbaijani nationalists accused gorbachev of trying not to save 
lives but to break the peoples front political movement by sending 
in soldiers 
other critics said he should have reacted more decisively long 
ago to the armeniaazerbaijan dispute 
i would say there has been perhaps no other issue in the 
past two years that has been given so much attention in moscow 
gorbachev said 
he said the kremlin tried to solve nagornokarabakhs problems 
by improving living conditions but enemies of his reform program 
thwarted the effort 
gorbachev said party leaders in the area succumbed to extreme 
demands rather than resist them

a federal moneylending agency for rural 
electric cooperatives that serve about 25 million people will not 
be dismantled by the bush administration agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter said monday 
he warned however that the rural electrification 
administration which is part of his department is in for some 
changes in the way it operates 
we need to make it a moreefficient administration yeutter 
told about 12000 people at the national rural electric cooperative 
associations annual meeting 
the association represents the nations 1000 nonprofit 
consumerowned rural electric systems in 46 states it is a major 
recipient of loans from the rea which was created in 1935 
during ronald reagans administration white house officials and 
some congressional leaders proposed a phaseout of the rea 
contending it was unneeded and inefficient 
there will be no more confrontational mode that will 
never happen during the bush administration yeutter said to 
cheers from the crowd of rural leaders from around the country 
but because of current budget priorities rea will not be able 
to afford the level of direct lending weve had in the past he 
said 
the reas budget for the current fiscal year is about 14 
billion said association spokesman thomas hoy the bush 
administration proposes cutting the agencys budget in the next 
fiscal year to 200 million an 86 percent reduction hoy said 
hoy called the proposed cut devastating

washington dcbased association was scheduled to address the 
48th annual meeting tuesday to detail the potential impact of the 
reduction on rural electric programs 
officials of president bushs administration said in a recently 
announced rural development plan that they want rea to take a 
strong role in rural economic development efforts

leaders in general will be providing leadership in nonfarm 
programs such as clean air and groundwater protection and 
development of alternative fuels

the situation in the world did improve in recent years but the 
danger of war is still preserved the doctrines and concepts of the 
united states and nato which are far from being defensive remain 
in force their armies and military budgets also exist 
this is why we need welltrained and wellequipped armed forces 
certainly they need improvement and restructuring but there 
should be a more responsible approach to changing the principle of 
their staffing and their construction as a whole in the context of 
changes in the world situation 
some questions have arisen in view of the ongoing and possible 
reductions in troops and armaments specifically apprehensions are 
expressed if this does not weaken the countrys defense capability 
evidently additional explanations are necessary here to show that 
the reduction and reorganization of the armed forces is being 
carried out strictly in conformity with the principle of reasonable 
sufficiency for defense reliable defence

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
comrades i want to say for one more time that the pivotal idea 
of restructuring the party itself is in asserting the power of 
party masses in this connection we are to recomprehend among 
others the role of primary organizations in what concerns 
admission to the party and quitting it using membership dues and 
implementing the tasks related to the new role of the party as the 
political vanguard 
the role of district and city organizations should be revised 
and their rights should be considerably broadened we should change 
the system of forming party bodies at all levels 
we need a new effective election mechanism that should also be 
sealed in the rules 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the future rules should definitely say that all elective bodies 
from top to bottom must be under control of and accountable to 
communists and that the apparatus must be under control of and 
accountable to elective bodies 
we have long been concerned by the fact that innerlife of the 
party and its functioning do not give party members the possibility 
to participate regularly in the formation of its policy 
much has been said about it but still we have no mechanism to 
translate this idea into life 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we should call for the vigorous representation of the most 
active advanced workers and farmers who are wellknown in the 
party in all elective bodies of the party including the central 
committee 
glasnost in the work of the partys leadership including the 
central committee and bodies elected by it should be ensured on a 
larger scale than before then communists will know everything and 
will be able to make conscientious judgments conclusions and 
proposals 
we are increasing communists real participation in the 
formation of the policy also by giving party bodies the possibility 
to develop their own platforms on various problems of social 
development in the context of one or another region 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the draft platform includes a proposal on changing the structure 
of the upper party bodies the meaning of this proposal is not just 
to rename them and thus show our readiness for renewal 
they are intended to strengthen the factor of democratization in 
the party leadership and simultaneously to create the best 
conditions for its activity as a working collective 
one may ask why reduce the central committee let us discuss 
it we proceeded from the need to turn the central committee into a 
body working on a permanent basis 
we should also depart from the principle of electing to the 
central committee mainly people holding certain posts this 
principle was actually an expression of the partyandstate system 
of power in the country 
we think these changes will help strengthen the central 
committees ties with party organizations because these ties will 
be maintained not through the apparatus but mainly through elected 
members of the central committee 
it would be appropriate to speak here also about the central 
party apparatus it is clear that the change of the partys role 
should entail changes in the qualitative composition of the 
apparatus it should become an assistant of the central committee 
and work strictly under its control

a pregnant nurse and her husband were stabbed 
to death by masked palestinians monday on suspicion of 
collaborating with israel and doctors were unable to save their 
unborn child arab reports said 
army sources confirmed the deaths in the town of khan yunis in 
the occupied gaza strip and said police were investigating 
the slayings of jamil rizik elbayouk 45 and his wife 
intissar 40 followed the weekend slayings of two other suspected 
collaborators in the gaza strip and the discovery of an alleged 
collaborators body near the west bank town of tulkarem 
arab reports said the west bank victim rafeek shawahneh 35 
from the village of kufr thulth was stabbed and beaten to death 
he was kidnapped two days earlier and the reports said he was 
suspected of collaborating and selling land to israelis 
the deaths raised to 181 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs during the nearly 26monthold palestinian uprising 
against israeli rule in the west bank and gaza strip most have 
been slain on suspicion of collaboration but some were killed for 
alleged drug dealing or prostitution 
since the revolt began in december 1987 651 palestinians have 
been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians and 43 israelis have 
died 
collaborator killings have declined in the west bank since an 
appeal issued in middecember on behalf of plo leader yasser arafat 
to show more caution in dealing with suspected traitors but such 
killings have continued in the gaza strip where islamic 
fundamentalist groups operate alongside proplo factions 
arab reports said mrs elbayouk was seven months pregnant and 
that doctors at nasser hospital performed an emergency caesarian 
section but were unable to save her child mrs elbayouk worked as 
a nurse at the hospital 
on oct 26 a nurse was stabbed to death inside nasser hospital 
and several weeks later another nurse from the same hospital 
survived an attack in her home 
at the time arab reports said the two women accused of giving 
the names of palestinians being treated in the hospital to israeli 
authorities wounded palestinians who come for treatment to 
hospitals often given false names to avoid later arrest 
also monday clashes were reported in the tulkarem refugee camp 
between supporters of the islamic fundamentalist group hamas or 
zeal and members of proplo factions 
at least 10 people aged 9 to 35 were injured arab reports 
said they were treated and released at the nearby tulkarem 
hospital they said 
the clash involved clubs knives and stones arab reports said 
they said army troops intervened with tear gas and rubber bullets 
to break up the melee 
in another incident a palestinian stringer for cbstv was 
roughed up by israeli troops who damaged his camera and 
confiscated videotape of a demonstration he was covering in gaza 
city according to arab reports 
the correspondent taher shriteh was treated for bruises at 
shifa hospital and released they said he also works as a stringer 
for the londonbased reuters news agency 
michael rosenbaum cbs bureau chief in tel aviv confirmed the 
incident and said a complaint will be filed with israeli military 
authorities

cambodias prince norodom sihanouk said monday he 
would return to live in one of cambodias liberated zones by 
the end of the month 
as a patriotic cambodian my duty is to return to my 
muchloved country to live there in the midst of my people 
sihanouk said in a statement to the press 
he said he planned to live in one of a certain number of 
liberated zones in the interior of cambodia that are controlled 
and administered by his army 
an assistant to sihanouks secretary who identified himself 
only as kim said sihanouk would live in an area liberated from 
vietnam but that an exact place had not been chosen

rep barney frank dmass denied monday a 
report that he offered 10000 to 12000 to help a male prostitute 
get a new start in florida after they quarreled about the mans 
activities in franks rented townhouse 
its totally bizarre frank said of the report attributed to 
stephen gobie in an article in the new issue of penthouse magazine 
its the first time i ever heard of it 
the house ethics committee is investigating an allegation that 
frank an acknowledged homosexual knew gobie was operating a 
prostitution business from franks capitol hill home frank has 
denied the allegation 
franks response to the penthouse article came the same day his 
office made public campaign finance figures for 1989 indicating 
that he raised 103476 last year most of it after gobies 
allegations were made public only a handful of the contributions 
came from constituents the rest were from political action 
committees and individuals outside the district or the state 
frank 49 has acknowledged paying 80 to gobie for an initial 
sexual encounter he says that after that they became friends and 
he gave gobie a job as a personal aide housekeeper and driver 
firing him after learning gobie was using the apartment as a 
business base 
gobie is quoted as saying in the penthouse article that he and 
frank argued after the congressmans landlord learned gobie was 
operating a sexforhire business in the apartment 
i told him i needed 2000 or 3000 to move to florida 
gobie is quoted as saying i thought washington had tapped out 
for me barney offered me 10000 to 12000 but i said i dont 
need that much 
the article does not say whether gobie said he received any 
money he has remained in washington 
frank said the report was totally bizarre as is virtually 
all of the new information in the penthouse article by art harris 
and rudy maxa 
the congressman said there was partial truth to one story 
told by gobie in the article even though he gets it wrong 
gobie is quoted as saying one day at a restaurant barney 
stood up to a bunch of marines razzing a table of gays they were 
sashaying around with limp wrists and laughing so barney says my 
names congressman barney frank do you guys have a problem were 
you harassing these men because they are gay he got their 
commanding officers name and reported them 
frank said yeah i was in mr henrys on capitol hill when 
some marines were hassling some guys and i went over and identified 
myself and told them to stop but i never gave their names to the 
marine corps because it was right after the lebanon bombing and i 
figured they were upset and id give them a pass on it 
a marine corps barracks in lebanon was bombed on oct 23 1983 
and 241 servicemen were killed

richard secord is trying to circumvent his 
plea bargain by appealing his conviction irancontra prosecutors 
said monday in asking a federal judge to delay dismissal of 11 
felony charges or reinstate them against the retired air force 
major general 
in a court filing the prosecutors also said they may ask us 
district court judge aubrey robinson to throw out secords plea 
agreement with the government and seek to put him on trial on all 
12 of the charges he once faced 
secord filed a notice of appeal jan 25 one day after he was 
placed on two years probation following a guilty plea to a charge 
of making a false statement to congressional investigators 
as part of the plea agreement the office of independent counsel 
lawrence walsh agreed not to prosecute secord on eight counts of 
perjury and other counts alleging conspiracy to pay illegal 
gratuities to oliver north offering and paying north an illegal 
gratuity and obstruction of congress 
prosecutors now are asking that the court delay final 
dismissal pending completiton of secords appeal or 
alternatively reconsider dismissal of charges already 
dismissed 
the decision to appeal is a clear violation of the spirit of 
the plea agreement and irancontra prosecutors will oppose 
his attempt to reopen what should be a settled conviction 
walshs office said 
the government regards it as an act of bad faith to agree to 
plead guilty with the undisclosed intent to challenge the validity 
of the plea said the prosecutors 
the appeal is based on a contention by secords lawyers that 
walsh lacks jurisdiction to prosecute for an offense arising out of 
secords testimony to congress 
thomas green secords lawyer said after secord was sentenced 
jan 24 that if the appeals court were to uphold his position 
that would result in a reversal and vacating of the conviction 
secord who paid for a 13800 security system at oliver norths 
home pleaded guilty to lying when he told investigators in a 
deposition in 1987 that he was unaware of any irancontra proceeds 
going to north 
the enterprise was the network of offshore companies and secret 
accounts secord and business partner albert hakim set up to handle 
money in the irancontra affair raised by overcharging iran for 
arms sold that country in secret

egyptian authorities monday arrested a suspect 
in the desert bus attack in which nine israelis were killed and 
said the man was a palestinian who went to egypt two weeks ago with 
his accomplices 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir demanded that egypt track 
down all of those involved in the sunday attack and punish them 
and israelis mourned their dead with silence and screams of anguish 
egypts stateowned middle east new agency quoted an 
unidentified police official as saying monday night that one 
suspect had been arrested but gave no further details 
israeli leaders said the latest middle east peace efforts should 
not be thwarted by public outrage over sundays attack the worst 
on israelis in egypt since the two countries signed a peace treaty 
in 1979 
newspaper editorials noted however that the incident would 
almost certainly boost support for hardline views toward arabs 
israeli victims flown home by military jet from egypts capital 
gave harrowing accounts of the several minutes during which two 
gunmen on a desert road raked their bus with gunfire and hurled 
grenades inside 
everyone saw his death said professor yigal barak a 
passenger who was unhurtthere was nobody who could protect us 
nobody carried any weapons 
i felt like a jew who is facing the nazis said judith 
benjamini 63 of tel aviv describing the death of her 72yearold 
husband ishachar 
all the dead were israelis and there were 21 people wounded 
including an egyptian tour guide 
in washington the state department called the attack an 
outrageous act designed to halt efforts toward reconciliation 
and dialogue between arabs and israelis 
president bush called shamir to express his sorrow and secretary 
of state james a baker iii relayed a similar message in calls to 
the israeli and egyptian foreign ministers department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler said 
shamir told parliament our first demand from egyptian leaders 
is to find the perpetrators of the crime and bring them to speedy 
trial and punish them severely 
he said israel would go ahead with its peace initiative calling 
for palestinian elections but also would try to liquidate 
bloodthirsty terrorism 
he noted that egyptian president hosni mubarak had telephoned 
him at midnight monday to apologize for the attack 
i thanked him for his words but i want to point out that we 
view egypt as responsible for the safety and security of israeli 
citizens who visit egypt shamir said it is inconceivable that 
israelis will repeatedly be victims of attacks by murderers who 
exploit egyptian soil for their evil and murderous plots 
mubarak denounced the attack as a monstrous aggression 
directed primarily against his efforts for israelipalestinian 
talks as a step toward shamirs election plan 
an israeli extremist group telephoned a bomb threat to an office 
of the national itim news agency saying an explosive was planted 
at islams sacred dome of the rock mosque in jerusalem police 
searched the area and found no bomb 
while israelis mourned the dead some with silence and some with 
anguished screams leaders on the left and right hardened their 
stands on whether it is time to move toward peace with the 
palestinians 
trade minister ariel sharon a member of shamirs rightwing 
likud bloc but a foe of the prime ministers plan for elections to 
choose palestinian peace negotiators said egypt had no right to 
press on with efforts to start an israelipalestinian dialogue 
the positions of egypt and the plo are the same he told 
israel army radio 
but finance minister shimon peres leader of the centerleft 
labor party said on israel radio that the peace process should 
not be stopped by a few mad terrorists 
the attack gave shamir a respite from challenges to his 
leadership of likud by sharon and other hardliners sharon agreed 
to postpone for a week a showdown session on the governments peace 
plan that was scheduled for wednesday 
but israeli newspaper editorials noted that the attack could 
could help the hardliners gain ground 
this fearsome crime will no doubt also makes its mark on 
efforts to get the peace wagon moving again wrote the 
masscirculation yediot ahronot daily 
again there will be doubts about the value of a signature on a 
piece of paper in the face of deep hatreds that remained ingrained 
in the heart the editorial said 
two unknown moslem fundamentalist groups meanwhile claimed 
responsibility for the attack 
in cairo an unidentified caller said the organization for the 
defense of oppressed in egyptian prisons carried out the attack in 
retaliation for alleged torture in egyptian jails 
in the jordanian capital of amman a handwritten message to the 
french news agency agence france presse claimed the assault was 
carried out by a group called the islamic jihadholy war jerusalem 
group but it was unclear if it was connected to any of several 
groups using that name 
egyptian investigators said they found the white peugeot sedan 
used in the attack beside a road in the nile river delta and that 
they had clues to the attackers 
the egyptian news agency identified the owner of the car as 
fathia ahmed abdelaal and said she is an egyptian citizen who 
rents her car to tourist companies 
it quoted a police official as saying the attackers hired the 
car several days ago to use it in their attack no further details 
were given 
authorities immediately tightened security in cairos southern 
suburb of maadi where many israeli diplomats live police threw up 
barricades and checked cars in the suburb where egyptian gunmen 
attacked israeli diplomats in 1984 and 1985 
a state of alert was also declared in egypts sea ports and 
airports to prevent the gunmen from fleeing the country

relatives of british hostages held in lebanon 
asked author salman rushdie on monday not to publish a paperback 
edition of the satanic verses which some moslems consider 
slanderous 
we believe the time has come to balance the principle of free 
speech against that of self restraint which is also necessary in a 
civilized society the families said in a statement 
it was issued through the archbishop of canterbury the most 
rev robert runcie and signed by frances and david waite wife and 
brother of runcies envoy terry waite and by close relatives of 
the three other missing britons 
eight americans also are held in lebanon including terry a 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
who was abducted march 16 1985 and is the captive held longest 
most of the hostages are believed in the hands of shiite moslems 
loyal to iran the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini pronounced a 
death sentence on rushdie a year ago feb 14 1989 and the 
novelist has been in hiding since 
mondays statement from the british families said his book had 
caused grave offense to moslems throughout the world and 
argued that free speech had been upheld by its large sales in hard 
cover 
rushdie 42 a naturalized briton born to a moslem family in 
india has been under police guard at an undisclosed location since 
khomeini urged moslems to kill him the decree was not lifted when 
khomeini died in june 
given the predictably grave damage likely to be caused we 
believe that further publication on the grounds of upholding free 
speech would be both misconceived and irresponsible the families 
said 
viking penguin rushdies publishers reiterated monday night 
that no decision had been made about a paperback edition 
the relatives made their appeal the day after a london 
newspaper published a 7000word essay by rushdie defending his 
book and saying he regretted the offense caused 
british moslem leaders dismissed the essay but members of 
londons literary establishment credited the author with a 
brilliant defense of free speech 
family members feel rushdie has made matters worse for the 
captives 
is it worth it to publish a paperback for this notion of 
freedom of speech when freedom of individuals and indeed his own 
liberty is at stake waites cousin john waite asked in a 
television interview if he thinks along those lines im sure he 
will feel a spirit of compromise means dont publish the 
paperback 
novelist martin amis countered should we deprive ourselves of 
certain freedoms just to humor terrorists to make them feel 
better stringing up salman rushdie would make them feel better 
still it is not something we consider 
terry waite disappeared in beirut on jan 20 1987 while trying 
to win the release of american captives 
the other missing britons are television journalist john 
mccarthy and teacher brian keenan both missing since april 1986 
and retired pilot jack mann who vanished last may keenan also has 
irish nationality 
they are among 18 westerners missing in lebanon including the 
eight americans

defense lawyers at john gottis assault trial 
urged the jury monday to reject mafia hysteria and acquit the 
reputed mob boss of charges he ordered the revenge shooting of a 
union leader 
lawyers bruce cutler and gerald shargel representing gotti and 
a codefendant ridiculed the quality of the prosecutions key 
evidence poor quality audio tapes secretly recorded in 1986 at 
gottis hangout in the borough of queens and in a visiting room at 
the rikers island jail 
a prosecutor defended the states evidence during his closing 
statement saying gotti had the motivation and he ordered the 
shooting of john f oconnor former vice president of carpenters 
union local 608 
after a threehour closing argument from assistant district 
attorney michael cherkasky gotti said of his chances for 
acquittal theres no problem theres never been a problem 
the jury was expected to hear final instructions from acting 
justice edward mclaughlin and begin deliberating tuesday 
the defense lawyers disparaged the truthfulness of criminals who 
were prosecution witnesses saying they were lying to save 
themselves 
they cited vincent the fish cafaro an admitted former 
mafioso who is now a government informer and witness cafaro 
testified about the mafias structure but said he knew nothing 
about the case against gotti 
cutler gottis lawyer told the jury that although cafaro knew 
nothing about the case he was put on to spread the poison so 
youll say well somebodys a gangster so well convict him 
anyway 
we are in america cutler said thats not how its 
supposed to be people are not supposed to be convicted because of 
who they are who their friends are what their background is 
shargel said prosecutors suffer from a disease that will cause 
them to do anything to get john gotti 
gotti 49 reputed head of the gambino gang and reputed mob 
associate anthony guerrieri 61 are charged with ordering the may 
7 1986 shooting of oconnor 
cherkasky asked the jury to study the daily court transcript of 
the trial we truly believe that if you continue to look at the 
evidence the evidence is overwhelming of guilt he said 
prosecutors say gotti had the westies a gang from hells 
kitchen on manhattans west side shoot oconnor because in 
february 1986 oconnor allegedly ordered goons to trash bankers and 
brokers a mobrun restaurant in lower manhattan for using 
nonunion labor 
shargel guerrieris lawyer said there is absolutely no proof 
that gotti and his client ordered the shooting of oconnor 
oconnor who has recovered from at least four shots in the 
buttocks testified for the defense but he invoked his fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination several times when 
crossexamined by assistant district attorney michael cherkasky 
oconnor has been charged in a 127count indictment with 
extortion perjury larceny and labor racketeering his case is 
supposed to start soon 
the principal witness linking gotti to the oconnor shooting was 
james studs mcelroy 45 a former westies gang member who is 
serving a 60year federal sentence 
mcelroy testified that he went to the funeral of reputed gambino 
underboss frank decicco and was introduced as the westie who was 
going to whack oconnor 
cutler called mcelroy a psychopathic maniac who once cut a 
mans throat for 100 and lied on the stand to help his girlfriend 
get favorable treatment in a drug case and increase his own chances 
of getting out of jail 
james mcelroy is saying what he knows the prosecutors want to 
hear shargel said 
when the smoke clears you will realize one thing that there 
is no proof let alone proof beyond a reasonable doubt that john 
gotti and anthony guerrieri had john oconnor shot shargel said 
the evidence they have put before you is riddled with doubt 
and infested with uncertainty 
on the subject of the tape recordings the defense pointed out 
that transcripts of the same conversations used in a federal court 
trial differed from transcripts in this trial in state supreme 
court a trial level court in new york state 
youve seen time and again that they misinterpreted on the 
tapes shargel said 
the defense lawyers say a key sentence on tape in which gotti 
allegedly says were gonna gonna bust him up is inaudible 
they prosecutors know full well that the tapes dont prove 
the case if they did john gotti and anthony guerrieri would have 
been arrested in 1986 not in 1989 shargel said

the labor department proposed monday that 
permissible workplace exposure to cadmium a potential 
cancercausing substance used in batteries paint and plastics be 
reduced by at least 95 percent 
the new standard would affect 512000 workers in a variety of 
industries according to the occupational safety and health 
administration 
cadmium is a soft metal found in lead copper and zinc sulfide 
ores and is used among other things as an anticorrosive and in 
batteries plastics ceramic and paint manufacturers also use it 
as do metal machining and welding firms 
permissible exposure limits currently are 100 micrograms per 
cubic meter of air for cadmium fumes 200 micrograms for cadmium 
dust averaged over an eighthour shift 
osha proposed to reduce those limits to 5 micrograms or 1 
microgram for all cadmium compounds and asked for comment on which 
limit should be chosen the agency said the lower limit could 
prevent 14 cancer deaths and as many as 189 cases of kidney damage 
each year 
a shortterm exposure limit was proposed to guard against heavy 
exposure to cadmium for short periods that would not violate the 
eighthour standard the shortterm standard would limit 15minute 
exposures to five times the concentration specified in the 
eighthour standard 
the agency estimated a 95 percent reduction would cost 
businesses nearly 57 million a year while the 99 percent reduction 
would cost about 160 million most of the difference includes 
additional costs for engineering controls respirators and hygiene 
facilities necessary to achieve the lower limit 
about half of the affected workers are already below the lower 
limit said assistant secretary gerard scannell who heads osha 
the agency will hold hearings on the proposal in washington in 
june and denver in july a decision is expected by around the end 
of the year

mikhail s gorbachev told the communist party on 
monday it must give up its unchallenged right to rule the soviet 
union to the tide of democratic reform he let loose five years ago 
in a historic speech to the partys central committee in the 
kremlin he tacitly acknowledged the growing power of the 
prodemocracy movement that has toppled communist regimes in 
eastern europe set several soviet republics on the road to 
multiparty politics and on sunday drew huge protests in moscow 
but his move was unlikely to bring about the disintegration of 
the communist party and gorbachev who is both party chief and 
head of government did not address the possibility of the party 
losing power 
the communist partys leading role in society a tenet of soviet 
socialism that excluded any other political forces since vladimir 
i lenin founded the soviet union during world war i was 
formalized in the soviet constitution in 1977 
the party wants to remain the leading force in society but must 
prove its worthiness earning the right to govern instead of taking 
it for granted gorbachev said 
in the future the party intends to struggle for the role of 
ruling party but do it strictly in the framework of the democratic 
process rejecting any kind of legal or political advantage 
gorbachev said 
political reform that has strengthened the soviet government at 
the expense of an allcontroling party apparatus has been 
accompanied by a growth in political pluralism gorbachev said 
presenting a draft platform to the 249member central committee 
this process can lead to the creation of parties at some 
stage 
central committee sources said gorbachev told the closed meeting 
that political changes he has pushed through since taking power in 
march 1985 have in effect created a multiparty system already 
in his speech gorbachev called into question another tenet of 
leninism democratic centralism the theory that requires strict 
adherance by the partys 20 million members to decisions once they 
have been made at the top 
the partys renewal presupposes its thorough comprehensive 
democratization and rethinking the principle of democratic 
centralism with emphasis on democracy and power of the party 
masses gorbachev said 
he proposed the central committee meet again in about three 
weeks to consider new party rules it will reconvene its present 
session on tuesday 
the sources said that in contrast to usual practice there was 
no applause for politburo members when they entered the hall at the 
beginning of the day nor any applause for any of the 28 speeches 
during the session 
gorbachev interrupted the proceedings to give his opinions only 
once or twice after he spoke unlike previous central committee 
meetings they said 
the soviet leader used strong terms to defend himself his 
policies and actions 
he named as some enemies of his reform policies 
representatives of the shadow economy a veritable mafia that is 
fanning the flames of ethnic strife and putting pressure on state 
bodies under the slogans of national revival 
he said soldiers had to be sent to the azerbaijan republic 
because a coup attempt nothing more nothing less was being 
attempted 
gorbachev said power changes were needed to get things done 
at present from the viewpoint of strategic tasks and in view 
of current realities it is necessary to realign forces in the 
upper echelons of power in order to give more dynamism to 
perestroika processes and ensure more firmly their 
irreversibility he declared 
he also cautioned that while the world situation has improved 
the danger of war remains the doctrines and concepts of the 
united states and nato which are far from being defensive remain 
in force 
gorbachev indicated that he did not foresee the reform 
overturning the countrys socialist system as well as the 
communists assurance of power 
the party was ready to act with due account for these new 
circumstances cooperate and conduct a dialogue with all 
organizations honoring the soviet constitution and the social 
system it endorses he said

the twoday central committee meeting had shaped up as a major 
struggle between reformers and conservatives over the partys 
future rumors emerged that conservatives would accuse gorbachev of 
bringing on economic collapse and ethnic unrest with his reforms 
the soviet president said he had hoped 1989 would be the turning 
point for his economic reforms but acknowledged that recent 
events have shown there has been no change for the better 
gorbachevs address monday granted the basic demands of the 
hundreds of thousands of people who swept 60 abreast through the 
streets of the capital on sunday communist reformers and 
noncommunists demanded the party give up its exclusive claim to 
power 
reformer boris n yeltsin a leader of the rally told the 
central committee the new platform did not go far enough in 
general the impression is formed that it was written by two hands 
both the left and the right he said 
small political parties already are forming in the baltic 
republics where communist leaders are leading the drive to 
eliminate the partys guaranteed role 
gorbachev said in lithuania last month it would be no 
tragedy if a multiparty system evolved but that such a system 
was not a panacea 
transcripts released by the tass news agency indicated gorbachev 
underwent immediate stinging criticism at the central committee 
meeting for a lack of decisiveness 
is it not time for you mikhail sergeyevich and the 
leadership of the country as a whole to seriously think about the 
fate of the socialist government over the fate of honest laboring 
people and take the most direct radical measures before its too 
late asked the first speaker kiev party chief ai kornienko 
the ambassador to poland vladimir i borovikov also gave a 
strong speech urging faster reforms said several central committee 
sources 
one central committee source said leningrad party chief boris 
gidaspov who has become a lightning rod for conservatives 
demanded the establishment of strict law and order in the country 
despite the criticism gorbachev was in firm control of the 
meeting and there was no organized effort to oust him or limit his 
power the source said 
the source said many of the 27 speakers who followed gorbachev 
criticized his proposed platform for being too general and that a 
commission of about 60 members was formed to rework it overnight 
gorbachev was appointed head of the commission he said 
there was little criticism in the meeting of gorbachevs 
proposal to strike the partys constitutional claim to exclusive 
power central committee members said they predicted it would be 
approved handily 
more than 1000 people including 240 central committee members 
100 nonvoting members military district commanders and local 
party and government officials attended the meeting the source 
said but only full central committee members will be allowed to 
vote on the platform tuesday he said 
gorbachev also said the communist partys views on managing the 
economy and the government no longer should be pressed on soviet 
society as a whole 
the soviet leader called on the central committee to move up to 
late june the next party congress theoretically the partys most 
powerful body which would be charged with electing a new central 
committee and leadership 
congresses normally are held every five years and the next 
would have been regularly scheduled for spring 1991 but gorbachev 
last year moved up the date of the congress to this fall and in 
his speech monday called for it to be moved up again 
central committee members interviewed outside the kremlin at the 
end of the days session also said gorbachev proposed structural 
changes in the party and the government 
svyatoslav fyodorov a wellknown eye surgeon and participant in 
the meeting said the platform included creation of a stronger 
presidency with powers like that of the french or us president 
vladimir gusev chairman of the gornoaltai regional party said 
the soviet leader proposed creating posts of two deputy chairmen of 
the communist party gorbachev also proposed reducing the size of 
the central committee tass said

angolan president jose eduardo dos 
santos has extended for another year an amnesty for rebels trying 
to topple the government the angolan embassy in lisbon said monday 
the announcement came as government troops and rebels battled 
for control of the strategic mavinga airstrip in southeastern 
angola which is on the way to the rebels jamba stronghold 
according to an embassy statement dos santos said sunday that 
the amnesty which covers common crimes and crimes against state 
security would be extended for a year from sunday 
government sources in the angolan capital luanda said about 
40000 rebels have turned themselves in so far 
the amnesty went into effect in december 1988 as an incentive 
for the rebels to end the 15yearold civil war 
but rebel leader jonas savimbis national union for the total 
independence of angola unita wants the marxist oneparty state 
to hold free elections as a precondition for peace 
the portuguese news agency lusa quoted an unidentified military 
source in luanda as saying the rebels had launched a counterattack 
on mavinga 
government forces were hampered by low supplies and could not 
consolidate their positions lusa quoted the source as saying 
a military source had said friday that two government columns 
had taken control of the airstrip and most of the town 700 miles 
southeast of luanda 
the rebels denied the claims and savimbi called for an allout 
attack nationwide 
according to lusa the rebels sabotaged luandas electricity 
supply lines monday depriving the capital of power for most the 
day 
earlier the angolan state news agency angop reported that two 
members of the governments ruling party the popular movement for 
the liberation of angola mpla congratulated troops on mavingas 
capture but had differing views on how the civil war should end 
defense minister pedro maria tonha sunday urged youngsters and 
soldiers in the southeastern garrison town of cuito cuanavale to 
fight until they defeat the rebels the news agency said 
it said former interior minister alexandre rodrigues called for 
a peaceful solution during ceremonies in the northern town of 
ndalatando commemorating the 29th anniversary of the start of 
independence wars against former colonial power portugal 
rodrigues spoke as a representative of dos santos and it was 
his first official appearance since he fell into disgrace in 
december 1988 accused of forming secret combat units without the 
presidents knowledge 
rodrigues was fired as interior minister but remained in control 
of a key commission of mpla and reportedly received support from 
hardline party members 
the rebels have fought to force the government to share power 
since angola gained independence from portugal in 1975 
savimbi and dos santos agree to a truce in june but it 
collapsed within weeks and efforts by us soviet portuguese and 
african diplomats have failed to persuade the two sides to resume 
negotiations

he was hit in the head last wednesday by a stray bullet and died 
saturday 
the photographer was one of the handful of journalists to have 
covered the civil war since it began in april 1975 he survived 
countless battles and two israeli invasions and had the reputation 
of leading a charmed life though he was wounded once before and 
was twice kidnapped by moslems 
samerejian was among more than 150000 people who have died in 
nearly 15 years of war here and the 12th journalist to be killed in 
the conflict 
he was wounded fatally while covering street battles in east 
beirut between rebel gen michel aouns troops and the lebanese 
forces militia led by samir geagea 
samerejian was taken to a hospital but no surgeon could get 
there to operate on him because of fierce housetohouse fighting 
the red cross got him to the american university hospital in the 
western moslem sector on thursday surgeons removed the bullet that 
shattered his brain but he died saturday without regaining 
consciousness 
annahar editor francois akl wrote of samerejian throughout 
his outstanding career george was noted for his fearless 
determination to be on the scene regardless of the risks involved 
he was the ideal example of the news photographer whose eye 
instantly catches what his camera should record 
mohammed baalbaki chairman of lebanons press syndicate said 
in a eulogy journalism in lebanon has become a profession of 
death and george samerejian is one of its esteemed martyrs 
a sniper shot samerejian in the left leg in west beirut on dec 
9 1975 early in the civil war but after 35 days in a hospital 
bed samerejian was back shooting pictures of the fighting 
annahar said he was kidnapped twice by different moslem 
factions but in both instances emerged less than a week later 
and when he came out his captors had become close friends 
samerejian was in south lebanon in 1978 when the israeli army 
invaded to drive out palestinian guerrillas an old lebanese woman 
hid him in her cellar for three days and helped him sneak through 
the israeli forces to safety 
i was in agony when israeli tanks rumbled over my hideout and 
i couldnt take pictures of them samerejian wrote 
he covered the second israeli invasion in 1982 including the 
28day bombardment of west beirut 
samerejian is survived by his wife and two daughters

scientists are building a 
remotecontrolled aircraft to fly through the hole in the ozone 
layer over the south pole harvard university said monday 
the craft will fly up to 85000 feet above antarctica where 
temperatures plunge to minus 135 degrees said professor james 
anderson who teaches atmospheric chemistry 
the aircraft will seek information about the ozone layer over 
the south pole 60 percent of which has been depleted anderson 
said 
some experts believe the protective ozone layer has been damaged 
by chlorofluorocarbons from air conditioners refrigerators some 
aerosol sprays and other sources 
because ozone blocks ultraviolet radiation damage to the ozone 
layer could lead to higher levels of skin cancer eye problems and 
damaged food crops anderson said 
the craft will have a 60foot wingspan and be built of graphite 
hydrocarbons and other strong lightweight materials 
andersons team at harvard is designing the aircrafts 
instrumentation john langford of aurora flight sciences in 
virginia is heading the team that will build the aircrafts body 
the unmanned crafts flight over the south pole will be battery 
powered and controlled by a computer program monitored from mcmurdo 
station in victoria land antarctica langford said 
anderson and langford said they expect the aircraft to make its

president fw de klerk in 
his speech last week announcing major political reforms lifted 
virtually all the media restrictions imposed under the 3yearold 
national state of emergency 
the only emergency media restriction still in force prohibits 
photographic or television coverage of political unrest unless 
police permission is obtained 
many of the restrictions repealed by de klerk had been ignored 
with increasing frequency by south african and foreign journalists 
these regulations either prohibited or restricted reports about 
unrest security force action general strikes or consumer 
boycotts and political statements the government deemed subversive 
in addition to scrapping these regulations de klerk on friday 
lifted bans that had prohibited the local media from quoting 
militant government opponents 
even before the emergency was declared in june 1986 south 
africas media was subject to an array of restictive laws that 
remain in effect these restrict reporting about such topics as 
mational security energy supplies and incidents in prisons 
during the emergency several foreign journalists were expelled 
and several antiapartheid newspapers were ordered to close for 
months because of alleged violations of the restrictions 
in the past year such actions have become rare and the 
government has been approving hundreds of visas for foreign 
journalists to come on temporary visits to cover the expected 
release of jailed african national congress leader nelson mandela

the state senate on monday approved a bill to 
restore the death penalty in new york state a measure democratic 
gov mario cuomo has vowed to veto for the eighth straight year 
the 4020 vote followed a 2hour debate in which the chief 
senate sponsor republican dale volker asked his colleagues in the 
gopcontrolled chamber to send a really dramatic message out to 
the streets 
but state sen howard nolan a democrat argued that the death 
penalty would have no effect on crime rampant in many sections of 
the state 
the legislation would permit the death penalty for the most 
heinous murders such as contract killings and the slaying of 
witnesses 
the action by the 61member senate began whats become an annual 
ritual at the state capitol both houses of the legislature 
annually pass the death penalty bill cuomo vetoes it and 
legislators then count noses to see if theyve got the votes for an 
override thus far they have come up short 
the measure now goes to the assembly where a vote isnt 
expected on the bill until late february or march at the earliest 
only after that would it go to the governor for his promised veto 
im confident that we have a better than even shot of 
overriding said volker 
the 1990 death penalty battle has taken on additional meaning 
because the governors job and all 211 seats in the legislature go 
before the voters in november 
as in the past republicans are expected to make cuomos 
opposition to the death penalty a major campaign issue 
the governor who has said he expects to seek reelection to a 
third term this year is considered a potential 1992 presidential 
contender 
cuomo arguing that the death penalty is debasing and not a 
deterrent has called instead for lifewithoutparole sentences for 
some murderers the state senate has refused to go along with that 
proposal 
new york states electric chair hasnt been used since aug 15 
1963 when eddie lee mays convicted of murder in a new york city 
bar shooting became its 695th victim 
since then the states death penalty law has been gutted by 
court decisions the state legislature has been unable to put one 
back on the books because of the gubernatorial vetoes 
new york is the largest state without capital punishment 
thirtyseven states including california have death penalty laws

violence by rebels and threats against 
candidates campaigning for the feb 25 elections pose serious 
obstacles to the democratic process in nicaragua according to a 
un report 
the report released monday by un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar said the un observer mission in nicaragua also 
expressed concerns over attempts by opposition groups to discredit 
the nations electoral authority and the international observers 
themselves 
the report said that during december and january there was 
constant military activity attributed to groups of the 
nicaraguan resistance which has taken a tragic toll of life and 
has undoubtedly hampered the electoral process 
rebel leaders have denied any involvement un observers say 
there also was a considerable increase in the number of reports 
of intimidation against candidates during the same period the 
report said 
in the cases reported pressures range from damage to property 
to death threats complaints usually involve members of the state 
security department the report said 
elliot richardson the un chiefs personal representative 
monitoring political developments in nicaragua discussed the 
intimidation with nicaraguan president daniel ortega during a 
january visit to the central american nation richardson said such 
incidents could undermine the credibility of the vote 
the un observers said ortega pledged to encourage members of 
his ruling party to refrain from any forms of intimidation against 
opposition candidates 
most of the intimidation appeared to come from local party 
members indicating it did not result from a nationwide effort to 
subvert the political process the un observers said 
during the past two months there have been substantial 
improvements in access to the media for opposition candidates and 
groups according to the un report bias observed in the mass 
media posed a serious concern in the initial stages of the 
campaigns 
the un observers also said violence at political 
demonstrations does not appear to be a cause for concern going into 
the final weeks of campaigning for the presidential and national 
assembly elections 
since violence erupted dec 10 at a rally sponsored by the 
national opposition union a coalition of 14 parties there have 
been more than 200 public demonstrations with no reports of serious 
injuries the report said

the president of a private economics 
institute on monday called mexicos domestic debt a time bomb 
that could do more damage than the foreign debt 
jorge alberto perez zogbi of the mexican international foreign 
debt studies institute spoke in an interview with the associated 
press the day after president carlos salinas de gortari signed a 
widely acclaimed agreement with foreign commercial banks 
theyre paying a lot of attention right now to the foreign 
debt but the domestic debt is causing more harm perez said 
the accord cuts 7 billion from the 485 billion mexico owes 
the banks and reduces interest payments by around 16 billion 
annually 
with the agreement mexico now owes all foreign lenders a total 
of 936 billion brazils foreign debt is the highest in the 
developing world at about 114 billion 
mexico also owes an additional 482 billion to mexican lenders 
perez said the salinas administration should turn its attention 
to the internal debt 
although the internal debt is smaller than the foreign debt 
payments are nearly three times as large because of high interest 
rates 
perez said mexico will pour 174 billion of the 72 billion 
federal budget into the coffers of domestic creditors compared 
with 556 billion destined for foreign lenders 
despite the signing of the foreign debt renegotiation the 
internal debt makes adequate health and welfare impossible he 
said 
perez said the domestic debt has increased 6000 percent since 
1982 and will stand at 57 billion by the end of the year since 
congress has authorized borrowing of up to 88 billion in 1990 
the internal debt will absorb 79 percent of the gross national 
product and 24 cents of every taxpayers dollar this year and the 
foreign debt will absorb 25 percent or eight cents of every tax 
dollar he said

against the rev ralph david abernathy and his memoirs publisher 
claiming she is the woman he implied slept with the rev martin 
luther king jr the night before he was slain 
the us district court lawsuit names abernathy who was an aide 
to king harper amp row which published his book and the walls 
came tumbling down and a harper amp row editor daniel bial 
the plaintiff adjuda abi naantaabuu said the defendants 
falsely and maliciously charge and caused the readers of this 
book to believe that she had engaged in adulterous behavior and 
sexual relations with dr martin luther king on the last night of 
his life 
naantaabuu who was identified as a beautician who also works in 
the civil rights movement claimed she has suffered great mental 
anguish because she has been ridiculed and her reputation has been 
injured 
in the book abernathy wrote that he awoke for a nap in a 
womans living room after a latenight dinner on april 3 1968 to 
see king and the woman emerge from a bedroom 
the book drew criticism from many of abernathys comrades in the 
civil rights movement of the 1960s 
naantaabuu did not give her version of the story in the lawsuit 
but in earlier interviews has said she was the host of the dinner 
and that she and her sister talked with king and another aide in 
the living room while abernathy slept on her bed 
everyone in memphis knew that dr king had been at my house 
the night before his assassination naantaabuu said in a 
statement released by her attorney dr abernathys book has cast 
shadows on my character even my own granddaughter asked me whether 
i had had an affair with dr king 
a call to abernathys office in atlanta was unanswered monday 
evening a spokesman at harper amp row also could not be reached for

the former prostitute who described 
assignations with evangelist jimmy swaggart to penthouse magazine 
got to keep about 54000 of the 210000 paid her by penthouse 
her attorney said monday 
shes happy i talked with her on the telephone louis h 
schultz said in an interview after announcing settlements with 
murphrees agents and the internal revenue service 
i dont think anybodys happy when theyve lost a large amount 
of money he said but im glad we were able to salvage some 
agents and the irs had claimed they were owed 428000 by 
murphree a major player in the scandal that rocked swaggarts 
religious empire in 1988 
however schultz said their figures were based on inflated 
estimates of the amount penthouse owed for the article and a 
promotional tour and in the irs 217000 claim for income from 
prostitution 
murphree told penthouse that swaggart paid her 20 a visit to 
strike prurient poses and perform sexual acts 
the irs figured she was a fulltime 12houraday working 
girl six days a week 52 weeks a year on a rather regular basis 
said stephen p high who handled that claim for schultz 
on the promotional tour someone asked about her income as a 
prostitute they put words in her mouth the irs took that 
figure added schultz he said the irs will take 28000 as taxes 
owed for 1977 through 1979 and for penalties and interest on those 
taxes 
schultz said last month that based on a report that 4 million 
copies of the july 1988 issue were sold penthouse might owe 
murphree 437000 
however he said monday that further research indicated 
penthouses lower figures and payment to murphree were correct 
the contract for 75000 up front plus 25 cents for each issue 
above 225 million sold covered only the 28 million or so issues 
sold in the united states and canada he said though another 
million may have been sold overseas 
he said murphree got 18000 of the first 75000 and will get 
about 36000 from money in dispute until monday 
most of the money has gone or will go to agents attorneys and 
the irs he said 
he said five agents and attorneys had convinced murphree to let 
them represent her in contract talks with firms willing to pay for 
her story 
she got herself into a mess of contracts he said 
with todays settlement the agencies and one who settled friday 
divide about 52000 schultz said 
he said he and his associates get about 25000 in fees and 
expenses 
schultz said murphree is just a housewife in the midwest but 
wouldnt say where she is living murphree married samuel w 
travis whom she met while doing time for prostitution in december 
1988 
in february of that year she was a prostitute working seedy 
motels in suburban new orleans she claimed that swaggart the 
baton rougebased television evangelist was a regular customer in 
1987 
swaggart tearfully confessed to an unspecified moral failure 
and was subsequently defrocked by the fundamentalist assemblies of 
god layoffs and cutbacks followed at his multimilliondollar jimmy 
swaggart ministries

doves that misbehaved over a crowd of 
president daniel ortegas supporters and a fistfight between two 
opposition organizers brought comic relief last weekend to 
nicaraguas electoral campaign 
it all happened sunday here and at another small town near the 
honduran border 
a crowd of 10000 was giving ortega a cold reception when he 
showed up at the somoto bullring for a campaign rally organized by 
his leftist sandinista party when cheerleaders failed to work up 
the people ortega took over 
i see you sunburned i see you bored i see you tired he 
chided the crowd then proceded to release onebyone six doves 
the symbol of peace the birds took off and after a short flight 
two dove straight into the crowd 
the other four flew a circular course and bombarded the 
gathering with more than a few droppings drawing squeals screams 
and laughter things went smoother for ortega after that 
ortega and running mate vice president sergio ramirez are 
seeking a second sixyear term in feb 25 elections against 
violeta barrios de chamorro and virgilio godoy of the united 
national opposition a coalition of 14 antisandinista parties 
the president told the rally how the sandinistas in their 10 
years in power had made sure the banks never foreclosed a farm 
mortgage when a landowner was too poor to pay 
the only time a farm mortgage was foreclosed was in 1979 when 
alfredo cesar was central bank president ortega said in what was 
an obvious dig at mrs chamorros campaign cesar is now a top uno 
adviser 
is there anyone here whose farm has been seized by the bank 
because of an unpaid loan ortega asked one peasant raised his 
hand and ortega asked him to come onstage 
when did this happen ortega asked the man 
about 20 or 18 years ago said the peasant provoking 
laughter 
oh ortega exclaimed smiling 
meanwhile in the town of posoltega west of here a fistfight 
broke out on the podium while a crowd of about 3000 uno supporters 
waited for mrs chamorro and running mate godoy to appear and say 
their campaign pieces 
one contender in the brawl was antonio lacayo mrs chamorros 
soninlaw and campaign manager another was jaime bonilla a 
member of unos top political council 
bonilla nearly fell off the stage before onlookers managed to 
separate them 
the cause of the fight was not made public but the sandinista 
party newspaper barricada had a field day on page 1 with the story 
and sandinistacontrolled television aired it on its sunday night 
national newshour 
mrs chamorro publisher of the opposition newspaper la prensa 
has become famous for her occasional absentmindedness 
addressing supporters on one occasion she mistook the election 
date saying said she was sure she would win the sept 25 
elections during another speech she left a crowd puzzled when she 
promised that when she is elected hunger will end because the 
corn will grow in your stomachs 
during sundays rally mrs chamorro made no faux pas

portauprince haiti ap a key political alliance monday 
threatened to pull out of haitis elections unless the military 
government allows the return of exiled leaders and moves up the 
presidential balloting from october to july 
the national alliance for democracy and progress is the only 
political group left in the campaigning for this years general 
elections and its announcement came as a surprise 
marc bazin the only officially declared presidential candidate 
and leader of the alliance also gave four other conditions to 
participate in the balloting 
it would be the first since the 1987 voting was canceled 
following a massacre at the polls in which armed thugs shot or 
hacked to death at least 34 people 
an alliance statement said the military governments recent 
crackdown and state of siege in which political activists were 
jailed beaten or forced into exile cast doubt on whether free and 
fair elections could be held 
all other parties have refused to take part as long as lt gen 
prosper avril remains in power but many candidates have also been 
jailed or deported avril declared a state of siege on jan 20 one 
day after the assassination of army col andre neptune his wife 
and their maid 
more than 50 opposition politicians and militants were arrested 
and beaten at the time six are still being held and seven were 
sent into forced exile 
the alliances position was unexpected because last week it 
welcomed the lifting of the state of siege on jan 29 in a 
controversial announcement it called the move an important first 
step toward the necessary normalization of the political climate 
avril lifted the declaration after an international outcry 
he came to power in a 1988 coup but has repeatedly promised to 
hold elections 
the ninemember independent electoral council has set local and 
municipal elections for april 29 legislative elections for july 22 
and aug 5 and presidential elections for oct 28 with a runoff 
on nov 25 
the alliance said legislative and presidential elections should 
be held on the same date in july ahead of local elections 
our position is clear if the electoral council does not 
modify the timetable we will not participate in elections bazin 
said at a news conference 
in addition to allowing the return of exiled leaders other 
conditions set by the alliance for its participation were that the 
government respect the constitution release uncharged political 
prisoners and give others a fair trial and allow the united 
nations to monitor the vote 
avril said last thursday that the exiles could return and that 
he hoped they had learned a lesson 
the new president would be be sworn in feb 7 1991 on the 
fifth anniversary of the ouster of dictator jeanclaude duvalier 
who fled to a exile in france 
avril a close aide of the duvalier regime gained power in 
september 1988 when a soldiers rebellion ousted lt gen henri 
namphy who took over after a popular uprising forced duvalier into 
exile in france

former us attorney general edwin meese 
iii and andre gratchev soviet deputy minister for international 
affairs debated at oxford monday night on the relative values of 
the us constitution and socialism 
the motion proposed by meese at oxford universitys venerable 
debating society that this house believes that the values of the 
american constitution not of socialism will shape the world in 
the coming century was carried by 351 votes to 235 
about 1000 students packed oxford union to hear the speeches 
the debating society is a training ground for politicians and a 
hotbed of talk wit and showingoff 
opposing the motion gratchev urged do not bury socialism 
perestroika is being tried by us to allow socialism to win 
socialism is capable of providing answers to human problems 
he said many western writers had predicted perestroika would 
fail because they said it was impossible to reform socialism 
but gratchev said perestroika involved irreversible change it 
will continue to alter the world and profoundly change the nature 
of socialism he said 
the purpose of perestroika is to subject socialism to 
historical change the 21st century will be the century of change 
right now the change is coming from the east from the soviet 
countries from moscow but it is not anticapitalist 
meese said socialism had not worked could not be defended and 
was being cast aside 
he said the value of the us constitution lay in giving to 
people the ability to bring about change through democratic 
processes 
we recognize the constitution will not solve all the problems 
of mankind but it allows the process whereby people can attempt to 
solve problems through their elected representatives meese said 
he said this was a potential recognized by more and more 
oppressed people 
that is why a copy of the statue of liberty was raised in 
tiananmen square he said referring to the prodemocracy 
demonstrations crushed by chinese troops in beijing last year

a honduran businessman already sentenced to 
life in prison on federal drug trafficking charges refused monday 
to enter a plea to a conspiracy charge in the killing of us drug 
agent enrique camarena 
juan ramon matta ballesteros appeared in court under heavy 
security with three other men including ruben zuno arce the 
brotherinlaw of former mexican president luis echeverria 
the three other men pleaded innocent to the 1985 tortureslaying 
of camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala avelar 
us district judge edward rafeedie entered an innocent plea on 
behalf of matta mattas attorney argued that a plea was not 
appropriate because his client was brought to the united states 
illegally to face charges 
he was kidnapped by agents of the united states from his 
homeland in honduras in violation of the extradition treaty and the 
united states constitution and was tortured by those agents said 
mattas attorney martin stolar 
mattas extradition to the united states from honduras in 1988 
sparked riots that left five people dead and the us embassy annex 
burned 
three federal judges have ruled the extradition was legal 
stolar also said the case has received highly prejudicial 
publicity since last months airing on nbctv of drug wars a 
miniseries about camarenas slaying 
matta 45 was sentenced last month to life in prison without 
the possibility of parole following his conviction on seven 
charges including conspiracy possession and distribution of 
narcotics and running a criminal enterprise

of racketeering and conspiracy to kidnap a federal agent

the university of notre dame bucked the college 
football association and became the first college to sell its home 
football games to a major network by agreeing monday to a fiveyear 
contract with nbc beginning in 1991 
abc and espn thought they had acquired rights to notre dame home 
games when they agreed to exclusive contracts with the cfa which 
consists of 64 schools 
but the deal by the fighting irish a member of the cfa created 
the possibility that other colleges might defect from the cfas 
package the terms of the agreement were not disclosed 
abc announced jan 17 that it had purchased rights to the cfa 
for 210 million over five years espn announced oct 4 1989 that 
it had bought the groups cable rights for 110 million over five 
years 
it would be premature to speculate on how the cfa membership 
may be affected said david ogrean cfa assistant executive 
director for television the cfa television committee will review 
the situation and consult with the membership both abc and espn 
with whom the cfa has agreements commencing in 1991 have expressed 
interest in continuing their relationship with the cfa 
abc said in a statement that it intends to pursue all remedies 
available to protect its agreement with the cfa from interference 
by third parties including nbc sports and to ensure participation 
of all cfa schools espn declined to comment 
in a news conference monday in south bend ind to announce the 
deal notre dame said it had not given the cfa any guarantees it 
would be part of the new television package 
nbc said it was legally free to conclude a deal with the 
fighting irish since the school had not committed to the cfas 
package 
we did not interfere with an existing relationship said nbc 
sports president dick ebersol 
ebersol said that for now nbc would not attempt to sign 
contracts with other schools however he said nbc would stand by 
and see what the developments are in the other schools 
sam jankovich athletic director at the university of miami 
said he would not rule out a similar plan for the hurricanes the 
1989 national champions 
the notre dame package will begin with a sept 7 1991 visit by 
indiana notre dame will play six home games a year during the 
contract against 16 opponents 
the agreement will not prohibit notre dame road games from being 
televised by other networks or cable stations 
ogrean said the deal does not affect notre dames status in the 
cfa 
the involvement with the television package is separate from 
being involved with the cfa said notre dame executive vice 
president e william beauchamp 
university athletic director dick rosenthal said he had had 
problems with abcs plan to show many games on a regional basis 
when its new deal begins in 1991 it would almost be better for 
us not be on than to be on in only part of the country he said

president bushs new defense budget doesnt 
offer a longrange vision for the pentagon in a time of 
revolutionary change but it gives some shortterm clues about how 
this commanderinchief wants the military to prepare for the years 
to come 
bush said his 2921 billion defense budget for 1991 offers a 
chance to restructure americas defenses in the wake of 
europes revolutionary changes and he made headlines with last 
weeks proposal to strip hundreds of thousands of us and soviet 
troops from the european continent 
but the budget proposal also reveals a conservative 
takeitslow approach in many areas 
the 1991 plan takes only tentative steps into a new era with a 
modest troop reduction of 38000 in the coming year cutbacks in 
about 20 minor conventional weapon programs and continued funding 
for several futuristic weapons systems from the reagan 
administration such as the strategic defense initiative

the death of noted western artist john 
clymer has not dampened enthusiasm in his hometown for building an 
elaborate museum in the artists memory 
the clymer museum already is functioning in a temporary setting 
and fund raising is moving ahead for a much larger facility which 
is expected to open later this year 
the museum is a huge undertaking for art lovers in ellensburg a 
ranching and university town of 11000 people located 100 miles 
east of seattle but the need to honor a native son is important 
said janice ludtka president of the clymer foundation 
we think of him as our rockwell in this area she said 
the comparison to norman rockwell is appropriate because 
clymers original claim to fame was the more than 80 covers he 
painted for the saturday evening post rockwells celebrity also 
rested on his post covers 
clymer supporters already have purchased a large building in 
downtown ellensburg but still need 200000 for renovations and 
arent sure where theyre going to get it ludtka said 
we have really saturated our own community and businesses and 
individuals she said 
after a campaign that included donation canisters in restaurants 
and special clymer sales by local merchants supporters are now 
seeking corporate donations from large washington businesses and 
government assistance 
they also have secured a 75000 grant from a local trust but 
that is contingent on raising matching funds ludtka said 
clymer was born in 1907 and died last nov 2 after an extended 
illness he attended art school in vancouver british columbia and 
then made his reputation as a commercial artist he married doris 
schnebly in 1932 and she became his researcher 
in 1964 clymer stopped doing commercial work and concentrated 
on painting historically accurate western scenes and wildlife his 
original paintings were selling in the 100000 range during his 
lifetime 
he lived his later years in teton village wyo and was a 
member of the prestigious cowboy artists of america 
the idea of a clymer museum arose out of the western art 
association which for 17 years has mounted one of the northwests 
largest art shows and auctions in ellensburg a separate clymer 
museum board was created to keep the two projects separate 
the western art association will rent space for its headquarters 
in the new clymer museum building 
the association has been operating out of a small storefront 
gallery in ellensburgs historic downtown since 1988 that space 
also has served as the temporary clymer museum 
the western art association owns five of clymers paintings and 
the new museum expects to acquire more as gifts and loans 
clymers death at age 82 has sparked an even greater interest in 
his work death does enhance the popularity of an artist 
sometimes said jo leal clark manager of the western art 
association 
speculation already is beginning on the value of limited edition 
signed prints of clymers works since there will be no more she 
said 
the new museum will be located in a 17000square foot building 
also in the charming historic district it used to house a bonanza 
88 store 
but even this is not the permanent home longterm plans call 
for building a brandnew museum on land that has been donated to 
the art association

on paper theres a promising catalogue of 
issues for democrats to claim as they head into the congressional 
campaign season but its still multiple choice with no consensus 
on a theme 
among the prospects the peace dividend proposed tax 
reductions the dispute over budget priorities and deficits 
democratic insistence that the administration is shortchanging 
national needs in education and the war on drugs 
ronald h brown the democratic national chairman says his 
party will rally around clear salable campaign issues and soon 
at least he hopes so 
we dont have consensus on the oneliners he said but he 
and the partys congressional hierarchy are working on it 
thats evidence of a frustration that always confronts the party 
out of white house power the democrats lot for all but four of 
the past 21 years they have to negotiate policy and political 
strategy among factions whose differences can mute the message 
president bush doesnt have that problem his oneline refrain 
is three words long two years old and still working for him no 
new taxes 
the democrats havent yet found an antidote 
brown thinks there may be one in sen daniel patrick moynihans 
proposal to cut social security taxes a reduction that would be 
worth 330 to middle income americans next year moynihan a new 
york democrat said he proposed it because the administration is 
misusing social security reserves to mask the size of the federal 
deficit 
id like to see the democratic party strongly on that issue 
brown said in an interview he said it may need fine tuning but it 
is the kind of proposal with which democrats can dramatize their 
differences with the republican administration 
i think thats the kind of comparison we need to be drawing 
brown said george bush fighting for a cut in the capital gains 
tax and here democrats are fighting for a cut in taxes for working 
people middleincome people 
and those are the kind of distinctions that i think are clear 
and concise and simple enough so the american people begin to 
understand the points that were trying to make and they begin to 
crystallize he said 
but democratic congressional leaders havent yet been able to 
crystallize their own positions let alone a party push for the tax 
cut they have not endorsed the measure now before the senate 
finance committee 
even if they were to agree theres a trap waiting in the house 
where rep dan rostenkowski dill signed up the democratic 
members of his taxwriting ways and means committee to a 1989 bill 
to protect the social security trust fund it would require that 
any changes in taxes or benefits be neutral in their impact on the 
overall revenues flowing into the social security 
bush and his republican allies call the moynihan proposal a 
charade that would lead to a general tax increase they also 
contend that it could lead to reductions in future social security 
benefits i hope its dead and i think it is bush said in an 
interview with the wall street journal 
and if it isnt he said hell veto it anyhow 
thats the kind of consistent headon theme the democrats lack 
on the tax proposal and on other issues 
it is the gap brown wants filled we ought to be in a pretty 
stark way indicating what our differences are he said 
but party chairmen can only urge advise organize and 
orchestrate they dont control issues elected officeholders make 
the decisions and therefore the record

producer miriam birch began suggesting a 
national geographic television special on bali not long after her 
first visit to the indonesian island 
i went to bali before it had an international airport and 
before the big tourist boom she said i went there on a 
pleasure trip and absolutely fell in love with it i thought it was 
the most magical and exotic place id ever seen 
thats high praise from a producer whos spent her career 
journeying to beautiful and exotic places from egypt to leningrad 
to make television documentaries 
birch began lobbying for the bali show soon after she was hired 
11 years ago by wqedtv in pittsburgh as a writerproducer for the 
national geographic specials she of course got her wish bali 
masterpiece of the gods will be broadcast wednesday on pbs as the 
second show in the national geographic specials 25th anniversary 
series 
the special captures balis distinctive culture in which 
religion and the arts are mixed with everyday life 
nearly everyone in bali is an artist birch said they 
dance or paint or play a musical instrument they have a special 
relationship between life and art and god 
one of the first questions people ask is whether tourism has 
hurt bali in the show one man says yes its lowered the 
standards for art in some cases people are creating things just 
for tourists i thought that was a very balinesian answer 
the onehour special is cast with the gentle peaceful balinese 
an island people whose ancestors include malaysians polynesians 
indians and chinese 
the people are agama hindi a mixture of hindu and the 
indigenous animistic religion thats practiced nowhere else on 
earth besides its vibrant multicolored art and haunting music 
the film also displays balis spectacular mountains beaches and 
stairstep rice terraces 
when she finally got the goahead birch went on an exploratory 
visit with tom skinner the executive producer from wqed and 
dennis kane formerly executive producer for the national 
geographic society at the same time they also visited singapore 
and shanghai 
birch returned for another month of researching the story after 
writing the script in los angeles she spent another 10 weeks in 
bali doing the special with her film crew 
when i went back the last time i knew the people events and 
places we wanted to film she said we arranged to be there for 
their most important religious holidays 
we were filming a high priest in a small town giving 
blessings he called me over and gave me a balinese blessing he 
poured water over my hands put a flower in my hand and put rice on 
my forehead it was a profound and moving experience i hadnt 
asked for it or expected it and i could feel the sincerity of the 
priest 
birch also has produced specials on jerusalem ireland and its 
horses japan the chinese panda the soviet circus and hong kong 
her 10th special voices of leningrad is set for april 4 
i was scheduled to do a film on shanghai she said id 
already written the treatment and it had been accepted i was on 
vacation in italy when events exploded in beijing that show went 
on the shelf and i went to leningrad 
the leningrad film which is set within the context of its 
history is the most issueoriented program ever for national 
geographic she said it tells what the soviet people are going 
through now with glasnost and gorbachev when peter the great 
founded the city as st petersburg it was a revolutionary idea it 
was on the edge of the russian empire it was on the swampy mouth 
of the neva river and it would be the northernmost metropolis in 
the world its a beautiful city but to this day its still a 
cold miserable place

im a documentary producer says jeff 
harmon what i do is document history 
during the war in afghanistan he did it the hard way with one 
program about the rebels then another about the soviet troops 
on sunday ted turners tbs superstation which aired harmons 
first show in 1986 and the other in december is repeating the 
second afghanistan the soviet experience 
vietnam vets in particular might find some of its scenes eerily 
familiar theres no triple canopy jungle to be sure but there 
are the contourflying helicopters the door gunners watching the 
ground the dusty hill outposts resupplied by chopper and the 
convoyguarding armored personnel carrier rolling along its young 
driver listening to western rock on his boombox 
another deja vu moment in a kabul hospital the wounded soviet 
grunt who according to the shows english translation complains 
that in this war you cant understand who are the civilians and 
who are the enemies 
the two programs the first is afghanistans holy war 
were filmed three years apart and shown on tbs national geographic 
explorer series 
harmon 36 was born in los angeles based in london but 
living out of my suitcase now he says hes basically 
selfeducated with a year logged at new york universitys film 
school 
he did his first afghanistan war documentary out of plain 
curiosity the image of these 19th century tribesmen battling a 
superpower intrigued the hell out of me and i got sucked into the 
image and went 
bankrolled by the bbc harmon and cameraman alexander lindsay 
emulated other correspondents trying to cover the rebels after 
soviet troops were sent to afghanistan in 1979 the two slipped 
across the border from pakistan in 1985 
his aim he says was to show the war from the gruntlevel 
perspective of the sovietfighting rebels the mujahideen the 
muj pronounced mooj as some westerners call them 
i dont go in with a correspondent or make myself a 
correspondent he says i tell the story of the people im 
covering i do it through their eyes i dont whitewash 
anything i dont take a partisan view 
indeed he says some rebel political leaders got upset at his 
documentary about the rebel troops including what the troops 
thought of their leaders and their real way of life including 
that some smoked hashish 
the leaders considered all that bad for the rebel image says 
harmon his opinion of them isnt kind they were like world war 
i generals to them their men out on the front lines were 
cannon fodder 
harmon wanted to film the soviet gis side of the war but 
didnt have high hopes having been with the rebels trying to kill 
them he thought would not exactly make him welcome not even in 
the new era of mikhail gorbachevs glasnost easing access for 
western journalists 
to his surprise he says the soviets granted him a visa when he 
sought to cover for britains independent television news the 
start of the soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan in 1988 his 
theory is that soviet officials had seen his earlier documentary 
and at least thought it honest 
visa in hand he hurriedly called national geographic officials 
in the united states got the green light for a fulllength 
documentary and with cameraman lindsay went to work he says he 
told soviet officials in kabul this 
im not going to make a propaganda film for you but im not 
going to do a hatchet job on you either all i want to do is show 
the war through the eyes of the ordinary ivan 
word of the unusual travels fast in any army most soviet grunts 
and helicopter pilots he met already knew hed covered the rebel 
side of the war harmon says but he found little if any 
animosity toward him he says 
they were fascinated by the fact wed covered the war on the 
other side the soldiers they were so curious so what was the 
enemy like i think they looked at me as a chance to see what it 
was like on the other side

when the nature conservancy bought 502 square 
miles of new mexico 90 percent of a mountain range and a more 
diverse population of mammals than any national park in the united 
states it was hailed as a milestone 
it certainly was but the purchase in late january was also the 
culmination of an explosion of conservation efforts in the last 10 
years 
a new breed of conservationists is buying up big chunks of the 
american landscape stamping the land inviolate to the bulldozers 
blade 
how much money the conservancy paid for the gray ranch in new 
mexico astride the continental divide wasnt made public but it 
was probably in the neighborhood of 18 million a sum that would 
have sounded improbable to a conservationists ears a decade ago 
what it brought under the conservancys protection was almost 
all the animas mountain range some 100 plant and animal species 
listed as endangered threatened or rare 13 precolumbian 
archaeological digs and hundreds of others as yet unexplored herds 
of chihuahuan pronghorn antelope seven different habitat types 
from desert grassland to chaparral and coniferous forest and 
endangered bits of nature from the whiteeared hummingbird to the 
night blooming cereus 
the conservancy acted when it discovered the ranch owners wanted 
to sell and there was the threat the land might be broken up and 
developed 
conservancy president john c sawhill announcing the buy said 
few intact natural systems of this caliber exist in the world 
today the effort also represents the future trend for the 
nature conservancy and its partners to truly insure our natural 
world for future generations we are developing creative ways to 
safeguard much larger landscapes 
a few years ago such an effort would have been only a dream 
but conservationists are becoming sophisticated advocates 
scientists business graduates experts in law and real estate 
inch by precious inch they are preserving farmland wilderness 
and open spaces against development more effectively than ever 
before 
the nature conservancy is a sort of symbol for individuals and 
other land trusts before the new mexico deal it was taking an 
average of 1000 acres a day out of commercial play 
says mike dennis general counsel of the conservancy for 
every scientist we have around here we probably have an mba a tax 
lawyer and a real estate attorney 
environmentalists have sharpened their skills in the private 
sector recycling many of the same dollars each time to buy new 
land they have discovered revolving funds a war fund that doesnt 
have to stay invested they can plunk down several million dollars 
until by prior arrangement a government agency can repay them 
assuming custodial care of the property 
or they can buy a piece of property deprive it of the potential 
for commercial development and resell the land for a somewhat 
lesser cost to what they think is an appropriate buyer 
who is that buyer a farmer who will farm without being tempted 
by high developer prices the us fish and wildlife service which 
wants to protect the land or a trust that is able to preserve the 
land as open space a vista a place apart 
in any case the conservationists send the resale dollars back 
into their revolving funds to be used again 
none of these organizations or individuals could succeed without 
local support when a developer wanted to take a 147acre scenic 
hay meadow in jackson hole wyo to put in 70 to 80 houses the 
local land trust negotiated an option on the land priced at 15 
million 
the county came up with onethird and the land trust raised the 
rest from private donations 
says ms jean hocker director of the land trust alliance an 
umbrella organization in washington for hundreds of local land 
trusts the community heard about it and came to the rescue 
the deal took three months speed is important 
there are more than 800 local land trusts established in states 
counties and communities almost half of them formed in the past 
10 years they protect about 2 million acres and they own 300000 
some of them have milliondollar budgets 
sometimes conservationists act in concert 
the mcquerry ranch 3500 acres at the foot of the 11000foot 
peaks of nevadas ruby mountains was in financial trouble the 
family in danger of losing the land they had farmed for generations 
a third of the ranch is a unique desert wetland area around 
franklin lake the kind of terrain that attracts resort 
developmentit is also a nesting area for migratory birds 
the american farmland trust suggested to the nature conservancy 
that the best way to preserve the land was to enhance the way in 
which the farm was operated by the family

<TEXT>
the migratory birds and the wetland fit the conservancys 
charter with 300000 from its revolving fund the 
conservationists bought the ranch and leased it back to the 
mcquerry family with certain conditions 
the family would have to change certain farming operations for 
instance they would not be permitted to graze the wetland area 
from fall to the following summer when the birds use the estuary 
when the family was able they would buy the ranch back but 
those covenants would remain 
if we hadnt stepped in certainly the family was going into 
bankruptcy says ralph grossi president of the american farmland 
trust they would have lost the farm 
the farmland trust felt there was a real danger of development 
to the land and the natural ecosystem around the lake 
the united states covers some 3600000 square miles or 23 
trillion acres of those 78000 square miles or almost 50 million 
acres are inland waterways there are also more than 88000 miles 
of tidal shoreline 
conservationist groups cant protect it all nor they say 
should they often they seek to cooperate with developers allowing 
residential uses but sequestering other areas in some cases 
developers pay mitigation fees for the damage their developments 
might cause those funds are used to enhance the protected land 
says the nature conservancys dennis when youre talking 
about an ecosystem you could be talking about anything from 5000 
acres to 500 square miles 
so he outlines a compromise a core that the conservationists 
want to own and manage around that they would establish a larger 
area where timbering and mining are banned then you may want an 
additional buffer where development is ok but its got to be 
limited you may allow a cluster of homes here on 2to 5acre 
tracts and preserve farmland over there 
even individuals are taking a page from their book and designing 
small local operations to save such properties as a farm in 
virginia or 400 acres of rolling countryside in connecticut the 
farm remained a farm and the connecticut tract is now home to an 
organically safe golf course 
in the array of people in the conservation army there is also 
an array of purposes 
the nature conservancys 542000 members dedicated to 
preserving habitats have financed a 600 million organization that 
has saved almost 4 million sensitive acres since it was founded in 
1953 it has 1000 employees and probably 10000 volunteers and 
covers every state 
considerably younger 10 years old and smaller a staff of 30 
nationwide is the american farmland trust dedicated to saving the 
nations farms and improving farming techniques yet it churns 
accounts of more than 2 million to get more acres for the buck 
we are concerned about the debt burden in agriculture says 
the trusts president ralph grossi many farmers are going out 
of business and their land isnt being cared for adequately 
organizations from the national wildlife federation to the 
audubon society from the us fish and wildlife service to ducks 
unlimited a hunters group often find themselves working in 
concert 
they all have one thing in common they can move more quickly 
than local or state governments can and using charitable tax 
benefits they can bring in a deal cheaper than developers can 
by stripping a piece of land of development rights it is not 
only protected regardless of who owns it but income tax benefits 
can either bring the owner a sizable tax deduction or provide 
instant cash for a farmer 
it also reduces the value of the land and hence its tax 
assessment which deprives the county or state of some tax revenue 
but counties and states usually are willing to forgo taxes on some 
property to enhance the value of land around it 
witness new yorks gov mario cuomo who has asked for 19 
billion to set aside areas of the empire state for scenic and 
recreation purposes california has provided more than 700 million 
for similar purposes and florida has an active land acquisition 
program 
but the smallest of communities can be stirred to action 
michigans west coast is a beautiful blend of dunes orchards and 
sandy beaches on lake michigan it is a magnet for those wanting 
second homes and unlike the coast of california which it mimics 
in miniature it has no coastal commission to protect it 
local land trusts with the help of the farmland trust moved in 
to buy a 507acre farm on the old mission peninsula blocking any 
further residential development it will remain an orchard in an 
area that prides itself as being the cherry capital of the 
world 
its unlikely that some crops will be grown in any quantity in 
the united states 30 to 40 years from now says grossi of the 
farmland trust the growing areas that are required the climate 
the soil the weather those unique values are essentially the same 
as those that attract people

the nature conservancy has been busy capturing 
islands from sea to shining sea to provide habitats for rare 
threatened and endangered creatures 
in the process it has led its negotiators into some strange and 
complicated deals 
for example shelter island off the tip of new yorks long 
island 6000 bucolic acres just two hours by car from the towers 
of new york city 
a third of it was the mashomack hunt club owned by the girard 
family which felt very strongly about keeping it a wildlife 
preserve 
it was held by a familyowned realty company that also held 
other family properties 
the family wanted to make a substantial gift of land but it 
also wanted to realize some cash from the holdings that included 
nine brownstones near rockefeller plaza in new york city warehouse 
property in miami and a number of oil and gas wells 
what to do 
conservancy experts worked out an elaborate deal the family 
sold the realty company to the conservancy for less than the market 
value reaping a charity tax deduction the conservancy then sold 
off the brownstones the gas and oil wells and the warehouses and 
raised the rest of the 12 million it owed the family for the 
realty company 
today the mashomack preserve on the atlantic flyway is home 
for flocks of migratory birds including the elusive osprey 
matagordo island is tiny by comparison the us fish and 
wildlife service desperately wanted the last parcel to go with the 
rest it managed in partnership with the texas wildlife service 
the islands inhabitants include about 140 whooping cranes 
millions of ducks and other waterfowl 
the conservancy again stepped in and bought the land 
transferring it to the wildlife service as federal funds became 
available 
had they waited the land would have fallen to the 40 or so 
heirs of the man who owned it and consensus is difficult under 
those circumstances he died of a heart attack only months after 
the deal was made 
sometimes a gift becomes an ecological headache 
santa cruz island is one of the channel islands off the coast of 
california over the years the owner gave most of the 60000 acres 
to the nature conservancy 
a century and a half ago sheep were introduced to what was 
largely a cattle ranch the sheep ran wild eventually numbering up 
to 40000 the conservancy brought in navajo shepherds to round 
them up it didnt work 
they went to the association of sheep ranchers who were of no 
help and were plainly disturbed lest that much mutton be dumped on 
the market all at once 
finally and regrettably fencing off a square mile at a time 
the sheep were killed 
sheep as any reader of westerns will tell you eat the grass 
down to the roots when the conservancy got the land the island 
was a dead brown today all but 10000 privately held acres in the 
south are green and home to specific island species such as the 
santa cruz kit fox island jay and others 
sometime in the future the last privately held parcel will be 
turned over to the national park service which manages all the 
channel islands and it will be green again

proposals to ease a growing water shortage in 
the arid middle east range from building a 1500mile pipeline to 
towing icebergs from antarctica whatever is done scientists say 
time is running out the water crisis can only intensify 
hostilities in the troubled region 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a shortage of water brought on by a 
population explosion is aggravating tensions in the volatile middle 
east and could lead to what one study calls an unprecedented 
upheaval 
water is more important than oil in this region says 
egyptian economist mostafa elsaid a former economy minister 
growing industrial development and increasingly crowded cities 
in the region have increased the demand for water in recent years 
the problem has been intensified by severe droughts over the last 
decade with five of six years the hottest years this century 
the crisis came sharply into focus in midjanuary when turkey 
blocked off much of the water in the 1460mile euphrates river 
that flows southward through syria and iraq to the persian gulf 
to chants of allah is great president turgut ozal pushed a 
button that lowered an 87ton concrete plug into the diversion 
channel under the dam the fifth largest in the world 
despite protests from iraq and syria the turks planned to 
staunch the flow of the river for one month to fill up the 
reservoir for the giant ataturk hydroelectric dam in southeastern 
anatolia province the centerpiece of an extensive irrigation and 
development program to aid the impoverished region 
ankara gave damascus and baghdad several weeks warning and 
even increased the flow of water before the cutoff to compensate 
but the turkish move reminded syria and iraq of just how 
vulnerable their water supply is 
baghdads althawra daily an organ of the ruling baath arab 
socialist party warned that the longterm fall in the euphrates 
flow could cause a real agricultural disaster in iraq 
affecting 32 million acres of prime farmland in the mesopotamian 
basin 
it warned that if turkey does not share the euphrates water 
relations could he harmed 
scientists say not enough has been done to head off disaster 
proposals range from a turkish proposal for a 21 billion peace 
pipeline to carry water for sale 1500 miles south to the arabian 
peninsula to towing icebergs from the antarctic to saudi arabia 
for most countries with the exception of saudi arabia and 
kuwait desalination plants on the scale needed are simply too 
expensive 
in this overheated atmosphere of political hostilities 
complicated by insufficient water to meet the needs of developing 
societies the latent tensions may develop into domestic conflicts 
and expand to regional ones professor elias salameh of jordan 
universitys water research and study center said at a recent 
seminar in nicosia 
water will determine the future of the middle east he said 
the population of the region will double by the year 2010 we 
need twice as much water as we have now 
there are an estimated 210 million arabs now spread across 21 
countries the population is growing at an average of 3 percent a 
year 
water has historically been a source of conflict in the middle 
east ancient civilizations flowered around the regions major 
rivers the nile the euhprates and the tigris and they had to 
fight to keep control of them without water there was nothing 
the people of the middle east have learned to live with meager 
water resources adapting their cultures and even their conflicts 
to this basic commodity salameh noted 
but he said the region was now trapped in a vicious circle 
the only way to cover the increasing demand for water is by 
curtailing the share of irrigation water for agriculture which in 
turn is in bad need of water to supply food for an increasing 
population 
syria and iraq bitter rivals in the arab world face a common 
threat from turkeys plans to harness the euphrates 
iraq depends on the river for much of its water for electricity 
generation and irrigation but can fall back on the tigris 
syria however is totally reliant on the euphrates and any 
cutback could have a potentially catastrophic impact on its already 
troubled economy 
poorly defined international laws on riparian rights leave 
little room for legal action 
ankaras announcement last year that it would halt the euphrates 
flow fostered speculation it was using that as a political lever to 
force damascus and baghdad to move against kurdish rebels based in 
their border territories 
foreign ministry officials in ankara deny there is any linkage 
but turkish anger at syria particularly has risen in recent weeks 
following a raid by guerrillas of the marxist kurdish workers 
party in which 24 villagers were massacred also a turkish survey 
aircraft was downed inside turkish airspace by a syrian mig fighter 
in october 
the ataturk project involves construction of 13 dams and 17 
hydroelectric stations generating 8000 megawatts of electricity 
doubling the regional output and providing irrigation for 28600 
square miles of land 
the turks have been providing syria with 500 cubic yards of 
water a second from the euphrates and increased that by 50 percent 
in late december to compensate for the cutoff 
one of the problems is that the sources of the regions main 
rivers the euphrates tigris and nile are in nonarab countries 
for the israelis the rivers on which they rely originate in arab 
countries 
possibly the most potentially dangerous water dispute 
encompasses israel lebanon jordan and syria over the waters of 
the jordan and yarmouk rivers the 1967 war and israels 1982 
invasion of lebanon stemmed in part from its need to acquire water 
resources 
jordan has long accused israel of taking an unfair share of 
water from the jordan and its tributaries 
washingtons center for strategic and international studies 
noted in a recent report the middle east stands at the precipice 
of another major natural resource crisis 
before the 21st century the struggle over limited and 
threatened water resources could sunder already fragile ties among 
regional states and lead to unprecedented upheaval within the 
area 
the united nations food and agricultural agency reported in 
november that middle east food production is rapidly falling behind 
population growth one of the highest in the world this has 
intensified the need for greater water resources 
sandra postel vice president of the usbased worldwatch 
institute an independent study group noted in a global report on 
irrigation in december that the middle east is one of several 
regions expected to suffer chronic water shortages in the coming 
decade partly because of changing climatic patterns known as the 
greenhouse effect

scientists have a gift for omans mountain 
tribesmen who pray for rain in the remote southern province of 
dhofar here on the southern edge of arabia 
three fogretention researchers from canada and chile have shown 
the jebalis or mountain dwellers how to harness moisture in 
the air to produce drinking water for their families and livestock 
across the monsoonclad dhofari landscape 
the scientists collect the mist by extraction using wire mesh 
screens as interceptors says mohamed ghassani secretary of 
dhofars environmental planning committee 
a small pilot project yielded 16280 gallons of water during the 
last monsoon more than 10 times the quantity nature alone would 
have provided he says 
preliminary results are encouraging experiments confirm the 
technology definitely works ghassani says were now planning 
for this years operation and optimistically preparing for the 
coming monsoon in june 
the project design team backed by the united nations 
development program the world meteorological organization and 
unesco includes dr richard schemenauer of the canadian 
atmospheric environment service and geographers pilar cereceda and 
juan barros from chiles catholic university 
oman lies on the southeastern tip of the arabian peninsula the 
sultanate flanks the great desert belt that stretches from the west 
coast of africa through the sahara to arabia pakistan and china 
southwest trade winds blow from the indian ocean across the 
southern coast trailing a veil of monsoon cloud over dhofars 
mountains from june to september 
dhofar accounts for onethird of the sultanates area of 115800 
square miles about the size of new mexico with a population 
estimated at 15 million including the bedouins of the central 
desert 
to the northwest the dhofar regions border with saudi arabia 
runs through the desolate area known as the empty quarter 
dhofars fertile alluvial soil is well watered for four months 
by the monsoon cloud but supplies of water for drinking and other 
domestic needs are less accessible for the tribal communities that 
live in the treedotted mountains 4900 feet above the coastal 
plain around the southern capital salahah 
climbing high into the mountains the scientists worked with 
omani environmentalists to erect interceptor and water retainer 
mechanisms in strategic hillside locations 
harvesting the monsoon cloud synthetically to provide a water 
supply for the jebalis and their crops and cattle had not been 
considered feasible until now a development fund spokesman said in 
the capital muscat 
exactly how much of this plentiful atmospheric phenomenon can 
be collected before its dissipated across the nejd desert is 
currently under study he said 
the omanis have traditionally found tree branches to be good 
interceptors he said 
planted in arid regions they could be very productive initial 
findings appear to justify largescale tree planting across 
watershed zones 
the jebalis have traditionally used clay basins placed under 
trees to collect water they say this will continue but they are 
also showing a great deal of interest in the other methods 
un officials say fog water retention is also of increasing 
interest in chile and other parts of south america 
small desalination plants have been established in dhofar which 
has a large reservoir of water under the salalah plain 
in the more remote areas two systems of seawater desalination 
and brackish water desalination are employed both using the same 
reverse osmosis technology 
we understand fog water retention could be a relatively less 
expensive complimentary alternative and look forward to seeing the 
results of further experiments a water resources ministry 
spokesman said

they are survivors of the golden age of jazz 
art hodes on the piano and bud freeman on the tenor sax were 
pioneers who developed distinctive styles still being imitated by 
other musicians they are both in their 80s now but not forgotten 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bud freeman and art hodes grew up in the chicago 
of the early 1920s when al capone ruled the underworld and the 
seductive sounds of a new kind of music spilled from smoky clubs on 
the south side 
the two freshfaced white teens used to sneak into those 
allblack joints to hear the likes of trumpeter louis armstrong and 
pianist earl fatha hines play music theyd never heard before 
bluesy beats and rich rhythms that would come to be known as jazz 
hodes and freeman didnt meet until much later but both were 
hooked in those early days and both made jazz their lives 
hodes built a reputation as one of the worlds premier piano 
interpreters of jazz blues 
freemans distinctive swing style on the tenor saxophone has 
been widely imitated 
and the musics still got them though both are in their early 
80s 
hodes plays to packed jazz clubs in chicago and abroad and 
freeman stayed in the business until an eye ailment forced his 
retirement a few months ago 
neither became a household word but theyre considered two of 
the great survivors of jazzs golden age 
there was a school of young white chicago players who heard 
the great new orleans players in chicago in the 20s and played 
their own variations freeman was one of them and art hodes was 
says martin williams a jazz scholar who compiled the smithsonian 
institutions recorded collection of classic jazz 
bob koester owner of chicagos jazz record mart says they 
come from the whole generation that pioneered jazz no one sounded 
like bud freeman before bud freeman they had unique styles which 
were so widely respected they were imitated 
richard wang director of jazz studies at the university of 
illinois chicago campus says hodes is a prime representative of 
a style of solo piano playing which developed here in chicago with 
the boogiewoogie pianists hes a living museum of jazz piano 
hes a survivor of a tradition which is not in the fingers of 
todays jazz pianists 
hodes says hes about 83 though no one knows for sure his 
birth records were lost when his family emigrated from russia in 
the first years of the century 
they settled on chicagos south side and hodes studied music at 
hull house where clarinetist benny goodman also was a student 
his mother hoped hed become a great classical pianist but with 
armstrong hines trumpeter king oliver and others playing at local 
clubs hodes had no time for the classics 
i heard them on records and eventually in person he 
recalled in a recent interview as benny goodman said you put 
your dads long pants on and hope that you can crash the clubs 
and thats what i did 
i was just knocked out it turned me everywhere but loose 
hodes says i just had never heard anything like this jazz was 
very new it probably could be compared to what happened to the 
kids when they heard the beatles 
hodes first job just out of high school was playing piano in 
a club run by a capone lieutenant 
he also played for scarface himself 
i doubt if he noticed me he says in those days your 
social standing was somewhere above the washroom attendant but 
below the checkroom girl 
but hodes persevered borrowing the brassy sounds of his new 
orleansbred heroes while developing a clear resonant blues style 
of his own 
my big break was going to new york city in 1938 he says

<TEXT>
there for the first time in my life jazz was being played in 
nightclubs for listening and not for background for strippers 
hodes made several recordings as a featured pianist and played 
with just about everybody including bix beiderbecke louis 
armstrong sidney bechet wang says 
in 1950 hodes settled back in chicago building his reputation 
as a soloist by touring the country and playing abroad during this 
period he and freeman met played together and became friends 
freeman born in chicago in 1906 grew up on the west side and 
attended austin high school where he and four other student 
musicians formed the austin high gang 
all five became professional musicians though freeman and 
trumpeter jimmy mcpartland who lives in new york are the only 
survivors 
we wanted to do our own thing freeman recalls they were 
fascinated by the rhythm the new sound the improvisation of 
what they considered black music 
the group played in an awful lot of chinese restaurants and i 
played some clubs that were pretty seedy places but they were 
places that i could play the way i wanted to play 
as jazz caught on freeman also went to new york his big break 
was his first recording in 1927 as a featured player with 
guitarist eddie condon he played with tommy dorseys band and with 
goodman in the 30s recording under his own name he gained fame 
as a soloist 
an unabashed fan of freeman and hodes wayne jones 56 a 
chicago jazz drummer has played with both 
i just love em theres something about them the era they 
came up in it defies words he says 
a lot of younger guys it doesnt mean anything to them but 
to me its like a kid ballplayer finally getting to play with babe 
ruth 
time hasnt dimmed their appeal 
shortly before freeman was sidelined by illness last year he 
played to a standingroomonly crowd at the green mill on the 
citys far north side 
and when hodes and a group of local musicians played there on 
jan 14 some people were turned away from the packed club hodes 
rousing solo renditions of black and blue and st louis 
blues hushed the crowd which included many young enough to be 
his grandchildren and when the music stopped they stomped their 
feet and shouted for more 
freeman and hodes cant account for their longevity 
ive lived a very fast life played around the world for 65 
years but i was never really a drinker and i always ate the best 
foods says freeman who gained a reputation as a ladies man he 
married several times but has no children 
blowing the horn it kept your head clear 
the father of five hodes has been like a teenager since 
remarrying after his first wifes death in 1980 jones says 
part of it has to be luck hodes says one doctor told me 
i lucked out in the game of genes but i have changed my style of 
living with the years i broke away from people who drank a lot 
and quit smoking and drinking 
ive always said that im a very lucky person most people 
have to go to work i get paid for playing i love it

why do comic books remain an american obsession 
were they the bridge between a world that relied on the printed 
word and a world that learns more from visual experience some 
experts call them the reflections of our lives descended from the 
cave drawings of an earlier life 
</TEXT>

comic books are history books to mike benton 
on the surface comics were written mainly for children 
says the texas comic book collector and author but on so many 
levels they reflect our society and our culture 
bentons recently published book the comic book in america 
an illustrated history taylor publishing dallas 2995 
traces the comic book back to collections of newspaper comic strips 
printed in 1933 but not their beginning 
the comic strip is not american benton says it goes back 
to cave paintings or hieroglyphics 
however the comic book as we know it was an american innovation 
they represent the best of american values benton says 
they were born out of good old american capitalism at the same 
time they were the most democratic art form you can imagine 
even the poorest of the poor could come up with a dime to buy a 
comic book the cheapest entertainment available and chockfull of 
traditional values truth justice liberty fair play and right 
winning over all 
m thomas inge a professor of the humanities at randolphmacon 
college has also studied comic books as a serious form of 
commentary they expose and highlight everything from social mores 
to contemporary politics he says 
that is the reason they are both loved and hated an amusement 
and an object of suspicion he says in their use of character 
dialogue scene gesture stage devices and compressed time they 
are close to drama but maybe inge says they are really closer to 
the movies 
at any rate their appeal is persistent americans buy more than 
200 million a year 
the first comic book in modern form was funnies on parade 
published in 1933 as a giveaway premium sponsored by procter amp 
gamble its comic characters included mutt amp jeff and joe palooka 
the first 10cent comic book came out in 1934 and detective 
comics published its first book in 1937 
in 1938 dcs action comics introduced a caped character from 
the planet krypton two boys from cleveland jerry siegel and joe 
shuster had come up with a new concept the superhero naturally 
enough they called him superman 
according to benton there were seven significant superheroes 
out of hundreds whose amazing exploits were chronicled in comics 
superman batman wonder woman spider man captain america 
captain marvel and plastic man were all milestones in the art form 
he says 
for example batman was the first superhero without super 
powers and plastic man was the first tongueincheek superhero 
captain america leaped to the defense of liberty in 1940 
tackling nazis even before the us entered world war ii 
during the war patriotic heroes flourished including captain 
america submariner the human torch major liberty the american 
avenger and jap buster johnson 
after the war america became preoccupied with other topics 
archie andrews the perennial teenager had been born in 1941 his 
misadventures at riverdale high set the tone for millions of 
adolescents 
romance comic books blossomed in 1949 becoming the 
fastestgrowing segment of the market the next year weird science 
and other horrifying comics hit the newsstands 
in the 1950s the funny animals bred rapidly kids sticky 
dimes could buy a veritable menagerie of talking ducks stuttering 
pigs and scheming cats 
everybody has a favorite comic making old comics highly prized 
on the collectibles market 
the comic books you read when you were 10 years old are the 
best comic books in the world says benton 39 
the early comics from the 1930s and 40s are the blue chips of 
comic investments benton says but he sees the greatest potential 
from comics of the early 1960s because those are highly sought by 
baby boomers 
in the late 60s underground comix poked fun at the 
establishment 
the underground artists delineated druginduced enlightenment 
sexual revolution and the political paranoia of the sixties with an 
explicitness never before seen in comic books benton says 
comics are now in a renaissance being written more for adult 
audiences than for children he says however kids are still the 
target of specially written educational comics 
benton has found them to be excellent textbooks he believes 
comics will serve to link the more literate society of the past 
with the more visual society of the future 
as we become postliterate we leave behind the written word 
in favor of images and pictures he says 
bentons austin company custom comic services teaches young 
people such things as the dangers of drug abuse and how to avoid 
aids 
even such a delicate subject as child abuse can be addressed in 
comics benton says comics teach kids how to take care of 
themselves in a visual friendly engaging nonthreatening 
method 
despite the rapid growth of comics benton still believes the 
medium is underutilized however he expects comics will endure and 
continue their strong appeal to all ages 
theyre a ticket to another reality he says theres 
almost something magical about it

they were victims of sen joseph mccarthys 
efforts to ferret out communist sympathizers on the nations 
campuses and elsewhere in the 1950s three university of michigan 
professors were among scores of academics to feel the sting of the 
house unamerican activities committee now 35 years later 
theres a movement afoot to make amends 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in 1952 h chandler davis wrote a check 
to pay for printing a pamphlet criticizing the house unamerican 
activities committee and sen joseph mccarthy for a witch hunt 
against communist sympathizers 
the university of michigan professor believed that was part of 
his constitutional right of free speech even during the 
anticommunist frenzy of the 1950s instead it made him a target 
of the committee and he became a cold war casualty 
brought before a huac subcommittee in lansing in 1954 davis 
refused to answer questions about his political leanings claiming 
his activities were protected by the first amendment 
the subcommittee cited davis for contempt and he landed in a 
federal prison for six months the university of michigan fired him 
for insubordination and blacklited him he says 
ive never been able to get normal employment in the us 
since then says davis 63 who moved to canada in 1962 and 
became a professor of mathematics at the university of toronto 
now some want the university of michigan to apologize to davis 
a former communist and two other professors who were branded as 
potential subversives because of their former communist sympathies 
mark nickerson then a professor of pharmacology and clement 
markert an assistant professor of zoology refused to testify 
before the subcommittee presided over by rep kit clardy a 
michigan republican 
unlike davis they cited their fifth amendment right against 
incriminating themselves and avoided prison 
michigan president harlan hatcher fired nickerson and censured 
markert 
now 35 years later the ann arbor chapter of the american 
association of university professors is asking the university to 
make amends to the three through severance pay honorary 
reinstatement or honorary degrees 
the university of vermont reed college and temple university 
made similar gestures to faculty members fired during the 1950s 
university of michigan spokesman joseph owsley says the issue is 
expected to come before the faculty senate and university president 
james duderstadt will have no comment until then 
other universities besides michigan fired faculty members says 
lionel lewis who found 126 instances at 57 institutions in 
researching his book cold war on campus 
im sure there are more says lewis chairman of the 
department of sociology at the state university of new york at 
buffalo 
the passage of time hasnt dampened the anger of the three 
michigan professors 
they didnt want testimony they wanted us to prostrate 
ourselves to humiliate us in public says markert who 
sympathized with the communist party during the depression and 
fought in a communistorganized brigade in the spanish civil war in 
1938 
the only reason they wanted to talk to you was to get other 
peoples names says nickerson a former communist who said he 
never considered cooperating with huac 
there are some things you can do and some things you cant 
you dont put somebody else in jeopardy to save your own job 
markerts department fought hard to save his job a university 
faculty committee voted unanimously that he and nickerson should 
stay but hatcher fired nickerson anyway 
there was quite a lot of support that wasnt expressed other 
professors would call me or come in and see me in the evening but 
walk right past me on campus nickerson says the purpose of 
that era was to scare people and it certainly did 
nickerson moved to canada and took a job at a 50 percent pay 
cut later he became chairman of the medical school at mcgill 
university in montreal and president of the american 
pharmacological and experimental therapeutics society 
i did everything i could have done it was just harder says 
nickerson now 73 and retired 
markert 72 says he felt few professional repercussions from 
the committees effort to smear him he was granted tenure at 
michigan and is now a professor at north carolina state university 
in raleigh 
hatcher who lives in ann arbor declined to be interviewed but 
in a videotaped interview about the era he said his goal was 
survival of the university 
mccarthyism was a very destructive force and the issue was 
how to preserve the universities in the face of that threat he 
said on the tape keeping in mind 
the videotape was an honors thesis project by former michigan 
student adam kulakow 
lewis says some universities chose to protect their faculty 
members and defend their freedom to hold unpopular beliefs 
that was the case at michigan state university says walter 
adams professor of economics and former national president of the 
american association of university presidents 
thenpresident john hannah asked faculty members with communist

sexy and outspoken taylor dayne is a hybrid as 
is her music at once warm and passionate it is driven by a beat 
just as she is driven it has helped her avoid the pitfalls of 
alcohol and drugs so often associated with musical success she 
knew what she wanted and got it

no shrinking violet this lady 
her debut record album produced four top 10 singles now shes 
on her second hit single from her second record album 
i dont believe in overnight stardom taylor dayne says 
bluntly thats garbage 
she and her version of rock n roll obviously is not nor her 
sense of what she looks like 
her hair red and bushy when the first album came out is now 
blonde and less full for photographers she pouts full lips for a 
sultry look 
from the time she was a child she says she knew she was going to 
sing i was an obnoxious kid wanting to sing solos in school and 
doing it 
she chooses decolletage for public appearances like when she 
presented the dance and rap awards at januarys televised american 
music awards 
i like to be photographed she says i have fun with it i 
like to feel good about myself 
being sexy is something that didnt happen overnight im 
thankful i take good photographs every now and then 
but she never considered modeling i didnt think i was pretty 
enough or tall enough a fool job singing pays better and its 
more satisfying 
her next tour for which shes having a great outfit made 
starts in march 
remembering advice from her voice teachers dayne always warms 
up her voice before she goes on stage on the road i get really 
freaked ask anybody on the tour bus with me i have a scarf 
wrapped around my neck i have my tea and lemon and honey 
i choose not to be involved in drugs i dont preach to 
anybody i have this path within me ive fallen off a couple of 
times i picked myself up and got back on always what i saw for 
myself is where i am now i know what works for me its to keep 
myself safe happy and healthy 
if she drinks too much and feels lousy the next day i know 
exactly what i did to make myself feel like that so i avoid it i 
dont avoid it altogether lets just say i dont abuse it 
in her three college years she studied philosophy and 
psychology she took voice lessons on the side she rehearsed with 
a band three nights a week and performed weekends people call it 
paying your dues 
sometimes the lead singer sometimes switching off with others 
sometimes the kid with the tambourine but she was getting 
restless wanted out of the long island scene and she wanted to 
front a band 
she joined one in white plains ny i was schlepping up there 
three times a week rehearsing it was five people and with 
everybody having their own ideas and enormous egos the songwriter 
was very gifted but he had a major attitude problem i knew it 
wouldnt take him far and i dont mind saying that because i hate 
him 
in manhattan he told her to copy other singers it was a 
bitter time in my life all i could do was pray i would meet 
somebody who would respect me for my vocal sound and for myself 
three weeks later i met ric 
ric wake a producer of dance records heard her first on tape 
he was struggling himself making 12inch singles hoping theyd 
get picked up by a major label 
i started singing and writing dance stuff with him i could 
feel the pulse of the music 
then she began to think that melodic songs would intrigue more 
people both dance and pop fans 
so almost an unknown she got from a music publisher a song 
that was danceable and she thought had crossover appeal tell it 
to my heart she cut a single and tried to shop it around 
but impatient to pay her father back money she had borrowed 
she was willing for a smalltime independent release of the record 
if a major record company didnt pick it up 
arista records signed her three days after she got out of a 
previous independent production deal 
born lesley wunderman she changed her name so single records 
shed made wouldnt be reissued to haunt her i thought taylor 
was different i like guys names dayne came out of a babyname 
book 
arista released tell it to my heart and it flew up the 
charts in america and abroad i was making an album four months 
later dayne says 
shed never sung a ballad when clive davis aristas president 
said that ill always love you a passionate ballad should be 
on the album 
she didnt want to sing it clive obviously had a lot more 
confidence in my voice than i did now im comfortable with 
ballads i knock them out constantly its cool 
dayne grew up in long island middle child of an engineer who 
also deals in rare coins and a mother who had operatic training 
one brother does record company promotion and the other produces 
corporate parties and weddings on a grand scale 
a ballad love will lead you back is her current single 
following with every beat of my heart wake produced the tell 
it to my heart album and the new one called appropriately 
cant fight fate

drexel burnham lambert inc said it narrowed its 
losses sharply last year and expected to return to profitability in 
1990 after spending two years at the center of the nations biggest 
securities fraud case 
the securities firm said it lost about 40 million after taxes 
in 1989 on 41 billion in revenues that compared with a loss of 
167 million on revenues of 44 billion in 1988 a year in which 
it took a charge of 650 million to cover a settlement of the fraud 
charges 
as recently as december drexel chief executive frederick h 
joseph predicted the firm would break even or show a modest profit 
for the full year 
although the results announced sunday fell short of that 
forecast drexel said cutbacks in the past year had effectively 
halved the firms breakeven point and leave it poised to turn a 
profit this year 
last years loss included 75 million in expenses related to 
investigations of the firm for securities abuses those expenses 
should drop nearly in half this year drexel said 
in september drexel pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed 
to pay a record of more than 650 million in fines and restitution 
to settle criminal fraud charges that stemmed from the ivan boesky 
insider trading scandal 
the firm also reached an agreement on civil charges with the 
securities and exchange commission last year that placed drexel 
under unprecedented government supervision for three years and 
revamps its management 
the loss last year also included an undisclosed amount of 
charges related to discontinued operations 
the firm unloaded its retail brokerage network last year and has 
reduced employment to about 5300 today from 9700 at the start of 
1989 drexel spokesman steven s anreder said he suggested that 
the charges for discontinued operations was fairly small but 
declined to give details 
drexel is a closely held firm and does not release detailed 
earnings figures 
before tax and interest payments and the special charges drexel 
said it had an operating profit of 67 million in 1989 
that profit came after provisions to mark down the value of the 
firms holdings of highyield bonds to reflect the steep fall in 
the market for socalled junk bonds in recent months drexel said 
the profit figure also included over 200 million in other charges 
that arent expected to recur the firm said 
anreder declined to say what the 200 millionplus charge 
covered or give details about the size of the junk bond writedown 
we never indicate the size of our position for competitive 
reasons he said of the junk bond portfolio drexel virtually 
created the junk bond market and rode it to prominence in the 
1980s posting a record pretax profit of 11 billion at its peak 
in 1986 
drexel said it would benefit from a sharp reduction in costs 
this year in addition to reduced personnel and legal costs the 
firm announced plans in october to cut its new york city office 
space to about 700000 square feet by 1991 from 15 million square 
feet 
anreder said drexel didnt anticipate any further job cuts 
despite a wave of reductions on wall street in the most dramatic 
move industry leader merrill lynch amp co in january announced a 
470 million charge to cover the elimination of some businesses 
the dismissal of some 3000 employees and a consolidation of office 
space 
i think we recognized the cycles a lot sooner than other 
people in the industry anreder said 
drexels equity capital stood at more than 800 million at the 
end of 1989 down from 11 billion a year earlier but up from 
about 750 million late in the year 
part of the reduction in capital reflected the firms withdrawal 
from retail brokerage anreder said drexel boosted capital late in 
the year with contributions from highsalary employees and 
employees should provide another 50 million to 100 million in 
fresh equity capital this year he said

14550 yen 
investors bought dollars in new york after the us labor 
department reported that the nations unemployment rate held steady 
at 53 percent in january

reserve from easing interest rates higher interest rates tend to 
make a countrys currency more attractive to investors 
dealers added however that uncertainty over the situation in 
the soviet union was keeping participants from taking large 
positions 
now the market is looking to whether soviet leader gorbachevs 
position will be consolidated in a meeting of the soviet

points or 005 percent today closing at 3763141 yen

about the direction of currency rates and falling government bond 
prices sent investors to the sidelines causing largecapital 
issues to decline

situation from the sidelines so anxiously that they remained 
reluctant to take part all day said a dealer with nikko 
securities co also speaking on condition of anonymity 
volume traded on the exchanges first section was estimated at 
400 million shares

chrysler corp to market the american manufacturers automobiles in 
japan a honda spokesman said monday 
honda spokesman hitoshi dewa said chrysler suggested the two 
companies set up a joint venture all other details including the 
chrysler models number of sales and distribution channels in japan 
have yet to be finalized dewa said 
nihon keizai shimbun japans largest business journal said 
honda will concentrate on selling 50006000 chrysler jeeps and 
cherokees a year through one of hondas three distribution networks 
in japan the newspaper said an agreement was expected later this

foreign manufacturer dewa said

congressional democrats are gearing up to 
rework the defense domestic and tax priorities in president bushs 
1991 budget but they acknowledge they dare not even tinker with 
the widest gulf between the two sides 
its no secret that the majority democrats in the house and 
senate want to cut defense spending beyond bushs proposal beef up 
favorite domestic programs and change the presidents mix of taxes 
but the differences on those issues amount to just a fraction of 
the gap that separates the white house and democrats on a larger 
question how much deficit reduction will be needed next year 
democrats say the real figure is double the 37 billion bush 
claims is necessary yet they concede they will use the presidents 
number for a simple reason if congress decides that 74 billion in 
savings are needed congress must find them 
without the executive branch congress simply cant assemble 
the political support to make the hard unpopular decisions that 
would have to be made senate budget committee chairman james 
sasser dtenn said last week 
the side that goes for the higher numbers has to come up with 
more spending cuts or taxes says rep charles schumer dny a 
member of the house budget committee its one of the most awful 
political dynamics ive seen 
the white house relying on expectations of a healthy economy 
next year based its 123 trillion budget on the assumption that 
healthy economic growth would shrink the 1991 shortfall to about 
101 billion hence just 37 billion in taxes or savings would be 
needed to reach the 64 billion grammrudman deficit target 
many analysts believe the economy will be less robust that 
means lower revenue collections and they say a 138 billion 
budget gap or 74 billion in savings needed to hit the 64 
billion target 
the reality gulf between the two sides gets wider still the 
democratic staff of the senate budget committee last week claimed 
the presidents budget hid at least 100 billion in legitimate 
budget costs by relying on big lies and budget gimmicks 
these ranged from carrying the federal costs of insolvent 
savings and loans associations off the budget a 50 billion to 
100 billion expense over the next two years to assuming 25 
billion in savings by running the internal revenue service more 
efficiently 
administration officials say they have done nothing misleading 
democrats disagree but will not discount those savings for fear of 
the consequences having to replace them with cuts or taxes 
elsewhere 
going with those higher numbers now would be political 
suicide for the democrats says stanley collender who follows 
the budget process for touche ross and co the accounting firm 
what democrats will focus on is bushs defense proposal he 
wants to spend 3033 billion for military programs next year 
above this years 2963 billion but 26 percent below what is 
needed to stay abreast of inflation democrats say that with the 
easing of cold war tensions those cuts will have to go lower 
perhaps 12 billion to 15 billion less than bushs figure 
weve got to cut more there says sen j james exon 
dneb a member of the senate budget and armed services 
committees but the problem is you get where everybody says 
dont close my base close his base therein lies the problem 
that local pork barrel takes the place of rational decisions 
democrats will be eager to use any defense savings to protect 
domestic programs against cuts proposed by bush 
democratic aides to the house budget committee said friday that 
they had found 46 programs that bush wants to eliminate including 
several student loan programs and subsidies to amtrak the 
passenger railroad fortythree others were targeted for major 
cuts including medicare farm assistance and federal prison 
construction 
majority lawmakers also are likely to try to change bushs plans 
to raise nearly 22 billion next year in new taxes fees and other 
government collections 
their main target is the presidents proposal to cut the capital 
gains tax rate which he insists brings the treasury 49 billion 
i dont see any quick resolutions here house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said friday the 
budget could very well be the focus of confrontation for the next 
few months

the bush administrations hopes of getting the 
federal deficit under control could be on a collision course with 
the federal reserves efforts to get control of inflation many 
economists believe 
the fed has been resisting a variety of signals from the 
administration that it would like to see a more aggressive easing 
of interest rates from the central bank in order to keep the 
economy from dipping into a recession 
private economists said recent comments from federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan leave the unmistakable impression that the 
feds inflationfighting efforts are not about to slacken as a 
result of the administrations comments 
as a result many private economists predict that a variety of 
shortterm business and consumer interest rates are likely to 
remain unchanged over coming weeks including banks prime lending 
rate which stands at 10 percent 
they said mortgage rates which have been rising should 
stabilize although they conceded this forecast depends heavily on 
the financial markets 
the feds main policymaking group composed of fed governors and 
regional fed bank presidents was scheduled to hold closeddoor 
discussions on tuesday and wednesday to set monetary goals for the 
rest of the year 
while the outcome of those deliberations will not be known until 
feb 20 when greenspan testifies to congress many economists 
predict that the central bank will not loosen further and will 
instead adopt a waitandsee attitude 
i think the fed is going to sit on its hands the employment 
and inflation numbers are coming in too high to permit further 
easing said david wyss chief financial forecaster for 
drimcgraw hill 
that could spell bad news for the administration which last 
week sent congress a budget projecting that the federal deficit 
will be slashed in half to 631 billion next year 
that projection was based on an optimistic economic forecast 
which called for growth to be higher and interest rates to be lower 
than many private analysts believe is possible given the feds 
current course 
treasury secretary nicholas brady on friday conceded that the 
administration and fed policymakers dont always see eye to eye he 
said these differences of point of view are openly expressed 
during his weekly meetings with greenspan 
since june the central bank has engaged in a series of small 
credit easing efforts as the fed tried to keep the economy from 
slipping into a recession but last week greenspan told a 
congressional committee he believed the chance of an imminent 
recession had diminished markedly since last spring and the current 
slowdown is likely to turn out to be only a temporary 
hesitation 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co said 
greenspans comment showed that the fed was willing to risk lower 
growth because of renewed concerns about the need to lower the 
inflation rate which last year jumped to a sevenyear high of 46 
percent 
the central bank is toughing it out letting economic growth 
dip quite low in an effort to get inflation down sinai said 
lyle gramley a former fed governor and now chief economist for 
the mortgage bankers association said the central bank also is 
being forced to keep an eye on the turbulence in financial markets 
especially the bond market where interest rates have been rising 
out of fears that foreign investors may be abandoning the american 
market in favor of higher returns overseas 
even if the fed wanted to ease they could hardly do so with 
sentiment in the bond market so sour any easing could well be 
counterproductive sending interest rates up and not down 
gramley said 
mortgage rates have been headed higher in recent weeks now at 
1017 percent the highest level since early september according 
to a nationwide survey by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
rates dipped to 969 percent in late december

the chevrolet corvette has the highest 
death rate in crashes while a fourdoor volvo has the lowest 
according to a study released today 
the study shows that 52 drivers and passengers die in car 
wrecks for every 10000 198587 corvettes registered in the united 
states it also found the volvo 740760 fourdoor had the lowest 
rate 06 deaths per 10000 vehicles 
the figures from the insurance institute for highway safety were 
released by the michigan association of professional insurance 
agents 
without question the consumer has a better chance of survival 
when driving a larger vehicle said james alexander president of 
the michigan association 
of the 10 vehicles with the lowest death rates three were 
large six were midsize and only one was a small car the 
volkswagen jetta with 11 deaths per 10000 vehicles 
twelve of the 15 cars with the highest death rates are small 
and the other three are midsize several including the corvette at 
the top of the list are highperformance cars 
gary mitchell a spokesman for the association said while the 
auto industry was making more small fuelefficient cars they 
werent as safe as the larger models 
what weve seen in recent years is that the industry has 
placed such a great emphasis on fuel economy that safety has been 
compromised he said theyre lighter so theyre more fuel 
efficient and thats commendable but i dont think fuel efficiency 
should take a front seat over safety 
highperformance cars tend to have higher death rates because of 
the type of drivers they attract mitchell said 
the study shows theres a direct correlation between high 
performance sports models and a higher accident death rate he 
said the corvette camaro mustang firebird and dodge daytona 
were all in the top 10 in terms of highest overall death rate 
the average driver in those cars is a man under 30 years 
old he said industry figures show there cars with a higher 
percentage of female drivers tend to have lower death rates 
theres a direct correlation 
debra barclay a spokeswoman for the washington dcbased 
center for auto safety agreed the the studys finding that smaller 
cars were less safe but said that doesnt have to be the case 
we have continued to say that you can make fuel efficient cars 
that are safe the technology is available its not being used to 
the extent that it can be she said 
with airbags consumers have to pay a few extra hundred 
dollars but they get an opportunity to save their life people are 
thrilled to have that choice she said 
barclay added that at least 14 insurance companies were offering 
discounts to customers who buy cars equipped with airbags 
mitchell and barclay also said congress should toughen safety 
standards for smaller cars 
the national highway traffic safety administration declined to 
comment on the study

the number of working us oil and gas rigs 
continued to decline this week dropping by six to 931 baker 
hughes inc reported 
but the number of working rigs still was higher than the 780 
total posted for the same week last year baker hughes said monday 
in the two previous weeks the count plunged by 55 and then 27 
to 937 experts blamed the decline on bad weather in some states 
and a general seasonal decline 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of 
producing wells 
ike kerridge a baker hughes vice president and economist said 
the rig count generally declines during the first quarter the 
count probably will bottom out in march or april he said 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oil producing states pennsylvania had the greatest 
weekly plunge having lost six rigs while new mexico lost five 
kansas lost three north dakota lost two and oklahoma and wyoming 
each lost one 
texas had the largest gain with seven while louisiana added 
four colorado increased by three and california gained two 
the number of working rigs in both michigan and ohio were 
unchanged for the week

congress is expected this week to start 
working out differences in oil spill liability legislation so it 
can send a bill to president bush by the march 24 anniversary of 
the exxon valdez accident 
the biggest remaining problem is a dispute over whether tankers 
should be required to have double hulls and double bottoms 
the legislation 15 years in the making would set 
comprehensive requirements for financing and managing oil spill 
cleanups the issue was thrust to the forefront last year by the 
exxon valdez disaster 
the tanker which did not have a double hull or double bottom 
dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil into prince william sound 
alaska when it ran aground 
staff members say the house wants the legislation ready for the 
presidents signature by the valdez accident anniversary the 
senate already has chosen its members for the conference committee 
while the house is expected to announce conference committee 
members on wednesday or thursday 
the house bill would put oil into the hazardous material 
category by requiring that tankers calling on us ports with 
petroleum products like those carrying other dangerous substances 
have double bottoms within seven years and double hulls within 15 
years of the bills enactment all new tankers constructed in the 
united states would have to be built with double hulls such 
requirements already exist for tankers carrying other hazardous 
materials 
the senate version calls for a study to determine if any other 
technology would give better protection against spills 
people have argued this thing over the years and nobody can 
really say precisely what would happen if a double hull or double 
bottom vessel was grounded said joe lastelic spokesman for the 
american petroleum institute which opposes that provision 
a doublebottomed ship could be more difficult to salvage 
because water could accumulate between the two bottoms and cause 
the ship to sink or capsize faster he said there also is concern 
that vapors would accumulate between the two layers in an accident 
and cause an explosion he added 
international shippers lobbied against such a requirement since 
it would mean foreign tankers would have to be refitted to do 
business in american ports 
the white house also opposes the provision 
rep dean gallo rnj plans to offer a motion to instruct 
house conferees to support the hullbottom requirement when they 
meet with the senate the motion would be nonbinding but it would 
lead to a house roll call vote and give congressional negotiators a 
sense of how strongly the house feels about the provision 
environmental groups like the national wildlife federation and 
the sierra club are lobbying in favor of double hulls and double 
bottoms 
in past congressional sessions the housesenate dispute has 
centered on whether states should be allowed to enact stricter 
liability laws than the federal government the senate favored such 
a provision while the house was opposed 
many house members put up a fight over the issue again last 
year but eventually the states rights faction won 
twentyeight states have their own oil spill liability statutes 
and 19 require unlimited liability for the oil companies or 
carriers to clean up damage to the environment 
the oil industry wants a federal law that would preempt the 
state laws and set limits on the amount a company would have to pay 
for cleanup saying insurance costs could put reputable shippers 
out of business

mexico and its commercial bank creditors 
signed a debt reduction agreement that was praised as an example 
for other indebted nations and the result of the governments 
economic reforms 
mexico stands as a beacon of hope for other debtor nations 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady said at sundays signing 
ceremony 
brady laid the groundwork for the agreement a year ago by 
offering debt forgiveness in exchange for economic reforms in 
developing countries previously banks had managed the debt crisis 
mainly by lending countries money to cover their interest payments 
a process that merely increased the total debt burden 
it is very important to have the first transaction completed 
but we do see it as only the beginning brady said 
mexicos agreement will cut the countrys 485 billion bank 
debt by a little more than 7 billion and reduce annual interest 
payments by about 16 billion mexico estimates the full impact of 
the agreement will save it more than 4 billion a year 
the renegotiation of the debt is sufficient for mexico and 
will lead to growth and better living conditions for mexicans 
president carlos salinas de gortari said 
salinas said faster growth is a social imperative to respond 
to the demands of the more than 85 million mexicans of today and 
the 10 million more who are expected to swell the nations 
population during the remainder of his sixyear term 
opposition leaders criticized the agreement predicting it would 
bring even greater austerity and hardship to the majority of 
mexicans 
its not a solution in the end cuauhtemoc cardenas leader 
of the leftist revolutionary democratic party said adding that it 
will lead to a prolonged period of austerity for mexicos lower 
income wage earners 
treasury secretary pedro aspe said the countrys total debt 
including loans from governments will total 936 billion after 
the accord that is the second highest in the developing world 
after brazils 114 billion 
officials of the 15 banks that negotiated the agreement on 
behalf of mexicos 450 creditor banks signed the accord in the 
ceremony at the national palace the other banks will sign in new 
york 
salinas took office dec 1 1988 six years into an economic 
crisis provoked by overborrowing and plunging prices for crude oil 
the countrys main export 
in a sweeping program to reform the heavilyprotected economy 
salinas has opened the country to competition from imports 
encouraged foreign and domestic investment begun selling a wide 
array of stateowned companies to the private sector and started 
slashing subsidies 
under the agreement banks could choose from three options 
reducing the principal amount of their loans by 35 percent 
reducing interest to a fixed rate of 625 percent or offering new 
loans equal to 25 percent of the debt they already held 
banks opted to reduce principal on 20 billion of the debt 
reduce interest on a further 225 billion and extend new loans for 
6 billion in existing debt 
the banks that chose the first two options will exchange their 
debt for mexican government bonds backed by us treasury bonds 
mexico will buy the us bonds as collateral with a 7 billion 
package of credits from multilateral agencies and japan as well as 
the mexican governments own funds 
aspe said the agreement will save mexico an average 41 billion 
annually in net transfers abroad in the next four years the figure 
includes 16 billion in reduced interest payments an average 
influx of 288 million a year in new credits and the deferment of 
prinicpal payments of 22 billion a year 
the country has been paying about 12 billion a year in interest 
and principal 
the agreement will serve as an example for the other countries 
affected by the problem of debt said michel camdessus director 
of the international monetary fund which is lending money to 
mexico as part of the agreement 
other countries in line for brady plan renegotiations have not 
made as drastic reforms as mexico venezuela has begun a program 
but renegotiations of about 21 billion of its 346 billion 
foreign debt have made little headway 
argentina which owes about 64 billion to commercial banks is 
in a very difficult situation but president carlos menem has 
said he will undertake reforms brady said 
brazil was 44 billion behind in interest payments to private 
foreign creditors in december and argentina has about 4 billion in 
interest overdue brazil is refusing to pay saying it wants 
presidentelect fernando collor de mello to assume office in march 
with a safe level of reserves 
cardenas said that if mexico had joined other debtor nations to 
negotiate in a block a real attitude of responsibility would 
have been obtained from the creditor banks

meeting monday and tuesday to debate gorbachevs proposal

daimlerbenz ag said monday it 
has broken off talks with a consortium of several west german 
engineering companies about the sale of its navy and missile 
technology lines 
the sale is required as part of a government agreement that 
allowed daimlerbenz to take over the aerospace concern 
messerschmittboelkerblohm gmbh it was the largest merger in west 
german history 
daimlerbenz said its deutsche aerospace ag aircraft and defense 
subsidiary has ended negotiations with systemtechnik nord a group 
of companies led by the steel and machinery company fried krupp 
gmbh 
in november daimlerbenz signed a memorandum of understanding 
with systemtechnik nord to sell the navy and missile activities 
the consortium was formed under pressure from the governments of 
hamburg and bremen where most of the navy and missile operations 
are located to prevent a loss of jobs 
a spokesman for deutsche aerospace said the company has gained 
the impression that not all partners of the consortium intend to 
stick to the memorandum of understanding he did not elaborate 
but the spokesman did not rule out an agreement with the group 
once the talks have been put on a new basis 
besides krupp which holds 35 percent of systemtechnik nord 
preussagsalzgitter and bremer vulkan own 30 percent each while 
matra sa of france and two smaller shipbuilding companies have a 
joint 5 percent 
under the terms set by economics minister helmut haussmann last 
september daimlerbenz has two years to sell the two divisions 
hausmann approved the merger against the recommendation of the 
federal cartel office and strong political forces but set certain 
conditions to help maintain competition in the nations defense 
industry 
the purchase of mbb made daimlerbenz the countrys largest 
aerospace and defense company daimlerbenz also makes 
mercedesbenz automobiles 
a spokesman for the city government of bremen said daimlerbenz 
and the consortium have not agreed on the price of the transaction

schlumberger ltds fourthquarter net income 
slipped to 1181 million or 50 cents a share from 1189 
million or 49 cents a share a year earlier the company said 
monday 
revenue in the threemonth period totaled 12 billion down 
about 3 percent from 124 billion in the comparable 1988 period 
for the year the new yorkbased oil drilling and oilfield 
service company had net income of 4415 million or 186 a share 
down from 4762 million or 180 a share in 1988 revenue 
totaled 47 billion down about 5 percent from 49 billion in the 
previous year 
schlumberger said the previous years stock buyback reduced the 
companys interest income in 1989 
decreased interest income of 63 million primarily resulted 
from spending 12 billion in 1988 to repurchase 345 million 
shares said chairman euan baird 
the increase in earnings per share on lower income also was the 
result of fewer average shares outstanding baird said 
higher oil prices in late 1989 helped the companys oilfield 
businesses recover from a slump in 1988 he said

with prices extending the days gains in the final hour of trading 
but activity overall was relatively subdued as worries about 
rising interest rates tended to restrain the advance 
the stock market has labored for much of this year under the 
weight of lackluster corporate earnings reports and rising interest 
rates 
interest rates have been rising in recent days in anticipation 
of this weeks government auction of 30 billion in new securities 
higher rates make yields on shortterm securities more

sears roebuck and co on monday reported its 
fourthquarter earnings rose sharply from a year earlier when it 
undertook a costly restructuring and said hurricane hugo and the 
bay quake made 1989 the costliest year ever for its allstate 
insurance subsidiary 
results from sears merchandise group its biggest business 
rose sharply in a performance that several retailing analysts said 
was better than they had expected 
sears reported net income of 6021 million or 176 per common 
share for the three months ended dec 31 compared with 1174 
million or 32 cents per share for the same period a year earlier 
sales for the quarter rose 42 percent to 152 billion from 
146 billion chicagobased sears said in a statement 
results for the fourth quarter of 1988 included an aftertax 
charge of 442 million for restructuring of the companys retailing 
business and a loss of 789 million from the sale of allstate 
insurance cos life and health insurance operations 
for all of 1989 sears reported net income of 151 billion or 
430 per share compared with 145 billion or 384 per share 
in 1988 annual revenue rose 71 percent to a record 538 billion 
from 503 billion in 1988 sears said 
the company is wellpositioned as it enters the 1990s and we 
expect momentum to build as the year progresses chairman edward 
a brennan said in a statement accompanying the earnings 
last year sears overhauled its retailing operation the worlds 
largest by cutting costs and introducing everyday low pricing 
in hopes of reversing slippage in its market share to both general 
merchandise discounters such as k mart and walmart and to 
superstores specializing in appliances electronics or 
automotive products 
the effectiveness of the strategy has been questioned since its 
debut last march but analysts said the fourthquarter results 
indicated the retailing unit may be shaping up after a shakeout 
the merchandise group reported fourthquarter income of 3686 
million on sales of 96 billion compared with a loss of 1135 
million on sales of 95 billion in 1988 the 1988 period included 
a 442 million aftertax restructuring charge 
the fourth quarter 1989 results included a 26 million aftertax 
gain from an accounting change compared with a 264 million 
aftertax charge in 1988 for the same accounting change 
generally speaking they are making progress said retail 
analyst monroe greenstein of the investment firm bear stearns amp 
co 
he said the merchandise unit was getting a better grip on 
expenses and that its gross profit margin was wider than many 
observers had expected due partly to the mix of goods sears is 
offering 
retail analyst edward weller of montgomery securities inc also 
said the results of the merchandise group were better than he had 
expected 
allstate reported fourthquarter income of 2454 million on 
revenue of 42 billion compared with 2063 million on revenue of 
38 billion in fourth quarter 1988 
sears said natural disasters last year including hurricane 
hugo the northern california quake and severe cold weather in the 
south resulted in historically high catastrophic damage claims 
against allstate but would not reveal the dollar amount of the 
claims 
sears earlier had pegged claims stemming from hurricane hugo 
alone at more than 250 million 
the dean witter financial services group reported fourthquarter 
income of 484 million on revenue of 11 billion compared with 
operating profit of 263 million on revenue of 9587 million a 
year earlier 
the coldwell banker real estate group reported fourthquarter 
income of 153 million on revenue of 3626 million compared with 
income of 619 million on revenue of 3774 million a year earlier

pleaded guilty monday to illegally obtaining classified pentagon 
planning documents and agreed to pay 25 million to settle charges 
in the continuing probe of contractors trading defense secrets 
rca corp pleaded guilty in us district court to two felony 
counts of conveying without authority two secret editions of a 
pentagon fiveyear spending program 
a current rca marketing official and a former one also pleaded 
guilty to felony counts of unlawfully conveying the secret 
documents they obtained from other defense firms to other people in 
rca the two face possible 10year prison sentences 
rcas guilty plea marked an acceleration in the governments 
contining investigation dubbed operation uncover 
nearly three months ago boeing co admitted it had illegally 
obtained defense department budget documents and paid 52 million 
in fines and restitution 
former boeing employee richard lee fowler was sentenced last 
month to two years in prison for obtaining more than 100 secret 
pentagon documents and passing them along to boeing and other 
contractors 
in pleading guilty rca conceded to a statement of facts filed 
by prosecutors that it had acquired a wide array of secret pentagon 
planning budget documents between 1978 and 1985 from other defense 
contractors 
these included copies of authoritative statements of overall 
defense policy and program memoranda that detailed weaponsystem 
priorities for the army the air force and the navy according to 
the prosecution filing 
us district judge james c cacheris fined the company 20000 
rca which was bought by ge in 1986 also agreed to pay the 
government 248 million to settle civil claims 
rca admitted in one count that on dec 19 1983 marketing 
official leonard c kampf provided a fiveyear planning document 
that contained details of the pentagons fiscal 1985 budget 
in the second count it admitted obtaining on nov 28 1984 a 
fiveyear defense program document containing details for the 
fiscal 1986 budget from ronald b stevens 
kampf 69 who left the company in 1984 and stevens 49 
manager of marketing services at rcas government systems division

investigation 
they obtained the documents from employees of other defense 
firms according to the governments filing 
according to court papers kampf obtained documents from philip 
r jackson rcas marketing representative in washington 
jackson who has received immunity from prosecution in return 
for his cooperation testified at fowlers trial that he received 
20 documents from fowler 
the probe of major defense firms is continuing said michael 
costello who heads the investigation for the pentagons inspector 
general costello declined to identify those companies specifically 
under investigation

fowler trial to be part of a ring of companies that swapped secret 
pentagon documents the others named in testimony were honeywell 
bendix ibm grumman raytheon rockwell and martin marietta 
ge spokesman george jamison said stevens has been suspended from 
his job 
ge said in a statement from its fairfield conn headquartgrs 
that rca a whollyowned subsidiary agreed to enter the guilty 
plea after learning that kampf and stevens had planned to plead 
guilty 
this unfortunate chapter in rca history is now closed ge 
said in its statement jamison stressed that the allegations 
centered on rca there have never been any allegations about ge 
with regard to this he said 
rcas guilty plea came just three days after ge was convicted in 
philadelphia of bilking the pentagon out of 10 million for a 
battlefield computer system 
ge the nations thirdlargest defense contractor could be 
fined up to 719 million and faces possible suspension from future 
contracts

ltv corps profit fell 24 percent in the fourth 
quarter due partly to a slump in the domestic steel industry and 
depressed results in its commercial aerospace programs the company 
said monday 
ltv currently operating under bankruptcy court supervision 
said that for the three months ended dec 31 net income was 723 
million or 50 cents a share down from 953 million or 67 cents 
in the same 1988 quarter revenue declined about 6 percent to 158 
billion from 167 billion 
the defense and energy company attributed the lower sales to 
reductions in military aircraft programs and fewer deliveries of 
ltvs multiple launch rocket system 
ltv said higher costs for raw materials and services had a 
negative impact on its steel businesses an increase in steel 
export volume was partially offset by a slumping automotive market 
the company said 
lower demand also helped reduce overall steel plant operating 
capacity to 76 percent in the quarter compared with 87 percent a 
year earlier 
for the year ltv earned 2649 million or 182 a share a 
sharp reversal from 1988 when the company lost 315 billion or 
3094 a share sales totaled 636 billion a 13 percent drop from 
73 billion in the previous year 
the loss included a 135 billion charge related to the 
companys chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and a onetime 226 billion 
noncash charge to reflect a change in the way the company accounts 
for pension benefits 
last years earnings included a 30 million write down of costs 
associated with the companys cancellation of plans to build a 
flexible composites center to make advanced aircraft components 
ltv which completed the sale its warren ohio steel bar 
manufacturing plant in november said exclusion of those results 
for 1989 accounted for a 71 million decline in 1989 operating 
income and for an 872 million decline in the steel groups sales 
for the year 
the divestiture is part of ltvs plan to reorganize into a more 
streamlined company before emerging from bankruptcy 
ltv said its results also benefited from the deferral of 
interest pension and other costs while the company operates under 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection

legislation to temporarily block companies 
from terminating employee pension funds for the purpose of gaining 
access to surplus assets was proposed monday in the senate 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan introduced the bill saying an 
18month moratorium was needed to give congress time to review 
pension fund changes that affect the lives and retirement 
security of millions of americans 
at issue is a pratice known as reversions in which 
companies terminate overfunded pension plans establish a new 
retirement program often through annunities with insurance 
companies and take surplus cash for their own use 
surplus pension assets have become a popular target for 
corporate raiders who acquire a company and use its retirement 
programs as a source of cash for other purposes since 1980 
according to a senate committee at least 2000 pension funds have 
been terminated to provide corporate owners with access to 20 
billion in surplus assets 
i tend to believe that pension fund surpluses belong right 
where they are in the pension fund kassebaum said in a speech 
on the senate floor 
terminating these funds and stripping out the surplus is but 
one more way to realize shortterm gain at potentially longterm 
cost 
the legislation would block only those terminations in which 
companies seek to use assets of a retirement fund for nonpension 
purposes a company could cash in a pension plan to create a new 
retirement program with better benefits and to make lump sum 
payments to workers with accumulated benefits of less than 3500 
kassebaum introduced the legislation in response to what critics 
called a junk pensions proposal involving the coleman co 
the kansasbased manufacturer of outdoor recreation equipment 
was acquired last year by macandrews amp forbes holdings inc which 
is controlled by takeover specialist ronald o perelman 
macandrews amp forbes had proposed terminating two coleman 
retirement funds valued at 83 million and investing the monies in 
annunities with an insurance company with a large share of its 
assets in highrisk junk bonds under the proposal macandrews 
amp forbes would be able to take more than 32 million in surplus 
cash for its own use 
in response to complaints about the proposal macandrews amp 
forbes announced last week that it would revamp the proposal and 
buy annunities only from a company with the highest financial 
ratings 
also monday rep dan glickman dkan introduced legislation 
in the house to provide more protections for pension benefits when 
federally insured retirement funds are terminated

the courtappointed bankruptcy examiner overseeing 
eastern airlines said monday he will fight liquidation of the 
carrier and called on creditors and management to start looking for 
compromises 
the comments by examiner david shapiro were contained in a 
statement announcing court approval of a 105 million ticket refund 
program for passengers and travel agents 
shapiro said it is totally irresponsible to presume 
liquidation or sale are the only alternatives for the miamibased 
airline which he termed eminently reorganizable 
theres got to be some give and take on both sides said 
shapiro from his washington dc office if the parties put the 
public interest first and their own selfish interests second then 
eastern is a viable airline 
recently rumors have circulated that texas air corp chairman 
frank lorenzo easterns owner would opt for a chapter 7 
liquidation 
the ticket refund program approved monday would cover 
ticketholders and travel agents who made purchases since eastern 
filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization last march 9 those 
who bought tickets issued before the filing remain under bankruptcy 
court jurisdiction 
meanwhile eastern has agreed to hire back 215 flight attendants 
by april 1 in a backtowork accord in which the union agreed to 
drop a lawsuit challenging the jobs of 215 recruits hired during 
the strike 
both sides had to compromise but this was something we could 
live with said mary jane barry president of local 553 of the 
transport workers union which represents flight attendants at 
eastern 
the union walked out march 4 in sympathy with the machinists 
union which remains on strike the flight attendants called off 
their strike on nov 23 
ms barry said terms of the agreement with eastern were 
described in a letter sent friday to the carriers flight 
attendants 
under the accord the union agreed to drop a lawsuit challenging 
the jobs of 215 recruits who were in training when the flight 
attendants strike ended in exchange for eastern rehiring 215 
senior attendants by april 1 
also under the agreement 
eastern agreed the union will continue to represent all eastern 
flight attendants and that all future hiring will come from a 
seniority list 
eastern will turn over to the union some 340000 in dues 
collected from flight attendants working since the strike began 
the union will drop around 215000 in claims from a 
longstanding dispute over pay to union representatives while on 
union business 
of the 3600 flight attendants now working for eastern about 
half were hired after the strike began the others are veterans who 
crossed the picket lines 
the union and eastern still must agree on a new contract to 
replace the previous one which expired in 1988 
ms barry refused to comment on whether the agreement marked any 
change in the hostility between eastern and its unions but she 
said the contract talks will mark the real test of whether we can 
get anywhere 
eastern vice president j michael jones said eastern was pleased 
with the agreement 
we are delighted to have reached a settlement that protects 
the jobs of those who assisted in the rebuilding of eastern he 
said in a letter 
negotiations are continuing with the pilots union which ended 
its sympathy walkout just before the flight attendants 
because of easterns downsizing as it strives to emerge from 
chapter 11 the number of former strikers who will get their jobs 
back is in doubt 
the company blackmailed the flight attendants said frank 
ortis president of the machinists local there are still 3000 
of them out of work and it looks like they are pretty well broke

rjr nabisco holdings corp on monday reported 
losses for the fourth quarter and all of 1989 reflecting the cost 
of its record 245 billion buyout by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
a year ago 
the consumer products giant the former rjr nabisco inc that 
was taken private in a deal finalized in february 1989 said it 
lost 144 million during the three months ended dec 31 compared 
with a 411 million profit in the 1988 quarter 
quarterly sales totaled 354 billion unchanged from a year ago 
for the year rjr nabisco lost 115 billion and had sales of 
1276 billion that compared with a 14 billion profit the 
previous year on 1264 billion in sales 
rjr nabisco blamed the negative results on significantly higher 
net interest expenses its decision to eliminate excess tobacco 
trade inventories and costs related to the kkr acquisition 
despite the losses which were expected chairman louis v 
gerstner jr said the company was making fundamental improvements 
and had steady operating results in its tobacco and food units 
our tobacco and food businesses exceeded their goals despite 
the extraordinary organizational changes and restructuring we 
undertook to strengthen the companys longterm prospects 
gerstner said in a statement were off to a very strong start 
he said the company has substantially completed a divestiture 
program spurred by the buyout that has allowed it to repay about 5 
billion of the debt it took on in the transaction 
the company said annual cash flow from operations totaled 647 
million after interest payments exceeding initial expectations 
the strength of the companys business and in turn its cash 
flow is crucial for the success of the buyout which was 
accomplished partly through the sale of 4 billion in highyield 
highrisk junk bonds 
interest and debt expenses shot up to 338 billion in 1989 from 
549 million the previous year 
rjr nabiscos bonds have fallen sharply in recent days after 
moodys investors service inc lowered its rating of the companys 
debt and that could mean higher future borrowing costs 
moodys said it downgraded the debt due to uncertainties about 
the cash flow of rjr nabiscos tobacco business over the long term 
as the company faces the problem of fewer smokers and possibly 
lower profits in the years ahead 
for the full year the companys worldwide tobacco businesses 
had sales of 698 billion a slight drop from 707 bilion in 
sales in 1988 but excluding the impact of required 
acquisitionrelated accounting adjustments and the trade inventory 
decision sales would have been up 27 percent the company said 
food businesses reported 1989 sales of 578 billion up 4 
percent from 557 billion in 1988 the gains occurred despite 
record expenses for marketing research and development of new 
products the company said 
rjr nabiscos products include oreo cookies ritz crackers and 
winston cigarettes 
its major subsidiaries are rj reynolds tobacco co rj 
reynolds tobacco international inc nabisco brands inc and

the bank of japan has probed life insurance 
companies securities firms and other institutional investors to 
guage their interest in buying us treasury bonds being auctioned 
this week news reports said tuesday 
the nihon keizai shimbun japans premier financial journal 
reported that the countrys central bank asked investors whether 
their investing stance had changed since the previous auction of 
us government securities late last year 
the report said some institutions viewed the banks inquiry as 
informal pressure on investors to continue buying us bonds 
it reflects how the bank of japan is concerned about the 
outcome of the auctions its a virtual request for us to purchase 
the us bonds actively kyodo news service quoted an official 
from a life insurance company as saying 
but takashi watanabe a spokesman for the bank of japan said 
the reports were groundless 
from tuesday through thursday the us federal reserve will 
auction 30 billion of three 10 and 30year securities 
in recent years japanese investors are estimated to have 
purchased as much as one third of all us bonds auctioned if they 
dont bid actively for us bonds at this weeks auctions that 
could force american interests rates up and put the brakes on the 
economy 
kyodo reported that officials at some life insurance companies 
called the queries unusual because bank of japan officials 
directly visited investors to solicit their responses 
fears of higher inflation and political uncertainties have 
driven japanese interest rates up sharply in recent months 
as a result japanese rates now are closer to us interest 
rates than they have been in years that fact has raised concerns 
in the us that japanese investors will no longer find us bonds 
as attractive as in the past 
on wednesday bank of japan governor yasushi mieno will leave 
tokyo for washington to confer with us monetary authorities

joseph hazelwood was in a bar for seven 
hours ordering glasses of vodka the day before his tanker exxon 
valdez caused the nations worst oil spill and he left the bridge 
before a tricky part of the voyage a prosecutor said monday 
but a defense attorney for hazelwood told jurors the skippers 
judgment was never impaired that he showed no signs of drunkenness 
and was calm cool and collected as a captain should be 
throughout the night and day of the accident 
assistant district attorney brent cole accused the fired exxon 
captain of leaving control of his ship in the hands of 
inexperienced crewmembers who were not certified to pilot the 
vessel through treacherous prince william sound where the tanker 
ripped its hull open on a reef outside normal shipping channels 
the ultimate responsibility for the tanker is with the 
captain cole said in his opening statement at hazelwoods trial 
the most dangerous part of the journey was after hazelwood 
absented himself from the bridge 
defense attorney dick madson however told jurors that 
hazelwood left the ship in the hands of qualifed crewmen who may 
not have had the proper licenses but knew the territory and took 
appropriate actions when it appeared the exxon valdez was in 
trouble 
cole also alleged that the 43yearold captain responded wrongly 
after the march 24 1989 accident frantically trying to move the 
ship off the rocks a maneuver which he said hazelwood later 
admitted was the wrong thing to do 
madson insisted that hazelwood never put the ship in reverse and 
did not try to move it off the rocks he insisted that hazelwood 
actually was trying to stabilize the ship on the reef in an effort 
to prevent further damage 
cole said that if hazelwood had succeeded in moving the ship it 
would have capsized spilling all of its oil he noted that at 
least some of the tankers cargo of alaska crude oil was saved 
although nearly 11 million gallons spilled killing wildlife and 
blackening miles of rocky shoreline 
exxon has said it has spent 2 billion on the cleanup some 
state officials say the work is not over and should continue this 
spring and summer 
hazelwood is charged with a felony charge of criminal mischief 
and misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment negligent 
discharge of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated maximum 
penalty for conviction on all counts is seven years three months 
in prison and 61000 in fines 
cole said that by the time the coast guard reached the tanker 
officers could see the extent of the disaster 
they could see the oil bubbling out of the tanker by some 
descriptions it was 12 to 15 inches thick he recounted 
cole reconstructed hazelwoods actions during the day before the 
ship left the oil terminal at valdez alleging the captain spent 
some seven hours in a bar called the pipeline club where patrons 
saw him ordering glasses of vodka 
when he returned to the ship cole said other crewmembers saw 
that he was intoxicated and one of them smelled liquor on his 
breath 
madson said he would dispute that hazelwood spent the day 
drinking before he boarded the ship although he conceded the 
captain had one or two drinks about four hours before he returned 
to the tanker 
hazelwoods attorney said the captain was in control throughout 
the ordeal 
he did not stagger he did not slur his words he was cool 
calm and collected as a captain should be madson said 
many hours after the accident the prosecutor said two 
investigators arrived and found hazelwood sitting off in a corner 
by himself 
it became apparent to both of them that captain hazelwood had 
been drinking both of them asked each other did you smell what i 
smelled and they both said yes 
by the time a state trooper arrived to investigate cole said 
the man was told they had a wild man on board 
later in the day the ships pilot william e murphy testified 
that he had lunch with hazelwood and two other crewmembers on the 
day they stopped in valdez to pick up their cargo of oil he said 
hazelwood drank iced tea and that afterward murphy dropped him off 
near the pipeline club 
about eight hours later they met again on the bridge of the 
exxon valdez murphy said 
while on the bridge did you notice any signs that he had been 
drinking asked cole 
no said murphy except i smelled something i associated 
with alcohol on his breath 
within a half hour he said hazelwood had left the bridge 
disappearing for about an hour 
its not unusual for masters to leave the bridge said 
murphy it wasnt typical to be gone for that long in the 
narrows 
would you have rather had him there asked cole 
yes murphy said 
murphy acknowledged he is testifying under a grant of immunity 
from prosecution an agreement reached at the request of his 
attorney 
murphy was not on board the tanker when it ran aground at the 
time pilots local boat handlers familiar with coastal waters 
were required to guide outbound ships to a point just short of 
bligh reef the rules since have been changed to require pilots to 
remain on board past the reef

newspaper subscription lists are depreciable 
assets attorneys for a newspaper company argued monday in a case 
that could affect how publications pay their taxes 
lawyers made opening statements in a lawsuit brought by the 
morning ledger co a newhouse family company that owns the 
starledger of newark 
morning ledger sued the internal revenue service after the 
agency refused to allow the company to depreciate subscriber lists 
for eight michigan papers it acquired in 1987 the company would 
decrease its taxable income by depreciating the lists 
morning ledger paid 305 million for the papers which had a 
combined circulation of 460000 the companys lawyers said 
the issue in this case is whether the morning ledger can 
depreciate for tax purposes certain assets of its business and 
those are the paid subscribers of the booth newspapers as of may 
31st 1977 said an attorney for morning ledger albert turkus 
the case is being heard by us district judge h lee sarokin in 
a nonjury trial 
subscriber lists can be treated like tangible and hence 
depreciable assets because they are used in the taxpayers 
business for a limited period of time and because they have 
ascertainable values separate and apart from goodwill said 
turkus 
but countered a government attorney the company has no 
proprietary interest in the subscribers 
these are atwill paying customers said gregory hrebiniak 
a lawyer with the justice departments tax division 
if the newspaper company is given the depreciation allowance 
any concern with paying customers could claim depreciation if they 
isolate some and say they have a limited useful life he said 
a paper and its subscribers have a customer business 
relationship just as if they were selling peas 
the michigan newspapers involved formerly known as the booth 
newspapers are the ann arbor news bay city times flint journal 
grand rapids press jackson citizen jackson citizen patriot 
kalamazoo gazette muskegon chronicle and saginaw news 
the trial is expected to end late this week

european community countries failed to 
agree monday on a proposal to japan over the contentious issue of 
phasing out restrictions on auto imports officials said 
foreign ministers of the 12 ec nations met here to discuss the 
issue together with other foreign trade and policy problems 
a spokesman for the european commission the communitys 
executive body said the discussions were encouraging and an 
undertstanding was found among all parties that a compromise must 
be reached 
the foreign ministers have widely diverging views on the 
troublesome issue some carproducing countries like france italy 
and spain have strict limitations on japanese cars imports and 
want them maintained others like west germany and britain have 
taken a more liberal attitude 
the european commission recently proposed abolishing national 
import quotas imposed by some countries and replacing them with a 
communitywide quota over a transitional period leading eventually 
to the elimination of all import restrictions 
the spokesman who requested anonymity said countries disagreed 
on the length of the transitional period countries suggested 
maintaining quotas for periods ranging from three to 10 years he 
said 
the community wants to do away with the quotas as part of 
efforts to create a single european market by the end of 1992 by 
that date the 12 nations have agreed to get rid of the many trade 
barriers preventing the free flow of money people goods and 
services 
the ec would represent the worlds single largest market for 
cars while japan is the worlds biggest auto exporter 
frans andriessen the ec official in charge of negotiating with 
japan asked the ministers for a clear position on the transitional 
period and import restrictions 
the countries have not yet agreed on whether trade negotiations 
with japan should be limited to cars or expanded to wideranging 
discussions the spokesman said the commission was in favor of a 
broad discussion 
andriessen told the ministers that japan has a trade strategy 
with the common market but the community has none in return 
the foreign ministers will resume their discussions on japanese 
cars in march a meeting with japanese officials is scheduled in 
june
