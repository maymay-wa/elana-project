terry mulholland of philadelphia phillies 
pitched the eighth nohitter of the baseball season wednesday 
night the most ever by major league pitchers in one year 
his performance sealed in the ninth inning when third baseman 
charlie hayes caught a line drive by pinch hitter gary carter 
lifted the phillies to a 60 defeat of the san francisco giants 
the seasons eighth nohitter surpassed the modern record of 
seven set in 1917 and 1908 
mulholland 76 struck out eight and walked none in making 
baseball history against the team that traded him to philadelphia 
last season 
only one batter reached base against mulholland rick parker 
reached first base on hayes throwing error to lead off the seventh 
inning but was erased on a double play 
it seemed only natural that the record would be surpassed in a 
season already becoming known as the year of the nohitter 
the nohit parade started on april 11 when the california 
angels mark langston and mike witt combined to beat seattle randy 
johnson then pitched the first nohitter in seattle history 
beating detroit on june 2 
nolan ryan of the texas rangers pitched his unprecedented sixth 
nohitter to beat the oakland as on june 11 oaklands dave 
stewart and the los angeles dodgers fernando valenzuela made 
another bit of history on june 29 by pitching nohitters on the 
same day different leagues 
less than 24 hours later andy hawkins of the new york yankees 
pitched a nohitter against the chicago white sox but lost 40 
on july 12 the sox melido perez pitched the recordtying 
seventh nohitter of the season a rainshortened sixinning 
victory at yankee stadium

a judge on wednesday appointed guardians for a 
leukemiastricken boy and his two young halfsiblings whom the 
sick boys father wants tested as potential bonemarrow donors 
but the illinois supreme court later stayed any action by the 
guardians until it reconsiders its original order that they be 
appointed 
the high court gave no indication when it would reconsider that 
ruling supreme court spokesman john madigan said 
the father and the attorney for 12yearold jeanpierre bosze 
said they hope the boys 3yearold twin halfbrother and 
halfsister would be tested if the guardians overlook the 
objections of the twins mother 
mom is making the wrong decision in this case said the 
childrens father tamas bosze of suburban hoffman estates the 
children would decide differently if they were grown up 
if my brother asked me for a blood test i would say sure 
bosze said after the hearing 
jeanpierres doctor says a bonemarrow transplant is the boys 
only chance for survival and the twins offer the best chance of a 
match bosze who fathered the twins by a former girlfriend went 
to court to force the testing after the woman refused to allow it 
in an order july 18 circuit judge monica reynolds refused to 
order the tests saying it would be an invasion of the twins 
privacy 
the illinois supreme court last week sent the case back to 
reynolds with further hearing with an order that guardians be 
appointed for the three children 
beverly pekala an attorney for the twins and their mother 
nancy curran appealed the high courts order 
the trial record is replete with evidence that all children 
involved with this case have had their interests zealously 
protected pekala said 
but attorney edward jordan who represents jeanpierre said the 
more objective view provided by guardians can help the court as it 
tries to balance the benefits to the boy versus the risk pain or 
inconvenience to the twins 
jordan said in his appeal to the high court that he wants time 
to gather more evidence he said this might include further medical 
information and testimony by people who have been donors in other 
cases 
and if any parents whose children were donors want to come 
forward wed be happy to talk to them jordan said 
the boys father said that jeanpierres leukemia must be in 
remission before he can receive a transplant 
bosze said his son recently underwent five days of chemotherapy 
and that doctors are close to bringing the disease under control to 
allow the operation 
he said that many nonrelatives have volunteered as donors but 
none has proven to be compatible 
the guardians named by reynolds are both chicago attorneys 
sheldon engel for jeanpierre and charles fleck for the twins

the american heart association is urging doctors 
across the country to consider testing for lyme disease in patients 
with unexplained strokes 
the suggestion comes after neurologists at walter reed army 
medical center in washington dc reviewed 12 cases of stroke 
caused by the disease contracted in europe 
the serious and possibly permanent brain damage that may result 
from strokes make it imperative that infection with lyme 
disease be suspected in any atypical stroke neurologists 
eugene may and bahman jabbari wrote in the august issue of stroke 
a heart association journal 
jabbari is director of the epilepsy and neurophysiology section 
at walter reed 
i suspect strokes caused by lyme disease have occurred in the 
united states but none has been reported so far said may 
senior neurology resident at walter reed hopefully 
neurologists in the united states will start looking more closely 
for lyme disease infections in stroke patients 
the doctors were alerted to the lymestroke connection when a 
20yearold us army soldier was transferred to walter reed in 
january 1989 where it was determined he had suffered a stroke 
triggered by an infecting agent that causes lyme disease 
the spirochete borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted to humans 
mainly by certain species of ticks each about the size of a 
pinhead 
may and jabbari found 11 similar cases in scientific literature 
and determined that all 12 had experienced meningitis and all had 
been infected in europe 
but they noted that only a few of the european strains of the 
lyme spirochete are closely related to the strains that cause lyme 
disease in the united states

the navy has confirmed that several 
sailors aboard the uss nimitz cheated on tests of their technical 
knowledge of the aircraft carriers nuclear reactor operations and 
procedures 
but the navy said it found no evidence that such cheating would 
harm the crews ability to operate the ship it denied public 
allegations by four sailors of unsafe procedures aboard the ship 
including shortcuts in various systems tests and the possibility of 
sabotage 
it found that the ships reactors are safe and that crew 
members are qualified to operate them the navy said in a 
statement tuesday 
the problem of several sailors cheating on exams was being 
resolved by the nimitz crew the navy said 
rep norm dicks dwash met tuesday with nuclear reactors 
office head adm bruce demars dicks said testing procedures 
involving the navys nuclear reactors were being reviewed because 
of the cheating 
there were nine people out of 345 who were involved in 
cribbing for exams and thats simply unacceptable dicks said 
but it didnt relate back to any safety problem on the ship 
lt col bob pritchard a navy spokesman in san diego said the 
exams require crew members in charge of reactor operations to 
answer a short list of questions the questions deal with their 
technical knowledge of operations and procedures concerning the 
power plant 
four sailors who said they work with the ships nuclear 
propulsion system had alleged on kirotv on aug 3 that the crew 
was overworked cheating on examinations was widespread and 
shortcuts were being taken in the ships system safety programs 
they claimed many nuclear crew members did not have sufficient 
knowledge to handle a nuclear accident and that some had considered 
minor acts of sabotage against the reactor to ease their workload 
the navy said it found no evidence of sabotage or a conspiracy 
to commit sabotage

a state regulators group is warning consumers 
about con artists who may try to exploit the crisis in the persian 
gulf by peddling bogus oil gas and precious metals investments 
the north american securities administrators association has 
issued an investor bulletin to warn small investors about the 
latest scams tied to recent developments in the mideast 
the group is an association of state government regulators that 
periodically alerts the public to the latest twists in 
consumerrelated securities fraud 
people shouldnt expect to make money overnight susan e 
bryant president of nasaa said in a telephone interview tuesday 
if a legitimate oil company is going to profit from the mideast 
oil crisis its going to take a while 
she said the organization had no direct reports of persian gulf 
oilrelated scams but there are rumors that theyre on the 
streets 
we usually dont get the complete story until someone figured 
out they lost money which could be several years down the road 
she said 
a con mans best friend is a headline or television news flash 
out of the mideast that threatens a disruption of oil supplies to 
the united states said bryant who is also administrator of the 
oklahoma securities department 
con artists previously have seized on the scam potential of 
mideast turmoil including the 197374 arab oil embargo the 1979 
iranian revolution and the tanker war during the iraniraq war in 
the 1980s bryant said 
investors should realize there are hundreds of high pressure 
telephone sales operations in the united states that will be 
burning up the phone lines with these kind of pitches for 
nonexistent or blatantly abusive investments she said 
investors should not to give money to strangers who contact them 
by phone nasaa said it also advised checking out whether an 
investment is registered with state authorities and if the promoter 
is licensed 
the nasaa bulletin warned that crooks through high pressure 
telephone sales from temporary boiler room operations 
encourage investors to buy into oil partnerships for 5000 
10000 or more 
to sweeten the deal they say the gulf conflict will drive up oil 
or commodity prices and the investor will be getting in early 
enough to ride the price rise 
but nasaa advised the wells in question often dont exist 
belong to someone else or are dry even a legitimate oil field can 
take as long as two years to reach full production the bulletin 
stated 
war and the rumor of war also can drive up the price of precious 
metals such as gold silver and platinum historically used as 
investment hedges during times of uncertainty and attract scam 
artists hawking bullion and coins nasaa said 
investors should be particularly careful about promotions for 
bankfinanced or collateral loan programs involving gold or silver 
the salesperson usually has made extravagant or misleading 
claims about the profit potential and very often high commissions 
interest charges storage fees and other expenses make it 
extremely unlikely that an investor will see a penny of profit 
the bulletin said

a twoday nationwide 
strike over sharply higher prices led to clashes between police and 
protesters that left at least 11 people dead and 50 wounded 
authorities said today 
the general strike virtually paralyzed the caribbean nation of 7 
million people on monday and tuesday nearly all stores factories 
and offices were closed and public transportation was scarce 
normal activity resumed today however 
the antigovernment strike which was organized by nine major 
unions led to violent confrontations between protesters and 
security forces in the capital santo domingo and several other 
cities 
police said the 11 people who died were all killed as a result 
of bullets fired by police and soldiers to disperse unruly crowds 
it was earlier reported that an 10yearold girl had died after 
being struck by a stone during looting but police said today that 
she was accidentally hit by a bullet at least 50 protesters were 
wounded and 2000 arrested over the 48hour strike period 
the unions organized the protest in response to an austerity 
program introduced last week by the government of president joaquin 
balaguer to shore up the countrys faltering economy 
juan jose arteaga presidential economic adviser said today the 
strike would have no effect on the governments economic policies 
the program includes sharp increases in the costs of basic consumer 
goods the price of gasoline for example rose 836 percent from 
55 cents to 107 a gallon 
the conservative balaguer 83 and blind is to be inaugurated 
thursday to a second consecutive fouryear term he narrowly 
defeated his longtime challenger leftist juan bosch in a disputed 
election may 16

mikhail s gorbachev today ordered the restoration 
of citizenship to a large number of exiles and an official 
suggested that nobel laureates alexander solzhenitsyn and joseph 
brodsky may be among them 
the soviet president canceled the decrees on citizenship 
concerning a number of persons who are now living abroad the 
official soviet news agency tass reported citing an official 
announcement 
the decree came two days after gorbachev issued a sweeping 
decree restoring the rights of all victims of stalins repressions 
saying thousands of innocent people still bore a stain of 
injustice 
the brief report on todays order said it dealt with 
injustices that occurred between 1966 and 1988 but did not say 
if it affected everyone whose citizenship was revoked during that 
period nor did it name anyone in particular 
however foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said the 
order concerns a rather large number of people some names were 
mentioned brodsky solzhenitsyn 
i just heard that ostensibly mr solzhenitsyn got back his 
soviet citizenship but i dont know for sure gremitskikh said 
the government of former soviet leader leonid brezhnev revoked 
the citizenship of prominent authors and performing artists who 
spoke out against repression in their homeland 
but gorbachevs government has restored the citizenship of a 
number of them notably cellist and conductor mstislav rostropovich 
and his wife singer galina vishnevskaya 
gremitskikh was unable to say whether the presidential order 
also applies to jews who emigrated to israel and were deprived of 
their citizenship 
both solzhenitsyn and brodsky spent time in soviet prison camps 
for their political views 
solzhenitsyn is the author of the gulag archipelago which 
depicted the horrors of dictator josef stalins prison camps the 
author was charged with high treason in 1974 stripped of his 
citizenship and expelled from the country he now lives in vermont 
other wellknown works by solzhenitsyn who won the nobel prize 
in literature in 1970 include one day in the life of ivan 
denisovich and cancer ward the soviet union banned his books 
for decades but in the past year has published several of them 
including the gulag archipelago 
solzhenitsyn came under particular criticism in his homeland 
because he has condemned not only stalin but also soviet founder 
vladimir lenin calling him evil lenin is still generally 
revered in the soviet union 
solzhenitsyn has said he would not return to the soviet union 
unless all of his books were published and widely available a 
number of his books have been printed but almost none can readily 
be found in the shortageplagued soviet union 
brodsky is a poet and essayist who now lives in new york only a 
few of his works were published in the soviet union until the 
literary monthly novy mir printed a selection after he won the 1987 
nobel prize for literature 
he was sentenced to five years in an arctic labor camp in 1964 
after being convicted of parasitism but released after 18 
months parasitism was the crime of not holding a job many 
dissidents were fired barred from working and then found guilty of 
parasitism 
brodsky left the soviet union in 1972 after being told by secret 
police to emigrate or face the consequences he understood the 
threat to mean that he might face another prison term if he stayed 
he left behind an eloquent appeal to brezhnev that he be 
permitted to return home one day 
although i am losing my soviet citizenship i do not cease to 
be a russian poet i belong to russian culture i feel part of 
it he said 
i feel bitter as i leave russia i was born raised and have 
lived here and i owe everything i have in the world to russia 
everything bad i have suffered has been more than compensated by 
the good and i have never felt that i have been hurt by my 
homeland 
in an interview in paris with the reporters from the soviet 
newspaper izvestia in 1988 brodsky said he might be interested in 
returning to leningrad for a private visit 
moscow news said today that a book of brodskys poetry is being 
published for the first time in the soviet union the northwest 
publishing house in leningrad plans 100000 copies of the book 
the autumn cry of the hawk

a television monitor shows the destruction 
of one of the worlds most loathed weapons a rocket armed with 
deadly nerve agent being cut by a machine and dumped into an 
incinerator 
it was the 63rd m55 rocket destroyed tuesday at this remote 
outpost 800 miles southwest of honolulu and the 1104th incinerated 
since the johnston atoll chemical agent disposal system or jacads 
plant began tests june 30 
i came here with a few doubts but i leave here reinforced in 
my support for this facility sen daniel inouye dhawaii said 
after seeing the process 
he and several other visitors wore gas masks and nerve gas 
antidote syringes strapped to their sides 
the 240 million facility was built to destroy 300000 aging 
chemical weapons moved here from okinawa in 1971 pending 
government approval and the outcome of a lawsuit filed by the 
environmental group greenpeace usa the facility also will 
incinerate 100000 rounds being shipped from west germany 
some pacific leaders and environmental groups fear the facility 
is unsafe and could turn johnston atoll into the nations and 
perhaps the worlds chemical munitions disposal site 
to address those fears inouye traveled to the small flat atoll 
on tuesday with congressional delegates ben blaz rguam and eni 
faleomavaega damerican samoa pacific forces commander adm 
huntington hardisty and several reporters 
an army spokesman said it was the first time reporters had been 
given access to the atolls chemical weapons facilities 
inouye chairman of the senate defense appropriations 
subcommittee said he arranged the tour because a lack of 
information about activities at johnston atoll was causing 
unfounded concern 
inouye said he came away convinced the facility was safe would 
not harm the environment and would not be used for weapons stored 
on the us mainland 
my reaction is very good blaz said i am absolutely 
convinced this facility is as good as it can be to do the job for 
which it is intended 
col david moss in charge of jacads told the visitors the 
facility is safe 
we take all the precautions we possibly can we do extensive 
monitoring weve destroyed over 1100 rockets already without 
incident moss said 
similar plants are planned for the mainland where nearly all of 
the us chemical weapons stockpile is kept the johnston atoll and 
european weapons amount to 66 percent of the us chemical 
munitions arsenal 
the disposal facility which resembles a factory or power plant 
covers several acres on the coral atoll that is barely large enough 
to accommodate its airport 
the facility is being tested in a 16month trial run burning 
obsolete rockets containing the nerve agent gb which kills by 
paralyzing the respiratory system 
greenpeace sued to block the shipment of weapons from west 
germany to johnston atoll a federal judge in honolulu will 
consider the groups request for a preliminary injunction to halt 
the shipment at an aug 20 hearing 
greenpeace claims the armys environmental impact statements for 
the incinerator are not comprehensive and fail to address 
alternatives to incineration 
two ships that will carry the weapons to the pacific are not 
scheduled to leave west germany until next month

east germanys top political party relieved 
its general secretary of his duties today after a news magazine 
said he had worked for the former communist secret police for 15 
years 
martin kirchner chief of the christian democratic union of 
prime minister lothar de maiziere was told to step aside pending 
an investigation of the accusations said party deputy chairman 
horst korbella 
kirchner was pushed aside shortly after the west german magazine 
stern reported in its latest edition that he worked for the 
notorious secret police as a paid informant for 15 years 
stern which cited as sources three former secret police 
members said kirchner was working for the intelligence network 
when he met last year with west german chancellor helmut kohl and 
other west german officials 
kirchner was on vacation and could not be reached for comment 
he has denied previous reports in the press that he had ties to the 
secret police known as the stasi 
the stern report is the latest of several accusations that 
prominent people in east germanys new democratic system were 
informers for the oncefeared domestic intelligence network 
in recent months there also have been widespread reports that 
the stasi harbored notorious leftist terrorists and may have 
plotted and carried out the assassinations of dissidents and 
refugees 
considered one of the most skilled intelligence services in the 
world the omnipresent stasi created an atmosphere of fear and 
intimidation that helped keep in power the government of former 
hardline communist leader erich honecker honecker was ousted in 
the fall by a popular prodemocracy uprising 
the stern report said kirchner reported to the stasi details of 
a meeting with kohl and other west german officials during the 
waning days of the former government 
kohls west german christian democrats helped turn the east 
german christian democratic union from a communistlinked puppet 
party into a sister party that will soon merge with its west german 
counterpart 
the stern report said kirchner supplied information from the 
meeting with kohl to the stasi so it could prepare for the days 
following honeckers fall 
the christian democrats won the most votes in east germanys 
first free elections on march 18 by promising to seek quick unity 
with west germany 
de maiziere has denied accusations that he also supplied 
information to the secret police 
stern said kirchner was paid monthly by the stasi and worked as 
an informant for the agency until a few days before the opening of 
the berlin wall on nov 9 
stern said two of the three former stasi members it quoted were 
kirchners bosses during his relationship with the secret police 
between 1978 and 1989 
the stasi had more than 80000 members but was believed to have 
had even more people working with it on a regular basis this group 
included educators scientists and numerous other people 
east germans are torn between seeking retribution and 
prosecuting former stasi agents and informants or granting a 
general amnesty

abc anchor ted koppel planning a second day of 
reports from iraq today says jordans king hussein may have helped 
get him there in hope of airing the iraqi point of view 
the nightline anchor scored a journalistic coup tuesday when 
he became the first american reporter let into iraq since that 
countrys takeover of kuwait on aug 2 
today cbs anchorman dan rather and a cbs team that included 
correspondent allen pizzey also were allowed in a cbs spokeswoman 
said nbc and cable news network still were trying to arrange 
similar trips 
koppel in a phone report from the us embassy in baghdad to 
his nightline program tuesday night said hed spent 2 hours 
with king hussein several days ago 
he said the king an ally of iraqi leader saddam hussein is 
extremely eager to have the iraqi point of view communicated 
through the american media 
the king he added was very helpful i think in making our 
trip possible 
he speculated that iraqi officials let him in because they feel 
things are going so poorly for them that they have nothing to 
lose by letting us come over here and report from here 
because the reporting has been all so antiiraq that i guess 
they feel it cant get much worse and who knows some of their 
point of view might get across 
koppel whose emmywinning series is known for offering 
interviews with heads of state who engage in what some call 
television diplomacy flew to iraq from jordan late tuesday 
the abc crew with him included morning news anchor forrest 
sawyer who reported from bagdhad today on good morning america 
but koppel was unable then to interview the countrys leader 
and his abc crew him was unable to arrange a satellite video hookup 
from the staterun television facilities in baghdad 
so as sawyer did today koppel phoned in his reports to abcs 
world news tonight and then nightline the latter anchored 
in new york by chris wallace 
koppel also included on his latenight broadcast an interview 
with bob vinton whom he identified as a us businessman who has 
lived in iraq since last fall vinton works for johnson controls 
inc a milwaukeebased company that makes automotive batteries and 
building instrumentation 
vinton said iraqis continued to treat americans in baghdad 
courteously and that we have complete freedom of movement 
but he said there had been no indications that americans in 
iraq can go home at any time during the current crisis and he 
expressed surprise koppel was allowed in the country 
koppel said on the air that iraqi leaders had been trying to get 
news of us moves and glean us intentions from the global 
broadcasts of cable news network received in baghdad 
nbc seeking entry into iraq for sunday today coanchor 
garrick utley and correspondent rick davis has had difficulty 
getting visas due to communications problems between iraqi 
officials in jordon and baghdad said nbc news foreign editor david 
miller 
but were hopeful he said

prochoice activists burned mock baptismal 
certificates and declared themselves voluntarily excommunicated 
to protest an antiabortion campaign developed for the roman 
catholic church 
id certainly like to be excommunicated if thats what they 
are doing to people who support abortions said alison gude 28 
who was baptized in the catholic church 
gude was one of 20 protesters who gathered tuesday outside the 
cathedral hill hotel where 200 catholic officials and laymen got 
their first glimpse of the campaign put together by the public 
relations firm hill and knowlton 
were here to let them know the majority of people in this 
country are prochoice and no slick advertising campaign is going 
to deter women from seeking abortions said marianne jensen a 
spokeswoman for the bay area coalition against operation rescue 
which organized the protests 
some church officials have termed the campaign as informational 
rather than advertising 
the protesters chanted slogans such as keep your rosaries out 
of our ovaries as they gathered around a skeleton draped in red 
robes which they said represented cardinal john oconnor 
oconnor the archbishop of new york and chairman of the 
bishops committee for prolife activities addressed the diocesan 
prolife coordinators monday during the first day of the twoday 
conference 
protesters said the church intended to spend 5 million on the 
hill and knowlton campaign church officials have not released the 
projects cost but said 3 million in private donations has been 
earmarked for the project 
we think their money would be better spent on social services 
programs jensen said 
the point is to get professional assistance on how to better 
communicate our message so it will be heard said the rev john 
goudrick executive director for the secretariat for prolife 
activities i dont think its being heard because i rarely see 
reference to the unborn 
goudrick said the abortion debate instead centers on the 
conflict between women and government 
were focusing on the fact that right now respect for human 
life in this country is eroding goudrick said 
goudrick said the campaign would not target just a catholic 
audience 
human life is a human issue its not just a catholic issue 
he said

two out of three americans say they are 
following the action in the persian gulf very closely and 85 
percent of those polled say it is the most important news of the 
month a media organization reported today 
the times mirror center for the people amp the press said the 
level of interest was significantly higher than for news of 
previous actions involving us armed forces 
for example 60 percent said they paid very close attention to 
the december invasion of panama and 58 percent to the us air 
strikes against libya in 1986 compared with the 66 percent for the 
gulf developments 
times mirror said it was unprecedented to have 85 percent 
responding that the gulf action was the most important story the 
previous high was 56 percent for the invasion of panama 
the center is an arm of times mirror which publishes a number 
of newspapers and has other news media interests the center makes 
monthly surveys of public interest in the news 
it said the public was reasonably well informed about the gulf 
crisis with 66 percent knowing that the soviet union is supporting 
us efforts to get iraq to withdraw from kuwait almost as many 
64 percent knew that other countries were sending forces to saudi 
arabia to defend against an iraqi invasion 
the organization surveyed 1213 adults by telephone from aug 
912 the error attributable to sampling and other random effects 
is plus or minus 3 percentage points the center said 
the center also said that 30 percent of the public an unusually 
large proportion said they had followed news about the condition 
of the economy closely during the previous four weeks in may only 
18 percent said they were paying close attention to news about 
increasing interest rates and higher inflation 
still however just as was the case in june only 18 percent 
claimed to be closely following stories about the efforts of the 
administration and congress to cut the budget deficit

rebel fighters escorted staff and 
refugees living in the west german moroccan and egyptian embassies 
from the battle front of monrovia today but refused to let guineans 
evacuate their mission 
the rebels of charles taylors national patriotic front have 
accused guinea of supporting liberian president samuel doe with 
troops 
taylors rebels escorted 11 germans two moroccan diplomats the 
egyptian ambassador 4 lebanese and 24 liberians in an 18vehicle 
convoy headed for neighboring ivory coast west german ambassador 
juergen gehl told reporters as he departed 
it would take at least 12 hours to reach the northeastern 
border traveling through rebelheld territory 
about 60 guineans including the ambassador were not allowed to 
join the convoy gehl said 
rebels attacked the embassies of guinea and nigeria last week 
forcing more than 8000 people sheltered there into the streets 
where the rebels were battling does troops with rockets 
antiaircraft guns and assault rifles 
people at guineas mission made their way back to the building 
rather than risk passing through numerous rebel check points 
blocking the route to the border 
many of those chased from the embassy were mandingos a tribe 
rebels accuse of supporting does government people suspected of 
aiding doe risk summary execution 
taylors forces have captured at least four guinean soldiers 
accused of fighting with does troops but one of the prisoners 
told reporters he was guarding the embassy when he was taken 
an estimated 1400 people are still sheltered at the nigerian 
embassy next to the west german compound 
in the past taylor has said he would allow the nigerian and 
guinean embassies to evacuate their personnel 
but that was before both countries announced they were sending 
troops to a sixnation west african task force mobilizing in 
neighboring sierra leone the force has orders to sail to monrovia 
and force a halt to the nearly 8monthold civil war 
the west african nations sending troops are ghana gambia 
guinea nigeria sierra leone and togo 
rebels invaded from ivory coast on dec 24 in february rebel 
commander prince johnson split with taylor and formed a rival 
faction that is fighting does soldiers in central monrovia and 
fending off attacks from taylors forces 
on tuesday taylor said his rebels had killed johnson in an 
ambush but reporters later interviewed taylors rival who laughed 
at the claim 
doe and johnson have welcomed the west african intervention 
the intrarebel fighting has prolonged the rebellion in which 
5000 people have been killed mostly civilians 
more than 100 people including 52 west germans 28 spaniards 
five swiss four filipinos and two american citizens were evacuated 
sunday by us marines in helicopters from the atlantic ocean port 
of buchanan 90 miles east of monrovia they had traveled by convoy 
from congo town about a mile outside monrovia through rebelheld 
territory 
about 2000 us marines in ships off the liberian coast are on 
standby to protect us citizens and installations or are in 
monrovia guarding the us embassy

taped conversations between a psychotherapist 
and two brothers accused in the shotgun slayings of their wealthy 
parents cant be released a state appeals court said in a 
temporary ruling 
the court blocked release of tapes confiscated in connection 
with the arrests of erik and lyle menendez the brothers are 
accused in the aug 20 1989 murders of their father jose 
menendez and his wife kitty inside their beverly hills mansion 
prosecutors allege the sons were motivated by the prospect of a 
14 million inheritance 
the 2nd district court of appeal issued the emergency stay 
tuesday and set aug 24 for the prosecutors rebuttal said clerk 
john lepo 
the recordings are of counseling sessions between the brothers 
and their psychotherapist l jerome oziel prosecutors who 
already have listened to the tapes consider them key evidence 
defense attorneys claim the tapes fall under doctorpatient 
privilege and thus cannot be introduced as evidence 
were delighted by the ruling said defense attorney gerald 
chaleff 
santa monica superior court judge james albracht ruled aug 6 
that the privilege protection did not apply because oziel was 
threatened 
communication between a therapist and patient is considered 
confidential unless it involves threats or has been disclosed to a 
third party 
albracht said oziel believed the brothers made threats during 
the sessions and it was necessary to disclose the conversations to 
protect himself and others 
in another development erik 19 has refused to give 
authorities a handwriting sample beverly hills municipal judge 
charles rubin warned him monday that his refusal can be used as 
evidence 
prosecutors want to compare the brothers handwriting to that 
found on records used to buy two shotguns in san diego 
a preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for oct 22

a conservationist vessel deliberately rammed two 
japanese fishing boats in the north pacific disabling equipment 
used to recover driftnets a crew member reported 
the action was part of a campaign to document and halt the 
incidental deaths of millions of seabirds marine mammals and sea 
turtles from driftnetting said chris keyser in a marine satellite 
telephone call tuesday to the associated press 
the sea shepherd ii operated by the sea shepherd conservation 
society came upon the sixboat japanese squid fleet monday about 
1500 miles north of honolulu said keyser a freelance writer 
aboard the britishregistered 196foot north sea trawler 
it was necessary to disable their fishing gear in order to put 
them out of operation said paul watson the skipper of the sea 
shepherd ii and founder of the radical conservation group 
it was also necessary to create an international incident to 
focus international attention on the issue he said 
the japanese driftnetters are in violation of the north pacific 
treaty on the protection of migratory seabirds which was signed by 
the japanese government watson said 
but he contended that us and japanese authorities for the past 
decade have done nothing to enforce the treaty which protects 22 
species of sea birds 13 of which are threatened or endangered 
were fed up with people just talking about it its about 
time someone did something to get these pirates out of here said 
watson who charged that the north pacific area has become a 
biological wasteland because of the driftnetters 
any consequences are worth the action we took the sea 
shepherd society has always taken responsibility for its actions 
and we have never committed a criminal act nor caused any 
injuries he said 
there were no injuries although two of the japanese fishermen 
threw knives at the sea shepherd ii after the ramming keyser said 
the coast guard had not received any reports of the ramming but 
will be looking into the matter to see if any us citizens were 
involved said lt michael mohn at the joint rescue coordination 
center 
keyser identified the japanese vessels as the shunyo maru and 
ryoun maru 
after sideswiping the two boats the sea shepherd ii went after 
two more boats but they were faster and were able to escape 
keyser said 
there has been a growing movement throughout the pacific to ban 
the nearly invisible driftnets known by critics as walls of 
death which can stretch for 30 miles trapping a wide variety of 
marine life and birds as well as large schools of squid for which 
they were developed 
watson was one of the original founders of the conservation 
group greenpeace before breaking ties to found the sea shepherd 
conservation society now said to have 15000 members worldwide 
the 23 crew members of the sea shepherd ii include citizens of 
the united states great britain canada spain and the 
philippines watson said

californias ban on political party 
endorsements in elections of judges and local government officials 
is unconstitutional because if violates freedom of speech a 
federal appeals court has ruled 
the 83 ruling of the 9th us circuit court of appeals is the 
second blow in two years to state laws restricting party 
endorsements last year the us supreme court struck down a 
california law that prohibited parties from endorsing candidates in 
their own partisan primaries 
this decision constitutes a charter of freedom for political 
parties state democratic chairman edmund brown jr the former 
governor said in a statement after tuesdays ruling lobbyists 
and special interest groups have enjoyed a free hand while 
official political parties have been left out of local government 
deputy city attorney burk delventhal of san francisco whose 
office defended the state law said the ruling could be damaging to 
local government and judicial independence if it led to widespread 
party endorsements in nonpartisan elections 
it would deprive local governments of the opportunity to have 
people with independent points of view who do not necessarily have 
to toe the party line to gain access to the public delventhal 
said he said no decision has been made on an appeal to the supreme 
court 
the ban on endorsements in nonpartisan local government school 
board and judicial elections was added to the state constitution by 
the voters in 1986 after the state supreme court had ruled that the 
endorsements were not prohibited by law 
sponsors of the 1986 measure claimed roots in the reforms of the 
1910s that sought to break the grip of bigmoney interests by 
weakening political parties one of the reforms was to make all 
local government offices nonpartisan 
the measure was immediately challenged by a diverse group of san 
francisco political activists backed later by the state democratic 
party us district judge alfonso zirpoli ruled in their favor a 
threejudge appellate panel overturned his decision saying the law 
was needed to protect nonpartisan elections but the larger panel 
on tuesday reinstated zirpolis ruling 
chief judge alfred goodwin in the majority opinion said 
parties and their members have rights of free speech and 
association that cannot be completely suppressed without a 
compelling reason he said nonpartisan elections had been 
adequately protected by keeping the parties out of the nomination 
process and restricting the candidates partisan activities 
in a separate concurring opinion judge stephen reinhardt 
joined by judge alex kozinski said the integrity of the political 
process is threatened not by parties but by the corrupting 
influence of money in politics 
keeping parties weak does not prevent corruption and may even 
encourage it reinhardt wrote officeholders and candidates must 
go directly to the big monied interests and beg for the funds 
necessary to finance their campaigns 
he also said that as long as california elects its judges it 
must leave the voters free rightly or wrongly to consider the 
political philosophy of the candidates banning party 
endorsements merely leaves the field free to special interests 
reinhardt said 
dissenting judge arthur alarcon said a party endorsement in a 
judicial race might be tempting to a frightened incumbent who has 
been subjected to media criticism for an unpopular decision 
alarcon said 
judge pamela rymer in a separate dissent joined by alarcon and 
judge ferdinand fernandez said allowing party endorsements would 
effectively destroy the nonpartisan system

a state agency today put nine homes 
up for sale near the love canal chemical dump and said the 
neighborhood bought up by the government in the 1970s is safe but 
with no guarantees 
the homes have been rigorously tested and are as safe as any in 
niagara falls said william l broderick executive director of the 
love canal area revitalization agency 
but he said it was impossible to guarantee that the toxic 
chemical leaks that once drove 2500 people from the neighborhood 
would not recur 
theres no written guarantees going to be given broderick 
said at a news conference at his agencys offices about 500 feet 
from the site of the toxic dump all we have is the written 
assurance of the state health department and the state 
environmental department as to the maintenance of the canal 
if there is a problem in the future im sure the state will 
come back and do as they did last time 
the agency originally planned to offer 10 homes today but 
broderick said a resident of the neighborhood already had offered 
to buy one 
eight years ago the idea that anyone would want to move back to 
love canal was so preposterous that it became a joke in the movie 
tootsie 
james e carr the agencys planning director said tours of the 
homes will be given for the next 20 days to interested buyers the 
agency plans to start accepting offers sept 5 
broderick said a flurry of lastminute court action on tuesday 
would not prevent the agency from going ahead with plans to sell 
some love canal homes 
more than 200 people including several former residents have 
expressed interest in the small singlefamily homes asking prices 
of 40000 to 60000 about 20 percent less than comparable homes 
elsewhere have stimulated interest 
many prospective buyers say they believe the danger from the 
22000 tons of chemicals still buried there has been overstated 
the canal went right through my back yard as kids we used to 
go back in those fields mow them down play baseball said gail 
mcclinsey im fine and i have two children theyre fine i 
keep in touch with some of the friends i grew up with theyre 
fine 
but doubts remain about allowing people to move into homes just 
a few blocks from the canal bed where hooker chemical co dumped 
dioxin pcbs and other toxic chemicals in the 1940s and 1950s 
leaks discovered in the late 1970s led 2500 residents to 
abandon their homes making love canal a national symbol of the 
threat posed by toxic waste in tootsie dustin hoffmans 
character considers taking a part in a play called return to love 
canal 
carr said the area containing the 10 homes is safe even though 
most of the chemicals dumped in the canal have not been removed 
they do testing all the time theres continual monitoring going 
on he said sure id live there 
richard j lippes a lawyer for environmental and community 
groups seeking to block resettlement disagreed 
i would never buy a home in love canal i would never put my 
family in such jeopardy he said and if i wouldnt do it 
there is no way i could recommend to anyone else to do it 
the groups asked state supreme court justice joseph mintz to 
enforce his 1985 injunction barring resettlement pending 
environmental and livability studies but the agency urged him to 
lift the order saying the studies have been done 
the attorney generals office which originally sought the 
injunction said it would not object we feel that the terms of 
the injunction have been met said leslie gersing spokeswoman 
for attorney general robert abrams 
no rulings are expected until mintz returns from vacation next 
month 
a study completed in 1988 found that the resettlement area north 
and northwest of love canal which contains about 250 singlefamily 
homes was no more contaminated than comparable parts of niagara 
falls an area east of the canal containing about 270 homes was 
deemed uninhabitable because of contamination 
resettlement opponents claim the livability study and an 
environmental review completed this year are flawed among other 
things they say that other areas of niagara falls may be polluted 
from several chemical plants and other toxic dumps 
they havent determined that those control areas are safe and 
if those control areas arent safe neither is love canal lippes

iraqs takeover of kuwait came despite the 
emirates concessions on two key iraqi demands the foreign 
minister of kuwaits ousted government said in an interview 
published today 
in talks that broke down less than 24 hours before the aug 2 
invasion kuwait had agreed to write off iraqs war debts and let 
baghdad use a kuwaiti island for its oil operations said the 
minister sheik sabah alahmed aljaber 
in remarks published in this weeks edition of the stateowned 
almussawar magazine sheik sabah said iraq had demanded the 
writeoff of an estimated 14 billion to 15 billion in loans kuwait 
provided baghdad during its eightyear war with iran 
iraq asked us to drop the debts and we did not object 
sabah said 
he said the questions surrounding iraqs need of an outlet for 
its oil exports had not been completely resolved but that kuwait 
had done what it could to meet baghdads demands 
he said iraq had asked for ownership of two strategic persian 
gulf islands bubiyan and warba and that kuwait had areed to 
lease iraq one of them instead 
iraq asked for bubiyan island he told the magazine we 
agreed to give them warba island instead because bubiyan is about a 
quarter the area of kuwait and because warba is enough for iraqs 
purposes 
he said iraq would have been able to use warba as an outlet to 
the gulf for oil from its wells in rumaila a rich field in on the 
disputed iraqkuwait frontier 
the former minister said the demand for ownership was refused 
because the kuwaiti parliament had issued a decree banning the 
ceding of any land 
iraq stormed out of the meeting in jiddah saudi arabia and the 
invasion followed afterward baghdad contended it invaded at the 
request of a new government that had overthrown the old ruling 
family most diplomats discounted that claim 
iraq later announced formation of a new kuwaiti government then 
declared it had annexed kuwait 
the ousted foreign minister said the island question had been an 
irritant between iraq and kuwait throughout the iraniraq war 
baghdad repeatedly asked for the use of the two islands kuwait 
consistently refused 
in the fortnight before the invasion iraq accused kuwait of 
stealing 24 billion in oil from the wells near the frontier it 
also charged kuwait was trying to ruin baghdads economy by 
producing more than its opec quota of oil pushing down world 
market prices 
at the time of the jiddah talks diplomatic sources said the 
wardebt problem could be resolved but that kuwaits refusal to 
cede sovereignty over the two islands was a main sticking point

east oregonian pendleton ore on rising oil and gasoline 
prices 
its fascinating to observe that whenever the price of oil and 
gasoline skyrockets some oil company hotshot tells the rest of us 
we dont know how markets operate maybe fascinating isnt the 
word how about disgusting 
recent statements by charles j dibona president of the 
american petroleum institute typify the arrogance and obfuscation 
of those who think they know better as they gouge us during times 
of crisis dibona told the senate commerce consumer subcommitee 
that critics of the recent price increases were taking a naive 
onesided view of how markets work oil industry representatives 
issued similar statements after the exxon valdez oil spill 
mr dibona we may be naive in the sense that we expect the oil 
industry to show a little more restraint a little more 
patriotism when our nation faces a tough situation but we know 
how markets work the big oil companies use any excuse possible to 
jack up prices and the american consumers must fork over the dough 
if they want to get to work every day and keep american industry 
functioning 
considering the crisis in the mideast its to be expected that 
oil prices would rise but there is a difference between a 
legitimate price increase and a gouge 
taxpayers are spending millions to finance a strong effective 
response to this crisis at the same time we are hostage to the 
profiteers at home 
more critical is the possibility that the oil companies policy 
of greed before country is driving america into a recession 
economic growth has been slow the past few months almost stagnant 
while unemployment and interest rates are rising steep energy 
prices could plunge us into an economic downturn 
supply isnt the problem this week an energy department 
official said us commercial supplies of 392 million barrels are 
at the highest level in nine years

the journal lorain ohio on rising oil and gasoline prices 
political cases are funny in that the final verdict may not 
always equal the sum of all the evidence such we suspect will be 
the case in the investigation into the rapid rise in gas prices 
allegedly resulting from iraqs invasion of kuwait 
at a house subcommittee energy and power hearing looking into 
the rapid rise in gas prices chairman rep philip sharp dind 
suggested the cutoff of oil from the persian gulf warranted 
dipping into the us strategic petroleum reserve that would 
reduce consumer prices for gasoline 
but john easton of the energy department claims those reserves 
could only be used to make up for supply shortages not to bring 
down the price of gas 
but wait a minute if there isnt a shortage of oil then why is 
the price of gas rising so rapidly at the pump spokesmen for the 
big oil companies who claim no price gouging is taking place say 
its because the price of crude oil rose about 7 a barrel last 
week on the world market 
these contradictions in supply and demand deserve investigation 
but the body doing the investigating is congress which has been 
stuffing its pockets annually with pac money from the big oil 
companies 
well just bet this probe turns out to be a case where congress 
couldnt hit water if it fell out of a boat

the burlington county times willingboro nj on the persian 
gulf crisis 
with the array of opposing forces deployed around him why does 
saddam hussein persist in his annexation of kuwait and his threats 
to saudi arabia is his pride so important that he would commit 
national suicide rather than back off 
the situation would be laughable but for the modernday arms 
supplied him by the soviets and our friends the french and how can 
we laugh when a nation the size of iraq raises a millionman army 
and uses poison gas on its own people 
perhaps the ghost of hitler and the munich pact serve us now 
for president bush said we must resist aggression 
appeasement will not work iraq cannot be allowed to benefit 
from its invasion of kuwait 
if all the pressure fails to dissuade saddam we will at least 
be nipping in the bud a force that is a clear and definite threat 
to world peace and the world economy what we are doing is the best 
we can do in a dangerous situation we cannot control only oppose

los angeles times on japan and the persian gulf crisis 
japan is wholly dependent on foreign oil for all that it does 
and so much of that oil comes from the persian gulf japan is 
prevented by its constitution imposed on it in the settlement of 
world war ii from developing or deploying anything other than a 
force for selfdefense 
for the japanese the best course of action is often the one 
that permits it to go quietly about its business but unable to 
send troops and in the position of not wishing to alienate its arab 
oil vendors japan needs to figure out its best profile in this 
crisis 
tokyo was right in agreeing to join the embargo early even 
before the key united nations security council sanctions vote 
and now it would be welladvised to assume the role of one of

a federal appeals court has cleared the way for 
the extradition to israel of a palestinianamerican accused of 
taking part in a machinegun attack on a bus traveling through the 
occupied west bank 
mahmoud elabed ahmad has been in jail since his arrest three 
years ago while lawyers argued over whether he could get a fair 
trial in israel 
in a unanimous ruling the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
rejected ahmads argument that the crime was a political act not 
covered by an extradition treaty with israel 
ahmads lawyer former us attorney general ramsey clark said 
today he would seek a stay of extradition while he petitioned the 
us supreme court to review ahmads case 
if the high court refuses to hear the case ahmad could be 
extradited clark said 
ahmad 37 who israeli authorities sometimes refer to as mahmoud 
abed atta is charged with taking part in a 1986 attack in which 
three palestine liberation organization terrorists hurled molotov 
cocktails and opened fire on a bus carrying jewish settlers the 
driver was killed and a passenger injured 
ahmad left israel after the attack and was arrested by fbi 
agents in 1987 on a flight from venezuela 
in hearings last year before us district judge jack b 
weinstein ahmad argued he would not get a fair trial in israel and 
would be tortured 
weinstein ruled in september that ahmad should be extradited 
saying his offense was not a political crime and that he would 
receive just treatment in israel 
the appeals court affirmed weinsteins ruling but criticized him 
for holding such long hearings 
the interests of international comity are illserved by 
requiring a foreign nation such as israel to satisfy a united 
states district judge concerning the fairness of its laws and the 
manner in which they are enforced judge ellsworth h van 
graafeiland wrote 
the us secretary of state has the final decision on whether 
extradition should be denied on humanitarian grounds the court 
said 
ahmad was born in the west bank town of ramalah and became a 
us citizen eight years ago

the commericial dispatch columbus miss on david souter 
so far we like what we dont hear about judge david souter the 
presidents nominee to the supreme court hes a man who minds his 
own business and is too immersed in the law to seek the 
selfaggrandizing spotlight 
he sounds like a man who has no use for the trend setters 
preferring to spend his time with the writings of the influential 
minds of the ages than with andy warhol and his 15minutesoffame 
gang his is an american character and mind we can be proud of 
there seems little doubt that souter is a strict 
constructionist not prone to divining implications from the 
constitution 
we believe souter will defer to congress prerogative of making 
the law and then test those laws against the immutable 
principles of the constitution 
the trouble comes when judges circumvent elected 
representatives and thus the people to decide social policy 
judge souter will be a law tester within the context of learning 
and constructionism not a lawmaker he should be confirmed by the 
senate when hearings start next month

charleston wva daily mail on the red cross 
the american red cross is the nations largest charity and it 
enjoys a high degree of public trust but it has found itself 
defending its reputation on two fronts 
the pittsburgh press reported on a ninemonth investigation of 
the red cross response to more than 200 disasters the paper found 
that the charity sometimes overstated its response to an emergency 
especially right after a disaster sometimes donated funds didnt 
go where contributors thought they were going 
three days after a flood in alabama the red cross said it had 
opened a feeding site in elba and was distributing hundreds of 
cleanup kits only one red cross worker was in elba that day the 
press reported and she didnt have cleanup kits the red cross 
wasnt running a food operation either church groups were 
a local red cross unit raised 113 million after a tornado 
ripped up an alabama subdivision the recovery effort has cost the 
red cross 400000 so far the rest of the money went into the 
national disaster fund 
contributors earmarked 40 million to help earthquake victims 
in northern california and found out later that the red cross did 
not intend to spend that much there complaints were so vociferous 
that the red cross established a new policy henceforth funds 
contributed to a disaster will be used there 
the red cross gives the impression that disaster relief is its 
main line of work but only about 100 million 9 percent of the 
12 billion the red cross raised and spent last year went for 
disaster aid about 664 million went for blood processing expenses 
red cross blood operations have also come under fire serious 
when you consider that it supplies half the hospitals in the 
country a food and drug administration investigation showed 
weaknesses in red cross reporting of accidents and errors in 
handling blood as a result the charity is reorganizing its system 
and has replaced its director of blood services 
the red cross will have to work overtime to explain some of 
these criticisms to the public on which it depends

the dallas morning news on foreign investment 
after decades of deriding the rest of the world for refusing the 
benefits of us investment americans are growing more fearful of 
losing their own economic and political independence to foreign 
interests investing in the united states 
why are americans so afraid of foreign investment if investment 
is good what difference does it make where it comes from as long 
as it is not from organized crime since americans have been busy 
buying consumer goods and transferring incomes among themselves 
rather than putting money into productive investments it is nice 
someone has considered the united states to be worthy of 
investment 
while foreign assets in the united states have increased to 2 
trillion the best guesses are that they amount to only about 1 
percent of the nations total wealth foreignowned firms employ 
less than 4 percent of the nonbank work force 
one reason foreigners are transferring their huge dollar 
holdings into us assets is that they can get good prices 
restrict this repatriation of capital and the us economy will 
lose one of the few energetic factors left in it 
the united states is not going to provide for its economic 
future by halting investment that gives foreigners a stake in 
keeping the us economy healthy the united states will provide 
for its future by getting its own house in order

messimvrini athens greece on the persian gulf crisis 
one would assume that after 50 years of human progress and the 
attempts that have been made to heal the wounds of world war ii 
there should no longer be any madmen anywhere who would play 
with fire 
and yet as if there were no hitler as if there were no 
mussolini as if there were no merciless war in which rivers of 
blood were spilled and the world were divided into two camps up 
comes saddam hussein wanting to follow in the footsteps of 
those notable dictators 
in 1940 though the free people of the west either did not 
notice the danger in time or shrank back when they should have said 
the big no in the way that smaller but brave nations such as 
ours did and so those two paranoid conquerors of the world 
began the slaughter 
today fortunately things are different or appear to be 
different fellow arabs have joined in the western 
multinational force against the iraqi visionary conqueror and 
herald of the holy war of hatred 
in this way it is possible that his blackmail will not succeed 
in fact saddam hussein may pass into history as one of the failed 
conquerors of humanity whom no one will remember in a few 
years in far less than 50 years

stampa sera turin italy on the persian gulf crisis 
saddam hussein is sufficiently intelligent to know that the 
united states cannot impose even if it wanted to anything on 
israel and if ever it wanted to convince the present rightwing 
government of israel to clear out of the occupied territories the 
us could not do it particularly now when paradoxically thanks to 
saddam israel will recover that role of bulwark of the west 
that was weakened as a result of the americansoviet thawing 
but to tie a possible withdrawal from kuwait obviously in 
exchange for some guarantees that is money and strategic islands 
to the problematic withdrawl of israeli forces from the territories 
would serve saddam primarily to save his face and secondarily to 
repropose himself as the knight of the arabs

el mercurio santiago chile on the persian gulf crisis 
some think that the other oil exporting countries will not be 
able to increase their production to fill the vacuum left by the 
united nations embargo on iraq that is a reasonable point of 
view although it is also disputable those holding that point of 
view seem to ignore that strategic reserves of oil exist that will 
ensure supplies for a fairly long period of time 
on the other hand both iraq and kuwait have very large food 
deficits will the threat of famine make sadam hussein change his 
mind or on the contrary will it be able to strengthen the unity 
of the arab peoples in an islamic crusade seeking to do away with 
the prowestern arab monarchies israel and christians still living 
in lebanon should that happen the answer from the west would be 
immediate violent paralyzing

tass the official soviet news agency moscow on the persian 
gulf crisis 
the developments of the recent days iraqs annexation of 
kuwait and worldwide reactions to the act have brought into focus 
the longpressing question to give a boost to the work of the 
military staff committee of the united nations security council 
during the war in korea the functions of the direction of armed 
forces placed at the disposal of the united nations by some member 
states were transferred as a result of us political maneuvers 
directly to the general assembly the military staff committee 
thereby turned into a stillborn agency 
in the 1970s committee sessions were held regularly but they 
were a pure formality 
now that the cold war has ended the situation has radically 
changed the soviet union has reconsidered its attitude toward 
many un agencies including the military staff committee 
undoubtedly conditions are quite ripe to add substance to its 
functioning a solution to problems that have arisen in the persian 
gulf area could be the first practical step in this respect 
collective efforts and full use of un mechanisms are the surest 
and the most reasonable way to act in such conflict situations 
in the current complex situation in the middle east it would be 
apparently quite useful to use the potential of the united nations 
the security council and its military staff committee and not just 
the efforts of the united states alone with the involvement of 
other countries

straits times singapore on pakistan 
the dismissal of benazir bhutto as prime minister of 
pakistan answers to a familiar pattern in pakistani politics ever 
since its inception in 1947 pakistan has had problems coming to 
terms with democracy 
however the proper way to deal with weaknesses of the 
government would have been to subject it to questioning and 
possible defeat on the floor of parliament not dismiss it from 
above the presidential action is a problematic one therefore 
ms bhutto has alleged that the military with which she had 
growing differences had a hand in her dismissal if this is true 
the whole affair would be a reminder of the way the army has 
intervened in politics whenever in its judgment the politicians 
have made a mess of things 
pakistan has fought and lost four wars with india there are 
some who think that army rule contributed to pakistans decision to 
fight and that a dilution of military professionalism because of 
involvement in politics contributed to its defeat 
given that the next war might not remain nonnuclear regional 
stability would dictate that pakistan make every effort to resolve 
its political problems effectively and quickly

the daily telegraph london on marion barry 
washington mayor marion barrys case is a striking indictment 
of the state of race relations in america 
a public officer found guilty of an offense which the 
administration sees as one of the greatest threats to society 
should have resigned immediately instead the mayor basks in the 
adulation of his supporters and speaks sentimentally of forgiveness 
a government which believed in justice would hasten to 
strengthen its case instead it appears to be wavering for fear of 
a black backlash 
such muddled thinking diminishes public respect for the rule of 
law and by encouraging them to see themselves as eternal victims 
does a profound disservice to blacks 
it is time to recall martin luther kings words that a man 
should be judged not by the color of his skin but by the content of 
his character

the army has completed preparations for handing 
out gas masks to all israelis but israeli leaders said wednesday 
they were hesitant to give the order because it might create panic 
and send a wrong message to iraq 
many israelis were not waiting for government action alarmed by 
iraqi threats to attack israel with chemical weapons residents 
were buying protective gear from private stores 
by the time the army distributes the gas masks it will be too 
late one shopper told the yediot ahronot daily wednesday the 
man bought a gas mask plastic poncho rubber boots and gloves at 
amos gazit co a safety equipment store in tel aviv 
in jerusalem a store called safety and protection tried to lure 
shoppers by hanging a white protective suit and gas mask outside 
the front door boxes of gas masks were piled on the small shops 
floor employees refused to discuss business 
israeli newspapers have been running fullpage articles 
explaining what type of gloves clothing boots and gas masks are 
needed for protection against chemical weapons 
israel has long prepared itself for chemical warfare students 
go through gas attack drills and even the telephone book contains 
instructions of what to do in the event of a gas attack 
anxiety about an iraqi attack increased sunday after iraqi 
president saddam warned he would attack israel if the americans 
launched a military strike in the persian gulf saddam has nerve 
gases in his arsenal 
israel army radio reported wednesday that israels civil defense 
had completed preparations for distributing gas masks to all 
israelis and that it was now up to the government to issue such an 
order 
defense minister moshe arens reportedly is trying to assess 
whether mass distribution of gas masks would be perceived by iraq 
as an israeli preparation for a strike against it 
foreign minister david levy said that in the current tense 
atmosphere saddam might use the distribution of gas masks as an 
excuse to attack israel 
it could be interpreted as preparation of an israeli step and 
this could be used as an alibi by that dictator saddam to do 
something levy told army radio 
an army source said gas masks could be distributed to all 45 
million israelis within four or five days if the government gave 
the goahead 
in tel aviv meanwhile the municipalitys emergency committee 
met with army officials to discuss emergency preparations and said

for more than 20 years edward w gnehm jr 
toiled the diplomatic ranks on his way to being confirmed as new 
ambassador to kuwait then within hours iraqs invading army made 
him an envoy without a post 
gnehm a 45yearold career foreign service officer was 
endorsed by the senate foreign relations committee for his first 
ambassadorship only seven hours before saddam husseins forces 
swept into the tiny persian gulf sheikdom the senate formally 
approved him a day after the invasion 
it was fair irony he said in an interview 
gnehm had left his post as deputy assistant secretary of state 
for near eastern and south asian affairs and was in the throes 
of packing when iraqs takeover of kuwait disrupted his travel 
schedule 
gnehm a georgia native known as skip said he and his 
family had planned to take a beach vacation last week and then 
return to washington to pack and depart for kuwait 
instead he has been thrust into the job of director of task 
force one a state department crisis center handling family liaison 
and other political military and consular matters concerning the 
middle east situation 
gnehm is also at the washington end of critical 
telecommunication lines with us embassies in kuwait and baghdad 
he said he is putting in 16 to 18hour days and its a big 
job we receive thousands of calls a day from people with 
family or other personal interests in iraq or kuwait 
the outgoing ambassador to kuwait nat howell is to remain 
indefinitely in kuwait city it is not yet clear how the bush 
administration will respond to iraqi orders for all foreign 
diplomats to leave the city by aug 24 
meanwhile gnehms ambassadorial responsibilities have been 
confined to such duties as escorting the foreign minister of 
kuwaits governmentinexile around washington 
gnehm had anticipated that his new posting might be a troubled 
one in july 25 senate confirmation hearings he said the state 
department was deeply concerned about iraqi troop movements 
toward kuwait they are near the kuwaiti border they are 
threatening there is no question about saddams intentions 
sen daniel moynihan at the same hearing advised gnehm do 
not hesitate to tell them in kuwait that they are a very small 
weak country that is very rich and there are a lot of countries 
other countries that would like to gobble them up 
gnehm who speaks arabic and french received a master of arts 
degree from george washington university in 1968 and a year later 
joined the foreign service as a commercial officer in saigon 
vietnam 
he went on to serve as vice consul in nepal economic officer in

forest fires this week in californias yosemite national park 
have cooked up memories of 1988 when flames swept across another 
cherished piece of the west yellowstone national park in wyoming 
the fires have a lot in common both were aggravated by extreme 
drought and a decadeslong buildup of dry downed wood and fires 
in both parks are considered natural even essential ecological 
forces 
but yosemite officials are glad of one big difference they have 
so far escaped the harsh criticism that yellowstones fires focused 
on the national park services policy of letting some forest fires 
burn 
during the virtually rainless summer of 1988 fires swept 
through nearly half of yellowstones 22 million acres the unusual 
drought surprised yellowstone managers who clung for weeks to 
their standing policy of letting most natural fires burn if no 
human lives or property are threatened 
by midjuly when officials declared war on all fires within the 
park it was too late only the cooler wetter weather of autumn 
stopped the flames 
the controversy raged even longer as the park service took heat 
for what critics called a letitburn policy 
this past week in yosemite fire has charred more than 18000 
acres and caused more than 10 million in property damage while 
small compared to the yellowstone fires the fires have been 
especially destructive in the popular park where almost every 
feature of the landscape is treasured by visitors 
fire destroyed 66 homes in foresta a vacation village near the 
park four other communities were evacuated and the 759000acre 
park has been closed to visitors since friday 
but criticism of the park service has been light 
like yellowstone yosemite has a policy of letting 
lightningstruck fires burn in some areas but the fires this 
summer are burning in suppression areas where fires are fought 
automatically because of their proximity to roads or buildings 
said sue fritzke a yosemite fire official 
there was no question of policy at all she said 
it also helps that californians are more accustomed to drought 
and wildfire she said while yellowstones fires were a 
hundredyear event the yosemite fires are the result of a 
fouryear statewide drought and are by no means californias worst 
blazes this summer 
california was made to burn fritzke said people here 
understand that fire is a part of the ecosystem 
in both parks officials blamed the intensity of the fires on 
100 years of unenlightened management you always thought fires 
were bad and you put them out that was in the days before we 
understood the role fire plays in forest ecology said joan 
anzelmo a yellowstone spokeswoman 
by not allowing periodic small fires to sweep the forest clear 
of fallen dead wood and underbrush managers set the stage for 
huge destructive fires that practice changed in the early 1970s 
but theres still a buildup of downed wood and underbrush left over 
from earlier days 
huge sequoias in yosemite for example have survived 2000 
years of periodic fire and drought but they are susceptible to 
intense crown fires that roar through the canopy of the overgrown 
forest so crews this week sprayed the majestic sequoias with flame 
retardant chemicals 
normal fire policy is on hold in both parks in yosemite 
managers are waiting for more manpower and cooler weather before 
resuming theri controlled burns in yellowstone all blazes have 
been fought since 1988 pending adoption of a new stricter fire 
management plan due out next year 
officials in both parks said fire demonstrates natures amazing 
recuperative ability after the 1988 fires yellowstone researchers 
watched in wonder as plants poked up through ash and wildlife 
wandered back to begin a new cycle of life 
in yosemite this week the persistence of human nature was also 
apparent 
doug martin a foresta resident whose home burned down is 
calling neighbors this week to tell them of damage to their homes 
most of them dont care so much about how the town looks or if its 
safe to return martin said their first question is are we going 
to be allowed to rebuild

supporters of sen jesse helms have filed a 
complaint with the federal election commission over a boycott of 
philip morris products by gay rights groups 
the complaint filed by an independent group called reelect 
jesse helms says homosexual groups are acting as a political action 
committee in boycotting marlboro cigarettes and miller beer both 
made by philip morris inc 
the boycott was called because philip morris political action 
committee has contributed to helms reelection campaign 
while economic boycotts may be considered lawful as a means of 
political protest newspaper articles submitted with the 
complaint leave no doubt that the true purpose and intent of 
defendants activities extend beyond acts of protest to the defeat 
of senator jesse helms for reelection says the complaint filed 
last week 
because none of the groups are registered as political 
committees efforts promoting the boycott amount to an improper 
spending of funds to influence an election the complaint alleges 
the complaint names act updistrict of columbia and act upsan 
francisco which are aids activist groups with gay rights 
components as well as the dallas gay tavern guild the dallas gay 
alliance and the tarrant county texas gay alliance 
kate raphael a member of act upsan francisco who helped 
organize the boycotts said the group was assured by its attorneys 
that the boycotts comply with federal elections laws 
weve been assured that what were doing is most certainly 
permissible with the fec ms raphael said what it does make 
clear is that this action is having the desired effect by hurting 
helms campaign 
helms angered gay activists this year by criticizing national 
endowment of the arts grants for a robert mapplethorpe photography 
exhibit that included photos of homoerotic acts and naked children 
the exhibit by the late mapplethorpe led helms to propose 
restrictions on federal support of art deemed obscene or offensive 
helms also has been a vocal critic of any federal spending on 
aids education that might condone or promote homosexuality 
the fec complaint is at least the second filed by helms 
supporters in the past week 
state gop chairman jack hawke last week filed a complaint with 
the commission asking that it investigate any relationship between 
the national abortion rights action league and the campaign of 
harvey gantt helms democratic opponent in november 
hawke questioned an ad by the league that criticized helms 
opposition to abortion hawke asked the fec to investigate whether 
the ad is an independent expenditure or whether it is connected to 
the gantt campaign 
gantt campaign manager mel watt denied any connection between 
the campaign and the ad

two grape growers have been charged with 
passing off inexpensive wine grapes as premium varieties 
brothers nick and frank bavaro who own vineyards and a grape 
brokerage in escalon in the san joaquin valley are at the center 
of a statewide grape scandal 
an indictment charged them with conspiracy mail and wire fraud 
and false statements to the united states bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms in connection to the sale of wine grapes to 
seven northern california wineries 
the indictments from a federal grand jury were issued late last 
week 
if convicted of all charges each faces a maximum of 130 years 
in prison and fines up to 65 million 
lawyers for both brothers declined comment 
according to the indictment inexpensive grapes such as 
valdepena and french columbard were sold as expensive zinfandel 
chardonnay and other varieties the bavaros made 400 to 1200 per 
ton for grapes that usually sell for 100 to 200 per ton 
the brothers allegedly lied about at least 6500 tons of wine 
grapes valued on the wholesale market at about 4 million 
among the wineries that purchased the grapes in question were 
the delicato vineyards in manteca the lost hills winery in acampo 
and the robert mondavi winery in oakville

iraqs saddam hussein facing us and arab troops at the saudi 
border today sought peace on another front by promising to 
withdraw from iranian territory and release soldiers captured 
during the iraniraq war 
also today king hussein of jordan arrived in washington seeking 
to mediate the persian gulf crisis president bush on tuesday said 
the united states may extend its naval quarantine to jordans red 
sea port of aqaba to shut off iraqs last unhindered trade route 
in another mediation effort the soviet union said today it had 
sent an envoy to the middle east on a series of stops to include 
baghdad soviet officials also said soviet women children and 
invalids would be allowed to leave iraq 
president bush today denounced saddams ruinous policies of 
war and said the united states is striking a blow for the 
principle that might does not make right 
in a speech delivered at the pentagon bush seemed to suggest 
that american forces could be in the gulf region for some time 
no one should doubt our staying power or determination he said 
the us military buildup in saudi arabia continued at fever 
pace with syrian troops now part of a multinational force camped 
out in the desert to guard the saudi kingdom from any new thrust by 
iraq 
in a letter to president hashemi rafsanjani of iran read by a 
broadcaster over baghdad radio saddam said he will begin 
withdrawing troops from iranian territory on friday and release 
iranian prisoners of war 
iran said an iraqi diplomatic delegation was en route to tehran 
to deliver saddams message which it said it would review with 
optimism 
saddam appeared to accept a border demarcation treaty he had 
rejected in peace talks following the august 1988 ceasefire of the 
eightyear war with iran 
the move seemed aimed at heading off more trouble with iran 
which had condemned iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 but also 
criticized the multinational force dispatched to saudi arabia 
saddam said he sought to turn the gulf into a lake of peace 
free of foreign fleets and forces that harbor ill intentions 
against us 
in other developments 
the pentagon said that defense secretary dick cheney is 
considering urging bush to order a national callup of armed forces 
reserves for active duty because of the drain on units sending 
soldiers abroad bush can call up to 200000 reservists for up to 
180 days without seeking congressional approval 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said special 
ambassador mikhail sytenko left tuesday for consultations with the 
governments of syria jordan egypt and other arab countries 
sytenko a former deputy secretarygeneral of the united nations 
is also expected to visit baghdad gremitskikh said at a regular 
news briefing today 
the outlook darkened for about 3000 americans caught in iraq 
and kuwait when saddam sent his forces into the small oilrich 
sultanate 
the iraqi ambassador to greece said in athens the americans and 
other stranded foreigners could leave as soon as the threats from 
the united states and its allies are eliminated abc quoted an 
iraqi foreign ministry official in baghdad as saying americans in 
iraq are restrictees who will stay there until the crisis ends 
the soviet foreign ministry said soviet women children and 
invalids would be permitted to leave iraq spokesman yuri 
gremitskikh said the first group of 230 evacuees was assembling in 
baghdad today but evacuation plans were hampered by desert heat 
and lack of transportation 
nearly 9000 soviets were among the hundreds of thousands of 
foreigners trapped in iraq and kuwait iraq has agreed to allow all 
880 soviets in kuwait to leave but only by a 1200mile road route 
through iraq and to the iraqjordan border 
the british foreign office said today conditions in kuwait 
appear to be deteriorating there have been reports of wholesale 
looting but food and gasoline were still available said a 
spokesman who by custom was not identified banks remained closed 
the iraqi ambassador to venezuela said on tuesday that iraq 
would retaliate against venezuela and other opec oil cartel members 
if they boost oil production to fill the gap created by blocked 
supplies from iraq and kuwait with kuwait now annexed iraq 
has control of 20 percent of the worlds oil reserves a steep rise 
in world oil prices followed the kuwait invasion 
the un security council on aug 6 ordered a global embargo on 
trade with iraq as punishment for seizing kuwait bush then sent 
us troops and planes to saudi arabia saying iraqi troops massed 
nearby in kuwait threatened saudi arabia and its vast oil reserves 
twelve arab league nations voted for an arab force to protect 
saudi arabia with the vanguard of syrias contingent arriving 
tuesday according to diplomatic sources in riyadh the saudi 
capital 
egyptian and moroccan troops are already there 
the predominantly moslem nation of bangladesh said today its 
troops would join multinational forces in saudi arabia the size of 
the contingent was not disclosed 
turkey and saudi arabia in effect shut down iraqs major oil 
outlets through those countries but according to jordanian 
officials a smaller line into jordan remained operating 
truckloads of goods rolled into iraq from jordan on tuesday and 
iraqibound cargo was unloaded from ships at the red sea port 
ofaqaba despite the unordered sanctions 
king hussein was reportedly carrying a message to bush from 
iraqs saddam with whom the king met monday the monarch will meet 
bush on thursday in kennebunkport maine 
crown prince hassan king husseins brother and political 
adviser was asked today about the message the king was said to be 
carrying in an interview from jordan on abc he declined to 
discuss details but said i dont think that his majesty would 
be traveling at this crucial moment if the iraqi leadership did not 
have a rational approach to the future 
a cbs news report citing unidentified jordanian sources said 
that saddams message called for an international conference to be 
convened to discuss an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait in exchange 
the buildup of us forces in the region would halt bush however 
says he sees no shortterm hope for a diplomatic solution to the 
gulf crisis at least until economic sanctions force saddam to 
withdraw his army 
bush held out the prospect of more aid to jordan if it 
cooperates with the trade embargo 
on tuesday the united states and soviet union conferred in 
washington on putting an antiiraq naval blockade under a united 
nations umbrella 
the united states has provided most of the naval vessels so far 
to block iraqi trade with britain west germany and australia 
among the other nations lending support at sea 
the embargo is meant to cripple iraq by cutting off its exports 
of oil and imports of food and military supplies iraq imports 
about threequarters of its foodstuffs 
us allies and other un members have objected that the 
security council embargo resolution did not specifically authorize 
such a naval operation 
bush told a news conference on tuesday that the naval barricade 
now in force might be extended to jordans aqaba if it is a hole 
through which commerce flows in and out of iraq 
in saudi arabia today is the eighth day of desert shield 
the operation designed to confront an estimated 200000 iraqi 
soldiers now in kuwait iraq boasts an army of 1 million members 
at least 50000 us troops are expected to be committed to desert 
shield within weeks including marines army air assault forces 
paratroopers and infantry 
iraq said it invaded kuwait because of disputes over oil and 
money it accused kuwait of deliberately slashing iraqi oil 
revenues by overproducing oil and driving down prices among other 
charges 
iraq has 17 million residents and kuwait about 19 million

tens of thousands of east german farmers 
protested today on the square where communism was toppled to demand 
protection from freemarket forces crushing their industry 
late in the day east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
fired four ministers who dealt most closely with the nations 
crumbling economy 
dismissed were finance minister walter romberg agriculture 
minister peter pollack economics minister gerhard pohl and justice 
minister kurt wuensche 
pollack presides over the economic sector of the nation that has 
been hardest hit by east germanys shift to a free market 
the estimated 30000 farmers who converged on east berlins 
alexanderplatz were part of a nationwide series of strikes 
at the protest farmers waved banners demanding protection from 
western competition and black flags of mourning to protest what 
they said was the imminent death of their industry 
ending agriculture with a clearance sale read a large 
greenandwhite banner spread high above the crowd a reference to 
the slashed prices at which farmers must now sell their goods 
just a few hours before de maiziere announced his removal 
pollack was pelted with eggs and tomatoes when he tried to speak to 
the protesting farmers 
the protest was the biggest yet among east german farmers the 
most militant and hardesthit section of the countrys troubled 
economy 
the economic merger of the two german states on july 1 opened 
the floodgates to western competition and east german grocery 
stores have been filling their shelves with western products 
the large sovietstyle collective farms that once had a captive 
market now are forced to price their products at market levels and 
many are unable to meet their formerly subsidized payrolls 
experts say up to half of the collectives which employ more 
than 800000 people are essentially bankrupt and doomed to fail 
soon up to 70 percent of the market has been lost economists say 
rainer prizkow who works on a pig farm in the city of 
neuruppin said his operation has sold no pork in the last month 
we wont survive the winter he said 
arno mittendorf held up a redandgold banner awarded to his 
collective by the former communist regime two years ago because the 
farm had the highest production in its district of neubrandenburg 
mittendorf an agricultural economist said production is the 
same but little is sold 
we can only pay our workers through september he said 
experts say up to 4 million of east germanys 88 million 
workers could lose their jobs as the nation makes the transition to 
the free market 
almost 1 million workers are either jobless or working shorter 
hours at lower pay under a west germanfinanced program to keep 
workers targeted for layoff on the job 
romberg a member of the leftleaning social democrats who are 
uneasy coalition partners in de maizieres broadbased government 
often clashed with the christian democrats who dominate the cabinet 
pohl is a christian democrat and the other two are not aligned 
with a party 
romberg has been accused of overstating east germanys economic 
situation and once predicted that the country would experience a 
hot autumn a reference to unrest prompted by high unemployment 
expected in the fall

operations he said 
he said an unspecified number of iraqi students were studying at 
a moscow military academy most of them are about to graduate and 
we will have to see what will become of them 
moscow has maintained it prefers a political solution to the 
crisis over a military solution and has called for an expanded un 
mediation role 
it has refused to consider participating in a multinational 
force or naval barricade of iraq unless sanctioned by the united 
nations however it has sent two warships to the region to protect 
commercial shipping and has supported an economic embargo by 
cutting arms supplies to iraq 
we do not support any unilateral actions aimed at establishing 
a sea blockade that some countries are considering now politburo 
member gennady yanaev told a news conference any solution by 
force might provoke unpredictable consequences we do not want 
those consequences to occur

automotive output dropped sharply and stalled 
overall industrial production in july the government said 
wednesday although it noted the economy continued its slow growth 
in most other manufacturing areas 
the federal reserve said that while overall output was unchanged 
from june excluding motor vehicles industrial output rose 02 
percent last month about the same rate of growth that has been 
evident so far this year 
in another report wednesday pointing to continued growth the 
commerce department said business sales were up 10 percent in 
june while inventories fell 04 percent 
if inventories were to rise excessively in relation to sales it 
could cause production cutbacks and job layoffs as businesses 
attempted to sell off the backlog 
its modest growth michael k evans head of evans 
economics inc a washington forecasting firm said of both 
reports not very exciting but not recession numbers 
nevertheless evans and other analysts pointed out the july 
report preceded the iraqi invasion of kuwait in august and they 
questioned the impact of the subsequent rise in oil prices on 
economic growth later this year 
while weakness in auto sales has been a major factor 
contributing to the overall sluggishness of the economy this year 
economist michael p niemira of the mitsubishi bank in new york 
said he expects a strong increase in vehicle production this month 
were going through an intentional car buildup in the third 
quarter niemira said pointing to a backlog of just 55 days 
supply compared to the normal 6065 day supply 
evans said he thought the auto industry was positioning itself 
for a possible strike when the big three labor contracts expire 
this fall 
the fed report also cited a falloff in production of stone clay 
and glass products as further signs of weakness in the construction 
industry as well 
overall industrial production has fallen just twice so far this 
year 10 percent in january and a slight 01 percent in april 
but the rates of growth in the other months have been less than 1 
percent including a 04 percent gain in june 
production in manufacturing plants making both durable and 
nondurable goods inched down 01 percent in july after a 03 
percent gain a month earlier that was even weaker than the 05 
percent advance first reported 
output of durable goods motor vehicles and other bigticket 
items expected to last at least three years fell 04 percent and 
offset a 04 percent advance in june 
manufacturing of nondurable goods such as food and clothing was 
up 03 percent after a 02 increase a month earlier 
output at mines jumped 10 percent after a flat june while 
utility production was off 04 percent after a 19 percent gain a 
month earlier 
the fed said its industrial production index in july stood at 
1099 percent of its 1987 base the same level as the previous 
month 
the fed also said the operating rate of the nations factories 
mines and utilities which usually move in tandem with industrial 
production slipped 02 percentage point to 834 percent the 
operating rate measures not only output but also changes in 
productivity levels 
the operating rate at factories producing durable goods fell 05 
percentage point to 816 percent while the rate at plants making 
nondurable goods was unchanged at 839 percent 
the operating rate at mines was up 11 percentage point to 902 
percent while it slipped from 862 to 857 percent at utilities

saudi military officers said wednesday they 
have no qualms about fighting fellow arabs if iraqi forces invade 
their desert kingdom one pilot declared that if saddam hussein 
wants to fight we will fight to the death 
several saudi pilots interviewed by us reporters said they 
were prepared to defend their nation if the iraqi president 
launches an attack their squadron commander said his ustrained 
pilots were so eager to take on the iraqis that we have to put a 
leash on them we have to put a leash on me 
asked about the possibility of fighting fellow arabs one pilot 
said 
its not that its a matter of pride we are a nation that is 
not willing to start a fight but we will fight to protect the 
sovereignty of our country and we will win 
another pilot commented im a soldier when i go to fight an 
enemy is an enemy 
added a third nobody likes war but if he wants to fight we 
will fight to the death 
the pilots were interviewed at a saudi air base under ground 
rules that prevent the journalists flown to saudi arabia by the 
pentagon from disclosing the size or location of us and saudi 
troop deployments only commandlevel officers may be quoted by 
name 
the bases commander brig gen turki bin nasser a member of 
the saudi royal family told the reporters 
we would not like to see arabs fighting arabs but if we have 
to we will do it if anybody wants to come to the kingdom and 
attack we will fight to defend ourselves 
no arab nation had taken up arms against other arabs in modern 
times until iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
the saudi pilots all spoke english and were all trained in the 
united states 
before the meeting with turki the journalists were allowed into 
saudi jet hangars and maintenance facilities that officials said 
are offlimits to many saudis 
the journalists saw further evidence of the growing us 
presence including the firstever field deployment of the patriot 
surfacetoair missile system transport planes land day and night 
bringing in heavy artillery and other equipment to reinforce 
american units deployed after saddams army overran kuwait 
turki said that saudi american and british pilots were 
conducting joint missions but that many command responsibilities 
have yet to be worked out we hope the higher authorities will 
solve the problems of command control he said 
a squadron commander said the three nations pilots have been 
flying as a single force under a single command 
from the first day they arrived here that plan had to be 
implemented before we leave the ground the commander said 
defense secretary dick cheney plans to visit saudi arabia later 
this week presumably to discuss command questions 
president bush committed us forces to saudi arabia to protect 
the kingdoms oil fields the worlds richest and to back up his 
call for iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
american troops are equipped with masks and special suits to 
protect themselves against iraqs formidable supply of chemical and 
gas weapons but turki questioned saddams ability to effectively 
use such weapons 
as far as we know he doesnt have means of delivery with 
ballistic missiles but he has the means if they are carried by 
aircraft the general said 
air to air i have no problem he added meaning he believes 
us saudi and british air defenses can intercept any iraqi plans 
carrying chemical bombs 
the saudi air force is equipped with american f15s and f5 
fighters awacs radar planes and c130 transports plus 
britishmade hawks lightnings and tornadoes 
turki said saudi arabia needed help from the united states and 
other nations simply because of iraqs huge army if you face a 
millionman army you have to have a large enough force to deter it 
and to fight it if you need to he said 
he said the threat of an attack by iraq remains significant 
citing iraqi defensive positions set up near the saudikuwaiti 
border 
one saudi pilot trained in san antonio texas called the iraqi 
air force quite strong but no match for a joint saudiusbritish 
defense 
a squadron commander who said he received his first training in 
selma ala said iraqi plans have been spotted near the border 
with kuwait but none has crossed into saudi airspace 
i dont think it wise for them to cross the border he said 
we will react to that im confident that we could inflict 
heavy damage

prime minister lothar de maiziere on 
wednesday fired four cabinet ministers who had dealt closely with 
the nations crumbling economy they included the agriculure chief 
who earlier was pelted with eggs by angry farmers 
the fired officials were finance minister walter romberg 
economics minister gerhard pohl justice minister kurt wuensche and 
agriculture minister peter pollack 
hours before de maiziere announced the dismissals pollack tried 
to speak to thousands of protesting farmers on east berlins main 
square he was shouted down with cries of bandit and dog 
protesters hurled eggs and tomatoes during the melee pollack 
was hit on the head by a farmer who grabbed a reporters 
microphone he was unhurt but the rear window of his car was 
smashed 
the fired finance minister is a member of the leftleaning 
social democrats who are uneasy coalition partners in de 
maizieres broadbased government he frequently clashed with the 
christian democrats who dominate the cabinet 
pohl is a christian democrat the other two fired ministers are 
not aligned with a party 
romberg has been accused of overstating east germanys economic 
woes and once predicted that the country would experience a hot 
autumn a reference to unrest that could be prompted by high 
unemployment expected in the fall 
farmers have been especially hardhit by east germanys shift to 
a free market after four decades of socialism 
on wednesday about 50000 farmers converged on the 
alexanderplatz the sprawling east berlin square where protests 
last year helped topple communist rule they were among hundreds of 
thousands of farmers who took part in a series of twohour strikes 
rallies and other protests across the country 
the farmers waved black flags to mourn their dying industry and 
listened to farm leaders demand an economic bailout from both 
german states which are expected to unify by years end 
the economic merger of the two german states july 1 opened the 
floodgates to western competition and east german grocery stores 
have been filling their shelves with western products 
the bloated sovietstyle collective farms that once had a 
captive market now are forced to price their products at market 
levels and many are unable to meet their formerly subsidized 
payrolls 
farmers are sitting on thousands of tons of unsold pork beef 
produce and grain 
experts say up to half of the collectives which employ more 
than 800000 people are essentially bankrupt and doomed to fail 
soon up to 70 percent of the market has been lost economists say 
rainer prizkow who works on a pig farm in the city of 
neuruppin said his operation has sold no pork in the last month 
we wont survive the winter he said 
arno mittendorf held up a redandgold banner awarded to his 
collective by the former communist regime two years ago because the 
farm had the highest production in its district of neubrandenburg 
mittendorf an agricultural economist said production is the 
same but little is sold 
we can only pay our workers through september he said 
edgar mueller president of an association of farm collectives 
demanded 22 billion to 25 billion in aid for this year 
officials in both german states say the inefficient overstaffed 
farms must change to model the leaner privately run operations in 
the west 
protests also were reported in the cities of rostock dresden 
halle gera erfurt and suhl 
several highways were blocked by tractors and other farm 
equipment 
nationwide up to 700000 farmers took part in the twohour 
strikes the east german news agency adn said 
officials say other sections of the economy will quickly follow 
the plunging fortunes of the agriculture industry 
experts say up to 4 million of east germanys 88 million 
workers could lose their jobs as the nation continues its move to a 
market economy at an unprecedented pace 
almost 1 million workers now are either jobless or working 
shorter hours at lower pay under a west germanfinanced program to 
keep workers targeted for layoff on the job

a combination of rising business sales and 
falling stocks on shelves and back lots in june put inventories at 
their most favorable level in at least six years the government 
said wednesday 
its a rather impressive decline in inventories said 
michael k evans head of evans economics inc a washington 
forecasting firm one of the reasons we start a recession is that 
inventories get out of line and theres no evidence of that 
happening 
it means theres room for more growth if sales hold added 
michael p niemira an economist at mitsubishi bank in new york 
who said the inventory correction that began at the beginning of 
the year apparently continues 
in fact niemira said the decline in inventories combined with 
strong sales probably means a much better balanced economy in the 
second quarter than the government first estimated last month 
the commerce department said wednesday that sales jumped 10 
percent in june to a seasonally adjusted 5444 billion the same 
rate of increase as in may the advances were the strongest since 
february when sales rose 14 percent and regained a 10 percent 
decline in april 
inventories meanwhile dropped 04 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted 7973 billion down 31 billion from may when 
inventories posted a 05 percent advance it was the largest drop 
since a similar 04 percent decline in february 
the combination produced a 146 ratio of inventories to sales 
the lowest ratio since this series began in 1982 a commerce 
spokesman said the ratio means it would take 146 months to 
exhaust the backlog of goods at the june pace the ratio stood at 
149 in both april and may 
if inventories were to pile up excessively while sales slowed 
it could prompt businesses to cut back purchases resulting in a 
drop in production and job layoffs 
in its initial estimate of secondquarter growth the commerce 
department reported last month the 12 percent gain in the gross 
national product was due almost entirely to a big buildup in 
business inventories other major components of the economy 
declined 
the initial report on the gnp the nations total output of 
goods and services will be revised twice including the first 
reexamination on aug 24 when the june salesinventory report is 
taken into account 
wholesalers showed the biggest sales gain in june 17 percent 
while retailers posted a 11 percent advance and manufacturers a 
05 percent increase 
wholesalers had a 08 percent decline in inventories followed 
by a 05 percent drop by manufacturers retail inventories on the 
other hand edged up 01 percent

iraqi authorities have told us envoys that 
new guidelines are being prepared governing travel rights of 
the estimated 3000 americans stranded in kuwait and iraq the 
state department said wednesday 
privately us officials said they doubted that the rule 
changes would permit the americans to leave besides the americans 
more than 2 million other foreigners have been detained within the 
borders of the two countries since the iraqi invasion two weeks ago 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said an iraqi 
foreign ministry official informed a us diplomat in baghdad on 
tuesday that the new guidelines would be issued 
we are waiting right now ms tutwiler said 
she continued to refuse to describe the americans as hostages 
and she dismissed as pure semantics an iraqi officials 
description of the americans as restrictees 
whatever terms the iraqis use it doesnt change the facts we 
have been telling you for days these people are restricted from 
leaving she said there is no secret about this the world 
knows it finally they are admitting behavior that is contrary to 
all international norms 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater attached no significance 
to the iraqi officials use of the word restrictees 
thats not an official description and not what the government 
has told us said fitzwater who spoke to reporters while flying 
with president bush back to kennebunkport maine 
the iraqi official told abc news on tuesday the americans would 
not be allowed to leave kuwait and iraq until the current crisis 
ends iraqs ambassador to the united states mohamed sadiq mashat 
has said the americans will be allowed to leave in due time 
ms tutwiler said iraqi officials have been giving contradictory 
information about the status of the americans she said the 
administration has been avoiding the term hostage because the 
iraqis have made no demands for their release and they are not 
bound and gagged 
iraqi authorities have closed airports and borders to most 
foreigners since the invasion of kuwait on aug 2 ten americans 
connected to the us embassy in baghdad were allowed to leave last 
saturday and another group was expected to be allowed out soon 
about 500 americans are estimated to have slipped out of kuwait 
circumventing the iraqi travel ban the state department has been 
discouraging americans from trying to leave since a british citizen 
was shot to death during an escape attempt last weekend

irans spiritual leader wednesday called 
the stationing of us forces in saudi arabia an insult to the 
moslem people of that country tehran radio reported 
speaking at a religious gathering in tehran ayatollah ali 
khamenei said the united states was using iraqs invasion of kuwait 
as a pretext to strengthen its military presence in the region 
lashing out at saudi arabia for inviting the us forces 
khamenei said those governments which invited the us forces to 
their countries are devoid of grassroots support and do not 
command the backing of their peoples 
this is the reason they are unable to defend themselves he 
added 
he said the us military presence in saudi arabia was an 
insult to the moslem people of that country 
they will have to pay a dear price for the bullying us 
military forces he said 
khamenei also condemned the west and arab countries that backed 
iraq in its eightyear war against iran and said global 
arrogance and reactionary regimes of the region maintained an 
inhumane silence during the eightyear incursion against iran 
iran often refers to the united states and the west as global 
arrogance 
khamenei made his comments before iraq offered to seek a formal 
peace treaty to end the iraniraq war according to the islamic 
republic news agency 
some analysts fear that antiamerican radicals in iran will 
pressure the government to back iraq in the current gulf crisis to 
help force the us military out of the region 
iranian officials have criticized iraq for its aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait but have also denounced the dispatch of foreign forces 
to the region 
kuwait and saudi arabia were baghdads largest financial backers 
during the iraniraq war extending an estimated 30 billion to 
iraq in loans for its war efforts

the bush administration is considering the 
first callup in more than 20 years of the nations weekend 
warriors the reservists the pentagon has come to rely on to back 
up its fulltime military men and women 
defense secretary dick cheney discussed the reserves question 
with bush in a private meeting at the pentagon wednesday but the 
defense secretary has not decided on a recommendation said marlin 
fitzwater the white house press secretary 
the issue is politically sensitive because of the public 
perception that a reserve mobilization is tantamount to a 
declaration that the nation is on a war footing 
more than 20000 activeduty us ground forces already are in 
saudi arabia as part of operation desert shield to help deter an 
iraqi attack on the desert kingdom the pentagon has contingency 
plans to deploy as many as 250000 troops 
some reservists called to active duty would be deployed to us 
military installations and ports to help with the transportation of 
troops and equipment to saudi arabia while others would make the 
7000mile trip as part of the us combat force 
the president has the authority to activate as many as 200000 
reservists for 90 days he can extend the period an additional 90 
days without declaring a national emergency 
reservists perform a wide range of combat roles on the ground 
at sea and in the air 
military officials said the us forces in saudi arabia will be 
seriously hobbled if at least some of the nations 12 million 
army navy and air force reservists are not mobilized 
the last time that reserves were ordered to active duty was in 
1968 when president johnson called up 35280 reserves after the 
start of the tet offensive in vietnam and the seizure by north 
korea of the surveillance ship pueblo those reserves served on 
active duty from january 1968 to december 1969 
most reservists train for one weekend a month in addition to a 
twoweek training session each year some work fulltime with 
activeduty units as civilians but also perform their reserve 
training others are not obligated to train at all 
some military officials said they foresaw at least a partial 
mobilization of reservists although a pentagon spokesman maj 
doug hart said no decision had been made 
the services have come to depend on reserve forces for a wide 
variety of military missions 
the army for example relies on reservists to fill 80 percent 
of its combat service support units including medical specialists 
and engineers its armored divisions typically include two brigades 
of activeduty soldiers and one brigade of reservists 
the us army cannot sustain a major deployment except with 
great difficulty without them said one army strategist who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity 
reservists served voluntarily during the us invasion of panama 
last december and others volunteered for minesweeping operations 
when the united states began escorting kuwaiti oil tankers in the 
persian gulf starting in 1987 
about 1000 members of national guard units already have 
participated in the saudi arabian deployment as volunteers no 
guard or reserve units have been ordered to active duty hart said 
the largest contingent of reserve forces is the army national 
guard with 457000 members according to pentagon figures there 
are 319000 members in the army reserve 151000 in the navy 
reserve 116000 in the air national guard 83000 in the air force 
reserve and 43000 in the marine corps reserve 
in addition to those nearly 12 million reservists the services 
have 460000 people in the individual ready reserve and the 
inactive national guard these are former activeduty personnel who 
could be called on in a national emergency but are not trained as 
extensively 
reservists are most often called on to assist in natural 
disasters for example air force reserve c130 hercules transport 
planes from the 913th tactical airlift group in pennsylvania flew 
relief missions after the san francisco earthquake last october

consumers will see some relief from record 
meat prices as production increases next year the agriculture 
department said wednesday 
retail pork prices are expected to decline 1 percent to 3 
percent in 1991 from this years record level the departments 
economic research service said poultry prices may be down 4 
percent to 6 percent 
the 1991 forecast was based on indications that farmers will 
boost livestock production in response to favorable returns this 
year 
however beef production is not expanding enough to keep up with 
population growth so further price increases can be expected next 
year but the report said 1991 retail beef prices may rise only 1 
percent to 2 percent 
in 1990 the report said retail pork prices are expected to 
climb an average of 12 percent from last year 
overall 1990 poultry prices which include broilers and

europe remains united on economic sanctions 
against iraq but divided over the usled military response to 
iraqi president saddam husseins invasion of kuwait 
there has been a notable lack of enthusiasm in europe for 
joining the usled multinational force to defend saudi arabia 
only britain and the netherlands have committed troops 
support for the sanctions meanwhile is virtually unanimous and 
is the first major issue on which eastern europe and western europe 
have been united 
geographically europe is a strategic link in the military 
operation but there are worries about how severely that link may 
be tested in coming days 
spain portugal italy germany and greece have given the united 
states access to some bases to use for the persian gulf operation 
that contrasts with the situation in april 1986 when only britain 
allowed us planes to use bases for the bombing of libya 
denmark is permitting its merchant ships in the gulf to act as 
supply vessels for the multinational force 
but italy belgium and spain while preparing or sending 
warships to the eastern mediterranean are waiting at least until 
tuesdays paris meeting of the ninenation west european union 
before making any commitment to the multinational effort belgium 
said it wants the union the main european pillar of the north 
atlantic treaty organization to assume a more active role in 
coordinating a european contribution 
italy president of the 12nation european community cannot 
remain in the rear guard commentator antonio maccanico wrote in 
a pageone opinion piece in il messaggero the romebased national 
daily 
germany in a unique position because its constitution bars the 
military from operating outside nato territory remains split over 
sending ships to the gulf chancellor helmut kohl was quoted as 
saying west german minesweepers would join a european naval group 
sent to the gulf but foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
remains opposed on constitutional grounds 
some greeks including former premier andreas papandreou have 
expressed fears of retaliation if they go beyond the letter of the 
un security council resolution barring trade with iraq 
francis tusa european editor of armed forces journal 
international said there has been some serious concern in europe 
that the americans are going in feet first gung ho 
in their drive to put teeth into the sanctions the united 
states and britain have declared their navies are ready to prevent 
ships from carrying goods to and from iraq australia has said its 
ships are ready to do the same 
we are determined not to see sanctions busted sir crispin 
tickell britains ambassador to the united nations said wednesday 
but france and the soviet union formerly iraqs main arms 
suppliers have said the un security council must decide when any 
interdiction takes place both have sent sizable naval forces but 
refuse to participate in any barricade without un authorization 
gennady yanaev the politburo member responsible for 
international affairs for the soviet communist party told a moscow 
news conference wednesday that economic sanctions should be given 
time 
i emphasize any solution by force might provoke unpredictable 
consequences he said we believe that common sense will 
triumph without any military force 
the independent a leading british daily said a us barricade 
not authorized by the un would risk breaking the broad 
coalition that made the embargo possible and thus jeopardize the 
embargo itself 
but the daily telegraph a conservative newspaper said unless 
goods are stopped and sanctions enforced they are worthless 
if that can be done under a un mandate so much the better 
if not then we should accept the necessity for the american 
british and australian navies to do the job on their own the 
telegraph said

in a small office off forbes field 
volunteers answer telephone calls aroundtheclock for relatives of 
airmen who have gone on active duty with the kansas air national 
guard because of the mideast crisis 
sometimes the callers want to know whether fighting has broken 
out sometimes they want to know things like how to unplug a 
stoppedup sink 
whatever arises well find a cure for it said a volunteer 
named vicki whose husband has gone on active duty members of the 
support group have decided not to give their last names for the 
time being 
ive had calls from family members who are very distressed 
about the situation said captain d l mitchell chaplain for 
the 190th air refueling group a unit of state guard we have a 
barrage of calls after each presidential announcement 
last week gov mike hayden approved a department of defense 
request allowing 500 members of the unit to go on active duty after 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait the unit has 955 members including 
about 300 people who are full time 
on saturday three of the units kc135 aerial tankers left 
forbes field reportedly for saudi arabia although national guard 
officials declined to comment the tankers refuel jet fighters and 
bombers while aloft 
most national guard airmen serve one weekend a month and two 
weeks during the summer the prospect of going on active duty 
during a national crisis doesnt occur to many people when they 
sign up mitchell said 
many left spouses children and jobs behind them 
mitchell acknowledges that some wives are a bit dazed by the 
developments telling him i was not ready for this 
frequently he invites them to join the family support group as 
volunteers so they feel like they are part of the effort 
we have more help than we can use but we use all the help we 
get said vicki 
capt john andrews family support coordinator for the kansas 
national guard said he receives many questions about benefits and 
insurance in some cases wives of airmen who have gone on active 
duty might not have paid the bills and need advice on how to do it 
he said 
members of the 190th come to topeka from all over kansas and the 
surrounding states including one person from colorado springs

the communist partys top ideologist appealed to 
the nation wednesday to stop a series of attacks on statues of 
vladimir lenin the founder of the soviet union 
politburo member and party ideology chief alexander s dzasokhov 
told viewers of the nightly television news program vremya that 
the partys secretariat held a very serious and worried 
discussion wednesday on the various assaults on lenin monuments 
in recent weeks monuments to lenin have been destroyed in 
dozens of towns in the republic of georgia vandals have disfigured 
statues from the baltic sea to the pacific and authorities in the 
republics of latvia lithuania georgia moldavia and the ukraine 
have acted to dismantle them by legislative means 
this weeks edition of moscow news reported that in the town of 
petropavlovskkamchatsky in the soviet far east a statue to 
lenin was defiled by someone who scrawled the word hangman on 
it in white paint city police chief ivan dankulinets said the 
local prosecutors office and kgb is investigating but no one has 
been arrested 
despite the changes that have taken place under mikhail s 
gorbachev with previous leaders such as josef stalin and leonid i 
brezhnev being officially denounced lenin remains a sacred almost 
grandfatherly figure to many soviet citizens 
there has been a stream of telegrams and messages from soviet 
citizens censuring the defilement of monuments to the founder of 
our state and they have called for urgent measures to stop it 
dzasokhov said 
he compared the attacks on lenin statues to the destruction of 
temples and churches during the tragic years of the 1930s under 
stalin 
dzasokhov said the party secretariat would push for legislation 
to protect the statues as cultural and historic monuments 
the secretariat also called on the foreign ministry and the 
ministry of culture to hold talks with authorities in eastern 
european nations to obtain guarantees that monuments memorial 
plaques and museums connected to soviet history in those countries 
will be adequately protected the tass news agency reported 
as communists have lost power across eastern europe the past two 
years statues to soviet figures such as lenin have been removed 
sometimes with decorum and sometimes with disrespect 
dzasokhov singled out for criticism those local authorities in 
soviet republics who have decided to dismantle the monuments 
through legislation 
tass reported the party secretariat noted that city councils in 
the lithuanian city of kaunas as well as the ukrainian cities of 
ternopol and chervonograd had ordered that lenin statues be taken 
down thereby demonstrating disrespect not only for the soviet 
state founder but also for history itself 
last month the ternopol city council voted 640 with 21 
abstentions to remove the statues of lenin and karl marx the 
father of modern communism by sept 21 in time for the citys 
450th anniversary the city reportedly is seeking to sell the 
statues 
the moscow city council now headed by radical reformers voted 
this summer to remove a huge bust of lenin from its chambers 
dzasokhov said that in the past there were people trying to 
debunk lenin in intellectual ways and in fanatical ways 
he urged public and cultural figures to fight these fallacious 
actions 
lenins name is alive and will stay alive dzasokhov 
concluded and lenins doctrine is dynamic and not a static one

energy secretary james d watkins outlined oil 
production and conservation proposals wednesday that he said by 
yearend could replace up to 90 percent of the supplies lost because 
of the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
half the saving would come only if americans accept conservation 
efforts that for example would require them to keep tires 
properly inflated and drive at the speed limit or less 
the other half achieved by stepping up domestic oil production 
could require some compromises on the environment 
this is what we should be doing at home to minimize the 
disruption that is taking place watkins told reporters 
watkins said there is no indication that president bush is 
considering relaxing rules on offshore drilling because of the 
mideast crisis the secretary said the government continues to 
consider whether the nations 587 millionbarrel strategic 
petroleum reserve should be tapped because of the disruption of oil 
from iraq and kuwait 
watkins said his proposals should not be taken to mean that the 
united states is expecting oil shortages the rest of the year the 
world has ample oil on hand he said even though the market is 
being denied 42 million barrels each day because of iraqs 
takeover of kuwait and the resulting international boycott of both 
countries oil 
the world price of oil has risen significantly since the aug 2 
invasion and is hovering about 26 a barrel nobody believes its 
going to drop precipitously watkins said 
before the invasion the united states was importing between 
600000 and 700000 42gallon barrels per day from iraq and kuwait 
or about 4 percent of total us oil consumption the list of 
proposals outlined by watkins would by the end of the year 
replace up to 550000 barrels of that he estimated 
but a lot of things would have to happen before those savings 
were realized here are items on watkins list 
boost production from alaskas north slope now 18 million 
barrels daily by 50000 barrels that could be done within 90 
days watkins said 
the department would attempt to mediate a longrunning dispute 
over whether oil from the offshore point arguello fields in 
california should be transported to refinery via pipeline or ship 
chevron oil and santa barbara county authorities welcome mediation 
watkins said if successful it could produce an extra 75000 
barrels a day within six months 
encourage utilities to switch from oil to other fuels even 
those that are more expensive saving 100000 barrels a day this 
could require relaxed environmental regulations 
boost production of naval petroleum reserve fields mainly elk 
hills calif by 5000 barrels a day by october 
ask state regulators to be more flexible in setting 
allowables determining who may extract oil from what fields 
and in what quantities this could raise 30000 barrels a day by 
yearend 
operate ethanolproducing facilities now running at 80 percent 
of capacity at full speed resulting in production of more gasohol 
and saving 10000 barrels of oil per day 
the secretarys conservation proposals are far more tentative 
nevertheless he said we must begin to get americans without 
changing their lifestyles to begin reducing consumption 
watkins estimated 
operating automobiles at proper tire pressure would save 
100000 barrels of oil a day because of improved gas mileage he 
said the department plans a campaign to have service stations make 
the point to customers 
driving at the posted speed limit or slower would save 50000 
barrels daily 
another 40000 barrels daily would be saved if only 20 percent 
of families with two cars used the more efficient vehicle over 
half of us households have two or more cars 
increased use of carpools would save 90000 barrels a day

one of every four births in the united states 
in 1988 was to an unwed mother the government said wednesday the 
1 million births to unmarried women was an 8 percent increase over 
the previous year 
the report by the department of health and human services said 
that while the rates for children born out of wedlock were highest 
among black women the rates have been rising faster for white 
mothers 
the statistics also saw a rise in births to young teenagers for 
the second straight year after declining through much of the 1970s 
and 1980s there were 338 births per 1000 population to 
teenagers ages 15 to 17 
hhs said the largest annual increase for any age group was to 
women ages 40 to 44 up 9 percent from 1987 and 20 percent over 
1985 birth rates for women in their 30s have risen more than 40 
percent since 1975 
nearly two in three births to unwed mothers was among blacks and 
it was one in three for hispanics for whites the proportion was 
nearly one out of five the overall average was one in four 
the highest levels of births to unmarried mothers continued to 
be among women ages 18 to 24 hhs said 
since unmarried mothers are much less likely than married 
mothers to begin prenatal care early the proportion of women 
beginning such care in the first trimester showed no improvement 
through the 1980s and remains at 76 percent hhs said 
the percentage was particularly low among black and hispanic 
women

after four months of patching streets 
sweeping gutters and mowing lawns inmates at a national guard 
armory have repaired something even bigger their image 
county sheriff michael ashe said wednesday hes not surprised 
that holyoke which greeted the surplus prisoners from nearby 
springfield with trepidation and a lawsuit has been won over by 
good behavior 
im just pleased that things are going well said the 
mildmannered lawman he catapulted into national news in february 
when he solved his overcrowding problems by commandeering an armory 
in springfield and refusing to budge until suitable quarters were 
found for his inmates 
ashe and state officials compromised by moving the prisoners 10 
miles to a vacant national guard armory in this western 
massachusettes town the agreement was met with horror by holyoke 
residents who feared the inmates would upset the neighborhood and 
could pose a problem for a preschool center across the street 
but those fears havent materialized said mary e kates 
director of holyokes library a few blocks from the armory 
i was a little apprehensive especially when i heard it was 
being located so close to the early childhood learning center 
said kates 
now she is full of praise for her new neighbors 
they sweep the curb and get rid of that and then theyve been 
sweeping our walks picking up any trash thats been disposed of in 
the park and theyve been edging and removing weeds she said 
ive got loads of projects 
the saga began feb 16 when ashe dug up a 17thcentury statute 
allowing sheriffs to demand aid and assistance and marched into a 
national guard armory in springfield the main city in hampden 
county stunned guard officials watched as the sheriff installed 
about a dozen prisoners 
state officials eventually decided that ashe was justified in 
taking extraordinary measures ashes centuryold jail was built to 
hold 279 inmates is under federal orders to hold no more than 500 
and had a waiting list at the time of the seizure 
when the compromise was reached angry holyoke officials filed a 
lawsuit trying to block the transfer but ashe prevailed moving in 
quietly in april 
holyoke mayor martin dunn said wednesday hes still not thrilled 
with the location of the temporary jail scheduled to be used until 
a new permanent jail is built in the county but he said hes 
dropped the lawsuit and intends to keep using the inmates for such 
projects as park renovation 
weve had them cleaning city lots filling potholes he 
said basically its been going very well its been a productive 
experience 
ashe who has a masters degree in social work has won 
accolades for his innovative jail and community programs including 
his prerelease program and a jail garden project teaming inmates 
and senior citizens 
inmates sent to the holyoke center are those who are close to 
the end of their sentences and are serving for minor offences from 
the beginning ashe called the holyoke armory a community service 
center and assured residents the inmates would bring nothing but 
good to their neighborhood

closer federal supervision is needed to avoid 
a savingsandloan style crisis among governmentsponsored 
enterprises providing lowcost loans to home buyers farmers and 
students congressional auditors said wednesday 
the government has little ability to identify prevent or 
contain the effects of the kinds of problems that have led to 
taxpayer losses in the past the general accounting office said 
in a report 
the gao as required by last years sampl bailout bill examined 
the potential for a similar crisis among eight socalled 
governmentsponsored enterprises with collective obligations of 
more than 800 billion 
it said closer government oversight was needed of three of the 
biggest sallie mae which finances four of every 10 college loans 
and fannie mae and freddie mac which together finance about one 
fourth of the nations home mortgages 
the enterprises were created by congress but earn profits for 
private stockholders they are more formally known respectively 
as the student loan marketing association the federal national 
mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corp 
while there is no evidence that any of the enterprises are in 
danger of immediate failure the gao said they have many of the 
same unhealthy incentives that existed in the thrift industry 
they are not explicitly guaranteed by the government but most 
private investors assume congress and the administration would not 
stand idly by were one to near failure 
it seems clear that the federal ties cause investors to 
behave like insured depositors who believe their investments to be 
very safe the report said 
in fact congress in 1987 approved 4 billion in 
governmentguaranteed bonds to prop up the farm credit banks and 
the banks for cooperatives which finance agriculture 
because of the perception of government backing for the 
enterprises it is easy for them to raise money even when they are 
ailing the gao said 
the enterprises can continue to borrow money in private 
markets even when performing poorly the gao said 
in financially troubled times after capital is depleted 
owners and managers may have incentives to take unusual risks in a 
lastditch effort to recover it said 
the gao recommended that private investors in the enterprises be 
required to put up more of their own money or capital to insulate 
taxpayers from risk and provide an incentive against reckless 
behavior 
and the risktaking and capital levels of fannie mae freddie 
mac and sallie mae need closer government supervision it said no 
agency oversees sallie mae while the department of housing and 
urban development oversees fannie mae and freddie mac 
the auditors expressed skepticism that hud whose mission is to 
provide americans with affordable housing could properly ensure 
the safety of fannie mae and freddie mac 
the department has not provided the kind of safety and 
soundness supervisory controls normally imposed by banking 
regulators the gao said 
the government cannot depend on the department to reconcile 
its role as a safety and soundness regulator with its role as a 
promoter of housing it said 
other enterprises included in the report were the federal home 
loan banks which provide money for home mortgages the college 
construction loan insurance association which supports 
construction on college campuses and the federal agricultural 
mortgage corp which supports farming 
the gaos findings are similar to the conclusions in a treasury 
department study issued in may in that report the bush 
administration backed a controversial proposal to require 
governmentsponsored enterprises to meet the standards applied by 
independent creditrating agencies to the healthiest private 
corporations with triplea ratings 
the gao said it would present more specific recommendations when 
it issues a second report due next may wednesdays report was 
issued three months late

the soviet union on wednesday restored the 
citizenship of an undetermined number of exiles and among those 
reported on the list were nobel prizewinning authors joseph 
brodsky and alexander solzhenitsyn 
in his second major human rights decree in three days president 
mikhail s gorbachev canceled the decrees on citizenship 
concerning a number of persons who are now living abroad the 
official news agency tass reported 
foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said the order 
concerns a rather large number of people some names were 
mentioned brodsky solzhenitsyn 
i just heard that ostensibly mr solzhenitsyn got back his 
soviet citizenship but i dont know for sure gremitskikh said 
in a statement issued in her husbands name from their home in 
cavendish vt natalia solzhenitsyn said in solzhenitsyns 
case the original decree was not only a deprivation of 
citizenship but before that a forced eviction from the ussr 
that was accomplished through arrest and the accusation of treason 
since nothing has been said about that in todays resolution it 
does not apply to solzhenitsyn 
brodsky who lives in new york were not immediately available 
for comment 
the brief tass report said the order dealt with injustices 
that occurred between 1966 and 1988 but did not say if it 
affected everyone whose citizenship was revoked then nor did it 
name anyone gremitskikh said he did not know the number of people 
affected but that it was not in the thousands 
tass later reported that those people whose citizenship was 
being restored would be informed by the foreign ministry 
solzhenitsyn is the author of the gulag archipelago which 
depicted the horrors of dictator josef stalins prison camps he 
was charged with treason in 1974 stripped of his citizenship and 
expelled 
brodsky a poet and essayist was forced to emigrate in 1972 
under threat of imprisonment for his political comments 
publication of works by both solzhenitsyn and brodsky was barred 
for years in the soviet union but the restrictions were gradually 
lifted under the reform policies pushed by gorbachev who came to 
power in march 1985 
on monday gorbachev issued a decree restoring the rights of all 
victims of stalins repressions saying thousands of innocent 
people still bore a stain of injustice gorbachev said he took 
the action because our society has chosen the path of moral 
revival democracy and legality 
a 1989 soviet high school history textbook says 40 million 
people were repressed a word used to cover death 
imprisonment exile and other punishments 
under leonid i brezhnev the soviet government revoked the 
citizenship of prominent authors and artists who spoke out against 
domestic repression however gorbachev has restored the 
citizenship of such notables as cellist and conductor mstislav 
rostropovich and his wife singer galina vishnevskaya 
rostropovich who has conducted the national symphony orchestra 
of washington dc for 13 years returned to moscow in february 
for a triumphant concert he promptly held a press conference to 
call for the government to drop treason charges against 
solzhenitsyn and apologize 
wednesdays announcement said nothing about the treason charges 
against solzhenitsyn 
other exiled cultural figures have returned for visits in recent 
years under gorbachev although most have stayed in the west one 
exception was theater director yuri lyubimov who has resumed his 
job as director of moscows taganka theater 
solzhenitsyn won the nobel prize for literature in 1970 
government pressure on him increased after that and in february 
1974 he was arrested on the treason charge which carried a 
possible death sentence he was put on a plane to west germany and 
stripped of his citizenship 
solzhenitsyns opus the gulag archipelago was published in 
the soviet union last year other wellknown works include one 
day in the life of ivan denisovich and cancer ward 
brodsky was forced to emigrate in june 1972 after secret police 
gave him a choice to leave or face the consequences he 
understood the threat to mean he might face another prison term if 
he stayed 
brodsky left behind an eloquent appeal to brezhnev who was then 
soviet leader that he be permitted to return home one day 
although i am losing my soviet citizenship i do not cease to 
be a russian poet i belong to russian culture i feel part of it 
i feel bitter as i leave russia i was born raised and have 
lived here and i owe everything i have in the world to russia he 
said 
he was sentenced to five years in a labor camp in 1964 after 
being convicted in 1964 of parasitism but released after 18 
months parasitism was considered the crime of not holding a job 
many dissidents were fired barred from working and then found 
guilty of parasitism 
brodsky moved to new york and became an american citizen only a 
few of his works were published in the soviet union until the 
literary monthly novy mir printed a selection after he won the 1987 
nobel prize for literature 
moscow news reported wednesday that a book of brodskys poetry 
is being published for the first time in the soviet union the 
northwest publishing house in leningrad plans 100000 copies of the 
book the autumn cry of the hawk 
solzhenitsyn came under particular criticism in his homeland 
because he condemned not only stalin but also soviet founder 
vladimir lenin calling him evil lenin is still revered by 
most soviets

where will we draw the line in terms of this 
homosexualityheterosexuality thing said city alderman robert 
shaw who said he would introduce an ordinance banning the aids 
awareness poster 
is anything going on in this country now acceptable under 
the guise of free speech 
about 80 of the posters which depict three couples one 
heterosexual one lesbian and one gay each locked in a romantic 
kiss were displayed wednesday on buses and at transit stations 
kissing doesnt kill greed and indifference do reads the 
poster created by a new york art collective a version has 
appeared in the mass transit systems of both new york and san 
francisco 
its our way of saying were all affected by aids said gran 
fury collective member loring mcalpin 
yes we are affirming sexuality across the board said 
mcalpin we dont think its advocating a homosexual lifestyle 
the posters were approved earlier this year and refusing to 
display them would violate the first amendment protection of free 
speech said alfred savage executive director of the chicago 
transit authority 
under the law we have a requirement to post them savage 
said we have no jurisdiction over the content 
the transit authority was sued last year for refusing to post 
another aids awareness poster it deemed too blackoriented 
after the american civil liberties union filed suit the 
authority began displaying the ads said john hammell who directs 
the aclus aids and civil liberties program in chicago 
shaw said he planned to call a special city council meeting to 
discuss his proposed ordinance which would bar depictions such as 
that in gran furys poster 
this poster has nothing to do with the cure of aids he 
said it has something to do with promoting a lifestyle which i 
object to 
state rep robert regan a republican said tuesday he would 
reintroduce legislation in the illinois general assembly that would 
bar such displays of sexuality a similar bill failed this spring 
mcalpin said the poster paid for by the new yorkbased american 
foundation for aids research overcame initial objections in san 
francisco and new york 
nobody said this is great well take it there was a 
certain amount of resistance he said 
the poster is intended to address the deadly virus as an 
epidemic of corporate greed government inaction and public 
indifference she said we dont believe anyone is going to see 
that ad and change their sexual preference

experience that something is up at fort hood soldiers are updating

have been or will be deployed to the middle east 
i cant speculate on that we have no comment said fort 
hood spokesman maj jesse seigal on tuesday 
we simply havent announced anything out of fort hood a 
pentagon spokeswoman said 
the post is the largest armored post in the us and home of the 
1st cavalry and 2nd armored divisions the associated press has 
quoted an army source in washington as saying troops from fort hood 
would be deployed 
the people of killeen are sure that troops and equipment from 
their neighboring post will be involved somehow in the the persian 
gulf 
theres something going on you dont see any gis downtown 
at lunch we usually have five or six but i havent seen a gi in 2 
or 3 weeks said margaret galindo an employee at the german

a mother has been ordered not to smoke 
in front of her 5yearold son by a judge hearing a child custody 
dispute 
judge david stirling issued the ruling tuesday in superior court 
when the boys father manfred kallweit complained of health risks 
associated with inhaling secondhand smoke 
the mother anna maria de beni souza called the order crazy 
terry eagan regional vice president for the tobacco institute and 
tobacco action network said hes never heard of anything like 
this in any other part of the country 
eagan said he would have the industrys lawyers investigate the 
case the first thing that comes to my mind is the privacy 
issue eagan said 
kallweit who has joint custody of the boy asked the judge to 
impose the order after de beni souza petitioned the court for sole 
custody the petition is pending 
the ruling which bans smoking in direct presence of child 
within the home will stay in effect until the boy turns 18 or a 
higher judge overrules it 
if this is a new wave so be it said kallweits lawyer 
charles asbury i appreciate all the problems that cigarettes 
pose in the world 
the courts have regularly forbidden people to drink alcohol 
and consume drugs in child custody cases the reason being the risk 
of harm to the child smoking poses the same risk of harm 
de beni souza said shes a light smoker who goes through a pack 
of cigarettes in two or three days 
what right does the court have to dictate my behavior in the 
privacy of my own home she said this is not russia right

homeseekers flocked to the 
neighborhood surrounding the love canal toxicwaste dump wednesday 
as a state agency put nine houses up for sale but refused to 
guarantee their safety in writing 
the areas been real quiet itll be nice to get neighbors 
back said william stevenson one of about 70 people who stayed 
in the neighborhood rather than accept a government buyout during 
the late 1970s 
but environmentalists and former neighborhood residents 
denounced plans to resettle the area which became a powerful 
symbol of americas toxic waste problem when toxic chemical leaks 
drove about 2500 people away 
i think there is a very real risk said rebecca todd of the 
natural resources defense council 
the love canal area revitalization agency originally planned to 
put 10 homes up for sale wednesday but one was snapped by a 
resident of an area the government considers uninhabitable agency 
executive director william l broderick told a news conference 
about 20 people visited the agencys sales office and another 10 
called in the first four hours it was open said len rinallo the 
agencys salesman rinallo said two people had already put down 
100 deposits on houses they want to buy when the rehabilitation is 
finished 
the homes are priced at 40000 to 60000 about 20 percent 
less than comparable homes elsewhere about 250 houses in the area 
eventually will be sold 
the agency also announced that it was renaming the neighborhood 
black creek village the agency decided to borrow the name of a 
tiny local creek to help erase the areas toxicwaste image said 
agency planning director james e carr 
love canal gained notoriety after 22000 tons of dioxin pcbs 
and other hazardous chemicals dumped there 30 years earlier by 
hooker chemical co began leaking into a middleclass neighborhood 
built on top of the dump 
the 2500 people fled their homes and 240 houses and an 
elementary school were demolished more than 800 other homes have 
stood vacant since then 
the dump has been capped and a monitoring system installed but 
most of the chemicals remain buried beneath a 70acre fencedoff 
mound the area chosen for resettlement is north and northwest of 
the dump 
state studies show that it is no more contaminated than 
comparable neighborhoods elsewhere in niagara falls agency 
officials said wednesday 
its probably the safest area in the city of niagara falls 
because we know the most about it said broderick 
however broderick said the agency could not give any written 
guarantees chemical leaks would not recur 
all we have is the written assurance of the state health 
department the state environment department he said if there 
is a problem in the future im sure the state will come back and 
do as they did last time 
joseph e ceretto a 28yearold substitute teacher who 
inspected some of the homes said the lack of guarantees would not 
deter him from buying one 
he said the us environmental protection agency had deemed the 
area habitable with the continuous monitoring ill know whats 
in my backyard ceretto said 
outside the house ceretto wants to buy stood luella kenny a 
former resident whose 7yearold son died of a kidney ailment she 
blames on dioxin from the dump 
she said she didnt trust the governments assurances 
the government is fooling with people just like they fooled 
us 12 years ago telling us everything was going to be all right 
said kenny who now lives on nearby grand island 
but other onlookers such as the stevenson and his wife 
phyllis said they never believed the danger was as great as 
everyone feared 
we raised a family and they grew up and had children and now 
the children have children theyre all healthy mrs stevenson 
said 
todd of the natural resources defense council confronted agency 
officials at their news conference then held one of her own across 
the street 
she said offering the homes for sale put the agency in contempt 
of a 1985 court order her group and four others have asked a state 
judge to enforce the order and block any sales 
agency lawer paul reid said the court order only barred the 
sales until a habitability study and an environmental impact 
statement were completed and said those requirements had been met

the bush administration said wednesday it has 
asked congress to clear the sale of 46 f16 jet fighters and other 
weaponry to egypt 
a congressional source estimated the value of the package at 
nearly 2 billion 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler called the 
deal the final phase of a decadelong program to modernize and 
westernize the egyptian air force and said it was totally 
unrelated to the current crisis in the persian gulf region 
but she said as part of our response to the current gulf 
crisis we will review requests from our friends for additional 
arms sales on a casebycase basis 
rep mel levine dcalif said he had hoped the administration 
would use the gulf crisis as a time to reevaluate a policy of 
unrestrained arms sales to the region 
levine a member of the house middle east subcommittee said the 
sales had the effect of making a tinderbox more volatile 
egypt has played a leading role in the arab world in supporting 
the us economic boycott of iraq egyptian president hosni mubarak 
also sent troops to saudi arabia to assist in the defense of the 
oil fields should iraq attack 
congress was notified informally of the sale last thursday this 
started a 20day period in which congress has a chance to propose 
changes in the package 
then if both the house and senate do not vote against the sale 
within 30 days it goes through 
there is no indication so far of congressional opposition egypt 
is the only arab country at peace with israel as a result israeli 
governments have not objected to us arms sales to cairo 
the administration also is preparing to ask congress to clear 
the sale of at least a dozen f15 fighters to saudi arabia that 
could get a far different reception on capitol hill 
supporters of israel and members of congress concerned about the 
proliferation of arms in the middle east or the possibility the 
weapons could be captured by terrorists are apt to fight a saudi 
deal 
on the other hand the bush administration probably will make 
the argument that iraqs annexation of kuwait and threat to the 
saudi oilfields requires building up the saudi arsenal

portauprince haiti ap the council of state said wednesday 
it had passed a vote of no confidence in president ertha 
pascaltrouillot declaring her administration has become an 
obstacle to holding free elections 
general elections in this poor violencewracked caribbean 
country are scheduled for nov 4 but on wednesday the electoral 
council set up to oversee the voting pushed back the opening of 
voter registration from aug 19 to sept 3 
there has been much speculation that the electoral council will 
have to postpone the elections 
the 19member council of state which rules alongside mrs 
pascaltrouillot passed the noconfidence vote tuesday a 
statement released wednesday by the council did not indicate how 
members voted 
having respected none of its commitments the executive is no 
longer able to win the confidence of the people and has become an 
obstacle to the holding of genuine elections the council 
statement said 
in passing its noconfidence vote the council declared it was 
impossible to collaborate with the government but the councils 
president dr louis roy told the associated press that council 
will not resign 
it was unclear what effect the noconfidence vote would have 
although it does not oblige mrs pascaltrouillot to resign 
the vote was seen as a symbolic gesture to put pressure on mrs 
pascaltrouillot to abide by the joint governing agreement under 
which the council was to have veto power over her cabinet 
appointments and major decisions 
mrs pascaltrouillots civilian caretaker government came to 
power march 13 after a weeklong popular uprising toppled military 
ruler lt gen prosper avril 
mrs pascaltrouillot 46 a former supreme court justice 
became the first female president in haitis 186year history 
at the time she agreed to govern alongside the council of 
state whose members were appointed by civilian opposition leaders 
until after the countrys first free elections could take place 
later in the year 
the council is comprised of representatives of civic 
organizations and provincial districts 
the conflict between the council and mrs pascaltrouillot came 
to a head may 21 when the president appointed marie violene 
legagneur as finance minister without the councils authorization 
council members regarded legagneur as a sympathizer of the 
duvalier family dictatorship of jeanclaude baby doc duvalier 
who fled into exile in 1986 and of his late father francois 
papa doc 
legagneur resigned a month later 
also in june council of state member serge villard was 
assassinated by four gunmen two of whom were dressed in army 
uniforms 
in a statement of aug 7 the council accused the government of 
not pursuing the investigation of villards murder 
information minister carlo desinor said last week that the 
conflict between the council and the president stemmed from 
oversensitivity personality not political differences 
but in wednesdays statement the council accused the president 
of failing to implement the administrative judicial military and 
economic reforms that were set down as prerequisites for genuine 
elections when the caretaker government came to power 
haitis last attempt at holding free elections ended in failure 
on nov 29 1987 thugs in collusion with the army killed at 
least 34 voters at the polls halting the first free general 
elections in haiti since independence from france in 1804

rca has released a new song by elvis 
presley a poignant ballad called my happiness that had been 
believed lost an rca executive said in the late singers 
birthplace 
an 18yearold elvis recorded the song for his mother gladys on 
july 18 1953 at the memphis tenn recording service the vanity 
acetate disc for which the singer paid 398 is thought to be 
first recording by the king 
it could be called the underpinnings of rock n roll its 
still blues and country said dan wardell national director of 
catalog music for rca some have described it as the birth of 
rock n roll 
my happiness is the lead cut on rcas justreleased elvis 
the great performances a companion album to a twovolume music 
video of the same name due out friday from buena vista video 
thursday is the 13th anniversary of elvis death on aug 16 
1977 he was 42 years old 
the acetate disc had been in the possession of a highschool 
chum of presley rca obtained the license to the song 
the song was snapped up immediately for radio airplay in the 
united states and europe said wardell 
theres always extraordinary interest in anything having to do 
with elvis he said this is unusual because it was thought to 
be lost for many years 
wardell was a guest at welcoming ceremonies saturday at the 
elvis presley birthplace and park in tupelo the sentimental 
strains of my happiness how i long to be with you 
played over a speaker giving the occasion a warm ironic note 
the disc reappeared in 1988 in the possession of retired 
airline pilot ed leek who attended high school with presley 
rca was approached about it 18 months ago wardell said and it 
took that long to conclude arrangements for its release sun 
entertainment corp bought the rights to my happiness from 
leek rca obtained a license to use the song from sun entertainment 
presley recorded another song on the other side of the disc 
thats when your heartaches begin and discussions about that 
song are under way at sun wardell said 
that song needs a lot of restoration work he said 
however there is some skepticism about heartaches an 
expert hired by nbc nightly news said the aural 
fingerprints of a tape of the acetate didnt match a 1956 version 
of the same song by elvis 
wardell said we have an affidavit from marion keisker who 
was a secretary at memphis recording service that day the elvis 
presley estate says its authentic we have no reason to doubt its 
the real thing

president bushs advisory panel on the 
treatment of cancer and aids proposed major changes wednesday in 
government testing of experimental drugs to speed them to patients 
for whom time is running out 
for patients who are not benefited by approved and readily 
available medicines still unproved therapies may represent their 
only hope the panel said in its final report 
for patients who resist all available therapies new 
treatments on the cutting edge of science may represent the best 
standard of care it said 
the presidents cancer panel chaired by industrialist armand 
hammer a physician by training concluded that patients are 
willing to accept the risks associated with new and untried 
therapies 
but it said they can become more widely available only if the 
food and drug administration the agency charged with approving and 
regulating medical therapies can be allowed and is willing to 
become more flexible in implementing such innovations for 
patients for whom time is running out 
activist groups representing aids and cancer patients also have 
called for expediting and expanding use of experimental treatments 
the panel made these recommendations and findings 
the secretary of health and human services should establish a 
permanent policy and oversight committee to monitor the fdas 
regulation and approval of drugs and biologic therapies for human 
use 
expedited approval of cancer and aids drugs could result if the 
fda relied more frequently on the opinion of qualified experts 
serving on agency advisory committees 
the fda should consider modifying its current criteria for 
approval of new drug applications the present standard proof of 
improved survival might well be changed to include complete or 
partial positive responses in patients whose cancers have resisted 
all current therapies 
the panel said drugs that produce tumor regression in more than 
20 percent or 30 percent of patients in approval trials should be 
approved for marketing 
congress should give prompt attention to fdas inadequate 
resources staff and facilities 
fda studies designed to determine if a drug under investigation 
is superior to that of a prescription drug may no longer be 
required for that drug to receive market approval 
the fdas advisory committee system for human prescription 
drugs should be fundamentally restructured with panels permitted to 
bypass intermediate staff and report directly to the fda 
commissioner the panels should have an independent staff and 
control their own agendas and priorities 
the panel also recommended that companies sponsoring 
experimental drugs have the option of paying the fda for outside 
review of the applications by qualified and unbiased experts in 
order to resolve the fdas problem of increasing responsibilities 
and decreasing staff 
medicare medicaid and private insurers should give identical 
coverage for experimental drugs and all related medical care for 
aids and cancer patients the committee said 
we endorse the development of communitybased clinical trials 
that permit widespread access to investigational drugs without 
sacrificing statistical analysis of drug effectiveness and thus 
that can lead to early regulatory approval the panel said 
hammer said he hopes the report will prove useful in improving 
the federal drug review process and in reducing delays in 
marketing new drugs thus benefiting cancer and aids patients 
throughout the country 
the study was initiated in june 1988 at the request of president 
bush then serving as vice president

the government imposed travel 
restrictions on romanian tourists after hundreds of romanians were 
turned back into czechoslovakia by east german authorities the 
official ctk news agency said wednesday 
as of monday romanian tourists traveling to czechoslovakia will 
have to show an official invitation a voucher proving they have 
paid for their stay or a valid visa for a country of final 
destination ctk said 
however it said the measures do not mean cancellation of the 
mutually agreed visafree travel between the two countries 
ctk said that starting thursday romanian tourists going to east 
germany through czechoslovakia must produce the required papers at 
the czechoslovakhungarian border or be turned back 
the new regulations came after a growing number of romanian 
tourists sought to stay in czechoslovakia after being denied 
admission to east germany 
romania has the weakest economy among the six eastern european 
countries which are trying to introduce marketoriented reforms 
many romanians augment their incomes by buying products abroad 
that are scarce at home and selling them on the black market 
leading romanian authorities to impose stricter customs regulations 
thousands of others have sought to emigrate in hopes of finding 
better living conditions and jobs 
east german authorities now require romanians to produce an 
official invitiation or proof that they possess enough hard 
currency to pay for their stay romanian visitors also must hold 
roundtrip tickets 
east german border officials have turned back about 800 
romanians at the czechoslovak border over the past few days the 
mlada fronta newspaper said most of those sent back were romanian 
gypsies

panama said wednesday it will 
continue to allow iraqi and kuwaiti ships through the panama canal 
citing the 1977 treaties with the united states guaranteeing 
neutral operation of the waterway 
foreign minister julio linares said panama is putting the panama 
canal treaties above all other international agreements including 
those under the un charter last week the un security council 
imposed a mandatory economic embargo against iraq for its aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
according to the panama canal commission 27 kuwaiti ships 
passed through the canal last year only two ships flying the iraqi 
flag have made the passage in the last seven years the commission 
said 
in an interview linares said the united nations could have no 
legal objection to panamas decision to abide by the 1977 treaties 
the 1977 agreement declares the neutrality of the canal so 
that in times of peace as in times of war it will remain secure 
and open to the peaceful transit of the ships of all nations so 
that the canal and the isthmus of panama will not be the target of 
reprisals in any conflict between other nations of the world 
the panama canal commission issued a brief statement wednesday 
saying there has been no change in current policy in respect 
to the transit of ships through the panama canal 
president guillermo endara said that both the united states and 
panama agree that ships should be able to pass through the canal 
no matter what their nationality 
the united states and other western nations have amassed a large 
naval force in the middle east to stop shipping into and out of 
iraqi and kuwaiti ports 
the panama canal treaties call for control of the waterway to be 
turned over to panama at the turn of the century with that nation 
guaranteeing the neutral operation of the canal 
in 1979 panama took control from the united states of the canal 
zone which extends for five miles on either side of the waterway 
between the pacific ocean and caribbean sea

although ted koppel and cbs anchorman dan rather 
have been allowed in iraq abc news president roone arledge said 
wednesday he doubts this means a wave of other tv correspondents 
will be allowed in 
i dont get that sense and our people there dont get that 
sense said arledge he also said iraq didnt seek out abc to be 
the first network we just worked like hell to get in there 
he spoke a day after koppel anchor of abcs nightline 
became the first us network correspondent allowed in iraq since 
its aug 2 military takeover of kuwait 
rather who arrived wednesday in baghdad filed his first 
reports by phone because no tv satellite uplink was available cbs 
said 
koppel also had to do that tuesday but on wednesday was able to 
send via satellite a videotaped interview with iraq foreign 
minister tariq aziz 
we are not going to yield to pressure we are not going to 
yield to this kind of intimidation iraqi foreign minister tariq 
aziz said wednesday in a segment of the interview broadcast on 
abcs evening news iraq is not going to initiate a war the 
interview was carried on abcs nightline 
arledge speaking at a press lunch said he doubted any 
correspondent including koppel would be granted an interview with 
iraqi leader saddam hussein simply because he rarely gives any 
husseins only previous us television interview was in july 
with abcs diane sawyer however this time arledge i dont 
think anybodys going to get hussein 
he said the iraqis set no conditions in return for allowing 
koppel and an abc team in but have restricted what his camera 
crews could shoot there and once stopped him from taking a still 
photograph on a street 
he noted that similar restrictions apply in saudi arabia which 
is allied with the us in opposing iraqs takeover of kuwait and 
has allowed a large us military buildup on its soil 
iraqi officials generally havent limited koppels movements 
arledge said but made him leave a baghdad hotel where 36 americans 
and two british citizens are being held they were brought there 
from kuwait after the iraqi invasion 
koppel began pressing for entry into iraq last week when he 
talked with the countrys foreign minister after a news conference 
in cairo and on sunday got jordans king hussein to intervene for 
him arledge said 
before abc could transmit from iraqi tv facilities it had to 
get a waiver from the us government and intelsat the 
international satellite cooperative arledge said 
this was because payments for use of iraq satellite facilities 
are barred by the united nations economic sanctions against iraq 
cable news network and nbc still are trying to get 
correspondents into iraq

rebels evacuated most foreigners from 
monrovias battlefront in an 18vehicle convoy on wednesday but 
prevented scores of guineans and nigerians from leaving 
lt gen arnold quainoo commander of a west african 
peacekeeping force set to sail to liberia said a confrontation 
with charles taylors rebels while they were holding west africans 
could make his mission a disaster 
president blaise compaore of burkina faso where some rebels say 
they were trained said he opposed the military intervention by 
fellow west african leaders and warned of a possible spillover 
of liberias violent civil war 
insurgents of taylors national patriotic front invaded from 
ivory coast on dec 24 to oust what they called the corrupt 
government of president samuel doe fighting between taylor a 
former doe aide accused of embezzlement and a splinter group led 
by former army officer prince johnson has prolonged the conflict 
the fighting has killed 5000 people mostly civilians 
taylor had said he would allow the nigerian and guinean 
embassies to evacuate personnel but that was before both countries 
sent soldiers to join the west african army taylor spokesman tom 
woewiyu says nigeria and guinea whose leaders are friends of doe 
are trying to use the west african force as a cover to get troops 
into liberia to bolster the besieged president 
nigerian and guinean troops are mobilizing in freetown capital 
of neighboring sierra leone with soldiers from gambia ghana 
sierra leone and togo forming a force to exceed 2500 men they 
have orders to fight to force an end to the war 
taylor threatens to attack any foreign troops sent to liberia 
he excludes 2100 us marines on standby on warships off monrovia 
and in the capital itself evacuating americans and some other 
foreign nationals and protecting a skeleton embassy staff and us 
installations 
washington says it will not intervene militarily to end the 
conflict 
on wednesday taylors rebels escorted a convoy of foreigners 
and liberians from the west german moroccan and egyptian embassies 
west german ambassador juergen gehl told reporters as he left 
that 11 germans two moroccan diplomats the egyptian ambassador 
four lebanese and 24 liberians were heading for neighboring ivory 
coast 
but about 60 guineans including the ambassador were refused 
permission to join the convoy gehl said 
other diplomats said about 1400 people at the nigerian embassy 
also had to stay behind 
hundreds of guinean troops have massed with tanks on the border 
with liberia since guinea accused taylor rebels of making 
crossborder raids and killing liberian refugees of the mandingo 
tribe 
the war has degenerated into a tribal conflict with rebels 
killing civilians of does krahn tribe and mandingos accused of 
supporting him soldiers have slaughtered people of the gio and 
mano tribes to which most rebels belong 
compaores warning that the conflict may spill over was 
contained in a letter to gambian leader sir dawda jawara head of a 
liberia mediation committee set up by the economic community of 
west african states 
quainoo commander of the multinational force told reporters 
wednesday a ceasefire was a precondition for the kind of 
peacekeeping operation he would like to command 
he spoke before leaving freetown for banjul the gambian 
capital where taylor has promised to meet jawara to discuss the 
war and his opposition to the intervention force 
does troops control a few square miles of monrovia most of the 
capital is in the hands of johnsons men taylors fighters hold 
most of this country of 23 million people 
in washington the state department said us forces off liberia 
evacuated a total of 314 people as of last monday most of them

ruling liberal party

emperor akihito on wednesday led the nation in 
honoring the war dead with a minute of silence exactly 45 years 
after his father broadcast the japanese surrender that ended world 
war ii 
prime minister toshiki kaifu urged japan not to repeat the 
tragedy of the war and pointedly did not visit a shinto shrine 
where many of japans war dead including 14 convicted highranking 
war criminals are enshrined 
this was to avoid offending nations that suffered from japanese 
aggression in world war ii 
akihito flanked by empress michiko bowed deeply before a 
wooden pillar that stood as a monument to the dead and a huge 
display of white and yellow chrysanthemums he prayed for world 
peace during a memorial ceremony at the budokan martial arts hall 
near the imperial palace 
about 7600 survivors of japans war victims also participated 
in the nationally televised ceremony 
it is a very important task for each of us to establish 
lasting peace in order not to repeat the tragedy of the war 
kaifu told the hushed crowd 
earlier in the day all members of the cabinet visited the 
yasukuni shrine except kaifu the chief cabinet secretary and the 
foreign minister 
no prime minister since yasuhiro nakasone in 1985 has visited 
the shrine in an official capacity nakasone discontinued the 
visits because of opposition from china and other neighboring 
nations 
i think it is a natural expectation for the head of the state 
to pay respect to those who are sent to a war and lost their 
lives said a disappointed tsutomu hata of the governing liberal 
democratic party who was among nearly 200 members of parliament 
who visited the shrine 
about a dozen riot police vehicles surrounded the shrine to 
prevent violence between small groups of demonstrating rightists 
and leftists each group blared messages through loudspeakers that 
were virtually impossible to understand because of the high volume 
police later reported that three undetonated bomblike devices 
were found around the television station that broadcast the 
memorial ceremony 
no group claimed responsibility for planting the devices 
officials said but local media speculated that extremists who 
oppose the monarchy may have been responsible 
the late emperor hirohito posthumously known as showa 
announced to a stunned nation aug 15 1945 that japan would 
surrender to the allies the united states had just leveled the 
cities of hiroshima and nagasaki with atomic bombs 
akihito who is hirohitos son led the minute of silence at 
noon it even interrupted action at the national high school 
baseball tournament in osaka one of japans most popular sporting 
events 
i renew my deep sorrow when i think of many people who lost 
their precious lives in the last war and their survivors i 
pray for further development of our country and for world peace 
with all the people in this country and i would like to present my 
condolences from the bottom of my heart to those who died on the 
battlefield and in the war the emperor said 
at a separate ceremony japan socialist party chairwoman takako 
doi urged the government to admit japans responsibility as an 
aggressor in world war ii 
japan has been issuing stronger expressions of remorse for its 
actions in asia during the war 
when south korean president roh taewoo visited this spring for 
example akihito acknowledged that japan had caused the korean 
people a great deal of suffering 
while the emperor did not explicitly apologize for japanese 
actions kaifu did 
in the days leading up to the anniversary newspapers have run 
accounts from readers recalling the horrors of the atom bombings 
and the hardships during the war the englishlanguage japan times 
newspaper ran a series of accounts of atrocities during the war 
but most of the japaneselanguage media still shy away from such 
reports

a beirut newspaper said thursday that 
kidnappers were paid a 55 million ransom for freeing two swiss 
hostages officials in switzerland however have denied making any 
payoff 
the conservative alanwar daily citing anonymous sources in the 
southern city of sidon did not say who paid the ransom for freeing 
emanuel christen and elio erriquez kidnapped in october 
in another development irans deputy foreign minister thursday 
called for a goodwill gesture from the west to help gain the 
release of other hostages in lebanon the islamic republic news 
agency reported 
the iranian agency monitored in nicosia said mahmoud vaezi 
told visiting swiss envoy klaus jacobi the no 2 official in the 
swiss foreign ministry that a goodwill gesture by the west would 
help materialize the freedom of all hostages whether iranian or 
others held by proiranian groups in lebanon 
switzerland represents american interests in iran due to the 
absence of formal washingtontehran ties so vaezis call was 
believed directed at the united states 
in its report on the ransom alanwar said erriquezs release 
monday was delayed for several hours because of the kidnappers 
lastminute effort to increase the ransom 
the kidnappers insisted on collecting the full amount and that 
the share of the third party which worked as a mediator be added to 
the previous amount the source said without further elaboration 
erriquez 24 an orthopedic technician was held by a group 
calling itself palestine revolutionary squads christen 33 also 
an orthopedic expert was released six days earlier both worked 
for the red cross in lebanon 
alanwar said the kidnappers insisted on getting a lump sum and 
not installments which prolonged erriquez release to give time 
for the mediators to contact the international committee of the red 
cross and the swiss government it did not elaborate 
both swiss and red cross officials have denied making any deals 
for the hostages release 
fourteen westerners including six americans are believed held 
hostage in lebanon most by proiranian extremists longest held is

in a bold stroke iraqs saddam hussein held out a hand of 
friendship wednesday to old enemy iran proposing a powerful 
partnership against the americans who are fishing in dirty 
waters in the persian gulf 
the iranians sounded receptive to making peace with iraq a 
potentially troubling note for the us military operation in the 
mideast irans spiritual leader condemned the united states as a 
hellish power trying to dominate the region 
baghdad radio meanwhile said arab and palestinian groups were 
forming in the region to launch suicide attacks on us ships 
in washington president bush traveled across the potomac to the 
pentagon nerve center of the us mideast mission and declared 
that no one should doubt our staying power in confronting iraqi 
expansionism 
the american way of life is threatened by saddams growing 
control of the regions oil the president told an assembly of 
military men and women 
bush and pentagon planners were considering escalating the us 
mobilization by calling up thousands of reservists to reinforce the 
regular soldiers sailors and airmen streaming into saudi arabia to 
face off with the iraqi army which two weeks ago invaded and 
occupied neighboring kuwait 
a fresh us navy battle group steamed from east coast ports 
toward the troubled mideast led by the aircraft carrier kennedy 
i really dont want him to go one 15yearold said of his 
father a petty officer on the kennedy but the boy said he 
told me what was happening and explained why he had to go 
some in the task force had firsthand knowledge of the gulfs 
unseen dangers in 1988 one of the vessels the guided missile 
frigate uss roberts was heavily damaged by an iranian mine in the 
gulf 
as saddam maneuvered and the pentagon mobilized immediate hopes 
for a negotiated solution focused on jordans king hussein who 
piloted his own plane to washington late tuesday reportedly 
bearing a private message for bush from the iraqi president 
the royal mediator and the us chief executive will meet 
thursday at bushs oceanside retreat in maine 
concerns heightened daily over the estimated 3000 american 
civilians trapped in kuwait and iraq on wednesday turks indians 
iranians soviets and other foreigners were reported departing 
kuwait and iraq or arrangements were announced for their 
departure but the americans were still barred from leaving and 
looked increasingly like insurance for the iraqis against attack 
the iraqis said they seized kuwait on aug 2 to settle economic 
and territorial grievances they quickly annexed the small 
wealthy oil state 
the un security council has ordered a punitive trade embargo 
against iraq and bush has dispatched thousands of us troops to 
saudi arabia to defend that oil kingdom against a perceived threat 
of iraqi aggression which he said would also threaten us oil 
supplies and the us economy 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz accused the united states of 
pushing through the embargo for the purpose of starving and 
intimidating the people of iraq which is a proud people and 
rejects humiliation and subjugation 
the iraqi people the arab nation will reject by all 
legitimate means the attempts of the united states to extend its 
domination over the world by force intimidation and deception 
aziz said in a letter to un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar the text of the letter was released wednesday 
under growing economic and military pressure saddam made a bold 
move wednesday offering iran favorable terms for final peace in 
the devastating 198088 war between iran and iraq 
in a letter to irans president hashemi rafsanjani the iraqi 
president said his country beginning friday would withdraw its 
troops from iranian territories occupied in the war and free the 
tens of thousands of iranian prisoners of war it has held in 
exchange for a peace treaty 
saddam called for a new life of cooperation between iran and 
iraq so we can deter all those fishing in dirty waters and 
cooperate to turn the gulf into a lake of peace free of foreign 
fleets 
in tehran a spokesman for irans supreme national security 
council said the proposal would be reviewed with optimism the 
iranian foreign minister called the iraqi concessions irans 
greatest victory irans cabinet met late wednesday to consider 
the plan 
although tehran has condemned iraqs invasion of kuwait irans 
spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei on wednesday directed new 
bitterness toward the united states and the saudi and other oil 
autocracies in the region 
speaking to a religious audience the moslem cleric said foreign 
powers were in the region only to fight over material interests 
and resources he said a hellish establishment was dominating 
the world 
if saddam wins iranian agreement it would at least relieve the 
military pressure on the iraqiran border and allow him to divert 
troops to his southern frontier with saudi arabia at the most a 
deal might allow isolated iraq to conduct trade through iran and 
give saddam a potential military partner for harassing or 
confronting us forces in the region 
in the face of international boycott iraqs main outlet now is 
jordans red sea port of aqaba but bush is expected to press king 
hussein to close that seaport to iraqi goods otherwise the us 
navy will probably set up a maritime cordon off aqaba to block 
iraqi trade 
trucks many with distictive yellow iraqi license plates on 
wednesday were seen streaming northward out of aqaba on the road to 
amman and presumably continuing hundreds of miles on the desert 
highway to baghdad 
said one official at an aqaba port facility they appear to be 
in a hurry to get as much iraqbound cargo to that destination 
before the sanction loophole at aqaba is closed 
american and british warships maintained a close watch on sea 
traffic wednesday in the persian gulf radio monitors said the 
british frigate hms jupiter for example called two or three 
commercial ships in the morning to ask their destination and cargo 
the us navy has massed 27 ships including three carriers in 
the gulf the nearby arabian sea and the red sea 
we are not going to yield to pressure we are not going to 
yield to this kind of intimidation aziz the iraqi foreign 
minister said wednesday in an interview with abc news iraq is 
not going to initiate a war 
however radio baghdad in a broadcast later wednesday said 
arab and palestinian suicidal groups arrived in the gulf area and 
said that they are ready to launch suicidal attacks against the 
american ships which are imposing blockade against iraq the 
broadcast monitored in washington on shortwave radio gave no 
details 
the bush administration asserts a right to interdict vessels 
under the un security council resolution ordering the antiiraq 
economic sanctions but even some us allies disagree saying the 
council itself must approve a blockade 
australias foreign minister gareth evans backed down tuesday 
from previous government statements that three australian warships 
headed for the region would stop vessels violating the sanctions 
instead he said the australians would only interrogate and warn 
such ships against breaking the embargo 
the state department seeking to end such misunderstandings has 
been conferring with representatives of other major powers about 
putting the mideast naval forces under a un flag or un command 
the security council may take up the issue after hearing a 
report friday on international compliance with the embargo

the vast majority of nations say they are 
complying with a un embargo on iraq but envoys of some poor 
countries said wednesday they may seek compensation from the world 
body to offset financial losses 
the un ambassadors said no country has formally sought 
assistance from the un security coucil to make up for the loss 
they incurred by joining the sanctions however they said 
unofficial talks on the issue are under way 
a un committee is studying compliance of the 159 un members 
with the embargo that body is to meet friday and a report is 
expected later this month 
meanwhile libyan leader moammar gadhafi called on wednesday for 
the security council to hold a meeting in geneva to condemn us 
military intervention in the persian gulf in order to prevent a 
needless calamity 
un officials said that so far no council meeting had been 
scheduled and consultations on gadhafis request were expected 
any troops that are in the gulf that do not carry the banner 
of the united nations or that are not formed by the security 
council and under its command are regarded as troops of colonialist 
invasion and should be resisted gadhafi told the libyan news 
agency in a dispatch monitored in rome 
virtually all envoys who have commented publicly stressed their 
nations were honoring the sweeping sanctions 
jordanian diplomats declined comment citing the delicacy of the 
topic and the arrival of king hussein to discuss the crisis 
thursday with president bush jordan which has close ties with 
iraq has not put the sanctions into effect and has allowed 
commercial traffic bound for iraq to use its red sea port of aqaba 
bush has threatened to close that port 
on aug 9 bulgaria informed un officials it was honoring the 
embargo in spite of the serious difficulties that this would 
create for the bulgarian economy 
ambassador dimitar kostova said in a letter that bulgaria 
reserves its right to address the security council under the un 
charter 
under charter article 50 any state that faces special economic 
problems because of security council enforcement action may consult 
the council about a solution relief is not specified but could 
include exemption and appeals for compensation 
the council adopted mandatory economic sanctions against iraq on 
aug 6 banning all imports exports and even indirect financial 
dealings with iraq and kuwait which iraq invaded aug 2 the 
sanctions includes most food deliveries but exempt medical supplies 
and under special humanitarian circumstances food 
ivan sotirov another bulgarian un envoy emphasized wednesday 
that bulgaria was living up to its commitment to observe the 
quarantine but we must admit we feel the pinch he said in an 
interview 
bulgaria is a major transporter and transit point for commerce 
between europe and the gulf region iraq owes bulgaria about 12 
billion sotirov said 
iraq was paying bulgaria mostly in oil deliveries he said and 
this year bulgaria stands to lose an estimated 140 million because 
all commerce has stopped with iraq and kuwait bulgaria also has 
doubled the price of gasoline because of the oil shortage he said 
sri lankan ambassador daya perera said his government was also 
supporting the embargo 
but he added that sri lanka faces a tremendous hardship as a 
result and may eventually seek un relief he said iraq buys about 
25 percent of sri lankas tea and provides oil to his nation

president bush authorized naval commanders to 
use the minimum force necessary to interdict shipments to and 
from iraq a senior administration source said wednesday 
the presidents message was expected to be sent thursday to the 
us navy fleet in middle east waters the source said 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
instruction described a stepbystep approach under which 
commanders should first request ships to halt and to seek their 
cooperation before taking any more aggressive steps those steps 
could include attempting to block the ships passage or firing 
warning shot across the bow 
a minimum use of force might include steps taken to disable the 
ship so that it couldnt continue on its way the source said 
it will tell them to use the minimum force necessary said 
the source 
ever since bush has spoken of his barricade against iraqi 
commerce administration officials have said they hoped the mere 
threat of a possible confrontation would deter unarmed merchant 
vessels from carrying iraqi cargo 
in a pep talk address at the pentagon earlier wednesday bush 
vowed to use the massive infusion of us military might in the 
region to put a stranglehold around iraq and force it to abandon 
kuwait 
together we must ensure that no goods get in and that not one 
drop of oil gets out he said 
the source said the president had actually approved the minimum 
use of force a couple of days ago but that the directive had 
gone through a rigorous intraagency approval process 
departments such as state and commerce were brought into the 
process because of the delicate nature involved in dealing with a 
situation where shipments might be carried by ships flagged by 
third countries 
a preliminary message was sent out to commanders late wednesday 
but was pulled back for revision and the formal final directive was 
scheduled to be sent to the fleet early thursday the source said 
the official did not define what the problem was describing it 
only as a minor glitch 
bush spent 90 minutes at the pentagon getting an update on 
operation desert shield from defense secretary dick cheney and the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen colin powell 
the issue of a possible callup of the nations reservists was 
discussed but no decision has been made the source said 
another matter still under study is the development of a joint 
command for the tens of thousands of us soldiers and their 
international counterparts sent to saudi arabia to defend the 
oilrich kingdom from the threat of an attack by iraq 
there has been progress made but were not there yet on that 
one the source said 
underlining the presidents words the aircraft carrier john f 
kennedy and its eightship battle group left norfolk va for the 
middle east and pentagon officials said aircraft leaving soon would 
include f117a stealth fighters 
defense department sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said 22 of the radarevading fighters which saw their first combat 
in panama last december would leave for the persian gulf on 
thursday 
meanwhile the state department said more than 2 million 
foreigners including about 3000 americans were being kept from 
leaving iraq and the small nation it invaded two weeks ago a 
spokeswoman said iraq had promised new guidelines on 
foreigners travel rights but officials said privately they 
doubted any changes would mean the americans could leave 
noting that an iraqi official had been quoted as referring to 
the foreigners as restrictees state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler said finally they are admitting behavior that 
is contrary to all international norms however presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said merely thats not an official 
description and not what the government has told us 
bushs remarks came one day before he was to meet with jordans 
king hussein who has continued to allow supplies to flow into 
saddam husseins iraq despite a united nations trade embargo the 
king who has put himself forward as a mediator in the crisis was 
said to be carrying a message from saddam to the presidents maine 
vacation home on thursday 
fitzwater said the white house had no indication there was such 
a message but was willing to listen to hussein 
the spokesman said saddams public peace overture toward 
longtime adversary iran doesnt appear to have any impact on 
the mideast crisis except as another effort to separate the 
countries and create a diversion 
bush also will meet with saudi arabias foreign minister prince 
saud alfaisal and ambassador prince bandar bin sultan on thursday 
following his talks with king hussein fitzwater said wednesday 
night 
the meeting will allow further consultations between the two 
countries as agreed to by the president and king fahd the 
spokesman said 
bush returned to kennebunkport maine shortly after his 
pentagon remarks less than 24 hours after arriving in washington 
for meetings a news conference and wednesdays speech 
the president also was expected to get cost estimates for the 
huge operation and to discuss whether to call up the nations armed 
forces reserves and national guard to bolster units depleted by the 
gulf crisis fitzwater said later that cheney had not reached a 
decision on the reserves 
in his speech bush offered no new information on the questions 
of how many us troops will go to the mideast and how long they 
will stay in the event fullscale conflict the pentagon has made 
plans to ship up to 250000 soldiers to the region 
defending his decision to dispatch tens of thousands of us 
combat troops and dozens of warships halfway around the globe bush 
said nothing less than world order is at stake 
bush denounced what he called saddams raw territorial 
ambition and attempts to portray the conflict as a holy war of 
arab against infidel a struggle between the haves and the 
havenots 
the president said the us action was important to maintain 
access to energy resources that are key to americas way of life 
and to the worlds economy 
but he also said we are striking a blow for the principle 
that might does not make right kuwait is small but one conquered 
nation is one too many 
calling once again for iraqs immediate and complete withdrawal 
from kuwait the restoration of kuwaits government and the 
protection of all americans caught up in the conflict bush warned 
saddam not to doubt our staying power or our determination 
as long as iraq ignores the need for international order bush 
said peace and freedom are impossible the rule of law gives way 
to the law of the jungle 
it is saddam who invaded an arab state it is saddam who now 
threatens the arab nation he said we by contrast seek to 
assist our arab friends in their hour of need 
at the state department officials said americans stuck in 
kuwait are running out of cash and the us embassy has been 
advancing some of them money 
in iraq ms tutwiler said the 500 or so americans are able to 
move about but not to leave the country except for the 39 held 
in a hotel in baghdad 
again she cautioned against their trying to leave either 
country saying that would entail serious risk but she also 
kept to the administrations stance that the americans should not 
be described as hostages

the soviet union prepared to evacuate its citizens from iraq and 
kuwait and at least 3600 foreigners reached jordan overland from 
baghdad on wednesday western governments demanded that iraq grant 
westerners freedom to leave 
about 3000 americans 3000 britons 500 italians and more than 
450 japanese were stranded in iraq and kuwait overall more than 2 
million foreigners are in both countries 
a jordanian border official said at least 3600 foreigners from 
19 countries including poles pakistanis sri lankans and somalis 
had crossed wednesday evening at the ruweishid border post about 
200 miles northeast of amman 
no north americans west europeans or japanese were among them 
said the official who cannot be identified under standing 
regulations 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said in 
washington that an iraqi foreign ministry official informed a us 
diplomat in baghdad on tuesday that new guidelines were being 
prepared governing travel rights for the stranded americans but no 
new guidelines had been disclosed as of wednesday privately us 
officials said they doubted the rule changes would let americans 
leave 
iraqs ambassador to greece abdel fetah alkhazreji said 
tuesday in athens that americans and others could leave as soon 
as the threats from the united states and its allies are 
eliminated abc quoted a foreign ministry official in baghdad as 
saying americans in iraq were restrictees who would stay until 
the crisis was over 
ms tutwiler said we have been telling you for days these 
people are restricted from leaving finally the 
iraqis are admitting behavior that is contrary to all 
international norms 
the americans were caught in the war of nerves although the 
americans were not being called hostages us officials suspected 
that iraqi president saddam hussein might try to use them as 
blackmail if his confrontation with the united states worsened 
while most westerners are free to travel around within iraq and 
kuwait one group of 36 americans and two britons has been 
restricted to a luxury hotel in baghdad according to abc news 
an abc correspondent said the detainees in the hotel are being 
treated rather well spending much of their day at the hotel 
pool but seem to be under enormous tension and are afraid they 
will be stuck in iraq until the crisis ends 
ms tutwiler said banks in kuwait were still closed and the us 
embassy was giving cash to stranded strappedformoney americans 
an estimated 500 americans slipped out of kuwait after the aug 
2 iraqi invasion the state department has been discouraging 
americans from trying to leave since british businessman douglas 
thomas croskery 49 was shot to death while trying to flee into 
saudi arabia on saturday 
in northern england croskerys widow thelma 45 appealed to 
iraqi authorities to send her husbands body home for burial 
can they not realize that i am torturing myself that my 
husbands body is lying in the sand for days and i want him home 
she said 
iraq has agreed to allow all 880 soviets in kuwait to leave but 
only by a 1200mile road through iraq to the iraqijordanian 
border 
all soviet women children and invalids will be permitted to 
leave iraq but not soviet men officials have not said how many of 
the 9000 soviets in iraq are men 
there are 193 soviet military advisers in iraq 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said the 
first group of 230 evacuees were assembling in baghdad on 
wednesday he said intense desert heat and lack of transportation 
hampered evacuation plans 
italys foreign ministry on wednesday accused iraq of showing an 
absolute lack of respect for fundamental human rights by 
refusing to say when it would let westerners leave 
it said european community ambassadors to iraq including 
italys envoy met wednesday with foreign minister tariq aziz in 
baghdad and asked that foreigners be allowed to depart but met with 
a very disappointing response in tokyo the foreign ministry 
said iraq was asked to let japanese nationals leave after six 
japanese were denied permission to go to jordan 
about 230 japanese business people remained in iraq after all 
japanese on tourist visas were permitted to leave the ministry 
said the japanese embassy in kuwait was sheltering 246 japanese 
citizens

gov jim florio on wednesday night asked 
state residents angered by higher taxes for patience vowing in a 
rare televised address that his plans would benefit many and keep 
new jerseys economy strong 
calling the 28 billion in tax increases a good investment 
that will take time florio said it would ease skyrocketing 
property taxes and improve schools 
in his 25minute speech the governor acknowledged that his 
popularity has waned because of the proposal which prompted 
several antitax campaigns by citizens groups 
would i like to be the most popular governor in the history of 
new jersey florio asked sure who wouldnt 
but not if it means sacrificing the future for my 
grandchildren not if it means losing the quality of life we 
cherish in new jersey he said 
the democratic governor blasted his republican predecessor 
thomas h kean for leaving a 600 million budget deficit that 
florio said made tax increases necessary 
the governor who requested the primetime slot spoke from the 
studios of wwortv in secaucus across the hudson river from new 
york city his speech was carried by television and radio stations 
across new jersey 
in a republican response to the governors speech assembly 
minority leader chuck haytaian appealed to the antitax groups 
saying the tax hikes will harm the states economy 
haytaian said the increases insult the intelligence of new 
jerseyans and have spawned new jerseys summer of discontent 
florios popularity plummeted in a recent newspaper poll in what 
experts said was a tax backlash 
the governors plan included raising the sales tax from 6 
percent to 7 percent and expanded to cover previously untaxed 
products including toilet paper the sales tax and other levies 
went into effect last month and a higher income tax for about 17 
percent of the states residents takes effect next year 
the new taxes will be used to close the deficit pump more than 
1 billion in new money to schools and reduce property taxes the 
plan also includes a shifting of state dollars from richer school 
districts to poorer ones 
the new taxes passed by a wary state legislature in june have 
been sharply criticized 
youve heard about the people going around getting petitions 
signed demanding we undo whats just been done before it even 
gets a chance to work florio said well i cant help feeling 
most people are more patient they have questions not demands 
theyre not yelling theyre more interested in answers than 
confrontation 
florio denied that he lied during last years campaign when he 
said he saw no need for new taxes 
i believed we would have the surplus money governor kean said 
we would florio said i was wrong 
florio said a 274 million surplus quickly became a 600 million 
spending gap in the budget he inherited from kean forcing him to 
make cuts in state departments and raise the sales taxes and levies 
on liquor cigarettes and oil 
haytaian blasted the tax plan as one that will hurt many 
residents particularly middleclass homeowners in rich areas that 
stand to lose education dollars 
the grassroots tax revolt that is sweeping our state was born 
out of the anger and frustration of yet another political promise 
broken and yet another political promise for property tax relief 
he said

iraqs saddam hussein in a move that 
could free military manpower and ease the stranglehold of economic 
sanctions offered wednesday to make peace with his longtime enemy 
iran 
iran greeted the proposal with optimism but said a thorough 
study was needed that countrys islamic republic news agency said 
president hashemi rafsanjani and his cabinet were meeting to 
discuss the proposal 
iran and iraq never formally settled their eightyear war 
although it ended with a ceasefire in august 1988 
in his proposal the iraqi leader said he would pull troops out 
of territories seized from iran and free iranian prisoners of war 
he also suggested he was relinquishing the iraqi claim to full 
control of the strategic shattalarab waterway to the persian gulf 
those were major points of disagreement that stalled peace talks 
almost from the time they began five days after the 1988 
ceasefire 
in addition iraq allowed iranians trapped by the invasion of 
kuwait to leave irans official islamic republic news agency said 
the first of the estimated 100000 iranians in kuwait arrived in 
iran on wednesday 
the iraqi president outlined his peace proposal in a letter to 
rafsanjani a broadcaster read it over baghdad radio which was 
monitored in nicosia 
saddam indirectly called for an alliance with tehran against the 
united states saying the persian gulf should be a lake of peace 
free of foreign fleets and forces that harbor ill intentions 
against us 
the iraqi president said he was looking forward to a new life 
of cooperation on the principles of islam and respect of each 
others rights 
iran has denounced iraqs aug 2 conquest of kuwait but it has 
also criticized the buildup of thousands of western troops in saudi 
arabia to deter any iraqi attack 
irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei reiterated 
criticism wednesday of any sort of aggression in the region and 
said iran considers the presence of american forces in saudi 
arabia to the detriment of islam and moslems and against the 
islamic revolution 
his remarks were carried by the islamic republic news agency 
monitored in nicosia before the baghdad announcement 
irans press trumpeted saddams proposals with large headlines 
but one newspaper cautioned that iran should not become more 
embroiled in the gulf conflict 
peace between two regional powers is certainly conducive to 
peace stability and security for the whole region said the 
englishlanguage tehran times in an editorial made available in 
advance of publication thursday 
but the paper which often reflects rafsanjanis thinking said 
irans leaders should not allow the country to get involved in a 
crisis that might prove detrimental to our own national interest 
and security 
saddam said the troop withdrawal and the prisoner release would 
start friday he did not specify the size of the territory from 
which his troops would withdraw and the number of iraqi troops 
involved was not known 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz sent a message to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar asking him to instruct 
the head of the un iraniraq military observer group to cooperate 
with iraqi authorities in the troop withdrawal iraqi national 
radio said wednesday 
iran claims iraq holds 772 square miles of territory occupied in 
the final weeks of the war the united nations says the area is 
half that size 
in any event a peace treaty with tehran would ease pressure on 
saddam to defend the 730mile frontier with iran iraqs longest 
border 
saddam could also be hoping tehran would break with the rest of 
iraqs neighbors and allow food and other goods to pass through 
iranian territory to iraq 
but kamal kharrazi irans ambassador to the united nations 
said tehran remained opposed to the iraqi invasion of kuwait and 
would continue to abide by un economic sanctions 
we cannot accept aggression against another islamic country 
and annexation of that country to another country kharrazi told 
the bbc 
the settlement of the dispute between iran and iraq does not 
necessarily mean any sort of support or socalled help toward that 
country certainly we have our principles and we are committed 
to the resolutions adopted by the security council he said 
even if iran formally maintained an embargo a relaxation of 
military strength on the border would be a bonanza for smugglers 
the iraqi president said he wanted to settle the dispute over a 
1975 treaty that divided the shattalarab waterway which forms 
the gulf border between the nations 
saddam abrogated the treaty before invading iran in september 
1980 and had claimed full control of the shatt alarab as one of 
the main fruits of the war it remains closed to shipping 
iran immediately interpreted saddams announcement wednesday as 
dropping the claim to the full waterway foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati speaking on tehran radio called it the greatest 
victory of the islamic republic of iran in its history 
as for prisoners of war the red cross has registered 50000 
prisoners held by iran and 19000 iranians in iraqi hands but 
united nations and other officials have estimated the total number 
at 100000 some of them held since the early days of the war 
the international committee of the red cross headquarters in 
geneva said iraq had asked it to handle the repatriation beginning 
with 2000 friday

three former northwest airlines pilots used 
an alice in wonderland defense at their trial on charges they 
flew while drunk a federal prosecutor said wednesday in closing 
arguments 
assistant us attorney elizabeth de la vega said the defense 
attempted to make a routine flight look difficult and at one point 
contended it was easier to fly during an emergency 
she said the pilots also told of being sober when common sense 
and bloodalcohol tests showed obvious impairment 
it tells you a lot about the defense in this case it sounds 
like alice in wonderland de la vega told the us district court 
jury they say its hard to fly if its easy but its easy to 
fly if its an emergency 
william mauzy attorney for first officer robert kirchner said 
in his closing argument that de la vega had no evidence of alcohol 
impairment and that her case was an appeal to public fears about 
flying with drunken pilots 
what we have in this case is stealth impairment mauzy said 
impairment that hasnt been detected 
kirchner 36 of highland ranch colo captain norman lyle 
prouse 51 of conyers ga and flight engineer joseph balzer 35 
of antioch tenn have been on trial since july 25 on charges of 
operating an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol 
if convicted each man faces up to 15 years in prison and a 
250000 fine 
the three were arrested after their march 8 flight from fargo 
nd to minneapolis in tests about two hours after the flight 
kirchners bloodalcohol was 006 percent balzers 008 percent 
and prouse 013 percent in many states the legal limit for driving 
a car is 010 percent 
the case marks the us justice departments first prosecution 
under a 1988 federal law prohibiting operation of a common carrier 
while under the influence 
the law doesnt specify an illegal bloodalcohol content to 
find the aviators guilty jurors must conclude they were impaired 
by alcohol even though there were no problems with the flight 
judge james rosenbaum said he would instruct the jury thursday 
after balzers attorney bruce hanley gives his closing argument 
de la vega said she would present a rebuttal closing argument 
prouses attorney peter wold maintained that his client an 
alcoholic has a stiff tolerance to alcohol from 35 years of 
drinking 
its not hocuspocus to suggest there are different tolerances 
for alcohol wold said 
proving impairment doesnt require proof that the pilots were 
staggering or that the flight was flawed de la vega said the law 
only requires that she prove the pilots did not have the 
clearness of intellect and control that they otherwise would 
have she said 
mauzy said whats going on here is an appeal to fear its a 
scary thought to think that a pilot with a little alcohol in his 
blood would go flying 
but while the public may think its unsafe for pilots to drink 
the night before a flight mauzy said its not against the law 
there is an faa prohibition against flying within eight hours of 
drinking but the pilots are not on trial for that kirchner and 
balzer said they did not break the rule but all three were fired 
for violating northwests 12hour prohibition against drinking 
before flying

come september the networks annual banzai 
charge of new and returning shows will begin in earnest with 35 
new series on tap but dont expect a counterbarrage then of new 
shows from cable tv 
although cable now is plugged into 586 percent of the nations 
households and at least five new cable series will arrive next 
month cable networks still generally avoid the september rush 
the idea say cable executives is to avoid getting stomped by 
the megabuck watchus campaigns of abc cbs and nbc 
that is the primary reason for us says kay koplovitz 
president of usa network a cable heavyweight with nearly 53 
million subscribers we feel that were more competitive 
introducing series at different times of the year 
although the fall campaigns of the big three have become more 
frenzied in recent years as audiences defect to cable and 
independent stations cables annual watchus campaign still is 
held in april 
unlike the networks big month april is more a display of what 
cable has to offer than the premiere month for a flood of new 
series 
cable launches new programs all year around says turner 
entertainment networks president gerry hogan sounding the 
traditional slogan of his industry 
and instead of cable eventually joining the september stomp i 
think itll change the other way says hogan who runs ted 
turners tnt network and tbs superstation network 
i think the networks are going to recognize that what we do is 
more correct in the current television environment hogan says 
even though viewing levels are lowest in the summertime cable 
programmers at times premiere new shows then the idea being to 
offer an alternative to network reruns busted pilots and a few 
awful summer series 
last month for example the extrafee home box office service 
offered a sitcom dream on and the usa network began 
counterstrike an actionadventure epic costarring christopher 
plummer in his first series 
but some of the larger cable networks now appear to be gradually 
edging into the fall fray with a mix of new series and former 
network series that in precable days would have been syndicated to 
local tv stations 
example on sept 7 the usa network starts a new halfhour 
fantasy series swamp thing adding that to new episodes of 
three other existing madeforusa series including 
counterstrike another newcomer uncle pooch about a 
talking dog is due in october 
but usa also has some potent old reliables from the networks 
too arriving in september 
on monday sept 17 the unofficial start date of the new tv 
season it will start mondaythroughfriday repeats of 
macgyver later in the month it will add repeats of just the 
ten of us to its current rerun roster of crime story miami 
vice the equalizer and murder she wrote 
on sept 3 the lifetime cable network targeted at women and in 
497 million homes will premiere an ambitious doublebarrelled 
project that will be seen monday through friday evenings 
its weeknights will start with the onehour canadianbuilt 
eng which like cbs murphy brown and new wiou 
series has a tv newsroom setting eng which takes the 
drama of news seriously will be followed by repeats of nbcs 
la law 
those who denounced cbs for axing beauty and the beast 
probably will cheer the family channel next month it will run its 
first repeat of the series sept 7 and start the shows weekly run 
sept 21 
but the family channel serving nearly 53 million homes also 
has three new series arriving in september the most of any cable 
network 
two are sitcoms maniac mansion and big brother jake 
the latter features jake steinfeld bodybuilder to the stars in 
his acting debut he plays a hollywood stuntman who returns to the 
old neighborhood in brooklyn to care for a group of foster children 
old pro mickey rooney who was nominated for an oscar in 1979 as 
the trainer in the black stallion will reprise that role in 
the third new series the adventures of the black stallion 
the family channel also next month is bringing back three other 
series it premiered in past seasons rin tin tin k9 cop 
bordertown and the new version of zorro 
on the news front the arts amp entertainment network will 
premiere on sept 20 a new britishmade current events series 
world in action hosted for american viewers by bill kurtis

an indicator of smaller business optimism has 
fallen to its lowest level since 1982 suggesting the economy isnt 
likely to regain strength before the end of the year 
the indicator an index based on analysis of more than 2000 
responses from members of the national federation of independent 
business was completed before the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
developments in the mideast will undoubtedly increase 
uncertainty said william dunkelberg who interprets the results 
dunkelberg an economist is dean of temple universitys school of 
business and management 
he said the deterioration in confidence reflects an economy that 
is going down at least for the count of 2 or 3 but that no 
particular aspect of the economic situation could be blamed more 
than another 
rather said dunkelberg each index component continued to 
reflect the slow deterioration apparent in the data for some 
time an erosion he describes as slow motion 
the index begun by dunkelberg in 1974 is based on detailed 
responses regarding expected business conditions climate for 
expansion sales volume credit conditions job openings capital 
outlays inventories hiring and more 
these responses are formulated into the index which ranks 1978 
conditions as 100 it fell to a seasonally adjusted alltime low of 
811 in the second quarter of 1980 and reached its high of 1087 in 
1984s first quarter 
the latest reading of 982 for the third quarter 1990 down from 
1008 in the second quarter was the lowest since 953 was recorded 
in the third quarter of 1982 shortly thereafter the index ascended 
into 100plus levels 
while the index is valued as a measurement of privatesector 
strength or weakness it is watched also because of its fairly 
accurate record in forecasting future economic conditions 
based on responses to the latest survey dunkelberg believes the 
inflation outlook may continue to improve that pressure from labor 
costs may ease and that the jobless rate likely will edge up as the 
year ends 
still he believes inflation fears will prevent the federal 
reserve from any major easing of credit conditions at best he 
suggests the fed will make ease noises rather than take strong 
action 
the companies on which dunkelbergs analyses are based all 
members of the national federation range from very small companies 
proprietorships and the like to companies with annual sales of 
more than 100 million 
none of these companies would qualify by size for lists of the 
1000 largest companies which generally are said to constitute 
big business broadly categorized therefore they are 
small 
the community they represent the federation says involves a 
vast and varied number of companies employing about onehalf the 
nations private nonfarm work forces and producing about 50 
percent of gross national product 
as such says dunkelberg they provide a grassroots view of 
attitudes and experiences that add up to an accurate picture of 
present conditions and an indication of what lies ahead 
economically 
while reminding people that the survey was conducted shortly 
before the latest oil problems he doesnt foresee dramatic changes 
ahead 
the expansion was not characterized by any extremes and it is 
consequently likely that the slowdown that follows will be equally 
boring he said

deciphering airline fares never has been easy 
for passengers and the latest gyrations caused by the rising cost 
of oil are making the picture more frustrating than a rushhour 
runway backup 
thats why many travel agents have started urging clients to 
book flights several months ahead of time fearing that airlines 
inevitably will push fares higher to compensate for an enormous 
jump in jet fuel prices 
im writing tickets for february march and april said ben 
chanowitz an agent at travel magic a manhattan travel agency 
were recommending that people lock in now 
even for veteran air passengers the past week has been one of 
the more confused periods in the economics of air fares a 
convoluted science crammed with fineprint limitations 
first most airlines announced fare increases of more than 5 
percent to defray unexpected increases in jet fuel prices caused by 
the crisis in the oilrich persian gulf 
but on monday eastern airlines and trans world airlines two of 
the most financially weak carriers cut certain fares by up to 40 
percent to stimulate sales competitors matched them 
then on tuesday all major airlines delayed fuel surcharges by a 
week evidently out of partial fear that they could discourage 
wouldbe travelers from flying 
the net result is an atmosphere of uncertainty that is 
convincing a growing number of travelers to postpone plans or buy 
tickets now for thanksgiving christmas and beyond travel agents 
said 
we are encouraging people to buy whatever is available at the 
moment said juergen krenzien president of paul klein travel 
service in chicago our feeling is fares arent going down 
theyre going to go up 
others said it was a good idea to buy tickets now even if prices 
decline over the next few months because generally airlines will 
reissue the same tickets at the lower fare and refund the 
difference to the buyers 
but that generalization is loaded with some important 
exceptions especially in the case of discounted advancepurchase 
tickets that in many cases are nonrefundable 
the widely accepted rule is that airlines will only exchange the 
more expensive ticket for the cheaper one if the class of ticket is 
identical and the itinerary remains unchanged 
say youre holding a nonrefundable ticket for 200 and a 
lower fare is introduced at 150 all you do is contact a travel 
agent and you may switch to the lower fare said jackie pate a 
spokeswoman for delta air lines 
but there are conditions she said you cant change the 
flight or date if you were holding the 7day advance purchase 
nonrefundable and the new fare is a 14day nonrefundable then 
you may not be able to switch 
even with all the airfare uncertainty many travel agents say 
some good bargains are likely to endure especially going into the 
fall travel season that historically is one of the years slowest 
periods 
for example one of the most popular discounts a 14day 
advancepurchase nonrefundable ticket still offers a 40 percent 
discount off the peak price however its generally only good for 
tuesday wednesday and saturday travel 
moreover if youre a senior citizen you can get some of the 
best discounts because airlines and hotels have targeted people in 
their 60s as one of their most lucrative untapped markets some 
airlines offer packages to seniors that save hundreds of dollars on 
tickets with few limitations 
some travel experts are even predicting airlines will be forced 
to lower fares they speculate carriers might face a passenger 
boycott if they hike prices substantially to defray jet fuel costs 
which have jumped 25 percent and more since iraq seized kuwait aug 
2 and provoked world fear of an oil shortage 
the airlines have panicked over the fuel situation said 
eric munro chief executive officer of the san diego office of 
uniglobe worldwide travel but people are going to refuse to fly 
lets face it 
others said it was more likely that the airlines eventually will 
seek to minimize any fuelrelated increases and that many travelers 
probably wouldnt notice the rise in cost 
ten or 15 bucks just isnt going to make any difference for a 
bunch of people said herbert teison editor of the newsletter 
travel smart for business

an extensive study of celibacy among roman catholic priests 
finds that only half of them adhere to the discipline and that the 
subject itself is largely unexamined and confined to a realm of 
the secret 
psychotherapist a w richard sipe a resigned roman catholic 
priest who made the 25year study involving 1000 priests and 500 
of their intimates said the church shuns exploring realities of 
the celibacy requirement 
to church officials it cant be talked about in any way of 
actually discussing it he said it cant be questioned or 
logical arguments put forth about it 
all that is considered acceptable is to reiterate the party 
line 
sipe 57 a lecturer in the psychiatry department of the john 
hopkins university medical school in baltimore and also in private 
familytherapy practice there added in an interview 
an astounding thing not one seminary in the country has a 
course on celibacy not one even has a course on the history of 
celibacy so my church demands a state of celibacy without 
educating about it or supporting it 
sipe whose findings are to be detailed in a book a secret 
world sexuality and the search for celibacy to be published 
next month by brunnermazel said the church avoids the issues 
it relegates that activity to the area of the secret to a 
secret world he said you cannot have christian responsibility 
and put an important part of it in a secret world 
roman catholicisms rule of priestly celibacy is not a doctrine 
of faith but a clerical discipline it was not required until the 
12th century 
even afterward some priests bishops cardinals and even an 
occasional pope were married and concubinage flourished for 
centuries among clergy vowed to celibacy sipe said 
his findings came as surveys indicate a rising majority of us 
priests and laity favor optional celibacy allowing marriage 
for priests who chose it 
on the basis of his largescale data sipes estimates 50 percent 
of priests uphold celibacy to a great extent while the other 50 
percent violate it twenty percent have regular relationships with 
women he said 
many of these relationships are remarkably durable and 
personally compatible with the practice of ministry he added 
some behaviors of course are exploitative and pathologically 
determined 
in a preliminary summary of his findings last saturday to a 
convention of the american psychological association in boston 
sipes said another 6 to 8 experiment with noncelibacy in a 
datinglike behavior 
additionaly 10 to 13 percent of priests are active homosexuals 
he said while 6 percent involve themselves sexually with children 
or minors in most cases homosexually 
one percent practice crossdressing transvestism and 5 percent 
involve themselves in problematic sexual activity such as 
pornography and compulsive masturbation 
sipes said masturbation which the church condemns is a great 
conundrum for the student of celibacy because it is a common 
occurrence about 80 percent of priests do it occasionally 
of the half of priests upholding celibacy sipes said only 2 
percent have firmly achieved celibacy in a mature sense while 
another 6 to 8 percent despite missteps have solidly established 
the discipline 
additionally he said 40 percent of priests are practicing 
celibacy sufficiently well enough to be called celibate although 
unresolved personal and spiritual issues sometimes bring 
noncelibate behavior 
sipe who left the priesthood in 1970 to marry said his study 
identified four essential elements that make for a mature 
adjustment to celibacy namely 
productive work a welldefined prayer life a deep sense of 
community and a dedication to service 
the study conducted from 1960 through 1985 involved indepth 
interviews and reports from 1500 people a third of them priests 
in psychotherapy a third priests in other settings and a third 
lovers or others closely associated with priests 
he said that despite the obscurity in which celibacy has been 
shrouded and the lack of objective study of it celibacy has been 
a powerful factor in spiritual and cultural achievement in both the 
west and east 
however he said the present church approach is crippled by 
inadequate training of priests in human sexuality generally and by 
lack of education in celibacy itself 
considering the wraps kept on the subject preventing genuine 
proandcon analysis of it sipes said 
i say that bishops dont know any more about celibacy than 
priests and that you would find among bishops the whole spectrum of 
sexual adjustment and problems just as you do among priests 
it is logical to assume that bishops suffer the same sexual 
pressures as priests and if priests get involved sexually bishops 
must also there is no question about this the further i go in 
this study the more surprises there are about what goes on

tepito the infamous smugglers market is 
suffering an identity crisis 
mexico has thrown its doors open to imports making sonys and 
mars bars legal yesterdays contraband is available at stores with 
names like super gringo 
whats a smuggler to do 
cut prices build a shopping center offer cheap parking 
tepitenos have always had a keen sense of timing an eye for 
opportunity said miguel galan president of the confederation of 
tepito merchant associations 
in the 1970s when mexico was flush with oil money tepito 
became known as the place to buy contraband known as fayuca 
tough import restrictions meant only smugglers could supply the 
booming consumer demand for japanese televisions and stereos for 
shampoo and sweets made in the usa 
residents of tepito a scrappy innercity slum were glad to 
oblige 
it became a place where guts and a pickup could make a prince of 
a pauper tepitenos streamed back and forth across the us border 
like ants buying off police and customs officers 
fayuca flourished because it was good business for everybody 
customs the police the tepitenos the consumers galan said 
things began to change after mexico joined the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade or gatt in 1986 president carlos salinas de 
gortari has further eased import restrictions since taking office 
in 1988 
most of merchandise in tepito which specializes in electronics 
now is imported legally because people realized it was easier to 
pay taxes than to make payoffs galan said in an interview 
the prospect of legitimacy has spawned ambitious visions of 
direct imports from japan singapore hong kong and south korea it 
evokes dreams of conventional grandeur 
galan proudly unfurled an architects rendering of a fivestory 
172000squarefoot commercial center that would replace the maze 
of stalls booths and shops run by thousands of people whose 
families have done business here for generations 
we need 4000 parking spaces minimum galan said 
is it possible that infamous tepito home to 14000 merchants 
could become just another shopping mall 
on the surface the district seems to have changed little it 
hums with the raffish energy that made it legend 
housewives haggle with hustlers carts jam the streets laden 
with products as diverse as fresh donuts and eggs of endangered 
turtles pickpockets prey on the unwary in a bruising din of 
radios stereos televisions video players and nintendos 
merchandise still changes hands on a cashonly 
donteventhinkofaskingforareceiptorwarranty basis 
tomorrows tepito already seems to be evolving however since 
mexico opened its borders smalltime smugglers have been largely 
replaced by bulk importers legitimate and otherwise 
there used to be thousands of people bringing stuff across the 
border said alejandra escareno a thirdgeneration tepitena 
now there are only a handful of big guys they bring in stuff by 
the trailer load put it in their warehouses and sell it to small 
vendors 
escareno 42 said smalltimers cant offer competitive prices 
so she quit dealing in electronics when it became legal 
how could we compete when we had 10 televisions and they had 
100 she asked escareno went back to the familys old line used 
clothes another timehonored business in tepito 
tepito is a scavenger on the edges of mexican history for 
decades it was like a quirky mirror that reflected the silver 
lining instead of the cloud 
there has always been a special kind of person here who could 
figure out how to keep ahead of the game tepito historian 
alfonso hernandez y hernandez said in a recent interview with the 
newspaper la jornada 
its openair markets emerged after the desperate years of the 
19101920 revolution craftsmen displaced by war settled in tepito 
and survived by patching old clothes and shoes 
world war ii shortages rekindled the demand for refurbished 
items and then came the postwar years of growth 
as people moved into mexico citys new suburbs tepitenos 
snapped up their discarded possessions 
they cast off their old things in the rush to be modern 
galan said running a hand over the huge clawfooted desk his 
father had found tepito became known as the place to get 
bargains on antiques 
businessmen like galan who quit living in tepito after he made 
a fortune in pirated cassettes sometimes are described as 
insensitive to its special nature 
most tepitenos are fiercely loyal to the neighborhood which 
already was a teeming slum when spanish conquerors arrived in 1519 
the spirit that bred its smugglers also has spawned writers 
painters and poets some fear legitimacy may be the one thing this 
barrio of about 400000 people cannot survive 
escareno considered galans vision of megashopping parking lots 
and computerized marketing and said 
tepito is a special place the community is very united but 
it just wouldnt be the same

the army plans to lower 
the israeli flag and remove a tent encampment near gaza city as 
part of a new policy intended to reduce friction with palestinians 
soldiers have orders not to open fire and to avoid 
confrontations with stonethrowing youths patrols rarely enter the 
villages and crowded refugee camps 
the disengagement reflects a radical shift in the armys 
military doctrine and its effectiveness is reducing bloodshed in 
the palestinian uprising in the occupied territories that began in 
december 1987 
no one has been killed since may in the gaza strip where the 
uprising began in july three palestinians were killed in the west 
bank the lowest monthly toll of the revolt in which israelis have 
killed well over 700 palestinians 
this cant be called turning a blind eye but whoever 
thought of it was brilliant a military commander said on 
condition of anonymity 
he said the policy had been implemented gradually after the 
massacre of seven gaza workers by an israeli gunman may 20 started 
10 days of riots in which 18 palestinians died 
israel is changing its tactics at a time of of increasing 
conflict among palestinians 
since june 1 twice as many palestinians have been killed by 
other palestinians as by soldiers most on suspicion of 
collaborating with israeli authorities 
assad saftawi an elementary school principal and leading plo 
supporter in the gaza strip described the new policy as a ploy by 
defense minister moshe arens to improve israels image abroad 
some prominent palestinians say the uprising is in trouble and 
seek a new longerterm strategy to revive morale 
hamdi faraj a journalist in bethlehem said plo chairman yasser 
arafat should acknowledge the revolt or intefadah has flagged and 
is unlikely to bring palestinian statehood in the new future 
there is a gap between what the plo says and what the people 
see he said the state is not a stones throw away like they 
claim in slogans 
at the dheishe refugee camp in the west bank several activists 
blamed palestine liberation organization policy for the revolts 
loss of impetus and accused arafat of making concessions without 
getting anything in return 
khaled 25 who says he has been wounded three times and served 
10 months in jail without trial said arens timed his change of 
strategy well the intefadeh has cooled down and arens played his 
cards at the right time because people are tired and not chasing 
after the army he said 
ibrahim 33 said the intefadeh has almost stopped and the 
people have to start realizing that they have to take the solution 
in their own hands and do it themselves he said younger men 
should be brought into the plo leadership 
neither gave his last name 
for the army the arens policy signifies reversal of a 
longstanding military doctrine of taking the offensive and 
confronting each small demonstration to keep riots from developing 
it was very strange for the soldiers who have been drilled to 
charge to attack and to fire to be told halt restrain 
yourselves the military commander said 
because of the relative quiet he said an army encampment set 
up in the middle of the village of beit hanun would be dismantled 
and the troops evacuated villagers were told soldiers would return 
in force at the first signs of violence 
restraint also was evident elsewhere 
from an army lookout post near the jabalia refugee camp black 
smoke could be seen rising as palestinian youths ignited a tire in 
the streets 
in the past such an act would have brought swift action by an 
army patrol and possibly casualties 
this time itzik a 21yearold first sergeant looked at the 
smoke and shrugged his shoulders 
well probably let it burn itself out he said besides 
it creates a lot of heavy black smoke and the palestinians have 
to breathe it if it were four or five tires then wed probably go 
in with a company of about 100 men he said 
politicians have praised the army for restraint but military 
sources said some soldiers of lower rank felt it could be 
interpreted as a sign of weakness 
young palestinians say they will carry the fight to the army 
arens might pull back the soldiers but in that case we will 
start chasing the army said fuad 17 who showed a reporter 
wounds behind the ear and on his arm from rubbercoated steel 
bullets

recent highprofile campaigns to locate 
bonemarrow donors have overshadowed a worrisome plight the 
nations two major bonemarrow registries are at odds 
wideranging campaigns to enlist potential donors have created a 
backlog of blood samples for testing and when the tests finally 
are done not all patients get access to the results partly 
because the two registries have acted in competition not in 
concert 
their failure to share information is more than a bureaucratic 
tangle it wastes time and time is the one thing these dying 
patients dont have 
patients are caught in the middle acknowledges liz quam 
spokeswoman for the national marrow donor program which has been 
criticized by its smaller rival the american association of bone 
marrow registries 
the country and the patients are not going to be helped to the 
fullest with these two groups fighting like dogs and cats said 
claude lenfant director of the national heart lung and blood 
institute 
a marrow transplant is the last hope for thousands of patients 
with leukemia aplastic anemia and other diseases but time is 
precious in the search for a donor 
you dont have an extra day or month said bonnie lundquist 
of fort lauderdale fla who searched for months for a transplant 
for her husband peter he died in february a week after 
potential donors were found 
the odds of finding a perfect match are at best 20000to1 
so the bigger the pool of donors the better the chance 
the national marrow donor program a quasigovernmental agency 
is the nations largest donor bank with more than 150000 names 
american has 35320 potential donors and also offers lowcost 
access to foreign registries 
about 10000 americans a year search for a marrow match public 
awareness about transplants has burgeoned in the past eight months 
largely because of people like leukemia patient allison atlas 
20 of bethesda md 
her determined supporters friends of allison ran a highly 
publicized search for a perfect marrow match that raised 3 million 
and enrolled 50000 potential donors atlass quest was 
unsuccessful she got an imperfectly matched transplant from her 
mother before time ran out 
national based in st paul minn hopes to one day have the 
nations sole registry it is supported in part by federal funds 
and draws on 70 major blood banks for its donor base 
americans registry based in mandeville la is a network of 
communitybased donor pools and gets no federal funds each local 
pool began to help a particular patient then expanded to aid other 
patients before joining in a network 
the rift between the two registries came to light in february in 
a congressional staff paper cowritten by health policy analyst 
hellen gelband who noted a lack of coordination from the patients 
perspective 
people didnt always find out that there were different 
registries they could go to gelband said in an interview 
have deaths occurred because patients werent aware of all their 
options 
youd have a hard time documenting it but it could have 
happened certainly she said 
we get kids whove been searching with national eight to nine 
months and found nothing and dont have eight weeks left when we 
get them said joanne raymond executive director of american 
when im talking to the mother of a 6yearold who died 
yesterday because we had a donor but they didnt get to us in time 
i cant see the big picture any longer she said 
critics say there are two basic obstacles patients dont know 
where to turn and the donor banks dont share their resources 
national started sharing donor lists with american on april 16 
but its data is too incomplete for a successful search raymond 
said and american thus far has refused offers to merge with the 
larger national 
the reason says the congressional paper major philosophical 
differences having to do with transplant center access costs 
search information and approval of transplant centers 
national requires patients to be admitted to costly hospital 
transplant centers before they can search its donor registry at 
american patients can search with permission from their doctors 
without entering a center 
national says transplant centers ensure that donors get the best 
possible care and dont waste their time giving marrow to a patient 
who isnt eligible for transplant or properly prepared for surgery 
quam said the centers also relieve unqualified patients of false 
hope 
american believes in trying even when the odds seem impossible 
and while national focuses on donor protection with an eye 
toward research raymond says shes more oriented toward patients 
the congressional paper said the price of searching for a match 
and harvesting bone marrow varies substantially by transplant 
center even though the center itself is minimally involved in 
those activities and is paying the registry for those services 
gelband found that patients who never find a successful match 
spend an average of 4000 and sometimes up to 15000 patients 
who go through transplants can spend 100000 to 200000 
depending on whether there are complications said quam 
american and national are considering proposals that would help 
them work together though neither side will discuss them yet 
congress also is looking at the rivalry for now the turmoil 
continues in court battles and press releases 
until recently the lifesavers foundation of america based in 
covina calif was nationals recruitment and fundraising nerve 
center friends of allison was a major tributary of lifesavers 
then lifesavers and national split in a pending court case in 
minneapolis lifesavers says it now is a registry in itself it 
enlisted 100000 donors for national in the past and wants to share 
them national wants sole rights to them 
dr rudolf brutoco founder and chairman of lifesavers said he 
was disgusted by delays at national that wasted patients precious 
time but it was lifesavers success that helped overload the 
system backing up lab tests and paperwork at the donor centers 
when the atlases began their search national had gathered 
57000 donors in three years 
the money the program had allocated for blood typing paid for 
1300 new donors a year the atlases brought in that many in two 
days

matching marrow is a threestep process first the blood is 
tested to classify its first four antigens or cell identifiers 
that costs 75 per donor the second step is to identify the last 
two antigens that costs about 300 if all six match a final test 
mixes the patients and donors blood to see if one rejects the 
other 
because of the cost the second step called dr typing 
usually is not done until a match is achieved on the first four 
antigens only about 30 percent of nationals donors for example 
have had dr typing 
on june 1 lifesavers staff followed up on potential marrow 
donors whose names had been submitted to national as far back as 
march in two days the staff members claimed they located 62 
potential donors who had not yet been contacted by national for 
followup tests 
national responds that it sometimes has trouble locating donors 
after a potential match is found and the registry says some 
patients with common blood types can be matched preliminarily to 
scores of donors national says it cant test each of those matches 
immediately due to the logistics and high cost 
for its part national said it wants to do away with 
lifesavers publicity techniques featuring poignant pleas for 
donors by patients and their families instead it will seek donors 
to contribute marrow and money through corporations and service 
organizations 
quam said lifesavers in essence told families how much money 
had to be raised we dont want these determined moms and dads to 
feel so much pressure they have to second mortgage their homes 
plead with relatives or cash in iras she said 
leaders of each registry include people who got involved because 
of the illness of a family member or friend and those emotional 
ties color the debate over what approach to use 
those same emotions are at work among those who want to 
reorganize a system that is not working 
im concerned because it isnt a cohesive system because its 
too much of a burden on families said mrs lundquist the widow 
whose husbands match came too late im concerned that lives are 
being lost because of an inadequate system

the search for a bonemarrow transplant for 
peter lundquist dragged on for months it was more time than he had 
lundquist 37 a miami television news anchor and father of 
three died of lymphoma in february a week after potential donors 
were found 
his wife bonnie says administrative delays in a boggeddown 
system robbed her husband of precious time 
lundquist wanted others to have the chance that eluded him 
before he died he extracted some pretty stringent promises 
from his wife to help other patients and better the system 
peter was a really giving person who cared about other 
people mrs lundquist said in a telephone interview he left 
those good qualities i tried to step in where he had to leave 
off 
mrs lundquist promotes marrow donation because patients have 
no other options its the only system we have right now 
but she wants lawmakers and the public to know that 
the bureaucracy needs to be speeded up lundquist was orking 
through a transplant center in august his doctor asked the center 
to authorize a search with the nations biggest donor bank the 
search wasnt begun until november later there were delays in 
processing potential matches 
you dont have an extra day or month with cancer or leukemia 
patients said mrs lundquist 
the medical establishment doesnt tell patients about all their 
options a month after starting a search at the national marrow 
donor program she heard from another patients family about the 
american association of bone marrow registries she immediately 
started a search in the second registry 
patients families need to keep constant tabs on the progress 
of their donor search mrs lundquist said she called the 
transplant center weekly for updates the national marrow donor 
center doesnt take calls from patients 
families already under stress because of a loved ones 
lifethreatening illness often must resort to public appeals for a 
donor they might not have to if more potential donors could be 
found 
im concerned because it isnt a cohesive system because its 
too much of a burden on patients families she said im 
concerned that lives are being lost because of an inadequate 
system 
eventually she said each and every one of us will be faced 
with a cancer or leukemia situation a brother sister friend 
father coworker somebody you know will be affected 
mrs lundquist a former broadcast journalist now lives in 
suburban fort lauderdale and works as an aide to a state lawmaker 
she hopes to start a foundation to help people who need transplants 
in the meantime she gives advice and emotional support to 
patients and their families 
remembering my situation doesnt paralyze me it makes me 
empathize and sympathize with them she said but its hard 
because i realize the frustrations they feel i wish i could wave a 
magic wand and make it go away and have all the answers for them 
for me to become bitter now would not help other people ive 
become a lot more positive and motivated to make some good out of 
it not to become bitter and vengeful she said 
each day is a precious day

a government witness in the conflict of 
interest case against neil bush says the presidents son lost his 
ethical moorings but did not try to deceive anyone while a 
director of a denver savings and loan 
in testimony released tuesday by the federal office of thrift 
supervision university of colorado professor edward j conry wrote 
that the 35yearold bush did not lie try to conceal or mislead 
still neil bushs conduct was unethical because he placed 
himself in situations where his selfinterest or loyalty to others 
was in competition with the interests of depositors shareholders 
insurers and taxpayers wrote conry a professor of business law 
and ethics 
he became ethically myopic unaware that his perspective or 
conduct were biased he said 
neil bush was a director of silverado banking savings and loan 
association of denver which collapsed in december 1988 at a cost 
to taxpayers of 1 billion 
conry was one of several expert witnesses on both sides whose 
testimony was released by ots and bushs attorney james nesland 
the testimony was submitted to administrative law judge daniel j 
davidson as part of the proceeding in the bush case 
bush has been ordered to appear at a public hearing on sept 25 
in denver before davidson who will then make a recommendation to 
ots director timothy ryan 
in documents submitted by bush two experts disputed the 
regulators contention that bush failed to adequately disclose to 
silverado his business relationships with kenneth m good and bill 
l walters two big borrowers from the thrift institution bush has 
denied any wrongdoing 
i have never observed charges of unsafe or unsound practices 
as insubstantial as the charges filed against bush wrote charles 
m pickett a former attorney for the federal deposit insurance 
corp in my opinion bushs actions underlying the charges 
against him are not unsafe or unsound practices 
the ots also submitted statements by several former silverado 
directors that they were not informed of bushs precise 
relationships with good and walters 
in another document made public tuesday the ots asked davidson 
to authorize subpoenas for former silverado chairman michael wise 
and russell m murray a former loan officer of the thrift 
the thrift office noted that wise has announced his intention to 
refuse to testify by asserting his 5th amendment right against 
selfincrimination however the office said it believes wises 
assertion of that right is invalid 
in addition to the thrift agencys case the fdic is considering 
filing a negligence lawsuit against bush and other silverado 
directors 
pickett and geoffrey c hazard jr a professor at yale law 
school supported bushs contention that it was not a breach of his 
duty to vote as a director on silverado loans to good and walters 
since he didnt have a financial interest in the developers 
projects 
good and walters invested millions of dollars in bushs oil 
partnership jnb exploration co which drilled a number of dry 
holes in wyoming over two years and never became profitable 
bush has asserted that before he joined the silverado board he 
disclosed his relationships with good and walters to wise other 
silverado managers the board of directors and the thrifts 
attorneys 
good and walters two of silverados biggest borrowers got a 
combined total of 117 million in loans that they never repaid

several airlines are delaying for about a week a scheduled 53 
percent fare increase that the carriers proposed to defray the 
rising costs of jet fuel 
at the same time major airlines moved to match fare cuts that 
trans world airlines and eastern airlines proposed earlier this 
week for flights after labor day 
the 53 percent fare hikes were to have gone into effect today 
but united airlines and northwest airlines said tuesday they were 
delaying the hike until aug 22 while american airlines postponed 
it until aug 23 
they said they were taking the action for competitive reasons 
and that the delay meant they would absorb higher fuel costs for 
the time being 
the fare hikes were announced in the wake of iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait that drove oil prices higher 
american for instance said that each pennyagallon rise in 
fuel prices costs the airline 25 million a year on an annual 
basis united estimated its costs go up 225 million a year under 
similar conditions 
northwest spokesman bob gibbons said his airlines jet fuel 
costs climbed 8 cents a gallon to 74 cents in 48 hours following 
the invasion 
in another development tuesday united northwest and american 
offered lower fares in response to the postlabor day fare cuts 
announced monday by trans world airlines and eastern airlines 
united said it would match the twa and eastern fare cuts 
american said it would match the twa fares and northwest announced 
a reduction plan that it said parallels price reductions at twa 
eastern had said it will introduce discount oneway fares 
ranging from 69 to 139 and cover all of its 62 us destinations 
from sept 5 through dec 16 the tickets must be bought by aug 29 
twa said it will cut nonrefundable domestic fares in most 
markets at least 20 percent under similar conditions 
meanwhile us transportation secretary samuel k skinner said 
tuesday hell talk with airline executives this week to see what 
the department of transportation can do to help them cope with high 
fuel prices 
he said he wont know what form the help might take until he 
meets with the executives but i think we can do a lot 
skinner spoke with reporters after a tour of the boeing cos 
commercial jetliner factory in renton wash

grain and soybean futures prices turned mixed 
after a higher opening today on the chicago board of trade 
reflecting an easing of the inflation fears that recently have 
helped support the crop markets 
the markets opened higher across the board in an extension of 
tuesdays rally in which soybeans climbed as much as 9 cents a 
bushel 
but soybeans and corn turned mixed in reaction to a drop in oil

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade in a session that 
was relatively quiet except for a late surge in the soybean market 
soybeans sold off early in the afternoon amid reports that 
brazils government would make available the equivalent of 42 
billion in farm loans for the planting season beginning in 
september 
uncertainty about the level of government assistance brazilian 
farmers would receive had been a supportive factor in the soybean 
market 
soybeans rebounded strongly near the close though on buying 
that analysts attributed to technical factors 
wheat futures were strong all day partly reflecting farmers 
reluctance to sell wheat at current prices 
prices are so darn low theyre just sitting on the stuff 
said katharina zimmer a grains analyst with merrill lynch captial 
markets inc in new york 
at the close wheat futures were 4 cents to 5 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in september at 284 a bushel 
corn was cent lower to 1 cents higher with september at 247 a 
bushel oats were 1 cents to 3 cents higher with september at 
116 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with

some experts are starting to wonder 
whether there is much of a next for steve jobs new computer 
launched with splashy publicity in october 1988 the next 
machine was supposed to revolutionize personal computers like the 
apple that jobs and former partner steve wozniak hatched in a 
garage in 1976 and the macintosh that jobs gave the world in 1984 
one of the industrys most innovative creators jobs called the 
next the best computer in the world 
nearly two years later next computer inc has hardly made a 
dent only a few thousand of the sleek black boxes have been sold 
and the next has failed to generate great interest among corporate 
computer users analysts say 
the fundamental problem with next is they were just born at 
the wrong time said esther dyson who publishes the computer 
industry newsletter release 10 
its one more desktop computer she said the next new 
revolutionary advance is not going to happen on the desktop but 
on the new handheld computers that recognize handwriting she 
predicts 
others say the next machine may be too advanced for its own 
good for example it stores data on a stateoftheart optical 
disk which offers vastly more capacity than conventional magnetic 
floppy disks but optical disks are much slower at retrieving 
data jobs has since offered a faster magnetic hard disk as an 
option but still no floppy disk drive 
although the machine is exciting intellectually and important 
from a computer architecture point of view most customers have 
work to do they dont get off on computer technology said 
richard shaffer the editor of technologic computer letter another 
trade letter 
an additional problem for next is the machines unique operating 
system the base layer of software that controls internal computer 
functions it makes the next incompatible with other computers at a 
time when the industry is moving toward interchangeable systems 
software must be specially tailored for the next it cant use 
popular offtheshelf software such as lotus 123 
that creates one of its most serious dilemmas because 
relatively little software exists to run on the next it has a hard 
time attracting customers because there are few customers 
software developers are reluctant to write programs for it 
at the moment there still is no major application for which 
the next machine is the best solution or even more important the 
only solution shaffer said 
nexts critics also say the machine is too expensive 9995 to 
the general public and 6495 to universities it didnt help that 
the operating system was delayed until almost a year after the 
computer was unveiled they add 
jobs who founded next in 1985 after leaving apple computer inc 
in a management dispute said in january his detractors would be 
impressed by the fledgling companys performance in six months 
since then next announced what apparently is its largest 
contract the sale of about 300 machines to william morris agency 
inc the beverly hills calif talent firm the company said it 
chose next because of its ability to store videos of entertainers 
as well as textbased information 
but the industry is still waiting for delivery on jobs promise 
i would say theres a certain degree of disappointment said 
beverly bird a spokeswoman for businessland a computer store 
chain that signed an exclusive deal with next in march 1989 to 
retail its machines domestically 
at the time businessland predicted sales would hit 100 million 
in the first year 
but sales have fallen short international data corp a 
hightech research firm estimates that fewer than 7000 nexts were 
sold as of june 
next is privately owned and therefore is not obligated to 
disclose sales or finances jobs declined to be interviewed for 
this article 
bird said the 100 million estimate was based on availability of 
nexts operating system and applications software potential 
customers are still awaiting groundbreaking software that will 
entice them to buy the machine she said 
we know those products are coming she said 
she said businessland has placed next machines with a number of 
potential customers who are evaluating them or are working on 
software for internal applications that would run on next computers 
despite the slow start no one is predicting nexts demise the 
company is heavily capitalized one of its principal owners the 
japanese hightech company canon inc paid 100 million for a 
onesixth share last year 
the canon purchase valued next at 600 million which shaffer 
called a mouthopening jawdropping valuation for a company so 
young 
nexts other principal owner aside from jobs is billionare 
computer magnate h ross perot while international business 
machines corp has paid next to license its user interface its 
easytouse onscreen graphics that control the machine for an 
option on ibm computers 
next aides say theyre working on the shortcomings a faster 
processing chip is promised later this year along with a color 
monitor more software is on the way including a spreadsheet 
product from lotus development corp said todd rulonmiller 
nexts vice president of sales 
were trying to develop and deliver some compelling or 
breakthrough applications this year he said in an interview at 
next headquarters in this silicon valley community were 
starting to begin to see the efforts of a thousand software 
developers who went through training at a next developer camp last 
year 
while next has critics it also has received praise from many 
computer aficionados they say it is extremely easy to use vs 
rival machines has razorsharp graphics and is a computer 
programmers dream thanks to a builtin feature that allows easy 
assembly of new programs 
the next also has a builtin sound device that allows users to 
add spoken comments to computer documents through a microphone the 
comments in digital sound can be played back the next time the 
document file is opened 
jobs has said he believes the merger of text voice and video 
socalled multimedia will represent the third wave of desktop 
computing the first two were spreadsheets and desktop publishing 
he also has predicted the next will establish the third major 
computing standard after those of ibm and apple 
experts emphasize that other entirely new computers such as the 
macintosh lacked adequate software at first when the macintosh 
found its original niche desktop publishing a flood of software 
followed 
it took about two years for the macintosh to catch on in the 
interim critics also questioned whether the mac was a mistake 
it takes a long long time to bring a new machine to the 
market said shaffer the trade letter publisher even if it 
were the next macintosh were still early in the course i wouldnt 
write it off yet

from the outside next computers 
nondescript white factory building could be mistaken for an 
insurance company claims office 
inside it looks more like a showroom for italian furniture 
next chairman steve jobs fascination with detail and design is 
evident everywhere from the slick blackandwhite decor to the two 
varieties of gourmet coffee in the employee lunchroom 
a glass wall behind the reception area reveals the buildings 
true purpose through it the companys highly automated assembly 
line can be glimpsed below 
the assembly floor is surprisingly small about the size of a 
couple of football fields on a recent visit it also was 
surprisingly quiet the assembly line was not running and little 
activity was evident among the handful of workers hardly a good 
sign for jobs startup company 
the idle assembly line and operatingroom cleanliness gave the 
plant situated in a wellmanicured office park the air of a 
science fair project 
but randy heffner nexts vice president of manufacturing said 
it is unusual for a startup computer company to have its own plant 
in the first place most would farm out production until sales 
increased to a level to justify the expenditure on machinery 
by building its own plant heffner said next can control the 
quality of its products reduce inventory cut retooling costs and 
be more responsive to customer needs 
he said the plant currently is operating at onethird capacity 
but he would not say what that figure is jobs has said the plant 
can support sales of 1 billion a year 
of the 50 employees at the factory only nine are needed to run 
the customdesigned robotic assembly line which next says is one 
of the most advanced in the world the rest work in packaging 
shipping and other areas 
because the company has its own assembly line it can put 
together its own prototype computer circuit boards to make sure 
there will be no unforeseen problems in production that may not be 
evident in the design phase said heffner who worked at computer 
giant hewlettpackard co before joining next 
in addition it can produce a prototype board for nexts 
engineers in a few days instead of the few weeks if production 
were contracted out he said 
about 20 revisions were made in the circuit board used in the 
next machine he said

evoking images of boardroom napoleons french 
executives have struck out beyond their borders to wage the most 
aggressive corporate takeover campaign in europe 
the conquests extend far beyond the continent goodrich tires 
mack trucks and maalox antacid are among the american products 
french companies are commandeering in a transatlantic offensive 
even napoleon would envy 
some experts say france after decades of passive and insular 
business practices is simply catching up girding itself for a 
single european market by doing now what corporations from other 
economic powers have done for years 
but there is no disagreement that the french have undertaken the 
process with skill enthusiasm vast reserves of cash and the 
strong encouragement of their government 
that encouragement has prompted some complaints arising from 
the fact that many of the acquisitive french companies are 
stateowned 
european deal review published by the us consultancy group 
translink said there were 40 french state acquisitions of european 
targets in 1989 valued at 334 billion 
france is in effect nationalizing europe said mark dixon 
the reviews editor 
many governments consider such takeovers unfair because of the 
protection given to the french companies by their own government 
european community officials recently ordered renault and other 
french companies to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars of 
state aid which was ruled to give them an unfair advantage over 
companies from other ec members 
britain the most popular target for french companies last year 
said it may adopt special measures to prevent statebacked 
takeovers 
the sunday times of london in a recent fullpage article titled 
france inc storms the barricades said many experts see the 
hidden hand of the french government behind the sudden aggression 
of french dealmakers who for the first time have overtaken the 
british as europes most acquisitive businessmen 
in july alone french companies announced a series of ambitious 
farflung acquisitions including financier bernard tapies 
headlinemaking purchase of an 80 percent interest in adidas the 
west germanbased sporting goods giant 
in other transactions last month 
accor became the worlds largest operator of hotel rooms with 
160000 worldwide by purchasing motel 6 of the united states 
accors owners described their firm as the mcdonalds of the hotel 
world after adding 554 budget motels to a network that already 
included 850 hotels and 3000 restaurants in 60 countries 
lafarge coppee became europes largest cement producer by 
acquiring veb karsdorf a major east german company 
stateowned usinor sacilor announced plans to acquire edgcomb 
corp a major us steel trading company usinor sacilor became 
the worlds secondbiggest steel producer in 1989 through an 
aggressive foreign expansion 
usinor reflects the imperialistic style that appears to be in 
vogue in france said peter dupont a steel industry analyst with 
ubsphillips amp drew ltd in london 
the neonapoleonic trend is slightly anachronistic in terms of 
todays conventional wisdom he said but its in line with the 
tendency of french governments to allow industrial policy to be 
influenced by ideas of national prestige 
olivier collette a frenchman who directs the marketing 
information section at the us embassy in paris said most french 
companies are viewed favorably in the united states as productive 
industrial investors rather than speculators 
ive not detected any reaction similar to those concerning the 
japanese he said noting the french firms were rarely seeking 
real estate investments 
france was probably the last starter in this race collette 
said three years ago of the hundred largest french groups you 
had a very significant portion with very limited operations in the 
united states or none now most of them have a significant 
foothold in the us market 
he said french investment in the united states is now roughly 
equal to us investment in france 
earlier this month us regulators approved the 18 billion 
merger of norton co a massachusettsbased abrasives company with 
saint gobain of paris one of the worlds leading glass 
manufacturers 
when saint gobain proposed the merger in march to help norton 
avert a hostile takeover by a british firm it won praise from the 
us management 
with saint gobain as a partner we will continue to be who we 
are said nortons chairman john nelson 
another aggressive investor in the us market has been 
stateowned chemical company rhonepoulenc it acquired a majority 
interest this year in the pennsylvaniabased rorer group 
bestknown as the maker of maalox antacid thereby forming one of 
the worlds top 10 pharmaceutical companies 
earlier the michelin tire company acquired uniroyalgoodrich 
and pechiney a major packaging manufacturer bought american 
national can renault is in the process of buying mack trucks 
on the other hand the french can show a different side when 
foreign acquirers come calling for example italian financier 
giancarlo parretti tried to buy frances pathecinema film company 
this year but the government blocked the transaction on grounds it 
was not in frances national interest 
its not as easy for foreign companies to make acquisitions in 
france said ian fisher of the mmg patricof a british buyout 
firm the french are much more protective of their 
shareholdings 
why the sudden surge of french acquisitions experts say it 
results partly from french corporate fear of vulnerability in 1992 
when western europe is to be melded into a single market 
french industries are realizing that if they are going to 
compete in the new europe theyre going to have to get out there 
and do it said eammon bates head of the brussels office of 
bernard krief consultants 
in the past he said french companies got along satisfactorily 
by serving their large domestic market often with generous 
government support 
now they may find their own markets at home are threatened by 
the single market french industry has to defend its own 
interests bates said 
the best defense france decided was to take the offensive 
companies fortified by frances prosperous economy set out on 
concerted acquisition campaigns to gain large chunks of business 
elsewhere 
france at the highest levels has looked at the strategic 
aspects of 1992 from a fairly partisan angle if we exploit this 
to the full we can ensure further french preeminence in the ec 
bates said

two thousand western union corp employees 
got their jobs back wednesday as the company signed a tentative 
labor contract that rescinded a fourday lockout of union workers 
company and union officials said 
the twoyear settlement reached at 330 am wednesday 
guarantees the same level of health benefits and a 35 percent 
annual wage increase to the employees who are represented by the 
communications workers of america 
about half the workers covered by the contract are recording 
operators the others include technicians clerical workers and a 
smaller number scattered in other departments 
the contract also applies to 500 cwa employees not affected by 
the saturday morning lockout 
settlement of the labor dispute will free the company to 
concentrate on its proposed recapitalization plan which is 
essential to western unions future said robert j amman western 
union president 
the companys old contract with union workers expired aug 6 
workers had authorized a strike two weeks ago but the union never 
threatened to strike even after the lockout was declared said dan 
j beckstead the unions chief negotiator 
the company probably started moving when they realized the 
union and the membership was not going to crack under their 
pressure of a lockout beckstead said 
employees who were locked out will be reinstated with full back 
pay rosenthal said temporary replacements who had been staffing 
the companys principal facilities since saturday were withdrawn 
wednesday as union employees returned to work western union 
spokesman warren bechtel said 
beckstead said an unfair labor practice charge filed on monday 
with the national labor relations board would be dropped the 
complaint alleged that the company violated federal labor law by 
selectively locking out the 2000 workers 
the contract must be ratified by union members said cwa 
spokesman steven rosenthal he said ballots will be mailed by next 
week with the tally expected to be completed by early september 
the contract maintains pensions at current levels and retains a 
profitsharing program that was created in 1985 to compensate 
workers for wage and benefits concessions rosenthal said 
union negotiators made some concessions on the companys ability 
to contract work to outside firms and on the use of parttime 
employees bechtel said 
much of the debate at the threeweeklong talks centered on the 
companys attempts to curtail medical benefits bechtel said the 
company dropped its efforts to reduce medical benefits as part of 
the normal bargaining process 
the agreement came hours before western unions adjourned annual 
meeting was scheduled to reconvene the meeting to continue at 2 
pm thursday will focus on the debtridden companys proposed 
recapitalization plan 
under the plan western union wants shareholders to approve the 
reclassification of preferred shares into common shares 
a twothirds vote of the preferred shareholders is needed to 
approve the plan bechtel said 
the proposal also asks bondholders to allow the company to swap 
530 million in highyield notes for new notes paying lower 
interest rates and common shares 
noteholders originally had until midnight wednesday to turn in 
their bonds but that deadline will be extended bechtel said

united auto workers union members at a general 
motors corp parts plant returned to their jobs wednesday after a 
sixday strike that idled several other gm plants 
gm spokesman john maciarz said the company was happy to have the 
work force back and was gearing up production at its ac rochester 
west plant 
parts shortages caused by the strike have halted production at 
eight car and truck assembly plants in michigan ohio louisiana 
and indiana gm said manufacturing also was curtailed at a variety 
of component factories 
workers at assembly plants in flint and oakland county mich 
were recalled late tuesday leaving six plants shut down wednesday 
maciarz said 
by wednesday afternoon maciarz said about 16800 people were 
still on layoff because of the strike 
im sure there are going to be more callbacks tomorrow and 
more friday he said wednesday we also might see another plant 
or two go out for a short period of time 
production at the assembly plants will gear up through next week 
toward their prestrike capacities maciarz said he didnt know 
when each affected plant would return to normal production 
the contract ratified tuesday calls on gm to maintain the 
current work force level at the flint factory for the next six 
years workers were concerned gm would turn to outside nonunion 
companies to supply some of the grilles or fuel tanks made at the 
factory 
job security is also the top issue in national contract 
negotiations going on in detroit between the uaw and gm ford motor 
co and chrysler corp the three national contracts to replace 
those expiring sept 14 will cover more than 450000 workers total 
after the flint agreement was ratified local union leaders 
hailed its job security language just as national leaders did three 
years ago when the current gmuaw agreement was signed 
that contract permitted the automaker to close a plant only when 
sales of its products slumped badly since then gm has closed four 
assembly plants prompting uaw charges of betrayal 
the union unsuccessfully challenged one of the closings before 
an arbitrator 
this time things will be different said mike grimes shop 
chairman for uaw local 659 in flint 
were going to keep their feet to the fire he said

the dollar bounced higher wednesday against the 
german mark in us dealings after sinking to an alltime low 
against the mark in europe 
against other major currencies the dollar finished mixed in 
domestic trading after falling broadly overseas 
gold prices turned lower after rising in recent sessions due to 
worries about war and inflation resulting from actions in the 
persian gulf 
the dollar sank to a record closing low of 15605 marks in 
europe down from 15685 marks late tuesday and below its previous 
trading low of 15615 marks on jan 4 1988 
dealers said the dollar drifted even lower as trading got 
underway in new york with the currency dropping to about 15540 
marks early in the session 
but the dollar retraced some lost ground in the afternoon 
session in new york as some traders sold other currencies to cash 
in on their recent rise said john mccarthy chief currency dealer 
at amsterdam rotterdam bank 
we have seen some classic profittaking this afternoon he 
said from his new york office people got tired of selling 
dollars 
by late afternoon in new york the dollar was quoted at 15660 
marks up from 15645 marks late tuesday 
despite the recovery against the mark mccarthy said he does not 
think the sentiment toward the dollar has changed it was just 
oversold against almost all currencies and many participants were 
short dollars he said 
the fundamental conditions that have caused the dollar to 
decline over the past few weeks should continue to depress the 
currency he said 
many analysts say weakness in the us economy will eventually 
force the federal reserve to reduce interest rates to avoid a 
recession just as germany japan and other nations boost their 
rates to curb inflation 
the net effect will be to make the dollar less attractive to 
foreign investors currency analysts say 
the dollar has also been hurt by indications the middle east 
crisis might be winding down jordans king hussein traveled to 
washington for talks with president bush reportedly carrying a 
letter from iraqi leader saddam hussein 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and remains there despite protests 
from other nations around the world 
besides rising against the mark the dollar gained ground 
against the swiss franc french franc and italian lire in new york 
while falling against the japanese yen british pound and canadian

born in bulgaria and raised in the 
midwest frank popoff is just as comfortable steering dow chemical 
co into eastern europe as he is steering chums into a bloomington 
ind bar to reminisce about college 
popoff is a veteran of the chemical business in dows european 
operations and travels there at least once a year the president 
and chief executive is at home in a changing eastern europe and its 
fledgling freemarket economy 
but because were old hands in that part of the world and have 
been for many many years were trying to be part of a process 
rather than part of the pyrotechnics of eastern europe newly 
discovered by people who a year ago could have cared less he 
said 
highprofile us companies have plunged into eastern europe 
over the past year forming businesses ranging from auto assembly 
plants to tourist hotels but dows been there since the 1960s 
originally as a trader with all the east bloc countries and more 
recently as a partner in a hungarian styrofoam factory 
global operations are part of a broader strategy popoff helped 
devise to tame boomandbust cycles in the chemical industry hes 
also pushed dow into new technologies pharmaceuticals and consumer 
products ranging from oven cleaner to saran wrap which sell 
regardless of the economys health 
he said the biggest challenge is trying to persuade consumers 
that dows products can be used without harming the environment 
there are no chlorofluorocarbons in these cups any more 
popoff said in an interview picking up a white styrofoam coffee 
cup from a dark wood conference table 
we have to be a player in the earth day scenario he said 
well either have to meet this challenge or revise our growth 
rates for the industry 
a 50 percent slump in secondquarter earnings proved the 
countrys secondlargest chemical company behind dupont isnt yet 
immune to industry cycles 
prices for plastics and chemical products weakened raw material

thirdbest year in profits 
dow is like a baseball player who hits 300 year in and year 
out said david sowerby vice president and economist at 
manufacturers national bank in detroit 
of the second quarter earnings he said even 300 hitters go 
into temporary slumps the economy is weak and they cant escape 
that they still look good fundamentally 
although developments in europe are of particular interest to 
popoff he said the area remains mired in bureaucracy and central 
planning that make the area relatively unattractive to foreign 
investors 
the pacific rim is i think the growth area for the next 
decade popoff said dow has growing operations in japan 
thailand korea and china 
popoff 54 succeeded viennaborn paul f oreffice as president 
and ceo in 1987 after success with european operations oreffice 
remains chairman 
he did a good job of achieving a lowcost production position 
in europe and thats why they brought him over here said 
industry analyst fred h siemer of chemical research for wall 
street he understands the global nature of the business 
the global outlook came to popoff naturally his family left 
bulgaria when he was a child amid turmoil of hitlers nazi 
expansion his father ran an importexport business

advisory committee meetings and is an active alumnus of sigma chi 
his college social fraternity 
frank is a very valued counselor for me said jack 
wentworth dean of the universitys school of business dow hires 
many university graduates and funds scholarships at the school 
wentworth said popoff also relishes meeting old friends like 
john peterson now chairman of city securities corp in 
indianapolis when they get together they act like classmates and 
they go back to their old local pub 
well go back to nicks old english pub for old memories 
peterson said they dont check us for ids anymore they just 
look at us funny because we have a tie the students are looking 
very young 
popoff strikes many as urbane and humble at the same time 
perhaps a reflection of his success 
hes not phony wentworth said he doesnt come on like he 
knows it all hes the kind of person youd like if he was the 
janitor

tighter controls against air pollution will push 
petroleum companies to devise new formulas for nearly all the 
gasoline sold in america by the end of the century according to a 
study released wednesday 
the study by the arthur d little management consulting firm 
predicts domestic refiners will spend up to 22 billion to alter 
their gasoline one result would be higher gasoline prices 
the changes would mark the most significant shift in gasoline 
production since companies started making unleaded fuel in the 
1970s said carlton jones who helped write the study 
a driving force behind the change will be legislation to amend 
the federal clean air act jones said both the us house and 
senate have approved bills that would require companies to 
reformulate their gasoline the goal is to reduce emissions of 
pollutants such as carbon monoxide 
the legislation would require reformulated gasoline to be sold 
in nine metropolitan areas that represent about 21 percent of the 
nations population jones said those areas which have high ozone 
concentrations are new york chicago los angeles hartford 
philadelphia baltimore milwaukee houston and san diego 
the requirement would take effect in 1993 but other forces 
could lead the movement to spread around the country jones said 
for example distributors might face logistical problems if they 
try to continue providing gasoline made under current formulas 
while at the same time providing the reformulated product 
also petroleum companies might broaden the sale of reformulated 
gasoline as a competitive wedge 
if one company advertises that its reformulated gas burns more 
cleanly consumers might want to buy that jones said 
some companies already have begun to change their formulas 
shell oil co introduced a new gasoline formula this year in the 
nine areas targeted by the federal legislation said norman 
altstedter a company spokesman 
altstedter acknowledged there was a competitive aspect to 
the companys decision but he said our first thing is to help 
improve air quality 
but the petroleum industry objects to the legislation proposed 
in congress 
our position is the government should not be writing formulas 
for gasoline said rg ensz spokesman for the american 
petroleum institute an industry trade association 
the government should set certain air quality goals and let 
the auto and petroleum industries figure out how to meet those 
goals he said 
along those lines automobile and oil companies have joined to 
conduct a comprehensive study of cleaner burning fuels ensz said 
he predicted some small refiners could be put out of business if 
the government adopts unworkable formulas 
the study itself says the investments required to meet tighter 
environmental standards may be unprofitable for refiners 
to make the new formulas companies would not simply be able to 
adjust current operations but would have to install new processing 
equipment that refiners dont usually have jones said 
the study predicts reformulated gasoline will cost consumers an 
additional 7 to 12 cents per gallon 
the study also looked at the european market but predicted the 
push for new gasoline formulas will proceed more slowly there this 
is partly because the united state has been more active in imposing 
strict emissions requirements and also because europe has less 
severe smog problems 
another variable in the equation however is the political 
crisis in the middle east jones said he did not expect the crisis 
would have much effect although an extended drop in oil supplies 
could delay implementation of federal regulations

extending a freeze on wholesale gasoline diesel and jet fuel 
prices enacted in response to a call by president bush for 
restraint during the persian gulf crisis

states was the first oil company to announce a freeze after pump 
prices increased sharply after iraq invaded kuwait aug 2

extension but it would review prices daily crude oil prices have 
risen only slightly since the oneweek freeze was announced and 
pump prices have stabilized as well 
arco spokesman doug elmets said the companys demand volume has 
increased 10 percent at the pump since the price freeze was 
announced 
the freeze applies only to the price of fuel sold to wholesalers 
and not retailers the company has asked its retail distributors to 
keep a hold on pump prices 
arco sells gasoline in arizona california nevada oregon and 
washington state 
bush called for price restraint by oil companies after 
widespread allegations of price gouging at the pumps to take 
advantage of the instability in the middle east

manhattan may be worth hundreds of millions of dollars less than 
he claims

billion to lending institutions including 933 million to citibank

existing 75 million loan by first fidelity bancorp his equity in 
trump castle to secure an existing 13 million loan by midlantic 
bank and his equity in trump plaza to secure a 196 million 
letter of credit from national westminster bancorp 
the restructuring also defers payments on some of the 
outstanding bonds for the three casinos and his manhattan 
properties for three and five years 
trump spokesman norma foerderer said trump would have no comment 
on the documents 
a cover letter on the on the report prepared for trumps lenders 
by leventhal asked the commission to keep details of the 
restructuring plan confidential 
this report contains highly confidential and sensitive 
information which is vital to donald j trump the letter said 
dissemination or disclosure of any or all the contents of this 
report could adversely affect those interests 
the rescue plan also requires trump to sell some assets to raise 
cash although there has been speculation that such transactions 
could amount to a fire sale because some values were depressed 
the major assets listed by trump with the value he assigns to 
them the going market rate estimated by leventhal and the 
shortterm liquidation value estimated by leventhal were 
taj mahal and adjacent land 106 billion 7675 million

freezing the assets of fundamerica inc but refused to appoint a 
receiver to protect the marketing companys assets until bankruptcy

denied

i dont intend to appoint a receiver for a day a dubious 
position and just one more person who will have to be paid from the 
funds of fundamerica she said 
receivers are appointed by judges to manage troubled companies 
until a court rules on claims brought against the firm 
she said the preliminary injunction freezing assets would remain 
in effect until a trustee is appointed by bankruptcy court to run 
the companys affairs

by selling multiple memberships to club members that they in turn 
could sell the company maintains it is a legitimate consumer 
buying club
