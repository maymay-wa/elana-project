magellans mapping of venus will resume 
next week after engineers repair a computer programming glitch that 
makes the spacecrafts solar power panels wobble nasa says 
magellan on friday suspended its 744 million effort to make 
pictures and maps because of the solar panel problem and because 
its communications with earth are being hindered by the sun which 
is lined up between venus and earth 
nasas jet propulsion laboratory expects to fix the computer 
software so magellan can resume taking radar pictures by nov 7 or 
8 magellan experiment representative steve wall said wednesday 
the twin solar panels are essential for recharging magellans 
batteries but the wobbling hasnt hurt their ability to gather 
solar energy 
the craft was launched from a space shuttle in may 1989 and 
arrived at venus on aug 10 it has made pictures of volcanoes 
huge solidified lava flows faults craters and 600milewide 
milehigh bulges on venus

a screaming crowd of nearly 1000 
prohomosexual activists mobbed the entrance of an auditorium to 
protest a halloween night christian crusade aiming exorcise the 
city of evil spirits 
they blocked buses bringing the faithful to the meeting which 
they contend is a thinly veiled attack on homosexuality 
were queer were here get used to it they chanted 
born again bigots go away racist sexist antigay 
the focus of their wrath was a prayer breakthrough for at 
least 5000 organized by texas evangelist larry lea and san jose 
minister dick bernal they say the city by the bay is plagued by 
immoral homosexuals crime witchcraft and general sin 
were praying to god for people all people and against the 
powers of darkness bernal said earlier the ultimate goal is 
to save the fallen angels of the city from satan from evil 
immorality 
despite the protest the meeting started on time with the 
faithful jumping up and down and singing 
evangelicals from some 250 northern california churches needed 
police to pull them bodily through the crowd to the civic center 
auditorium once inside the doors they were roughly grabbed by 
badgewearing monitors and sentries they bags were searched some 
stood for a patdown search 
you come in here for a christian activity and they search you 
like a thief said one of the revivalists 
jesus is lord reminded a woman next to him shaking a fist 
at the crowd through the glass doors 
outside the screaming was at a earsplitting level the 
protesters lifted a 12foothigh paper penis in the form of a cross 
in front of barricades guarded by dozens of visored police 
police eventually separated the two groups keeping the 
demonstrators across the street 
the demonstration started an hour before the prayer warriors 
began their program and broke up about an hour after it started 
many of the protesters headed for the predominantly gay castro 
district where thousands usually gather on halloween 
a war of words raged all day in this city that takes advantage 
of halloween to flaunt it nonconformity 
theyll end up in the hell they deserve with their 
narrowminded views said sister missionary delight founder of 
the 11yearold sisters of perpetual indulgence said of the 
evangelists i think its scary that they think were a real 
threat to society 
delight who is a man was dressed in a nuns habit and curled 
fairy shoes and held a wand during a pagan ceremony tuesday across 
from the hall where the prayer warriors were to meet 
lea who distributes prayer army dog tags and has donned 
military fatigues in previous crusades said halloween was selected 
to launch his threeday assault on evil and sin because according 
to legend demons are strongest at that time 
this is not just kids having fun lea said there is 
actual worship of the devil 
as the evening wore on an estimated 300000 revelers were 
expected to camp it up in the castro district police barricaded 15 
square blocks instead of the usual four and a stage was set up on 
market street to lure partiers away from the most crowded areas 
this is just good clean fun for us a celebration of our 
lifestyle said joe van esballesteros organizer of the drag 
extravaganza 
a group called grand homosexual outrage at sickening 
televangelists ghost was formed to engage in the spiritual 
warfare with lea and bernal 
leas characterization of the city as being ruled by spirits 
of perversity and witchcraft is nothing but thinly veiled 
homophobia and fearmongering said ghost member mark pritchard 
we intend to show that san francisco is a diverse community of 
people who love peace and freedom 
tim lavender vice president of the larry lea ministries denied 
the christians hate homosexuals and others with different 
lifestyles 
were not here to pray against the gays or any group of 
people lavender said we are here to pray for a return to 
traditional values this is an opportunity for all christians 
to come together 
lavender said the socalled peaceloving people in san 
francisco who oppose the religious right have been calling lea and 
bernal with death threats since the prayer event was announced in 
september 
were not trying to provoke any type of violence he said 
on tuesday city workers washed sidewalks in front of the 
auditorium to erase at least one dozen red spraypainted threats 
that said kill the christian 
last summer lea turned out 6000 exorcists in anaheim for a 
threeday prayer breakthrough to inflict serious damage on 
forces of darkness in southern california nearly 7000 believers 
showed up to help him clobber the devil in chicago where they 
brandished imaginary swords and spoke in tongues

the worlds oldest active sailing ship built of 
spanish pine 132 years ago may creak and groan but its looking 
for work 
sailing ships are no longer commercial so there is no reason 
for her existence except her existence and i will do anything to 
keep this ship going said mark litchfield skipper of the 
127ton brig maria asumpta 
bunting fluttered between the two masts as litchfield welcomed 
potential hirers and sponsors at a shipboard reception wednesday in 
st katharines dock near the tower of london 
as she costs nearly 200000 pouns 388000 a year to 
maintain and run in a full 10month season theres a lot of work 
to be done in raising money litchfield said 
for the crew its more of a romance than a job 
it is a living spirit and if you were aboard for a week you 
would know that too deckhand michael spike jenkins said 
wednesday 
shes all wood and natural rope not clinical like a steel 
ship he said 
lucy taylor 29 the only woman among a crew of 10 said she got 
tired of teaching in an eastern england primary school and answered 
an advertisement for ships cook 
i always had a subconscious dream to sail on a tall ship 
she said its a very free way of life and we are together as a 
community 
i feel attached to the ship its like a person i was away 
on land for a week and when i came back and saw it i cried this is 
the first job i have done that i havent wanted to leave 
the maria asumpta is in the guinness book of world records as 
the worlds oldest active squarerigged sailing ship 
the brig was built in badalona near barcelona in 1858 for 
transatlantic trade carrying rum molasses tobacco and spices 
from the caribbean and returning with up to 500 tons of cargo 
the maria asumpta was discovered in 1980 lying as a hulk in 
malaga southern spain by litchfield and a friend robin 
cecilwright 
it was about to be towed to sea and burned the usual fate of 
many old wooden ships 
the two englishmen bought the ship and spent 18 months restoring 
it then sailed it to england it crossed the atlantic in 1984 
spent three years in the great lakes and came back in 1988 
i believe that feat under sail was never achieved before by 
a vessel 130 years old said litchfield a 49yearold former 
royal navy officer 
the ship is hired for parties and promotions film work and sail 
training and turns up at seaport festivals and regattas 
it is 11 years older than the famous clipper cutty sark now 
preserved in a london dry dock at greenwich in southeast london 
deckhand charles smith 43 from the shetland islands north of 
scotland said its noisy in the old ship at sea and he likes to 
hear the creaking of the timbers 
its talking to you he said 
of course it if didnt creak it would break apart

the netherlands is tightening the 
rules on asylum because it hasnt enough money housing and jobs 
for all the poor refugees flooding in 
holland is a historic haven for the oppressed it sheltered the 
pilgrims who fled religious persecution in england before they 
sailed for the new world 
a decade ago in 1980 only 1330 people claimed refugee status 
in the netherlands this year the number is expected to reach 
20000 and the government threatens to jail aliens who make 
unjustified requests for asylum 
dutch officials contend most asylum seekers are economic 
refugees looking for easier lives in this hightech welfare state 
hundreds of people have come from economically depressed eastern 
europe in recent months and the government fears a new rush of 
arrivals if the persian gulf crisis turns into war 
the netherlands subscribes to the un definition of political 
refugees as those fleeing persecution on ideological grounds and 
is reluctant to stretch its welfare resources in a time of economic 
uncertainty 
jobs housing and tolerance are getting scarce and only about 
13 percent of asylum requests are approved 
this is one of the most densely populated countries in the 
world said maurice van hezik spokesman for the justice 
ministry theres pretty high unemployment among the nondutch 
population if you were to admit people who only come to work that 
would make the problem worse 
one asylum seeker sara amini of iran claims she was persecuted 
at home for being a member of a small opposition party in iran 
when she arrived last summer with her husband and two children 
she expected the free housing and allowances that used to be given 
nearly all asylum seekers 
instead they were jammed into a 15footsquare room at a former 
convent school in rijsbergen one of 23 refugee camps in holland 
i heard people in the netherlands were very friendly very 
helpful compared to other european people she said in an 
interview i didnt expect it to be like this 
people seeking asylum in the netherlands used to be taken to 
governmentsubsidized housing projects and given social welfare 
payments equivalent to about 800 a month 
in 1987 however an influx of ethnic tamils fleeing the civil 
war in sri lanka gave rise to what critics call the bed bath and 
bread program 
the government opened 15 refugee camps including rijsbergen to 
house asylum seekers during processing 
aad kosto deputy justice minister said this summer he would 
jail those who sought asylum without good reason and might flee the 
camps and try to lose themselves in the population 
only a few people have been jailed but the practice is expected 
to become more common in the effort to stop rejected asylum seekers 
from joining the estimated 50000 to 60000 illegal aliens in this 
nation of 146 million 
prime minister ruud lubbers summoned the mayors of eight towns 
and villages in september and told them each would be host to a new 
refugee camp he said the first busloads of people were on their 
way 
seven more camps are planned by the welfare ministry which is 
buying 500 mobile homes 
van hezik said some people admit theyve only come for jobs and 
others offer the strangest stories 
he cited the case of a third world refugee who claimed to have 
arrived on a ship bound for switzerland which is landlocked van 
hezik said the man apparently hoped to be expelled to that country 
in early august romanians began pouring into eindhoven in 
southern holland radio free europe the ussponsored station 
had described the city as hospitable to strangers van hezik said 
hundreds of east europeans have made their way to the 
netherlands and the persian gulf may provide the next source of 
refugees said jan tielemans director of the rijsbergen camp 
well probably be noticing the side effects the indians 
the sri lankans who are huddling in jordan eygptians too he 
said we wont know for another few months 
some of these people are simply looking for a living and they 
think one of the ways theyll get it is by asking for asylum 
a 26yearold iraqi at rijsbergen said he deserted saddam 
husseins army days before it invaded kuwait on aug 2 
i was sick and tired of it all said the man who identified 
himself as an artillery sergeant born in yemen but would not give 
his name i just wondered what would happen if i deserted 
he said he hid in a helicopter belonging to the red crescent 
the moslem version of the red cross which took him from his 
position near basra in the south to the kurdistan region of 
northwestern iraq then crossed into turkey 
the iraqi said he reached amsterdam by ship and acknowledged he 
stood very little chance of being accepted as a refugee 
if theyre willing to listen ill tell my story he said 
if not the world is big enough

david paul entrepreneur and real estate developer 
was by all accounts a stranger when he arrived in the early 1980s 
and bought a dying miami thrift 
by the late 80s the chairman of centrust bank had been 
embraced by miamis establishment and accepted into the inner 
sanctums of civic leadership and paul enjoyed an extravagant 
lifestyle and had deep pockets matched by few in this city of 
risktakers and jetsetters 
trouble was financial regulators say he was using centrust 
depositors money to support his philanthropy and lavish 
expenditures 
they contend pauls spending habits contributed to centrusts 
collapse at 18 billion one of the nations biggest savings and 
loan failures 
and now the federal government wants paul to reach into his 
pockets and return 308 million 
paul 51 is accused of using centrust as his own personal piggy 
bank regulators say depositors money paid for goldplated 
bathroom plumbing and a 29million art collection that included a 
13million painting by flemish master peter paul rubens the 
artwork was later sold for a loss 
we cant find anyone who has been so involved in 
conspicuous consumption said thomas p mason public affairs 
officer for the office of thrift supervision in washington 
once a prominent democratic fundraiser paul also has become 
something of a political pariah 
gov bob martinez and democratic challenger lawton chiles have 
criticized each other for their routine political dealings with 
paul and pauls contact with sen john kerry dmass has become 
an issue in his race against republican challenger jim rappaport 
maurice ferre a former miami mayor reflected several months 
ago about pauls acceptance in business and civic circles in 
hindsight it was a misjudgment but david paul is a spectacular 
guy hes a super salesman a gambler and miami is a place where 
people are awed by money as a status symbol of achievement 
paul who has until nov 1 to pay the 308 million restitution 
or post bond for that amount has been in israel and could not be 
reached for comment his miami attorney sanford bohrer says the 
government action has no merit and will be vigorously contested 
his problems arent over by a long shot acknowledged 
terence mcelroy spokesman for the state office of the comptroller 
but bill cullom president of the greater miami chamber of 
commerce argues that paul shouldnt take all the blame for the 
federal takeover of centrust once the biggest sampl in the 
southeast 
every single savings and loan in the united states had board 
members and they were allowing these things to happen its 
unacceptable to me for the bank examiners to come in and play 
monday morning quarterback he said 
that sentiment was echoed by a former centrust board member one 
of the few willing to comment on paul 
there was a time that centrust was riding the crest and making 
lots and lots ofprofit said jessie mccrary an attorney and 
civic leader while they blame paul for the demise of centrust 
what do they say when he resurrected dade federal from oblivion 
paul acquired the failing thrift in 1983 and the following year 
renamed it centrust he made earnings soar through liberal 
accounting practices and an extensive junkbond portfolio much of 
it purchased from the investment firm of drexel burnham lambert 
inc 
the 47story centrust tower a downtown miami landmark was lit 
nightly paul changed the colors on the building during the 
holidays or when it was requested for a community event 
the flamboyant bank chairman who collected a salary of 48 
million plus other compensation from january 1988 to september 
1989 donated to local universities and causes such as the campaign 
against casino gambling in all he gave some 17 million over a 
threeyear period 
then the roof started caving in in 1989 the banks losses 
mounted and a published report showed paul had lied on his 
official centrust biography including that he had a phd from 
harvard and an mba from columbia university he didnt 
regulators seized control of centrust this year and in june the 
bank was sold to great western bank of california 
his la gorce island residence is for sale at 95 million and 
his 7 million customized yacht grand cru was sold for a cutrate 
3 million 
he was for all appearance a very good corporate citizen 
said cullom the chamber of commerce president all of these 
things are just coming to light how could we know as a civic 
community what was going on

congress wants electric garage doors to 
reverse automatically and cigarette lighters to be childproof 
mining in antarctica to be prohibited and foodhauling trucks to be 
barred from shipping hazardous trash 
these mandates and more are among scores of bills approved and 
sent to president bush in the final days of the 101st congress 
while headlines concentrated on the budget legislation 
garage doors and cigarette lighters are governed by the consumer 
product safety commission which congress strengthened in its first 
reauthorization of the agency in nine years 
this important consumer protection agency was an abandoned 
stepchild during the reagan years said rep doug walgren dpa 
chairman of the house subcommittee on consumer protection 
ideological conflict among the members of the commission 
paralyzed the agency 
besides taking steps to make the commission work better 
congress ordered it to establish mandatory safety standards for 
automatic garage doors and to complete its work on cigarette 
lighters 
although many of the newer garage doors automatically reverse 
when they hit an obstruction the safety provision is not required 
more than 50 children have been killed in accidents involving 
automatic doors walgrens office said 
it also said that in 1987 fires started by children playing 
with cigarette lighters killed 180 people including 140 children 
under age 5 
this is a horrible toll that can and should be prevented with 
an effective safety standard said walgren i believe it is 
imperative that the commission move quickly to complete this 
important task 
lawmakers also saw the possibility of a toll being taken in 
antarctica 
the continent at the south pole was established as a scientific 
area in 1959 with a treaty signed by 35 countries in 1988 the 
nations agreed to regulate mining by requiring environmental 
impacts to be considered first but that pact didnt guarantee 
preservation of the antarctic 
a bill passed last week bans any us mineral development on the 
frozen continent and asks the president to negotiate new 
international treaties to ban all mining 
antarctica is the last relatively untouched continent on the 
planet providing unparalleled research opportunities and the 
united states is in a position to exert international leadership to 
permanently protect and conserve this last frontier said rep 
silvio conte rmass sponsor of the bill 
oceanographer jacquesyves cousteau in testimony to congress 
forecast possible global tragedy if antarctica were open to 
widespread mining 
the antarctic with 90 percent of the ice of the world 
represents a formidable cold storage that stabilizes the climate of 
the world cousteau said 
a slight warming of the atmosphere could trigger melting that 
would raise the level of the oceans to intolerable proportions he 
said 
coal mines would bring about coal dust on the surface of the 
ice even a small quantity would change the reflective power of the 
ic would absorb more heat from the sun would start some melting 
of the ice said cousteau 
congress passed about 200 bills in its final week some involved 
internal government operations while others addressed regional 
issues 
some took hours of debate and were voted by roll call others 
were passed in minutes on voice vote with little discussion 
two bills designed to protect the public from hazardous 
materials are on the way to the president 
rep thomas luken dohio led the effort to prohibit the 
backhauling of waste by trucks that also are used to carry 
food 
he gave a graphic example of the danger of this practice he 
said that after feed grain was transported in a rail car that 
earlier had hauled an arsenic compound 1 million worth of cattle 
died from eating the contaminated grain 
milk from other cattle was poisoned and had to be dumped for 
over four weeks until it tested clean luken said 
the legislation instructs the departments of transportation 
agriculture and health and human services and the environmental 
protection agency to consult on regulations for transporters 
no food cargo would be allowed in truck or rail cars that carry 
healththreatening materials extremely hazardous materials such 
as asbestos or infectious waste would have to be shipped only in 
carriers specifically designed for that purpose 
after eight years of trying luken also won approval of his bill 
to strengthen the law governing the transportation of hazardous 
material it makes civil and criminal penalties harsher requires 
greater safety precautions unifies federal state and local laws 
and sets up training on responding to emergencies 
luken said that last year there were more than 6000 accidents 
involving hazardous materials and that more than 165 people were

with voters in an antigovernment snit many 
candidates are trying hard to show their warm fuzzy sides in the 
final week of the election season 
children music personal drama and highminded sentiments 
generally make a comeback at the end of any political campaign but 
strategists say the soft landing is especially important this year 
the level of disgust is much higher said democratic 
pollster celinda lake you need to offer an alternative be seen 
as someone who doesnt seem political and will cut through all of 
this mess 
thats not to say hardhitting advertising and attacks have 
vanished many strategists believe longshot challengers and 
candidates in tight races must keep up the barrage if they want to 
win 
republican pollster david b hill agreed that candidates need to 
clinch the sale with niceness at the end of the season but he 
said that doesnt mean you need to pull off your other spots 
that keep your foot on the throat of your opponent that youve got 
down on the ground 
nevertheless consultants acknowledge that negative advertising 
carries greater risks this year as a result of widespread voter 
frustration with politiciansasusual 
weve always known that when you do negative campaigning you 
raise your own negative ratings and make yourself look more 
political lake said thats a more dangerous trend this year 
than normal 
thus the special emphasis on touchyfeely ads and rhetoric such 
as this 
its a warm sunny day in a new ad from lowell weicker the 
independent candidate for connecticut governor a choir sings and 
weicker tells viewers that the governors office is about 
leadership vision integrity he explained his strategy last 
week i want to become the governor of the state of connecticut 
feeling good about how i got to be the governor of the state of 
connecticut 
in neighboring massachusetts democrat john silber alienated 
many voters with his abrasive personality now hes running an ad 
in which he strolls amiably through a flea market in another spot 
hes surrounded by young children joking with a little girl as she 
combs his hair 
in rhode island an ad for rep claudine schneider praises both 
her and the man whose job she wants democratic sen claiborne 
pell as proven caring committed and honest its hard to 
tell who paid for the spot until the end when the 71yearold 
pells picture recedes behind a photo of the relatively youthful 
schneider two of a kind the announcer says one with a 
past and the other ready to meet the future 
california democrat dianne feinstein reintroduced a dramatic ad 
that helped her win the partys gubernatorial nomination feinstein 
is shown announcing the traumatic 1978 murder of san francisco 
mayor george moscone an event that put her then president of the 
citys board of supervisors into the mayors chair the ad 
highlights her support for the death penalty and abortion rights 
and describes her as tough and caring 
ben nelson the democrat challenging nebraska gov kay orr 
last week pulled all ads that criticized mrs orr or mentioned her 
name the people in nebraska think all of that stuff is 
negative he said 
oregon republican dave frohnmayer running for governor and 
colorado democrat josie heath running for the senate each have 
switched advertising consultants and strategies theyre both 
striving for more positive images 
republican analyst doug bailey warns that too much rosiness can 
backfire 
television is so slambang its all confrontation and 
slugfest and battle royal he said if you come across as soft 
or dull you can be missed altogether 
but dave petts a democratic pollster said strategists were 
rediscovering the power of positive advertising particularly when 
its used as a finale after weeks of aggressive crossfire 
theres nothing more effective than a candidate looking at the 
voters and saying this is what he or she stands for petts said 
positive information can move voters if its conveyed at a time 
in the campaign when voters are really paying attention

turn to page 225 of the 13th edition of the 
fannie farmer cookbook to learn how to truss a chicken page 628 
to bake a batch of brownies or just soak in the spirit of the 
book which is only partly about food 
it also is about an act of giving and receiving because the 
experience at table is a communal sharing talk begins to flow 
feelings are expressed and a sense of wellbeing takes over 
marion cunningham writes in the 13th edition of fannie merritt 
farmers guide to the american kitchen 
a valuable cookbook also reflects its time and the previous 
edition cunninghams first published 11 years ago already was 
losing its relevancy when she set out three years ago on the new 
edition 
i tell you things are different really different it was 
only looking recipe by recipe that i could see how dramatic our 
changes have been she said in an interview in new york 
testing every recipe in the 12th edition cunningham dropped 200 
and added 325 for an appropriate total of 1990 fat was reduced 
when it worked and recipes sometimes dropped when it didnt 
theres no kippered herring in cream or crabmeat terrapin for 
example 
there are new chapters on microwave cooking which surely wont 
prompt any manufacturers to ask her to be a spokeswoman outdoor 
cooking and vegetarian foods such as zucchini pancakes and a 
winter vegetable cobbler that will win any contest 
all sorts of ethnic ingredients are used raw fish is out as is 
steak tartare salt generally is left up to the cook and there are 
warnings about raw eggs and fish and other safety problems 
those were the issues that were very hard to reconcile 
cunningham said to act responsibly and not destroy the feeling 
that cooking and eating are well certainly one of the better 
human endeavors 
while farmer aimed the boston cookingschool cook book 
published in 1896 at families who had help in the kitchen the 
newest edition of the fannie farmer cookbook alfred a knopf 
2495 is intended to capture the way ordinary people actually 
eat 
so along with the instructions for making past from scratch are 
recipes for a ham and cheese sandwich for making popcorn hotdogs 
and macaroni and cheese cunningham tells how to improve the flavor 
of canned broths and offers suggestions for leftovers everyone 
clamors for the simple cheese spread in the appetizer chapter 
she writes 
there is plenty of practical advice too of olive oils for 
example she says money does not always buy the best and i have 
found the terms virgin and extra virgin not very meaningful 
both inside covers have all sorts of nifty facts things youve 
been told dozens of times but cant seem to keep straight such as 
how to tell if an egg is stale and whether cream whips better cold 
or at room temperature 
farmer would cunningham concluded wholeheartedly embrace 
todays health movement cunningham too thinks we ought to know 
what we eat 
but in concentrating so much on the negative aspects of 
eating we are making ourselves overly fearful and we are missing 
the pleasure that a good meal provides she writes instead of 
stringent diets eliminating almost all fats all salt all sugar 
from our diets and bloating ourselves with highfiber products i 
believe that the best possible approach for the average person is 
to eat a wide variety of foods and to eat sensibly in 
moderation 
while there is plenty of lowfat food this is no diet book 
along with the turkey patties and vegetable soups and green 
salads there is a carpetbag steak a beef and oyster dish from 
the improvident days of the 19th century and chicken fried 
steak served with milk gravy 
cunningham delivers a storehouse of basic information and a 
pep talk come on now just get up and go in the kitchen taste 
the food experiment its fun its homey and it tastes good 
dont let your failures stop you 
cooking is a dandy way to solve a lot of problems said 
cunningham besides she said its harder to learn to drive a 
car 
cunningham 68 began the 12th edition of fannie farmer in 1974 
with no writing experience and no famous name she had been a 
fulltime homemaker and two years earlier had met the late 
american cooking icon james beard 
jim beard recommended me i didnt think i had any 
qualifications said cunningham sitting on a hotel bed with her 
legs drawn up under her gray hair pulled straight back into a 
short neat ponytail 
the choice made sense to judith jones cunninghams editor at 
knopf 
for one thing she had worked with beard and his classes on 
the west coast he thought she really typified the good home cook 
in america and had natural good taste and thats just what fannie 
farmer needed jones said 
cunningham was charged with restoring the oldfashioned 
principles 
it made me so happy to have something to focus on ive really 
loved it she said i loved it from the beginning 
her pale blue eyes still express a little awe at her success 
more than a decade later during which she also has written the 
fannie farmer baking book and the breakfast book and worked 
as a restaurant consultant 
her husband a man shed known since kindergarten and who she 
says gave her the support and encouragement to become a 
professional died three years ago their son and daughter are 
grown so except for a yellow labrador named rover and a cat she 
lives alone and cooks for herself in walnut creek calif 
besides beard she uses joy of cooking and the early 
american cookbooks she collects i turn to a lot of them 
wonderful recipes simple to make 
like threequarters of american families she has a microwave 
the speedy clean and silent oven did not fare well under 
cunninghams scrutiny although she includes more than 50 recipes 
specifically for it 
the microwave has promised a lot more than it can deliver 
she said 
it was she wrote no faster than the stove for many of the 
vegetables she tested meat becomes pallid and the texture is not 
appealing 
while cunningham experimented with the new in equipment and 
ingredients sometimes she found the old to be far superior 
lobster thermidor and newburg for example did not work with 
milk instead of cream and with cream they stayed 
people can read about them if they dont want to make them 
she said

freddy krueger hates halloween 
in fact oct 31 is a nightmare for five fred kruegers who live 
in pennsylvania virginia north carolina and illinois 
its particularly tough for the fred krueger who lives in 
tobyhanna pa his house is two blocks from elm street 
no kidding fred kruegers men with the same name as the star of 
screen scream and gore are alive and well but unenthusiastic 
about the holiday that is descended from the medieval all hallows 
eve 
the prank calls and weird stares they say will be relentless 
none of the freds is maimed by scars has popout claws or even 
dons a fedora none has been accused of even one grisly murder 
unlike the prolific maniac featured in the neverending movie saga 
a nightmare on elm street but these disparities do not ward 
off pranksters 
i got some regular customers on the phone said fred krueger 
who lives in olivers mills pa and works for liberty mutual life 
insurance co 
its best to go along with them he said noting that kids 
will just harass him if he sounds mad or hangs up 
fred krueger a retired banker from charlotte nc also plays 
the demonic role but said he tries to keep it simple because he 
once scared a little girl 
she wanted to know iicopters 
to make sure no herds wander into their ranges they also patrol 
the ranges in trucks before the shells start flying over the 
tortured landscape 
it may look like crap to us but its kentucky blue grass to 
them said lt col bruce judge a marine operations and training 
officer 
safety is a paramount concern said marine capt william 
taylor a public affairs officer its like going into a farmers 
field and telling him wed like to bust some big caps in your 
backyard 
the clash of cultures is stark 
a bedouin tending his bleating livestock can see helicopters 
flitting through the skies armored columns rumbling across the 
terrain and endless convoys of military trucks on the roads 
on one night recently a patrol of three marine amphibious 
assault vehicles passed within 25 yards of a bedouin camp deep in 
the desert goats were visible through night vision goggles but 
the soldiers said they never saw the camp 
another night patrol picked up movement on its sensors but 
couldnt hear anything it turned out to be a herd of 20 camels 
passing by 
bedouin require lots of space to roam yet they say they welcome 
the troops in the desert 
i thank god the government is having people come to defend the 
kingdom alazmi said giving a visitor arabic coffee sweet tea 
and fresh dates while sitting on a rug in the shade of a tent flap 
saddam hussein should be punished he attacked people who did 
him no harm god will punish him he said 
although the bedouin life is rustic some have the luxuries of 
modern life such as mercedes benz cars and cellular telephones a 
camel can fetch 2500 at auction and thats a lot to lose to an 
errant artillery shell or a tank 
on the advice of saudi authorities another bedouin named 
abdullah rajab prepared his herd of 70 camels for a journey south 
and out of harms way 
some of the troops came and drank tea with me they were very 
nice rajab said 
as he spoke dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers from 
the british 7th desert rats armored brigade shook the ground as 
they rumbled past his livestock 
their tracks scarred a desert once trodden only by animals and 
herders 
but the military also does good deeds in the desert when hassan 
rashed alkhater of jubail the eastern saudi industrial city got 
his pickup truck stuck in the sand an army vehicle stopped to 
help 
i was waiting for 30 minutes for someone to help and a 
passing army vehicle pulled me out said alkhater who owns 150 
head of sheep and goats

kidnappers dragged hasson saleem 11 
from his schoolbus oct 10 forced him into a car and sped away 
hours later abductors seized three more boys from affluent 
families of sindh province and a former chairman of the pakistan 
national shipping corp 
kidnappings for ransom are increasing in karachi and the belief 
grows that authorities are helpless against the lawlessness 
gripping pakistans largest and most turbulent city 
in the rambunctious southern port where parties once ran until 
dawn people are afraid to go out at night 
more than 100 people have been snatched in two years no one has 
been killed but more than 1 billion rupees 500 million in 
ransom has been paid 
the list of victims reads like a whos who of industrial and 
financial families 
we want a military government an executive of a 
multinational corporation said echoing the sentiments of many 
residents we may not have law but at least well have order in 
this democracy we have neither law nor order 
benazir bhuttos political opponents blamed her for the violence 
in her home province until president ghulam ishaq khan dismissed 
her 20monthold government aug 6 it was one of the factors he 
cited in taking the action 
gen mirza aslam beg army chief of staff then declared the 
crime wave over and said peace had been restored 
kidnapping gangs soon proved him wrong abducting people at the 
rate of one a day 
businessmen held protest strikes that paralyzed karachi the 
countrys financial and industrial center but nothing changed 
the gangs have lists of top businessmen and their family 
members a security agent said speaking on condition of 
anonymity once they have selected their target a reconnaissance 
team is deployed to gather the necessary information about their 
daily movement and then they strike 
gamg members then get in touch with the victims family a deal 
is struck and the ransom paid 
families seldom request official help because they lack faith in 
the police and fear for the victims safety 
we cant trust police because most of the crimes are committed 
with their connivance said a businessman whose younger brother 
was kidnapped 
police say lack of cooperation by victims families and the 
public is a major reason for their failure to stop the kidnappers 
they also claim the gangs enjoy the patronage of some political 
parties 
authorities accuse such extremist ethnic parties of involvement 
in many of the abductions students hostels in karachi are said to 
be hideouts for the gangs 
apart from political patronage feudal patronage is also a 
factor the security expert said most gangs enjoy the support 
of the big landlords who wield political influence because of 
these factors the governments in sindh have almost become hostage 
to the criminals 
karachis economy has suffered businesses and investors are 
moving their operations from the financial and trading center of 9 
million people to safer punjab province in eastern pakistan 
i dont know what will happen to me when i leave my home 
industrialist tariq shafi said i keep an automatic gun in my 
car in this situation how do you expect us to invest in the 
city 
the flight of capital has boosted unemployment already about 25 
percent and fed the kalashnikov and heroin culture a 
reference to the soviet automatic rifles and heroin trade brought 
to pakistan by the war in neighboring afghanistan 
companies that specialize in protection are thriving 
two years ago the adamjee insurance co started offering kidnap 
policies 
initially we approached the leading businessmen but now 
they are coming to us an adamjee executive said on condition 
his name not be used 
adamjee works with lloyds of london when a client is 
kidnapped experts from britain are flown to help negotiate the 
ransom 
businessmen are abandoning expensive luxury cars for less 
conspicuous compacts hiring bodyguards and building huge steel 
gates to close off the streets around their fortified estates 
each week the heads of the 22 most powerful industrial empires 
gather in downtown karachi 
when these meetings started 15 years ago the discussions were 
about business politics culture an executive said now the 
only topic is our and our families safety

for a kid growing up in the postworld war ii 
suburbs it was a comforting world of captain kangaroo on the tube 
a new washing machine in the basement a shiny gas guzzler in the 
carport and a bomb shelter in the backyard 
this is our childhood said roger g kennedy director of 
the national museum of american history where he introduced a new 
exhibition that takes a nostalgic look at the lives of children 
born during the cold war years 
kennedy meant not only the childhood of the current baby boom 
generation of parents but in a deeper sense the innocence of a 
nation that yearned only for peace and the emblems of middleclass 
prosperity 
the show titled this is your childhood charlie brown 
children and american culture 19451968 opens today at the 
smithsonian institution museum for a sixmonth engagement through 
next april 
it contains more than 500 artifacts and graphics from an america 
that would soon lose its innocence in vietnam and the social 
upheavals of the late 1960s 
among them is charles m schulzs first peanuts comic strip 
which appeared oct 2 1950 perhaps more than any other cartoon 
characters of that era charlie brown and his friends mirrored the 
hopes and fears of postwar america with a gentle captivating 
humor 
in an age when children were taught to live by societys rules 
and obey their parents their tv heroes frequently wore uniforms 
even bob keeshans captain kangaroo wore a uniform jacket with 
badge as a figure of benevolent authority 
it was the world according to dr spock whose lab coat and 
spectacles are on display along with the drafting table where he 
wrote his bestselling paperback baby and child care for a 
generation of worried mothers 
parents worried too about communism and nuclear attack their 
childrens toys included a gilbert u238 atomic lab and civil 
defense medical kit among the hula hoops barbie dolls gi joes 
lassie lunch boxes and davy crockett coonskin caps 
also on display are such postwar images as a model of the 
sputnik satellite a space helmet dale evans and nurse nancy 
books a pink chenille bedspread a captain video game an annie 
oakley cowgirl outfit a ding dong school record player and 
romper room diploma and an easybake toy oven 
curator charles mcgovern a historian of popular culture said 
the exhibition seeks to highlight some of the myths and realities 
of what is remembered today as a very calm and tranquil era 
actually he said happy suburbanites and the threat of 
nuclear war lived side by side along with growing urban poverty 
and racial divisions that erupted into social conflicts in the 
1960s 
kennedy said the whole fabric of american society began a long 
unraveling 
parents tried to shield their children from societys problems 
with barriers of security and conformity mcgovern said but 
the children rebelled against parental values when they discovered 
that affluence was not translating fully into happiness and 
social justice 
the show ends by raising questions about whether parents can 
protect their children from new threats of drug abuse violence 
aids and homelessness childhood today is at risk suggests 
mcgovern 
the exhibition was underwritten by a 125000 grant from united 
media which syndicates the peanuts comic strip

eugene roberts former executive editor of 
the philadelphia inquirer tuesday said he had no evidence that 
pennsylvania supreme court justice james mcdermott was corrupt 
either before or after the newspaper published a 1983 series 
critical of the states highest court 
mcdermott has sued the inquirer claiming he was maliciously 
defamed and his reputation damaged because of the articles which 
were published may 17 1983 and titled above the law roberts 
is listed as a defendant in the case 
the series subtitled the questionable conduct of the 
pennsylvania supreme court alleged that the justices routinely 
participate in cases in which their friends have an interest 
ignore judicial canons of ethics meant to regulate their conduct 
and engage in politicking influencepeddling and favoritism 
mcdermotts lawyer james beasley asked roberts if any evidence 
has appeared since series was published that would indicate 
mcdermott was corrupt 
roberts answered no 
beasley asked how the series title came about and roberts told 
him above the law was probably composed by a copy editor 
handling the series written by daniel biddle also a defendant in 
the lawsuit 
is it a reasonable synopsis of what the story was about 
beasley asked roberts responded yes 
beasley pressed on do you believe the title could connote 
criminal conduct 
no said roberts 
most of the days proceedings involved legal conferences out of 
the jurys hearing by the opposing lawyers with common pleas judge 
john lavelle of carbon county specially appointed by the supreme 
court to try the case 
roberts who was scheduled to return to the witness stand 
wednesday acknowledged that one of the objectives of journalism is 
to write a story that is fair balanced and accurate 
thats because you want the people to believe what you print 
is true beasley asked 
thats one of the reasons roberts replied adding that 
readers have a right to a balanced story that gives different 
points of view and is accurate 
roberts three years ago was named president of philadelphia 
newspapers inc which publishes the morning inquirer and the 
afternoon daily news he retired last month and plans to teach next 
year at the university of maryland 
he testified that as the inquirers executive editor a post he 
held for 18 years he could kill any story he didnt want in the 
newspaper and never needed anyones permission to do it 
thats enormous power beasley said and roberts agreed 
about the court series roberts testified he didnt select the 
language that went into the story or how paragraphs were 
positioned nor does he remember doing any editing of it 
beasley asked do you have any evidence that prior to may 1983 
that justice mcdermott ruled on any case in favor of a friend or 
campaign contributor while he served for 15 years on the common 
pleas bench 
i dont recall the common pleas bench but i know he ruled in 
a case for a friend and campaign contributor when he was on the 
supreme court roberts responded

the solid united nations front forged to 
squeeze saddam hussein out of kuwait has evolved during the 
threemonth occupation into an alliance divided over strategy and 
goals 
the wild card is saddam himself who is selectively freeing some 
western hostages like the french in hopes of eroding support 
for military action he has tried to fashion a regional perception 
that the struggle is not over kuwait but whether arabs or the west 
will hold sway in the middle east 
saddams neighbor saudi arabia exemplifies the conflicts 
within the alliance assembled against iraq 
the saudis demand that iraq withdraw from kuwait and want saddam 
to promise never to attack another arab state at the same time 
there have been indications the saudis might consider concessions 
of kuwaiti territory 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev suggested monday the time 
was ripe for another arab diplomatic initiative perhaps led by 
saudi arabia 
with the saudi oil installations vulnerable to attack the 
countrys defense minister prince sultan has said his country 
now playing host to the multinational force would never allow an 
attack to be launched from its territory 
however king fahds son prince mohammed was quoted as saying 
the waiting period for ending iraqs occupation of kuwait through 
the embargo will be soon defined because patience has limits 
secretary of state james a baker iii is expected to visit saudi 
arabia and possibly other arab capitals next month in an apparent 
effort to shore up the alliance against saddam 
some analysts say the differing approaches of the nations 
opposed to saddam actually complement each other preparing the 
military punch while pursuing the diplomatic option 
that range of difference in the multinational group is a 
positive thing said middle east analyst shahram chubin of the 
genevabased center for strategic studies 
if you want the regional coalition behind you you have to 
show that youve given the un option a chance he said by 
telephone 
theres a great and deep ambivalence on the part of the united 
states regional arab allies about the whole enterprise he 
said theres a lot of antiwestern feelings and theres a 
feeling of solidarity with their cousins in iraq 
the linchpin position is held by the united states which has 
deployed 220000 troops in the persian gulf president bush has 
demanded iraqs unconditional withdrawal from the oilrich emirate 
it invaded aug 2 as well as restoration of the ruling alsabah 
family 
bush has repeatedly stressed the military option and defense 
secretary dick cheney has said as many as 100000 more gis could be 
deployed if needed cia director william webster said the bush 
administration believes the middle east will not be secure while 
saddams weaponry is intact 
the persian gulf crisis is filled with political traps for bush 
largescale casualties would be a liability while a diplomatic 
solution that left saddams war machine in place would sow the 
seeds for a reprise of the present conflict 
were into a perilous phase in the standoff if the goal of the 
allied forces is more than what the un resolution calls for to 
destroy saddam and his ability to make war said a middle east 
expert with the us state department 
then no matter what amount of diplomacy is engaged theres 
no way to avoid shooting most of the european allies would not 
necessarily support that with the exception of britain he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
i dont think you can get the french to agree that the goal is 
now to destroy saddam the state department expert said i 
dont think the arab states can send their troops into battle for 
that purpose 
the united states has the most troops in the multinational 
force followed by britain and france 
britain stands squarely behind bush on the use of force against 
saddam but france and the soviet union have rejected any military 
action without express united nations approval 
british prime minister margaret thatcher has been most outspoken 
about military action you get him out make him pay and see that 
hes never in a position to do these things again she has said 
france which favors waiting for economic sanctions to force 
iraq out of kuwait was iraqs closest western economic partner 
before the invasion although iraq apparently tried to woo france 
by freeing french hostages president francois mitterrand has 
rejected any concessions in exchange for hostages

mohammed miari an israeli arab and michael 
eitan a jew are two members of parliament whose quarrel goes to 
the heart of the arabisraeli conflict 
miari from an arab village in northern israel was involved 
with the palestine liberation organization in a futile attempt to 
sail a shipload of palestinians back to their homeland in february 
1988 
eitan a jew saw it as an act of treason designed to turn 
israel into palestine and undermine the jews right to the land he 
went on a 36day sitdown strike in the attorney generals office 
to get him to prosecute miari 
the attorney general yosef harish finally agreed to ask the 
knesset or parliament to lift miaris parliamentary immunity so 
that he could be prosecuted 
on monday a parliamentary committee agreed to the unprecedented 
step by a vote of 136 with two abstentions 
the move stands a good chance of winning final approval by the 
120member knesset next month and an equally good chance of being 
declared unlawful by the supreme court because the whole point of 
immunity is to enable a lawmaker to fulfill his election promises 
my immunity is not given me by legislators but by the masses 
who elected me for my message of seeking peace and a just solution 
by establishing a palestinian state alongside israel miari said 
after the vote 
miari is not accused of abetting terrorism and a 1986 law 
forbidding contact between israelis and plo officials has been 
openly violated by several israeli lawmakers including miari 
but to israelis like eitan the case of the plo ship is very 
different 
the ship was to carry 180 palestinian deportees and some 120 
sympathizers moreover it was named al awda the return an 
evocative word meaning the palestinians right to reclaim the land 
that became israel in 1948 
al awda is one of the basics of plo doctrine eitan said in 
an interview tuesday the plo knows that talk of throwing the 
jews into the sea no longer goes down well so they say right of 
return whereby all the palestinians will come back to israel and 
then the jews will have nowhere to go but into the sea 
the project failed because the ship owner canceled the charter 
agreement and the vessel was then sabotaged in an explosion the 
perpetrators are unknown but miari suspects israeli secret agents 
miari says eitans fears are groundless 
yes there are those who think in an abstract way that the 
whole land belongs to the palestinians just as there are jews who 
think the whole of palestine belongs to the jews he said in an 
interview 
he believes based on a dozen meetings with arafat and other top 
plo officials that the plo is set on a course of negotiations to 
achieve two states for two nations 
miari 51 was born in the village of birweh near acre in 
northern israel in 1948 the arabisraeli war reached birweh and 
the miaris fled to a neighboring town when they came home the 
village was in rubble 
miari studied law at the hebrew university in jerusalem and was 
always politically active in 1984 he ran for the knesset on the 
ticket of the progressive list for peace a leftwing arabjewish 
coalition advocating negotiations with the plo and was elected 
along with matti peled a retired jewish army general 
in 1988 he was reelected this time alone but still the third 
strongest force among israels 800000 arab voters 
at each election authorities banned the party as a threat to 
state security each time the supreme court quashed the ban 
eitan 46 sees the plo as a movement bent on israels 
destruction and miari as one of its representatives in the knesset 
until his party the governing likud bloc ordered him to 
desist he would open each speech with the words mr speaker 
honored members of the knesset excluding plo representatives 
seated in this chamber 
he says he understands miaris motives and respects his 
integrity but understanding and sympathy are only good as far as 
my front yard when understanding and sympathy means having to give 
up the state of israel the only country i have then it stops 
every independence day while israeli jews dance in celebration 
of their statehood miari takes his wife and children to birweh and 
joins the rest of the villagers in paying respects to the place 
they still call home 
for 2000 years the jews remembered jerusalem and the land 
he says so why should the arabs forget after 40 years

there are still more labor union members in new 
york city than anywhere else but whether it is still a union 
town in the traditional sense is critical to the unions striking 
the daily news 
despite a steady decline in the power of nonmunicipal labor 
unions over the past 30 years the battle over the newspaper has 
provided evidence of labors continuing clout 
many newsstand dealers said they were not selling the daily 
news because of threats from men who followed delivery trucks 
around the city 
two municipal unions barred a daily news editor from covering 
a news conference monday at which the unions announced they were 
breaking off contract talks with the city 
union leaders announced plans for a boycott against daily news 
advertisers 
in an ad in the daily news a manhattan car dealer said 
attention union members extra deep discount savings just show 
us your union card 
but what really is a union town 
union leader don owen summed it up by telling of a day in his 
childhood when his mother stopped him from crossing a picket line 
in front of a store 
she said we cant go in there she explained the whole 
thing to me and that was it we didnt go until the strike was 
over he said 
but today people are not familiar with that scenario any 
more everybodys just out for themselves says owen now a vice 
president of the amalgamated transit union 
union drivers struck greyhound eight months ago but riders are 
still buying tickets and the buses roll with permanent nonunion 
replacements eastern airlines continues to operate in the second 
year of a machinists strike 
you give people half fare and theyll get on the damn plane if 
they see a wing hanging off owen said 
esther fuchs a political science professor at barnard college 
says that although unions remain part of the citys political 
fabric there are no union towns any more 
i would guess that the public is not going to be particularly 
distressed that the daily news is considered to be antiunion in 
this particular dispute she said 
theodore kheel adviser to the newspaper unions conceded that 
unlike 40 years ago crossing a picket line is no longer anathema 
there is less support today for unions kheel said 
the news said in tuesdays editions that 45 of the 350 newspaper 
guild members in its editorial department returned to work monday 
only nine of the papers 10 unions are on strike members of the 
typographical union have continued working because they have 
guaranteed lifetime jobs 
but kheel said the wounds inflicted by the daily news on its 
workers are so raw that oldfashioned union solidarity will make 
the boycott work 
one and a half million union people in the city with an 
average of three people per family four and a half million people 
with union connections and there will be an impact kheel 
asserted 
he said the reagan administrations crushing of the air traffic 
controllers strike in 1981 emboldened employers to take on unions 
todays unionists come less and less from the ranks of 
bluecollar factory workers labor militants who also happened to 
be the core of the daily news 24 million daily circulation of 
four decades ago 
since world war ii new york city has lost twothirds of a 
million factory jobs more than detroit had when it was the world 
capital of car manufacturing there still are a third of a million 
manufacturing jobs in the city but they continued to bleed away 
the areas of decline were heavily union and except for the 
public sector the growth industries have been largely nonunion in 
the 1980s said samuel ehrenhalt regional director of the 
federal bureau of labor statistics 
the environment in which unions operate has changed 
ehrenhalt said both the economic environment and the political 
and social environment weve seen people ready to disregard 
strikes as in the case of the airlines unions have been on the 
defensive 
in the united states union membership is about 60 percent in 
private employ and 40 percent public opposite to the balance in 
new york city said leo troy an economics professor at rutgers 
university 
new york city is clearly still a union town but now 
predominantly public sector rather than private troy said 
its a union town because the politicians are in bed with the 
unions

an experimental treatment strengthened a foot 
muscle in three muscular dystrophy patients raising hopes of 
countering the disabling weakness produced by the disease a study 
says 
scientists had injected about 8 million immature muscle cells 
called myoblasts into the muscle that raises the big toe 
the result in the first three patients treated is very 
exciting news said peter law of the university of 
tennesseememphis results are not yet available for eight later 
patients he said 
scientists hope the technique will let them overcome progressive 
muscle weakness and wasting caused by duchenne muscular dystrophy 
the most common and devastating childhood form of dystrophy 
duchenne which strikes boys almost exclusively usually appears 
between ages 3 and 5 progressive weakness forces most patients to 
use wheelchairs by age 12 and few survive beyond their early 20s 
the disease caused by a defective gene strikes once in every 
3500 male births 
law discussed his results in a telephone interview before 
participating in a news conference tuesday at the annual meeting of 
the society for neuroscience in st louis 
he cautioned that the experimental treatment needs more study 
before it could be considered for general use 
dr leon charash chairman of the muscular dystrophy 
associations medical advisory committee called the result a 
very important preliminary finding 
it is the first report of increased strength from the technique 
and thats of course what weve all been waiting for he said 
but charash stressed that the result must be duplicated in 
larger muscles and that scientists must find out whether the 
improvement will endure 
his association helped pay for the research 
researchers in part chose the foot muscle in case anything went 
wrong and the muscle had to be removed law said 
animal studies suggest that some injected myoblasts merge to 
form new healthy muscle fibers while others fuse to the patients 
ailing muscle cells and introduce a full complement of genes that 
stops muscle degeneration by replacing the defective gene that 
causes duchenne dystrophy law said 
myoblasts for the first boy injected were taken from his 
adoptive father while the two other boys received myoblasts from 
their brothers the three boys took the drug cyclosporine to keep 
their bodies from rejecting the myoblasts 
three months after injection the treated muscles in the three 
boys had strengthened by 18 percent just over 30 percent and about 
80 percent law said the 80 percent gain probably reflects the 
fact that this boy was weakest to begin with law said 
cyclosporine was stopped three months after injection at six 
months after injection the muscles showed some additional gain in 
strength law said 
the muscle function continues to improve indicating that the 
cells are not dying are not being rejected so this is very 
important he said 
the eight other patients in the study are continuing on 
cyclosporine as researchers look for strength improvements six and 
nine months after injection he said 
no patient has shown side effects from the treatment law said 
in perhaps three months law said he hopes to start another 
study in which about 1 billion myoblasts would be injected into 
major leg muscles if that is effective it might help patients 
walk he said

the drug enforcement administration says it is 
investigating whether one of its undercover couriers may have 
unknowingly carried the bomb that blew up pan am flight 103 over 
scotland 
the december 1988 bombing which killed 270 people aboard the 
plane and in the village of lockerbie has been attributed by law 
enforcement authorities to a proiranian terrorist group 
investigators said the terrorist group put plastic explosive in 
a tape recorder in baggage that was shipped from frankfurt 
germany 
nbc news which first reported the new dea investigation tuesday 
night said it had learned that pan ams flights from frankfurt had 
been used in a cyprusbased undercover operation to fly informants 
and suitcases of heroin from the middle east to detroit 
nazir khalid jafaar 20 of detroit was killed in the bombing 
the network said part of the drug agency review was to determine 
whether he had been enlisted in the drug operation and whether he 
had been tricked into carrying the bomb 
the drug agency and german authorities had arranged for pan 
american world airways baggage operation in frankfurt to be used 
to put suitcases of heroin on planes apparently without the usual 
security checks nbc news said it cited an unidentified airline 
source 
in a statement late tuesday the dea said it was aware of 
allegations made to the media that an agency operation was 
involved in the bombing 
although no evidence has surfaced to substantiate such a 
claim we are conducting an inquiry into these allegations 
including a review of case files and dea operations and activities 
in the relevant time period the statement said 
spokesman frank shults said the agency hoped to know where it 
stands at about the end of this week 
a presidential commission on air terrorism reported in may it 
found no evidence of any involvement by the dea with the bombing 
rep james traficant dohio said last november he had received 
an insurance investigators report that convinced him the central 
intelligence agency had been tipped an attack might be made on the 
plane 
the report he asserted contended that the cia was covering 
up a drug run between frankfurt and new york something the cia 
immediately characterized as ridiculous 
pan am subpoenaed documents from the dea and five other agencies 
in an effort to prove that security agencies had received warnings 
about the bombings 
the judge in the victims lawsuit against the airline reviewed 
documents produced by those agencies but found no basis for 
turning them over to pan am said steven pounian a lawyer 
representing victim families in the case in us district court in 
brooklyn ny 
pounian declined to comment on tuesdays announcement by the 
drug agency 
pamela hanlon spokeswoman for the airline in new york also 
declined to comment 
the terrorist group according to law enforcement agencies was 
retaliating for the accidental shooting down of an iranian airliner 
over the persian gulf the previous summer by a us warship

air may be free but it will cost almost 
everyone to make sure its clean 
the newly passed clean air bill aimed at ridding the nation of 
much of its atmospheric pollution over the next decade is expected 
to carry an eventual price tag of more than 22 billion a year to 
the economy 
and if you drive a car use electricity or buy hair spray you 
will help pay the bill businesses from mortuaries to bakeries will 
be affected and may pass on their costs to customers or reduce 
their profits 
president bush is expected to sign the measure which will usher 
in new pollution control requirements on factories refineries 
electric utilities and automakers 
the estimates on how much the antipollution law will cost have 
ranged widely the white house puts the bill at 10 billion a year 
by 1995 and anywhere from 22 billion to 25 billion a year by 
2005 some industry estimates have ranged at more than 60 billion 
a year 
americans will see continued progress to improve the nations 
air quality but they also will pay the price said william fay 
who headed industrys lobbying efforts against the bill the 
measure cleared congress easily last weekend 
the economy already spends an estimated 32 billion a year on 
air pollution controls the environmental protection agency 
estimates many in industry and government say that amount easily 
could double 
but environmentalists argue the industry figures are highly 
inflated and even the more conservative government estimates may 
not take into account future cost savings by the adoption of new 
technologies and business ingenuity 
history demonstrates that once a law is passed people find a 
less expensive way to comply with it says richard ayres 
executive director of the clean air coalition the environmental 
umbrella group that campaigned for a strong bill for more than a 
year 
when all of the new requirements are in place the typical 
household likely will pay less for the improved air quality than it 
does for going to the movies said ayres he cited a study that 
estimated the cost at about 20 per household a month by the year 
2005 less than what the typical family pays on movies tobacco 
products or alcoholic beverages 
while the extent of the new costs may be hard to pin down the 
fact that cleaner air will be more expensive is certain 
automakers say new equipment to comply with tougher tailpipe 
emission standards will add 500 or more to the price of a car and 
make some vehicles difficult to engineer so they meet the new 
requirements others put the added cost of a car at closer to 130 
per vehicle and note that is less than the cost of many popular 
options such as a stereo radio 
gasoline prices also are expected to increase because refineries 
will have to produce cleanerburning fuel the new gasoline blends 
which will be required in cities with the worst smog and account 
for onefourth of all the gasoline sold may cost motorists several 
pennies to a dime more a gallon 
the cost of cutting acid rain pollutants from coalburning power 
plants will total 5 billion to 7 billion a year with consumers 
in midwestern states absorbing most of that burden the utility 
industry says 
we estimated it will cost us approximately 700 million a year 
from 1995 to 2004 to comply with the new acid rain control 
measures said luke feck a spokesman for american electric power 
the utility holding company provides customers with electricity in 
indiana ohio michigan kentucky tennessee and west virginia 
feck said rates for aep customers will go up an average 13 to 15 
percent but for some such as those provided electricity from 
ohio power whose plants are among the dirtiest the increase 
could be as much as 30 percent 
most of the utilities with dirty plants will be forced to either 
switch from highsulfur coal to a more expensive fuel or install 
scrubbers that can cost 100 million apiece 
new curbs on industrial emissions both toxic chemicals and 
smogcausing pollutants will be costly to small businesses as 
well as huge petrochemical plants forcing higher prices on 
everything from plastic toys to car repainting and drycleaning a 
dress 
some consumer items such as hair spray or deodorant may 
become more expensive because of new requirements phasing out not 
only environmentally damaging chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs but 
also some of their less damaging substitutes motorists will find 
that automobile air conditioner coolants such as freon a cfc will 
no longer be available over the counter

workmen tunneling under the english 
channel have created the first land link between britain and the 
continent connecting 31 miles of tunnel in a prodigious feat of 
engineering and finance 
transmanche link the construction consortium building the 
chunnel said the historic linkup occurred at 825 pm tuesday 
when british workers sent a probe 2 inches in diameter through to 
their french colleagues 
linking england and france the tunnel symbolizes the growing 
unification of europe it also fulfills a dream of napoleon who 
wanted to send his armies through the tunnel to conquer britain 
eurotunnel plc the anglofrench consortium overseeing the 
worlds largest engineering project plans for highspeed trains to 
pass through the channel tunnel in june 1993 
eventually a train trip from paris to london should take three 
hours 
despite her countrymens fears of losing their ancient moat 
against europe british prime minister margaret thatcher described 
the breakthrough as a very exciting moment 
it is an example of what europe is about she said in 
london this is europe in practice 
in london the conservative daily express newspaper noted today 
that britons will be able to walk to france for the first time 
since the ice age 
this is a hugely historic moment because it means in effect 
that britain is no longer an island a construction union 
official in calais said threading a spinning probe the width of a 
garden hose through 100 yards of chalk under the channel bears the 
first tangible fruit in three years of drilling 
champagne corks popped and workers danced jigs after french 
drillers phoned news of the probes arrival to their british 
counterparts 
initial tests indicated the two halves were 20 inches out of 
alignment technicians will be more certain wednesday but they 
called the rough lineup exceptional 
the workers will now bore out a oneyard hole tunnelers are 
expected to walk through and greet each other with handshakes in a 
few weeks 
the tunneling machine on the french side will then guide itself 
by laser toward the british machine ensuring perfect alignment 
thatcher and french president francois mitterrand will meet 
midtunnel on jan 26 
the linkup came on the maintenance tunnel the smallest of three 
tunnels being dug the other two will handle rail traffic freight 
and special piggyback trains that will carry passengers and cars 
about 80 percent of all the drilling is now complete 
eight workers suffered injures two seriously about 90 minutes 
after tuesdays linkup when a tractor rolled over on them in a 
service gallery authorities in nearby sangatte reported 
since the tunnel construction began in 1987 there have been 
seven accidental deaths on the british side and two on the french 
side 
the tunnels cost has soared from an initial estimate of 94 
billion to 167 billion including an extra 197 billion in case 
of unforeseen cost overruns 
the digging is accomplished by gargantuan boring machines that 
bring to mind images from japanese monster movies 
each resembles a gnawing worm some threestories high with a 
spinning drill of hundreds of blades mechanical legs slap together 
the concrete tunnel lining in the wake of the advancing drill head 
whhen its work is done the drilling machine on the french side 
will be hauled out in pieces the one on the british side will dig 
a side passage and be buried in cement officials say it is too 
costly to extricate the machine 
the tunnels were joined 13 miles southeast of folkestone 
england the british terminus near dover and 10 miles northwest of 
sangatte near calais 
the tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side accounting 
for its total length of 31 miles 
militant workers on the french side are striking for more pay 
and began a work slowdown thursday threatening to stall the 
linkup but it came off on schedule 
eurotunnel plc announced oct 8 that it had reached an agreement 
with its banks on 35 billion in new credit more than 200 banks 
are involved in financing the worlds costliest tunnel 
the threehour paristolondon trip would be comparable to 
flying if transport to and from airports is included and is half 
the time of the present carferry journey 
officials estimate the tunnel trains may carry 28 million 
passengers in the first year of operation eurotunnel doesnt 
expect a profit until the end of the century 
france hopes the project will revitalize depressed northern 
regions but many britons fear an influx of continental ills 
ranging from terrorists to rabid animals 
britain warned napoleon not to try to build the tunnel digging 
was started subsequently in 1882 and 1974 but both efforts failed

its autumn in the nations capital but 
fatima a 32yearold kuwaiti educator is still wearing the thin 
cotton outfits she had when she wound up stranded in the united 
states three months ago 
she had left her husband and 16yearold daughter at home so she 
could attend a conference at the university of connecticut in july 
shortly before iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 she hasnt seen her 
family since 
depressed and alone fatima spends her days trying to spread the 
word about what is happening inside her country at night she 
sleeps in a rented oneroom apartment she asked that her last name 
not be used for fear that her family in kuwait could be harmed 
fatima and several dozen other kuwaitis work as volunteers 
at the headquarters of citizens for a free kuwait a nonprofit 
group established to draw attention to kuwait 
the volunteers cling to each other as if they were family 
anxiously awaiting news from inside their country 
the group is financed in part by the kuwait governmentinexile 
it has hired the public relations firm of hill amp knowlton to help 
publicize the countrys plight 
kuwaits leaders are living in saudi arabia and its embassies 
around the world are still functioning kuwait is financing its 
projects and giving stipends to stranded citizens with money from 
its overseas investments 
we are undertaking a public education campaign trying to 
explain what is happening to kuwait emphasizing the human 
tragedy said dr hassan alebraheem the groups president 
alebraheem a professor at kuwait university was on vacation at 
the time of the invasion 
alebraheem said the group has received tremendous support 
from americans people in the midwest seem to be particularly eager 
to learn about kuwait he said 
he was pleased that secretary of state james a baker iii 
highlighted kuwaits situation in a speech in los angeles this 
week 
it is a story of barbarism in its most crude and evil form 
the rape of kuwait baker said he gave details of iraqi soldiers 
shooting two kuwaiti children 
citizens for a free kuwait has opened its main us office in a 
building several miles from the white house the furnishings are 
austere few pictures are on the walls and paper kuwaiti flags 
serve as decorations 
for most of the volunteers the office has become their home 
away from home all told about 3000 kuwaitis are stranded in the 
united states roughly half of them students 
while most of the volunteers are kuwaiti citizens some are 
americans such as stephanie mcgehee 37 of san diego 
mcgehee worked in kuwait for several years as a photographer and 
was there when iraq invaded she wrote about her dramatic aug 17 
escape from the country for the associated press 
mcgehee said her work for the kuwaiti group takes up about 24 
hours a day 
she and others arrange visits to college campuses set up 
seminars nd plan publicity events the group has reached 
supporters in many states in an effort to persuade local 
governments to pass resolutions supporting kuwait 
the group has scheduled prayer vigils in the nations capital 
los angeles and san francisco on friday 
alebraheem said he and others hope for a peaceful solution to 
the situation in kuwait but he added that military action might be 
the only course 
nobody actually favors violence or bloodshed he said but 
all diplomatic efforts have been shut out the news is very 
negative

lawton chiles daughter wept when he took a 
prochoice stand on abortion during a televised debate in the 
florida governors race 
i was watching my dad being so proud of him said rhea 
chilesmackinnon when he said he would veto any legislation that 
would restrict abortion my heart fell i was so overwhelmed i began 
to cry 
thats because shes steadfast in her conviction that abortion 
is murder so is her husband alex 
we cant rationalize it we cant turn our cheek and look the 
other way said chiles adopted 24yearold daughter its not 
a spiritual issue its not a catholic issue its not a matter of 
personal choice its a human rights issue abortion is inhumane 
the democratic candidate first broached the issue during a 
primary debate in september when challenged for a stand by party 
rival bill nelson he beat nelson handily and is in a neckandneck 
race with gov bob martinez 
during his 18 years in the us senate chiles supported 
abortion only in the case of rape incest or danger to the life of 
the mother he voted for a constitutional amendment to overturn the 
us supreme courts roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion 
like prolife candidate martinez he is personally opposed to 
abotion but chiles says he would veto any attempt to change 
floridas abortion law because it would violate the states 
guaranteed right to privacy 
a decision whether to obtain an abortion is uniquely personal 
to each woman chiles says and government should not interfere 
with this personal right 
martinez called a special session in 1989 in an unsuccessful bid 
to restrict access to abortion and regulate abortion clinics 
mrs chilesmackinnon wrote to martinez at the time calling 
abortion cruel and violent i thanked him for standing up for 
whats right for standing on his convictions 
her personal stand was known long before abortion became an 
issue in the governors race an article she wrote explaining her 
opposition was published in the tampa tribune in may and three 
prolife feminist guest columns have appeared in the oracle the 
university of south florida student newspaper 
now that her views have been thrust into the campaign it has 
created an emotional tugofwar for her 
i love my dad she said noting their similarities on a key 
point education and counseling to end abortion chiles has said 
he respects his daughters right to her own opinion and agrees 
there is a common ground for them 
during her pregnancy mrs chilesmackinnon began to wonder about 
her natural mother she began a search for the woman who at 16 gave 
birth to her and gave her up under pressure from her family she 
found her mother and they have since become friends 
i was so grateful to the one who gave me life i wanted to find 
her so she would know it and know what a wonderful life i have 
said mrs chilesmackinnon abortion at that time was illegal but 
available 
if it werent for her choosing life for me i wouldnt be here 
today standing up for the lives of unborn children who dont have a 
choice

japan has increased its investment in the us 
food system but still is a long way from taking over the nations 
farms and agribusiness network an agriculture department analyst 
says 
for example japanese investors last year bought about 456 
million worth of us farmland compared with 289 million spent in 
1988 
before that the biggest singleyear japanese investment in us 
farmland was 22 million in 1982 said christine bolling of the 
departments economic research service 
overall about 1 billion worth of farmland that agency 
researchers are aware of has been bought with japanese money 
sometimes in joint ventures with us companies also japanese 
investors have spend an additional 5 billion to buy or invest in 
agriculturally related businesses 
bolling whose study was reported in the november issue of 
farmline magazine said the joint ventures with partial ownership 
mask the overall presence of japanese ownership 
according to commerce department figures total foreign 
investment in the us agribusiness sector is about 30 billion 
with an additional 10 billion in agricultural land 
thus the 6 billion japan has in farmland and related 
industries represents about a 15 percent share of the 40 billion 
foreign total 
the us agribusiness complex is so huge that foreign 
properties are a small part of the whole complex bolling said 
japan is not the largest foreign investor in american 
agriculture and agribusiness she said but it does appear to be 
grow faster than some of the traditional leading investors 
including the united kingdom 
while some are concerned about increasing japanese investment 
in us agribusiness there should be no more concern than that 
over british canadian or other foreign investment in the 
agribusiness sector bolling said 
among the largest japanese holdings are a 77000acre cattle 
ranch in montana a 25000acre citrus grove in florida and a 
1000acre prune orchard in northern california 
in food processing bolling said japanese investors own the 
secondlargest vinegar company in the united states several food 
processing plants and a company that controls 60 percent of the 
breadbaking industry in hawaii 
japanese are also involved in california wines bottled water 
and soft drinks alaskan fish processing textile mills and feed 
additives and grain storage bolling said they also hold a major 
interest in the 7eleven chain of convenience stores 
in some cases japanese investments in us agribusiness are 
part of a vertically integrated industry where the products are 
shipped to japan she said such situations have developed in 
the citrus prune and beef industries 
for example bolling said japan not only has bought a montana 
cattle ranch but also feedlots and beefprocessing plants in 
washington and california she said joint ventures in feedlots have 
been established in california colorado illinois iowa nebraska 
nevada pennsylvania texas and wyoming 
altogether bolling said beef shipments originating from these 
cattle operations represent 15 percent to 20 percent of the us 
beef exports to japan 
the japanese investment in us agribusiness is part of a 
global phenomenon of market integration she said it also fits 
in with japans situation in that it is an affluent but 
fooddeficit country that sets high standards for the food it 
imports and consumes 
 
washington ap about 330000 farmers participating in the 
longterm conservation reserve program soon will be getting 16 
billion in rental payments for taking cropland from production 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says 
the payments are for the 1991 fiscal year that began oct 1 
yeutter said tuesday the departments agricultural stabilization 
and conservation service will notify county offices to begin 
payments immediately without any further delay 
during the recent budgetcutting maneuvers it appeared the 
payments would be delayed or even reduced but yeutter said full 
cash payments will be made to cover contracts signed to place 
cropland in the program during crop years 1986 through 1990 
under the program farmers agree to idle highly erodible 
cropland for 10 years in return the government helps pay the cost 
of establishing protective grass or trees and provides annual 
rental payments for the land taken from production 
the payments average nearly 50 per acre annually approximately 
339 million acres have been signed up in the program 
yeutters announcement was hailed by rep kika de la garza 
dtexas chairman of the house agriculture committee as good 
news for farmers who need to pay bills for this years operations 
and to make plans for next year 
de la garza said the conservation program continues to play a 
very important role in helping protect the environment 
 
washington ap preliminary results show a new triplewhammy 
beetle bait shows promise against corn rootworm beetles according 
to the agriculture department 
besides a small amount of lethal insecticide the bait contains 
a compound that attracts the beetles and a feeding stimulant that 
makes them eat more a fatal last meal 
officials said the bait was spread on more than 1000 acres of 
corn in south dakota nebraska illinois iowa and indiana in 
august 
gerald r sutter of the departments agricultural research 
service in brookings sd said tuesday in a report issued here 
that if the new bait works corn farmers could dramatically cut 
insecticide use 
the bait contains only about 2 percent of the insecticide 
normally used in sprays against the adult beetles he said 
sutter said the preliminary results show the bait reduced beetle 
populations in the corn next spring will show whether the 
reduction was enough to significantly lower the beetles egg laying 
for a new hatch

the two house members with the biggest 
campaign bank accounts entered the final five weeks of the 1990 
election season with more money than all 331 house challengers 
combined according to a new survey 
the review of the latest federal election commission filings in 
house races underscores the huge fundraising advantages enjoyed by 
incumbents 
for example the 406 house incumbents seeking reelection 
entered the final stretch of the campaign with 97 million to 
spend 29 times more than the 33 million held by challengers 
seven of the 406 incumbents had at least 1 million in their 
campaign accounts as of sept 30 according to the survey by common 
cause a citizens group that advocates public financing of election 
campaigns 
the two incumbents with the biggest war chests democratic 
reps mel levine of california and stephen solarz of new york had 
more cash on hand than all 331 challengers combined 
levine reported a balance of 17 million while solarz had 
165 million 
not far behind were reps david dreier rcalif and charles 
schumer dny who reported campaign balances of 16 million and 
14 million respectively 
reps dan rostenkowski dill robert matsui dcalif and 
james quillen rtenn each had 1 million on hand as of sept 30 
in all house incumbents have had 204 million to spend on 1990 
elections including 146 million raised since 1988 elections and 
58 million left over in campaign accounts common cause said 
that total is nine times more than the 24 million raised by 
challengers the survey found 
common cause which is seeking new restrictions on political 
action committee donations said house incumbents had reaped nearly 
70 million in pac money in 1989 and the first nine months of 1990 
challengers received just 37 million from pacs in that period 
the hefty fundraising edge allows incumbents to easily outspend 
their opponents 
house incumbents spent 969 million from jan 1 1989 through 
sept 30 nearly five times the 20 million spent by challengers 
the extraordinary campaign finance advantage that house 
incumbents have over their challengers is corrupting our political 
process to the point where we wont have real elections for the 
house of representatives in 1990 common cause president fred 
wertheimer said in a statement released with the organizations 
latest campaign finance survey 
common cause said there were only 29 house races in which the 
challenger had raised at least half as much as the incumbent in 
eight of those races the challengers had raised more

when the cost of the senate race in north 
carolina between jesse helms and harvey gantt is tallied it will be 
easy to forget the 22072 spent on paper and envelopes in faraway 
iowa 
neither candidate is shopping out of state the supplies were 
for a conservative groups mailing criticizing democrat gantt the 
spending is just a tiny slice of the millions special interest 
groups are pouring into targeted races as the 1990 campaign draws 
to a close 
the money not subject to contribution limits because it never 
enters campaign treasuries is coming from such diverse groups as 
the realtors political action committee abortion rights groups 
antiabortion forces environmentalists and a pac representing 
dealers of japanesemade cars 
entering the final week of the campaign special interests had 
reported spending roughly 4 million on independent expenditures to 
influence congressional campaigns in 1988 about 72 million in 
independent expenditures on congressional races was reported 
this year the matchup between helms a threeterm gop 
incumbent and gantt is a favorite target drawing money from 
labor conservative and gayrights groups as well as both sides of 
the abortion debate 
the national abortion rights action league for example has 
spent 200000 on radio television and other ads attacking helms 
antiabortion stance according to federal election commission 
records 
other major races targeted by naral for large independent 
spending include the iowa senate race between democratic sen tom 
harkin and republican rep tom tauke the florida governors race 
and house contests in oregon and florida 
naral and its iowa affiliate reported spending more than 93000 
in september and october to support harkin and 3000 to oppose 
tauke 
its federal filings show nearly 80000 has been spent to oppose 
the reelection of florida gov bob martinez a staunch abortion 
foe most of narals spending on that state race does not have to 
be reported to the fec 
narals spending in the past two weeks also has included 25000 
and 1800 to oppose the reelection of republican reps denny 
smith of oregon and craig james of florida respectively 
not surprisingly antiabortion groups also are involved in many 
of the same contests 
the national right to life pac has paid for mailings to support 
eight candidates including helms smith and james several right 
to life state pacs also mounted modest independent spending 
campaigns in recent weeks 
a handful of conservative groups have spent a combined 100000 
on independent expenditures in the past four months they were led 
by the conservative republican committee which reported 77500 in 
independent spending 28000 of that supporting helms 
much of the spending by the conservative groups has been for 
telephone banks mailings and radio ads opposing liberal democratic 
senators 
the national education associations pac reported spending 
100000 to support gantt a gayrights group and a pac 
representing social workers reported far more modest efforts on 
gantts behalf and a north carolina pac formed to oppose helms 
reported spending 15000 on radio ads attacking the conservative 
republican 
the biggest spender so far is the realtors pac which as of last 
week reported making 802500 in independent expenditures on a 
dozen races 
the realtors spent 168000 and 108000 to support the senate 
bids of republican reps hank brown of colorado and larry craig of 
idaho respectively 
the realtors also spent heavily to support freshmen house 
members peter hoagland dneb 70000 ileana roslehtinen 
rfla 70000 and ben jones dga 93500 and it spent nearly 
73000 to support republican rep jack buechner of missouri who 
is seeking a third term 
the most controversial spending has been the more than 340000 
spent by the auto dealers amp drivers for free trade pac to support 
the senate candidacy of new hampshire republican rep bob smith 
the pac is running television ads supporting smith leading 
democratic challenger john durkin to protest that the organization 
is trying to buy his opponent 
i wont sell out to the japs durkin said last week in 
criticizing the pac whose members sell japanesemade cars durkin 
has made an issue of the spending smiths camp has criticized 
durkins use of the word japs 
the realtors also reported spending 54600 to support smith

in the first ruling of its kind in britain an 
industrial tribunal has found that a british policeman of indian 
origin suffered racial discrimination from fellow police officers 
constable surinder chima singh 33 had complained he was barred 
from joining the criminal investigation department of the 
nottinghamshire county police force in 1987 because of his race 
the tribunal is empowered to order the force to compensate singh 
and will hear more evidence before ruling on his claim for damages 
the tribunals chairman christopher tickle said during 
tuesdays hearing in the central british city of nottingham that 
singh had as he claimed been the butt of racist language 
tickle said that singhs race had caused him to be treated less 
favorably than other officers who applied to join the investigation 
department 
singh from nottingham was born in india but grew up in 
huddersfield west yorkshire he received a chemistry degree from 
lancaster university before joining the nottinghamshire force in 
1981 
earlier this year police launched a nationwide drive to recruit 
from racial minority groups mostly blacks from the west indies and 
people from the indian subcontinent 
ethnic minority groups comprise 39 percent of the economically 
active workingage population in britain and 10 percent in london 
police figures published at the beginning of this year showed 1 
percent of police officers in england and wales and about 15 
percent of police in londons metropolitan force are from racial 
minorities 
industrial tribunals operate britains main judicial system 
hearing disputes between employees and employers mainly cases 
where unfair dismissal is alleged they cannot force an employer to 
take back a fired worer or five the worker the job to which he 
claims hes entitled

voters in this city dubbed 
butterfly town usa decide next tuesday whether to float a 12 
million bond issue to protect a grove of pines and eucalyptus trees 
where monarchs and tourists gather 
developers and property rights groups oppose the measure which 
calls for 12 million in borrowing to buy and set aside a 27acre 
butterfly habitat 
butterfly fanciers insist that protecting the privately owned 
diveley grove is vital to saving the species in this part of the 
country 
if we dont preserve this grove 10 to 20 years from now the 
butterflies will be in trouble said ro vaccaro member of the 
friends of the monarch theyre running out of wintering sites 
and they need a very specific climate with the perfect humidity 
temperatures and trees 
i just cant image butterfly town usa without butterflies 
if the bond issue wins the required twothirds vote property 
taxes would rise 15 cents per 100 of assessed valuation about 
15 a year on a 100000 home 
butterflies have long held a special place in the lives of the 
16000 residents of this seaside town 105 miles south of san 
francisco 
on the second saturday of each october children dress up as 
butterflies and march through town spreading colorful wings to 
usher in the fall butterfly season 
the grove of monterey pine and eucalyptus trees is one of the 
few remaining wintering grounds in the western united states for 
the orange and black butterflies 
in the 1940s as many as 2 million monarchs flew south from 
canada to winter in pacific grove compared to tens of thousands 
now monarchs east of the rockies winter near the gulf of mexico 
where their habitat is also dwindling as trees are cut 
some residents including steven magyar say the bond issue 
tramples on property rights the city council put the measure on 
the ballot after wavering on whether to allow development of the 
land 
if somebody wants to develop their property they should be 
able to the butterflies will still hang around magyar said 
everybodys in favor of remaining the butterfly capital but 
butterflies arent the endall beall 
i hope the bond passes because i want to see the butterflies 
stay here said 81yearold edna milar diveley who owns the 
grove but theyre going to have to rehabilitate the grove there 
arent enough lower and middle branches on the trees to keep the 
butterflies happy 
mrs diveley retired and sold a motel adjacent to the property 
the butterfly grove inn some 25 years ago but in 1988 she decided 
to sell or develop the diveley grove 
the city council approved her plan to build housing units with a 
oneacre buffer zone for the tree grove but public outcry prompted 
city leaders to put on the ballot the issue of whether to buy and 
set aside the entire property

taxpayers in the northeast would be hit harder 
than any other region in the country under the deficitreduction 
package awaiting president bushs signature a nonprofit group 
says 
of the 10 states facing the highest tax increases five are in 
the northeast the tax foundation said tuesday 
these same five states connecticut new jersey new york 
massachusetts and new hampshire already pay among the highest 
federal taxes in the nation on a per capita basis and the 
increases come at a time when these states are limping through a 
recession 
theyre getting hit harder because the new budget package is 
more heavily weighed to highincome earners said paul merski 
the nonprofit tax foundations director of fiscal affairs about 
45 percent of the tax increases for the new package are for 
highincome earners 
many lawmakers from the northeast supported the 
deficitreduction package even though it hit their districts 
harder democrats in particular were anxious to position 
themselves in favor of higher taxes on the wealthy even if those 
wealthy were their own constituents 
rep barney frank dmass said tuesday there was no irony in 
the voting pattern 
if the state is wealthier than another state and you get hurt 
thats what you have to expect if you favor progressive taxation 
frank said if the state pays more as a result of being a 
higherincome state i dont regret that at all 
the high tax burdens of the five northeastern states reflect 
their populations which include the new york commuterexecutives 
of suburban new jersey and connecticut the park avenue elite the 
insurance industry executives of hartford conn highly skilled 
and highly paid defense workers in connecticut and hightech 
industry executives and workers in massachusetts and new hampshire 
connecticut residents on average will bear the largest burden 
in the nation and the largest dollar increase the tax increases 
will cost the average connecticut resident 174 for one year that 
compares to a national average of 133 
the massachusetts delegation voted 92 against the original 
budget summit agreement that was rejected by the house oct 5 that 
plan would have raised all federal taxes on massachusetts residents 
by an average 100 according to the tax foundation 
less than a month later the massachusetts delegation voted 101 
in favor of the deficit reduction plan approved by congress it 
raises taxes for massachusetts resident by an average 158 the 
fourth highest in the nation 
frank noted the original budget summit agreement included many 
items that would have hit poor and middleclass northeasterners in 
the wallet including a higher gasoline tax and a tax on home 
heating oil 
the new york state delegation voted 1816 against that budget 
agreement which would have cost each new yorker an extra 91 last 
weekend the delegation voted 2112 with one absent for the new 
budget package that will cost their constituents an average 145 in 
higher taxes 
new jersey would have the secondhighest per capita increase in 
the country under the new budget plan at 173 new hampshire 
which ranks sixth would absorb 149 in higher taxes per person 
a number of provisions in the budget and tax package passed by 
congress are intended to shift the burden to the rich the proposal 
increases taxes on luxury items such as furs jewelry and yachts 
hikes the tax on airline tickets and raises the wealthiest 
taxpayers from a 28 percent tax rate to a 31 percent rate 
the measure also limits the deductions that wealthy taxpayers 
can claim and increases their share of a special hospitalization 
tax

democratic chairman lawrence davis 
state republican officials said they were trying to ensure legal 
election returns 
davis said the gop is mailing postcards to registered democrats 
across the state saying if they havent lived in their precinct 
for at least the last 30 days they cant vote 
this is an outright lie davis said 
voters who have moved from the precinct in which they are 
registered may go to the board of elections before they vote or to

its not exactly neimanmarcus but a mailorder 
catalog from dallas will allow soldiers in saudi arabia to play 
santa claus 
with the army and air force exchange service catalog the 
200000 soldiers in the persian gulf can shop for loved ones back 
home without leaving their desert tents tens of thousands of 
copies of the christmas catalog are on their way to the middle 
east 
one of the things i think most of our american troops over 
there are accustomed to is the ability to go in and browse in nice 
stores and we want to give them that capability every day if 
their duties will allow that said maj gen jeffery b kahla 
who heads aafes 
our goal is customer satisfaction whether people are in the 
sands of saudi arabia or living in a beautiful house in dallas 
texas 
in addition to a mailorder service the 95yearold 
selfsupporting organization with headquarters in dallas runs 
cutrate stores on bases in the united states and around the world 
for members of the military and their dependents 
the stores are known in air force slang as bx for base 
exchange in the army its px for post exchange altogether 
aafes generates about 7 billion in annual sales and employs 82000 
mostly civilian employees 
the aafes set up field exchange stores within 15 days of the 
beginning of operation desert shield kahla said 
the 50 shops in saudi arabia offer soldiers candy sodas 
cigarettes lotion and batteries lots of batteries mostly for 
cameras and personal stereos also for sale shoppers also can buy 
socks underwear and plastic thongs popular for walking across the 
burning sand to the showers kahla said 
the only things missing are alcohol and adult magazines barred 
by the saudis kahla said 
exchange sales in saudi arabia have reached about 3 million a 
month he said 
some of the shops operated originally from the backs of trucks 
most are now in cramped tents with shelves of wooden slats and 
sand or wood floors few as yet have air conditioning or 
refrigerators 
and the inventory is limited to 350 items which means for 
example that the only cassette tapes for sale are those in the top 
10 
but its still a link to home 
it probably looks just like neimanmarcus to them kahla 
said referring to the luxurious dallasbased department store 
about 98000 copies of the christmas catalog have been sent to 
saudi arabia and an equal number are ready to be shipped the 
troops orders will be processed at aafes in dallas and filled from 
a warehouse or vendor 
the christmas catalog is available at military exchanges around 
the world but orders from those stationed in the persian gulf will 
get top priority 
we just dont want them to order something for their 
girlfriend or their mother and have it come back not in stock 
because they dont have another choice kahla said 
the catalog includes items found in most any stateside store 
model planes and tanks puzzles roller skates walkietalkies and 
wagons 
there is the bear forces of america 20inch teddy bears 
wearing the uniforms of the four service branches available in 
desert camouflage 
there are housewares jewelry clothing and a grandfather clock 
soldiers can even order a personal tanner although the idea may 
not have much appeal in the desert 
despite the saudi ban on nonmoslem religious symbols angel 
ornaments and creche figures are available in the catalog 
i know that the bx is important because ive been to war its 
very important to the morale of the troops kahla said it made 
me feel like i was a little bit back home 
in the gulf aafes also circulates hit movies operates vending 
machines manages pay phones and plans to open barber shops within 
about two weeks 
one walkup generic fastfood outlet has opened with plans 
for four or five more next may be a mobile popeyes fried chicken 
franchise

on sept 28 he wrote things get worse by the day 
the midwestern dentist is still stranded in kuwait a month 
later but his plea made it out it is among a trickle of letters 
that newly released hostages have smuggled past iraqi troops 
some are hastily scrawled on notepaper others are typed all 
offer stark urgent views of the persian gulf through the eyes of 
those trapped when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the letters talk of daily trivia and tell tales of atrocities 
they also carry the hostages provisional attempts at proper 
goodbyes postmarked in bangladesh or maryland or england 
wherever newly freed foreigners pass their first mail slot 
the situation here is entirely out of control wrote the 
dentist whose letters from kuwait were provided on the condition 
he not be identified 
i am in a safe house with a good friend we are surrounded 
by iraqi troops and there is a great deal of shooting in the 
area at night the letter continued 
the iraqis have destroyed all forms of normalcy here 
looting rape and sodomy and wanton destruction food stocks 
are almost gone and the garbage and rodent problems are increasing 
things here get worse by the day 
the estimated 1000 americans stuck in kuwait and iraq are from 
varied backgrounds they were in the middle east as teachers 
diplomats oil workers engineers and consultants 
but in their letters are common themes calls for quick and 
decisive american intervention complaints about boredom and 
fatigue for many hostages time is measured by what they may be 
missing at home 
darling the days and nights are long and boring fred f 
harrington a redmond wash businessman held as one of saddam 
husseins human shields wrote to his wife 
i do lots of reading american and british novels there is tv 
and vcr in the lounge breakfast is at 9 am lunch at 1 pm and 
dinner at 7 pm food is lousy my back hurts harrington 
wrote in a letter dated sept 4 
people here are terrified a 26yearold kuwaiti wrote to h 
norman angell a friend in bainbridge island wash one of my 
relatives was shot in front of his family after he was tortured for 
two months he was 23 years old 
two of my cousins were taken away and nobody knows where 
they are now wrote angells friend whose cousin escaped and 
mailed the letter after reaching germany 
tensions run high wrote mike nickman whose work on an 
irrigation project in iraq was interrupted by iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
they have security police sitting outside our door waiting 
for one of us to leave he wrote in a sept 4 letter smuggled out 
of the us embassy in baghdad by a british woman who forwarded it 
to nickmans parents in pleaston neb 
my patience is in short supply it is easy for my temper to 
rise up and of course in this situation thats not very wise 
wrote guy seago a 49yearold oil worker captured by iraqi troops 
while trying to escape kuwait 
in their letters many of the hostages mention their tempers 
they are tired of listening to the voice of america and waiting for 
the united states which has deployed 220000 soldiers to strike 
it has become a pretty tedious existence but preferable to 
being in baghdad or at some military installation wrote the 
dentist whose attorney provided copies of several letters those 
poor people will be killed when the shooting starts as the iraqis 
have nothing to lose 
for american hostages and their families the loss could be 
enormous 
you have given me great joy joseph murphy a 63yearold 
teacher wrote to his daughter in fremont calif from the us 
embassy in kuwait 
be smart and strong and brave my darling you have a great

in a major policy change the palestine 
liberation organization is urging arab countries to halt their 
8yearold effort to expel israel from the un general assembly 
the move is a gesture of moderation by an increasingly isolated 
plo which has lost some arab support for siding with iraq in the 
persian gulf crisis and saw its dialogue with washington cut off 
earlier this year over a plo factions attack on an israeli beach 
in a private meeting of arab ambassadors on tuesday palestinian 
and other arab diplomats said plo head envoy nasser alkidwa 
proposed that the arabs vote to accept israels credentials 
credentials of all nations must be approved each year allowing 
representation in the un general assembly 
however the arabs would propose an amendment to the official 
membership list that reminds israel of its obligation to obey 
security council and general assembly resolutions on the middle 
east 
security council resolutions have attacked israels declaration 
of a unified jerusalem as its capital and this month deplored 
the oct 8 temple mount killings in which police killed 20 
palestinians during a stonethrowing protest in jerusalem 
general assembly resolutions call for separate homelands for 
palestinians and jews and guarantee the right of palestinian 
exiles to go home to the new palestine 
israels un mission was informed of the proposal but had no 
immediate formal response 
the arab ambassadors were unable to agree immediately on the plo 
proposal one problem for them seemed to be whether voting for 
israels un membership even with those amendments would 
constitute recognition of israel 
i think they are very concerned about the implications 
themselves said one western ambassador who is an expert on the 
middle east 
the chairman of the arab group kuwaiti ambassador mohammad 
abulhasan said he would likely ask the general assembly president 
to delay consideration of the membership issue rather than take it 
up thursday as scheduled 
israel has been un member since the jewish state was founded 
in 1948 
since 1982 the arabs have challenged israels right to sit in 
the general assembly claiming it is not a peaceloving state as 
required by the un charter 
the arabs have lost every year and last year the soviet union 
abstained on the issue rather than voting with them this year the 
soviets are expected to vote in favor of israel 
alkidwa characterized the plos move as a more positive 
approach the israelpalestinian issue 
this is the first major new diplomatic move by alkidwa a 
nephew of plo chairman yasser arafat veteran plo ambassador zuhdi 
labib terzi retired from his 16year posting as head of the 
delegation last month to become an adviser to arafat the plo has 
observer status at the united nations 
observers believe that hardline arab states such as syria 
libya and iraq will not support alkidwas proposal if it is viewed 
as amounting to some form of recognition of israel 
in 1948 the newly founded israeli government was willing to 
accept the general assembly resolutions setting up two states but 
the arab nations rejected the twostate idea and attacked israel 
the day after it declared itself a nation 
israel captured about half the land that was supposed to become 
an arab palestinian state and the other half was divided between 
jordan and egypt 
the israeli government has claimed since then that it needs to 
retain some of the occupied territory as a buffer against arab 
attacks 
in 1988 arafat became the first arab leader to endorse the 
twostate concept originally devised by the united nations 
the plo lost significant financial and political support from 
some arab countries after arafat sided with saddam hussein on the 
iraqi leaders aug 2 seizure of kuwait arafat has since been 
trying to play a mediating role 
saddam has said he wants to link any solution to the crisis with 
an israeli pullout from occupied territories and has won the 
support of many of the palestinians living in those lands 
washington broke off dialogue with the plo in june after arafat 
refused to condemn a may 30 raid on a tel aviv beach by guerrillas 
of the palestine liberation front led by abu abbas 
there were no israeli casualties in the attack

japans outcast community has attacked an author 
who committed a faux pas in this nation where prejudice goes deep 
but largely undiscussed he wrote about their plight 
trouble started for dutch author karel van wolferen when he 
wrote that japans burakumin community has used confrontational 
tactics to scare editors publishers and tv producers into silence 
about its problems 
as a result the problems cant be addressed the author says 
van wolferen saw his book the enigma of japanese power 
fall victim to the same treatment when the burakumin liberation 
league pressured his tokyo publisher into temporarily halting 
sales 
burakumin meaning hamlet people is a euphemism for a 
former social class considered unclean in feudal japan because they 
dealt with death for centuries they were japans butchers 
gravediggers and tanners 
though physically indistinguishable from other japanese their 
more than 1 million descendants today live in separate communities 
and the government keeps meticulous records on family histories 
they have trouble marrying into the mainstream and getting decent 
jobs 
even mentioning their existence is taboo for most japanese 
indeed it was only in august 1989 that a japanese television 
producer dared for the first time to broadcast a program on 
burakumin prejudice 
on tuesday van wolferen challenged a burakumin leader in a 
debate to drop rough tactics that ironically he says have helped 
perpetuate their lowly status and selfcensor the problem of 
prejudice in japan 
van wolferen and his publisher wont say what pressuring tactics 
were used to halt japanese sales of his book which has been sold 
in the united states since last year 
but the burakumin group is known for cornering offending 
writers teachers or scholars whose opinions they object to and 
verbally harassing them 
many japanese scholars wont touch the subject of burakumin 
in part because theyre afraid of the liberation league coming and 
trashing their office said columbia university anthropologist 
theodore bestor who is doing research in japan 
van wolferen suggested that such enforced silence about social 
discrimination has led many japanese to remain ignorant of its 
impact that in turn gives rise to the kind of racial slur uttered 
recently by japans justice minister seiroku kajiyama who 
compared us blacks to prostitutes 
the average japanese has heard more about discrimination 
against blacks and other minorities in the united states than about 
japans minorities van wolferen said 
tatsukuni komori the leagues secretary general responded 
during the debate that his group welcomes all criticism 
we have never asked someone to rewrite or correct a passage 
that seems to be critical of the burakumin liberation league 
said komori who also represents his community in parliament but 
if factual inaccuracies are spread then we will probably have to 
resort to other measures 
komori said the league pressured van wolferens publisher 
hayakawa shobo into halting sales in early october and a planned 
advertising campaign for the books japanese version because it 
used discriminatory language to describe the community and made 
factual errors 
during the debate van wolferen said he had agreed to change 
special villages long used to refer to the burakumin to 
special communities but he said he stood by the books 
findings 
the book went back on store shelves in midoctober after van 
wolferen urged his publisher to overcome its fear and resume sales 
tuesdays debate was part of his effort to try to reach 
agreement with the burakumin on altering the next printing 
the controversy has underscored one of the major themes of van 
wolferens book which argues that political and social change in 
japan is stifled in part by the inability to discuss it 
the league has been trying to get united nations recognition 
as an oppressed minority he said after the debate held at the 
foreign correspondents club but un officials say they cant 
find enough written about the burakumin in japan to make a 
decision 
val wolferen said he thought the liberation league is at 
juncture where it may well begin to study its methods 
other analysts say that unwillingness to discuss prejudice 
extends to japans other huge minority those of korean descent 
and other groups 
japanese accustomed to hearing their society described as 
homogenous are fundamentally not even aware of prejudice because 
they dont see these minorities as being internal to japanese 
society said bestor 
when protests arose several years ago over a government law that 
requires fingerprinting of japans korean minority bestor said he 
remembers being shocked at the reaction of a japanese friend he 
considered fairly well informed 
he didnt know until i told him that the people being 
fingerprinted were born in japan and in some cases were third and 
fourth generation he couldnt understand why they were disobeying 
the rules of their host country

the jury that convicted ramon 
salcido of murdering his wife two daughters boss and three others 
returns next week to decide whether the former winery worker should 
die in the gas chamber 
salcido 29 was found guilty tuesday in an april 14 1989 
rampage in which he crisscrossed the sonoma valley in california 
wine country stabbing and shooting his victims he slit his 
daughrers throats and left them to die at a dump 
the sentencing stage begins tuesday the jury which reached its 
verdict on its fourth day of deliberations can recommend death or 
life in prison without parole 
what this means for the families is perhaps one chapter of 
this horrible nightmare will be laid to rest prosecutor peter 
bumerts said after the verdict 
we knew he was going to die in prison one way or another 
said defense attorney marteen miller 
although salcido confessed in a taped statement that was the 
prosecutions key evidence his lawyers tried to save his life by 
portraying him as suicidal and mentally ill they argued he 
suffered from a psychotic depression that was aggravated by an 
alcohol and cocaine binge in the hours before the rampage 
the prosecution scoffed at the notion salcido was suicidal 
saying the killer demonstrated his methodical ways when he stepped 
over dead bodies to bandage his finger which he cut while stabbing 
a victim to death 
he was convicted of six counts of firstdegree murder one of 
seconddegree murder and other offenses 
a firstdegree murder conviction requires proof of 
premeditation defense attorneys had urged jurors to opt for 
seconddegree murder or manslaughter 
according to testimony salcido began his murderous frenzy after 
a night of barhopping and cocainesnorting when he arrived home 
around 5 am he was furious that his wife was gone 
he grabbed the couples three young girls and drove to the 
county dump where he slashed each childs throat and left them to 
die one of them carmina then 2 survived telling investigators 
daddy cut me 
salcidos next stopped at his motherinlaws home fatally 
stabbing marian richards and two of her daughters 
when he returned home salcido fatally shot his wife angela 
and headed for the grand cru winery where he killed his boss 
tracey toovey 
salcido also went to the home of his coworker ken butti and 
shot butti and tried to shoot his wife terri before fleeing 
butti recovered from the wound 
salcido was arrested four days later in his native mexico he 
told investigators he was mad that his wife had hidden that their 
first child was fathered by another man 
the trial was moved to san mateo county because of publicity in 
sonoma county

billed personal expenses to a state credit card because its hard 
for him to separate his personal life from his business affairs 
i live eat sleep and breathe politics steve clark 
testified tuesday at his theft trial that is the truth its not 
necessarily good but its the truth 
holding back tears at times during 2 hours on the stand clark 
43 said he made mistakes on his expense records but didnt intend 
to steal from the state 
clark is accused of entertaining friends girlfriends family 
and political supporters on a stateissued credit card running up 
a tab of at least 844827 for the meals of personal guests on 56 
occasions from 1986 to 1989 
he could get up to 20 years in prison and a 15000 fine if

the charges forced clark to drop out of the race for the 
democratic nomination for governor 
the prosecution contends clark used the card to support a 
standard of living he couldnt afford on his 26500 annual salary 
among the lowest in the nation for a state attorney general

he wished without keeping records but circuit judge perry 
whitmore disagreed denying a defense motion tuesday to dismiss the 
case

three months late accidentally recording as guests people who 
didnt eat with him

didnt dine with clark or discuss state business when he said they 
had 
i never in my entire life meant to mislead or deceive or

an amphibious assault training exercise is 
under way in the persian gulf that a pentagon source says will 
involve landing more than 10000 marines on a beach in oman 
the exercise which started tuesday and is to last 10 days is 
the second major marine practice of amphibious assault techniques 
that could be used in the event president bush ordered an offensive 
against iraqi forces in kuwait 
the first was conducted on an omani beach in september 
bob hall a pentagon spokesman said the exercise involves 
elements of the 4th marine expeditionary brigade and amphibious 
task group 2 which have been in the gulf as part of operation 
desert shield to defend saudi arabia against possible iraqi attack 
hall called the maneuver a routine amphibious training 
exercise designed to refamiliarize these forces with a desert 
environment he declined to specify the number of marines and 
ships involved 
a pentagon source speaking on condition he not be identified 
said 18 ships including marine corps amphibious vessels and navy 
warships will participate in the exercise which he said also will 
involve forces from allied gulf nations 
hall said 20 airplanes and 75 helicopters will be used in 
staging the beach assault 
the amphibious assault ship uss iwo jima was en route to the 
exercise area tuesday when a boiler pipe ruptured killing eight 
sailors and critically injuring two others 
hall said it had not been decided whether the 1100 marines 
aboard the iwo jima would participate in the beach assault exercise 
as planned after the ship is repaired

a lawyers group and medical experts are 
urging the government to strengthen safeguards for people with 
asthma who use an effective but potentially dangerous drug 
they said tuesday that overthecounter asthma medications 
containing the drug theophylline should be banned 
and they want physicians and patients to be made more aware of 
potential hazards also associated with prescription versions of the 
drug 
our message about theophylline is that this medication can be 
a lifesaver or a lifetaker said michael maher president of the 
trial lawyers of america 
scheringplough the leading manufacturer of prescription 
theophylline products called the lawyers action a selfserving 
publicity campaign that will unduly alarm asthma patients and 
interfere with doctorpatient relationships by overstating ad 
overdramatizing the known risks of theophylline 
company officials said their theophylline products have had a 
good safety record with more than 60 million prescriptions written 
in the past five years adverse reactions amounted to 13 per 
100000 prescriptions said david pernock a company marketing 
executive 
he noted that scheringplough does not make any nonprescription 
theophylline products because it agrees that it is a drug that 
should be monitored 
the food and drug administration banned overthecounter sales 
of theophylline as a singleingredient product in 1986 two years 
ago the agency proposed a ban on other nonprescription uses of the 
drug 
the lawyers group last week sent a letter to the food and drug 
administration saying it knew of 26 preventable 
theophyllinerelated incidents of death or serious injury since 
1975 
about 10 million americans most of them children suffer from 
asthma which causes about 5000 deaths a year 
though not a cure theophylline a chemical cousin of caffeine 
is the most widely prescribed remedy to ease breathing and has been 
on the market for more than 40 years

the federal judge who sentenced mayor marion 
barry to six months in jail on a misdemeanor cocaine possession 
conviction says he believes four jurors were determined to acquit 
barry and misled the court during jury selection 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson also told a harvard 
law school forum on tuesday that he had never seen a stronger 
government case against a defendant 
he remarks in cambridge mass were reported by the washington 
post 
meanwhile former district of columbia police chief maurice 
turner said tuesday that barry was the target of undercover drug 
operations other than the one that led to his trial and conviction 
there were several aggressive grand juries that were seated 
and there were stings that didnt materialize turner now a 
republican mayoral candidate said during a campaign forum on 
wjlatv 
turner declined to provide details on the sting operations 
against barry which he first mentioned in response to a question 
about whether he would have approved such a tactic against his 
thenboss 
the stings were field operations and i dont want to go into 
it turner said i do approve of sting operations though 
turner who served 32 years on the police force with the last 
eight as chief added that he would not have sacrificed my career 
for someone using drugs 
the former chief declined to say whether the operations were 
coordinated with federal officials or whether his department was 
acting alone 
jackson told the law students at harvard that he thought the 
evidence against barry was overwhelming on 10 of 14 counts 
even though the mayor was convicted on only one count 
he said four jurors obviously did not tell the truth when 
they said during jury selection that they would approach the case 
without bias 
it is unusual but not necessarily improper for judges to 
comment about cases that are no longer pending before them legal 
experts said tuesday 
if barrys conviction is overturned on appeal jackson would 
have to withdraw from any retrial because of his opinion about 
barrys guilt the experts said but his comments apparently do not 
supply barry with ammunition in his expected appeal of his 
conviction they said 
i am not happy with the way the jury addressed the case 
jackson said at the forum some people on the jury had their 
own agendas they would not convict under any circumstances

chinas onechild policy hasnt worked as well as 
hoped officials said today as they released census figures showing 
china has 1133 billion people 20 million more than anticipated 
the discovery the result of a doortodoor headcount in july 
that was the biggest ever conducted in the world is the equivalent 
of finding that the entire population of australia had been 
overlooked among chinas masses 
our planners overestimated their capacity to control the 
population zhang sai director general of the state statistics 
bureau told a news conference 
if we look at the absolute figure of 20 million it is equal 
to the total population of a province he said trying to explain 
why these people had been missed before but if we take into 
account the large size of the population it amounts to only 18 
percent so it is not that big 
the figure of 1133 billion also could be under by several 
million however because a random recount in sample areas showed 
those areas were undercounted by 06 percent according to 
preliminary data released today 
china already has a strict family planning policy that sets the 
goal of one child per couple most cities enforce that strictly 
and couples that dare to have a second child face steep fines 
dismissal from work and explusion from the communist party 
but in many rural areas because of peasants desire for boys to 
work in the fields local authorities have allowed couples to have 
two children if the first is a girl in other areas officials have 
tolerated large families because they too want many children or 
have set fines that welloff peasants can easily pay 
many children born outside the official plan were not registered 
with authorities before the census 
zhang said he did not know of any proposal to stiffen penalties 
for extra births in light of the census results 
he and other census officials at the news conference expressed 
confidence that most unregistered babies nicknamed black 
babies because their existence is a dark secret have now been 
reported 
but even journalists for chinas staterun media expressed 
skepticism mindful of recent rumors that the census actually found 
the population to be 138 billion or higher 
arent your figures conservative one asked another 
reporter asked if it wasnt possible given the widespread 
corruption in chinese bureaucracy that some officials deliberately 
falsified results 
zhang denied both charges 
we followed statisticians ethics which says to seek truth 
from facts he said using a slogan made popular by senior 
leader deng xiaoping 
we believe the results of the census having undergone 
doublechecking basically reflect the actual situation he said 
minor mistakes in calculation could lead to an error of hundreds 
of millions we understand that even a minor mistake in our work 
would have a very serious impact on government policy 
zhang said the population is likely to continue growing by 15 
million to 17 million people annually through 1996 because of a 
peak in the number of women of childbearing age 
in other other results the census found 
men outnumber women 1066 to 100 reflecting the continued 
preference for boys over girls the government has acknowledged 
that killing of newborn girls continues in some rural areas and 
that in cities some women take tests to learn the sex of their 
fetuses and abort girls 
more than 26 percent of people at census time were living 
illegally outside the village or city where they were registered 
resulting in a floating population of more than 29 million 
people china tries to keep peasants from moving to cities and 
blames illegal migrants for the rising crime rate among other 
problems 
more than 180 million people or nearly 16 percent of the 
population were classed illiterate or semiliterate down from 
nearly 230 million at the last census in 1982

a satellite that will allow people 
aboard ships planes and trains to fax documents and place 
telephone calls orbited earth today after a smooth ride into space 
on a delta rocket 
the unmanned 125foot rocket roared into a cloudy moonlit sky 
on time at 616 pm tuesday 
the 80 million satellite separated from the booster as planned 
less than an hour later and settled into an elliptical orbit 22300 
miles high engines aboard the spacecraft were to give it a 
circular path over the next day or so 
the 1ton satellite is owned by the international maritime 
satellite organization or inmarsat 
the londonbased organization has more than 12000 computer 
terminals in use around the world most of them aboard ships each 
terminal is connected to an antenna that allows it to receive and 
send signals via satellite 
the satellite is the first of four to be placed in orbit by the 
end of 1991 to accommodate hundreds of thousands of inmarsat 
subscribers in the next decade said ahmad ghais inmarsat director 
of engineering and operations 
inmarsats first airborne terminal was installed in a united 
airlines jet a week ago ghais said more united terminals are 
expected to come on line soon 
anyone on the go should be able to use our satellites to 
communicate anywhere on earth ghais said 
inmarsat a cooperative of 62 countries currently depends on 
eight satellites owned by other organizations 
the new spacecraft built by british aerospace will have a 
working lifetime of 10 years 
the cost of the entire venture satellite launch and ground 
tracking equipment is estimated at 160 million 
tuesdays launch is believed to be the first time a us company 
has launched a satellite partly owned by the soviets said 
stephanie leemiller director of the transportation departments 
office of commercial space transportation 
the united states is the largest shareholder of inmarsat 
followed by britain and norway the soviet union is the 
sixthlargest shareholder 
it was the 200th launch by a delta more than any other us 
rocket the first delta was launched in 1960

burmas military rulers have arrested 
at least 45 opposition officials in a major crackdown on dissent 
that began with raids on buddhist monasteries last week sources in 
burma said today 
those held included members of the parliament elected in the may 
27 national elections that the government has refused to honor 
said the sources contacted by telephone in burmas capital 
rangoon 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said most were 
members of the national league for democracy which won the 
elections by a landslide 
one source said the numbers of detainees are changing all the 
time because people are being taken in for questioning and then 
released but we can say for certain that at least 45 have been 
arrested and kept inside 
the government has not announced any of the arrests 
sources in the national league for democracy said last week that 
12 of its officials including four members of the partys central 
executive committee were arrested on oct 23 two other committee 
members were arrested earlier so just four of the bodys 10 
members are free 
the partys two leaders aung san suu kyi and tin oo have been 
detained for more than a year 
the sources said most people were arrested in rangoon but 
others were being held in the countrys second largest city 
mandalay in the town of moulmein about 100 miles southeast of 
rangoon and in taungoo about 100 miles north of the capital 
several were members of the democratic party for new society a 
studentled group close to the national league for democracy they 
said 
the members of parliament who were detained included the 
representative of the co co islands in the andaman sea south of 
rangoon the islands are a military garrison almost entirely 
populated by military personnel they nevertheless elected a 
national league candidate 
the crackdown began oct 22 when troops raided monasteries in 
mandalay they moved after monks stopped ministering to soldiers 
after troops suppressed a demonstration reportedly killing two 
monks and two other people 
authorities extended the raids to offices of the national league 
for democracy and closed down some of the offices 
the political sources said up to 50 monks were detained in the 
raids but it was still unclear if the army had succeeded in 
forcing the monks to end their boycott 
there were reports that monks in at least one rangoon monastery 
were continuing it one source said 
the source said it would be difficult to break the boycott he 
said groups of monks as large as 500 had entered into compacts to 
go on with the boycott and these could be undone only if all those 
who took the vow were reassembled 
in many monasteries abbots had sent monks home before troops 
moved in he said it looks as if the military action has been 
largely cosmetic 
official radio rangoon on tuesday quoted mandalay commander 
maj gen tun kyi as saying registration cards should be issued to 
all monks as soon as possible 
the military government of gen saw maung seized power in 1988 
by crushing a nationwide uprising for democracy that sought to end 
more than a quarter century of repressive authoritarian rule

a 16yearold us justice department lawsuit 
accusing louisiana of operating segregated colleges has been thrown 
out by a federal judge 
us district judge charles schwartz on tuesday cited a federal 
appeals court ruling last month in a similar case from mississippi 
he said he disagreed with that ruling but that it was binding in 
the louisiana case 
justice department spokeswoman amy casner said tuesday said 
officials had not decided whether to appeal 
the department was the remaining party in the 1974 case 
black leaders lost enthusiasm for the lawsuit when a threejudge 
panel endorsed a plan that would have abolished predominantly black 
southern universitys board of supervisors as part of a remedy for 
alleged segregation 
the louisiana highereducation system consists of 17 colleges 
and universities and 138000 students 
schwartzs ruling cited a decision in september by the 5th us 
circuit court of appeal that said mississippis similar college 
system is not intentionally segregated and has an open admissions 
policy 
louisiana also has long had an open admissions policy but 
southern and grambling state universities remain almost all black 
blacks are a minority at louisiana state university and seven other 
major colleges 
southern dropped its support of the lawsuit last year grambling 
took no position on the case although grambling alumni agreed with 
southern that higher education was no longer segregated

a diplomat in the thai capital said 
today that vietnam is willing to allow the united states to base in 
hanoi an official who would seek information on americans missing 
from the vietnam war 
there was no immediate official confirmation from hanoi on what 
would be the first american post in the vietnamese capital since 
the northernbased communists defeated the usbacked south 
vietnamese government in april 1975 
hanoi eager to expand trade ties and end its political 
isolation is seeking to normalize relations with washington 
the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said the idea 
of stationing an official in hanoi was discussed at an oct 17 
meeting in washington 
the diplomat said john w vessey a special us presidential 
envoy on vietnamese humanitarian issues and vietnamese foreign 
minister nguyen co thach attended the meeting 
the diplomat quoted thach as saying tuesday in bangkok that 
vietnam accepted the idea thach spoke at the end of a threeday 
visit to thailand 
two us embassy officials also speaking anonymously said 
today that they knew of no firm agreement and it did not appear an 
official would be sent to hanoi anytime soon 
in washington on tuesday state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said the united states hoping to expand joint activities 
on the issue of missing soldiers previously had broached the idea 
of an office in vietnam but the vietnamese declined 
in the recent thachvessey meeting she said both sides agreed 
that the united states soon would send a technical team to hanoi 
and form a joint team of military experts to improve the search for 
information 
she added there was also discussion that should these efforts 
produce results that would justify the ongoing presence of a 
technical powmia prisoner of war missing in action team in 
hanoi we would seriously consider sending such a team at first on 
a temporary basis 
the vietnamese previously said that if the united states were to 
open an mia office in hanoi vietnam should be allowed to open a 
representation in washington it was not clear if this remained 
their position 
some us officials are stationed in vietnams ho chi minh city 
formerly saigon to process people seeking to emigrate to the 
united states under the orderly departure program 
about 2300 americans are reported missing in action from the 
vietnam war about 1700 of them on vietnamese soil from sept 
1525 american army forensic experts examined remains in ho chi 
minh city that the vietnamese said they found results of that 
examination were not available 
vietnam badly needs ties with the united states to end its 
diplomatic isolation and bring in funds for the impoverished 
economy 
the climate for relations between the two countries has improved 
since vietnam in september 1989 staged a major troop pullout from 
cambodias civil war and began efforts to seek a political solution 
to the conflict

former un ambassador jeane kirkpatrick says the 
united states has more options against iraq than just economic 
embargo or an allout ground war 
selective air strikes for example 
american air attacks against iraqi military targets are a very 
good option ms kirkpatrick told the 56th annual convention of 
the associated press managing editors on tuesday the first day of 
the fourday meeting 
i can imagine action that would combine american aerial 
strikes and arab ground operations for example said ms 
kirkpatrick professor of political science at georgetown 
university i think these are at least alternatives that are more 
likely than us participation in some sort of large ground war 
saddam hussein said tuesday that iraq was making final 
preparations for war and expected an attack within days by the 
united states and its allies 
ms kirkpatrick said it would be dangerous to let saddam keep 
parts of kuwait 
saddam would see partial withdrawal as a victory and become more 
desirous of occupying neighboring countries particularly saudi 
arabia and the united arab emirates she said 
saddam hussein is an aggressive man who already has used force 
and the threat of force against every one of his neighbors ms 
kirkpatrick said if he had rewards from this aggression i 
have no doubt that he would move on 
former san antonio mayor henry cisneros who also addressed the 
convention said intense scrutiny of political candidates will 
continue and overall is beneficial so long as the media practices 
fairness to the max 
i suspect what were in for is a future where this kind of 
scrutiny becomes the order of the day cisneros said 
he said openness carries a price 
there will be no heroes because there are no perfect 
people he said and were going to scare some people off 
cisneros who decided against a third term in 1989 denied that 
the revelation of an extramarital affair ran him out of office he 
said he decided to leave because of financial pressures worsened by 
his sons ill health

the government today charged the 
nations most prominent labor leader with inciting sedition in 
connection with unrest during last weeks crippling nationwide 
strike 
crispin beltran leader of the leftist may first movement was 
also charged with illegal assembly the charges stem from beltrans 
behavior at a rally in front of the senate when the fourday 
walkout began on oct 24 
about two dozen vehicles were destroyed in strikerelated 
violence 
nick elman the movements spokesman said the labor group will 
not be cowed by the arrest he said the movement was finalizing 
plans for another general strike but did not say when it will be 
called or what the demands were 
the trade union congress of the philippines the countrys 
biggest labor federation which did not join the strike deplored 
the arrest and urged the government to release beltran 
beltran 57 denied government charges that he called on people 
to overthrow president corazon aquino and he said he will clear his 
organization of alleged links to the communist underground 
i welcome this opportunity in order first of all to vindicate 
myself and the leadership of the movement and assert our legality 
and legitimacy beltran said we had nothing to do with the 
violence and we have no linkages with the underground movement 
he said there were unseen hands behind the scenes 
responsible for an evident crackdown against strike leaders and the 
death of a strike leader on monday 
beltran also asked authorities to take it easy on their 
charges and malicious imputations against us 
the labor leader whose movement claims 750000 members would 
face a maximum sixyear sentence if convicted of sedition 
defense secretary fidel ramos said beltran also had been charged 
in a court in toledo city in the central philippines where 10000 
workers walked out of the atlas consolidated mining corp asias 
largest copper producer during the strike he did not specify the 
charge 
militants believed to include communist rebels burned 23 
buses passenger jeeps and other vehicles during the labor unrest 
such attacks had not taken place during previous strikes 
on the day before the walkout unknown assailants killed the 
leader of a transport federation oscar lazaro who had refused to 
join the strike 
beltran was arrested late tuesday after he and manila police 
chief col ernesto diokno appeared on television to discuss the 
strike 
during the program diokno said police had been looking for 
beltran since the strike because he allegedly had made seditious 
statements beltran had been in hiding until appearing on the 
program 
beltran was later led to a police car and driven to the western 
police district headquarters 
last weeks strike was the most extensive since president aquino 
took office in february 1986 in the people power revolution 
that toppled the late president ferdinand marcos 
the strike called to demand a 42 percent increase in the 356 
daily minimum wage paralyzed public transport in manila and other 
cities 
it ended saturday without a settlement the government rejected 
the demanded pay increase but granted an increase of 68 cents or 
19 percent for manila area workers inflation is running at 121 
percent annually nationwide 167 percent in the capital 
beltrans arrest was expected to increase tension between the 
aquino government and organized labor the government has said the 
strike was communistrun although the may first movement denies 
the claim

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze will meet 
secretary of state james a baker iii next week in geneva to 
discuss the persian gulf crisis and disarmament the independent 
news agency interfax reported today 
it said they would meet on nov 89 soviet television said the 
meeting would occur nov 9 but that its location was undetermined 
the meeting will mark another chapter in the historic 
cooperation between the superpowers that began when baker met 
shevardnadze in the siberian city of irkutsk during that session 
the ministers learned iraqi president saddam hussein had invaded 
kuwait 
the two directed officials to prepare a joint statement 
condemning the invasion and demanding a withdrawal it was the 
first time since world war ii the superpowers agreed on a common 
position in a major regional conflict 
both countries have been sending diplomats around the world to 
try to defuse the crisis 
president mikhail s gorbachevs envoy yevgeny primakov has 
been touring the middle east to try to find a peaceful solution to 
the conflict 
baker meanwhile leaves the united states this weekend for 
saudi arabia other middle eastern countries and europe to discuss 
the crisis 
interfax quoting foreign ministry sources said that in 
addition to discussing the crisis shevardnadze and baker will talk 
about cuts in strategic nuclear weapons and conventional arms 
the soviet union has repeatedly ruled out the use of military 
force to drive saddams troops out of kuwait while the united 
states has built up its forces in the persian gulf region to 
220000 troops 
president bush has warned the united states would not hesitate 
to use force if provoked and defense secretary dick cheney said 
last week that 100000 more troops may be deployed in the region 
many countries have hostages in kuwait and iraq including those 
used as human shields at potential military targets and gorbachev 
has warned they may be endangered by any use of force by saddams 
opponents

a ban on the use of wood stoves and fireplaces 
will go into effect in denver on days when the air looks cruddy 
not just when the carbon monoxide gauges say it is 
the new regulations go into effect thursday the restrictions on 
burning wood are not new denver has had them for years its the 
criteria for determining when to impose the restrictions that are 
being changed 
previously the restrictions went into effect when carbon 
monoxide exceeded federal levels but officials got tired of 
getting complaints they were not doing enough to eliminate the 
pollution that hangs over the city during winter 
we had a credibility problem john leary deputy director of 
the air pollution control division of the state health department 
said tuesday wed say there was no high pollution day and 
people would look out and it looked terrible 
it conducted a survey asking 200 people chosen at random to 
look at slides and decide which showed dirty air 
we urged people to consider that they live in an urban area 
and not to expect the pristine air not what they would find in a 
national park there was remarkable agreement and at that point a 
standard was set leary said 
they agreed that the air is polluted even when 936 percent of a 
beam of light gets through a kilometer of air far tougher than 
federal standards 
a pollution alert triggers a woodburning ban that should idle 
most woodburning stoves and fireplaces smoke from wood fires 
plays a significant role in denver visibility which gets dirty 
brown air in the winter 
violators of a pollution alert can be fined 25 or more for 
repeat offenses

rival shiite moslem factions agreed today 
to end their bloody 3year power struggle which has claimed the 
lives of more than 1100 people 
also today the government of president elias hrawi announced 
that the four principal moslem and christian militias who fought a 
15yearold civil war that left 150000 dead have agreed to move 
out of beirut 
efforts to end factional fighting accelerated after syria with 
an estimated 40000 troops in lebanon helped the government crush 
christian gen michel aouns 11monthold mutiny on oct 13 
the two shiite militias the proiranian hezbollah or party of 
god and syrianbacked amal issued a joint communique today 
saying a comprehensive ceasefire in their confrontation began 
at midnight tuesday 
the communique said representatives of the two factions would 
work out a plan for the exchange of prisoners pending the 
achievement of a comprehensive and final settlement to the 
conflict under the auspices of syria and iran 
hezbollah is the umbrella group for kidnappers believed holding 
13 western hostages including six americans 
shiite sources have said hezbollah moved the hostages out of the 
south beirut slums before the crackdown on aoun anticipating they 
would lose their strongholds in the capital as the government 
implemented its peace plan 
the reports could not be independently confirmed 
the ceasefire the latest in a series of agreements aimed at 
containing the intershiite bloobath climaxed a series of meetings 
of senior commanders from both sides brig gen ghazi kenaan 
commander of the syrian armys military intelligence in lebanon 
chaired the talks 
the meetings at kenaans office in the east lebanons town of 
anjar were also attended by irans ambassador to syria mohammad 
akhtari 
police said no truce violations were reported in beirut south 
or east lebanon where both sides have bases 
the particularly tense iqlim altuffah or apple province which 
had witnessed some of the bloodiest rounds of the hezbollahamal 
war was quiet 
but a police spokesman who spoke anonymously in line with 
regulations said fighters of both factions maintained positions 
facing each other in the disputed mountain terrain above the 
southern port city of sidon 
hezbollah and amal vying for mastery of the 12 million shiites 
in lebanon have fought intermittently since june 1987 by police 
count 1100 people have been killed and 3222 wounded in the 
struggle 
both amal and hezbollah have been among the four militias to 
agree to the militiafree greater beirut plan the other two are 
the rightwing christian lebanese forces and the druse progressive 
socialist party 
we break the good news to the lebanese citizens who are 
longing for peace the lebanese forces militia reacted positively 
to the government plan for the creation of the greater beirut 
agriculture minister mohsen dalloul announced after a fivehour 
meeting with samir geagea the militias leader 
the session also was attended by defense minister albert 
mansour 
hrawi had assigned dalloul a shiite and mansour a greek 
catholic to discuss the greater beirut plan with militia leaders 
and work out details of the withdrawals 
all the militias have agreed to withdraw from greater 
beirut dalloul told reporters no deadline has been set for the 
pullout 
the proposed greater beirut extends along a 15mile stretch from 
the dog river in the north to the damour river in the south and 
covers the citys eastern and southeastern suburbs 
the government peace plan also aims to give equal political 
power to christians and moslems effectively shifting power to the 
moslem majority 
until recently christians had maintained political dominance 
despite their declining demographic strength

eileen stevens estimates 50 college students 
have died from fraternity hazing since her son was a victim in 
1978 
you send a young man off to college you expect him to come 
home not to be put through torturous or humiliating 
circumstances said ms stevens founder of the committee to halt 
useless college killings 
the groups acronym chuck serves as a reminder of her son 
chuck stenzel 
a pledge at a fraternity at alfred university in new york 
stenzel died of an alcohol overdose during an initiation according 
to a coroners report ms stevens of sayville ny settled a 
64 million lawsuit out of court and began her campaign to abolish 
hazing 
she travels frequently visiting campuses or speaking at 
seminars such as the annual fraternal law conference in cincinnati 
about 100 people mostly lawyers who represent fraternities in 
lawsuits are expected at the conference here friday and saturday 
national and student fraternity leaders and university officials 
also are invited 
they will look at hazing alcohol abuse date rape racial 
discrimination and other problems facing fraternities 
cases persist in which fraternity members require prospective 
members to perform degrading acts before granting them membership 
but fewer incidents have been reported in recent years as national 
fraternities banned hazing colleges cracked down and more states 
passed antihazing laws ms stevens said 
statistically there appear to be a couple of fatalities a 
year but i dont believe thats accurate said ms stevens who 
monitors news reports for hazing incidents many deaths are 
listed as accidents others go unreported and the victims are 
rarely autopsied 
her estimate of 50 hazing deaths since 1978 is accepted by the 
indianapolisbased national interfraternity conference the 
sanctioning body for 59 national fraternities their 5275 chapters 
and 400000 members on 810 campuses in the united states and 
canada 
last october morehouse college in atlanta suspended a chapter 
following the death of a pledge who allegedly was shoved when he 
failed to answer correctly questions posed by fraternity members 
in 1986 a fraternity at gustavus adolphus college in st peter 
minn was disbanded after members used silver nitrate to burn the 
fraternity insignia on the backs of pledges 
hazing isnt limited to fraternities ms stevens said 
certainly it goes on in the military in sports even school 
bands she said 
after an incident last december in which a woman student was 
handcuffed to a urinal the us naval academy revised its rules 
for disciplining any midshipman found guilty of physical abuse of 
freshmen even if the act falls short of what is considered hazing 
thirty states have antihazing laws according to fraternal law 
a newsletter distributed by manley burke amp fisher the cincinnati 
law firm that organizes the fraternal law conference 
a certain amount of indoctrination is considered important to 
cohesiveness in college fraternities as in military academies but 
the conference says national fraternities have tried to eliminate 
the oldfashioned meanspirited tasks and the sort of forced 
heavy drinking that resulted in chuck stenzels death 
ms stevens agrees citing steps by fraternities to offer 
alternatives such as public service projects to take the place of 
hell week initiations 
every college campus i visit and ive been to a dozen this 
semester already i think there is a change things like 
alcohol awareness weeks and dry rushes where fraternities 
entertain prospective members without alcohol being present she 
said

hindus and moslems fought with knives and 
guns in scattered violence today leaving at least seven more 
people dead and more troops were sent to guard a disputed holy 
site in this northeastern city 
the dispute over the site has pushed the government to the brink 
of collapse and violence stemming from it has left at least 158 
people dead in the past week on tuesday night the violence spread 
to neighboring bangladesh 
troops killed five people and wounded at least 20 in ayodhya on 
tuesday when thousands of hindu militants broke through police 
barricades and forced their way to a 460yearold mosque they want 
to replace with a hindu temple 
hindu fundamentalists had vowed to start construction tuesday on 
a temple to the hindu god rama on the site which they revere as 
the gods birthplace 
the fundamentalists say the mosque should be razed to make way 
for a hindu temple in this holy town 300 miles southeast of new 
delhi hindus make up 82 percent of indias population moslems 
comprise 12 percent 
at least 45 people died in street battles tuesday and today in 
six states mostly in cities with large moslem minorities as the 
decadesold hindumoslem dispute over the ownership of the site 
came to a head 
one hindu man committed suicide tuesday in protest 
todays deaths from stabbings and shootings occurred in what 
indian news agencies described as mob violence in four widely 
separated cities in western and southern india indian news reports 
do not identify victims or give many details in the belief that 
doing so would aggravate tensions 
in bangladesh gangs of moslems armed with knives or clubs 
attacked at least 11 hindu temples and smashed idols in the 
southern port of chittagong tuesday night to protest the ayodhya 
episode hundreds of hindu homes and shops were burned but no 
injuries were reported 
police imposed a curfew on the city at dawn today no injuries 
or arrests were reported 
the ayodhya dispute has has brought prime minister vp singhs 
government to the verge of collapse 
authorities deployed additional troops around the disputed 
shrine today and blocked the bridge across the sacred saryu river 
where 6000 hindus had gathered 
the devotees sat in the fields opposite the town and sang hymns 
and the anger of the previous day seemed to have eased 
tuesdays widespread violence prompted singh to renew an offer 
to resign singhs 11monthold coalition lost its majority in 
parliament last week when an allied rightwing hindu party withdrew 
support over the temple issue 
singh has been under mounting pressure from dissidents in his 
party to quit he faces a parliamentary vote of noconfidence on 
nov 7 and his letter offering to step down seemed to presuppose 
that the government will lose 
all energies should be directed to diffuse the situation and 
maintain communal harmony it is in the pursuit of these goals that 
we have sacrificed a whole government he wrote to the president 
of his janata dal party 
my conscience is clear that i have sacrificed the highest 
office for the cause of unity of the country and the oppressed 
he wrote 
the letter was dismissed by the janata dal dissidents as an 
attempt by singh to rally his supporters the party is to meet 
early next week to decide the leadership question 
most political analysts predict elections within a few months 
and a possible return to government by former prime minister rajiv 
gandhis congress party which governed india for all but four of 
its 43 years of independence 
at least 900 people were killed in hindumoslem violence last 
year after the hindu group announced its plans to replace the 
mosque with a temple

an american reconnaissance satellite written 
off by the soviets and others as an expensive failure apparently is 
alive and spying after all 
first three men in europe separately spotted it orbiting 503 
miles high then a computer programmer in canada followed a trail 
of mathematical clues to the conclusion that the object is the 
satellite launched from the shuttle atlantis on march 1 
it apparently has been there all along said ted molczan of 
toronto who took the observations of three other satellite 
observers and tracked its course backward to the hushhush launch 
the atlantis mission was secret and all the pentagon said about 
it was that it achieved its goal whether that referred to a safe 
shuttle flight or a new operational spy satellite was left to 
conjecture 
the soviet news agency novosti reported march 7 that four 
orbiting fragments presumably separated from the american spy 
satellite were spotted in orbit the agency said it assumed 
the spy satellite has been blown up by its owners for some 
unknown reasons 
defense department spokesman pete williams replied only that two 
parts associated with the payload had entered earths 
atmosphere and burned up and the remainder are expected to decay 
within two to seven weeks 
the reappearance of the satellite was first reported by florida 
today a daily newspaper published in melbourne fla which said 
the 500 million photo reconnaissance satellite appears to be 
carryig out its mission to spy on the soviet union 
molczan said the object was spotted independently by three 
european observers russell eberst of scotland daniel karcher 
whose location he did not know and pierre meirinck of france 
he gave this sequence of events 
eberst who has been a satellite observer for nearly 30 years 
saw the object with binoculars on oct 9 took measurements and 
for the time being that was that 
karcher saw the object on oct 12 and meirinck saw it on oct 
14 each took precise measurements 
eberst and meirinck were chatting on the telephone and eberst 
mentioned his observation they learned of karchers observation 
their analysis showed that all three observed the same satellite on 
different nights 
my role was to take my knowledge of secret launches and see if 
what they saw matched with any of them molczan said the object 
was orbiting at a relatively high inclination 65 degrees from the 
equator 
molczan said he has data on anything the soviets launch and the 
object didnt fit he then considered six possibilities of american 
launches eliminating them one by one before tracing the satellite 
back to the march launch 
molczan who has a group of other amateurs in the north 
reporting to him said other facts strengthen his belief that what 
is being seen is the spy satellite 
he believes the satellite was boosted into a higher orbit and 
three degrees higher in inclination on march 7 the orbiting 
fragments the soviets spotted that day may have been shrouds or 
other protective covers 
molczan said the satellite repeats its track every nine days 
common for satellites designed for earth observation he said he 
believes it takes digital images that then are transmitted to 
ground stations 
major advances in optics would enable the satellite to see well 
even from an altitude of 5039 miles molczan said and it could 
stay at that distance from earth for many years without much need 
for fuel to correct its course 
and why did the object disappear for so long 
molczan said the unusual change in orbital inclination would 
make the satellite difficult to follow it turned out by looking 
at records that eberst and karcher had tracked and recorded the 
object in june but molczan said he and others were busy following 
a titanlaunched satellite and it fell through the cracks

the warsaw pact will cease existing as 
a sovietled military alliance next year more than 30 years after 
it was formed to meet the threat of western attack a senior 
hungarian official said today 
the official who spoke to western reporters said the 
military aspect of the crumbling sixnation alliance would 
effectively be suspended in december with the cessation of joint 
military exercises 
the pact will be dissolved as a military alliance in june and 
will continue to function only as a political forum he added 
without elaboration 
the warsaw pact was formed in 1955 in response to the creation 
of the north atlantic treaty organization a year earlier as the 
cold war gained force the two alliances confronted each other 
until communist governments were swept from power across most of 
east europe last year 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity appeared to 
be indirectly elaborating on past comments by leaders of newly 
democratic east european countries who have been pushing for a 
transformation of the alliance to reflect new political realities 
president vaclav havel of czechoslovakia said last week that the 
pacts military structure would be abolished it will instead be 
transformed into a body with a consultative political function 
he said according to ctk the czechoslovak state news agency 
havel gave no dates but said the essential transformation 
would be completed by a toplevel warsaw pact meeting that was 
originally slated for saturday in budapest but has been postponed 
until after nov 19 
that is when the 34 nations of the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe will hold a summit in paris the nations are 
set to sign a major eastwest conventional arms reduction 
agreement 
hungary has already served notice that it will leave the 
military part of the warsaw pact next year if it is not dissolved 
by then 
on saturday warsaw pact ministers are to sign an agreement on 
arms ceilings for each of the pacts six members clearing the way 
for the signing of the eastwest arms pact in paris

the gaguaz minority launched a drive to secede from the republic 
earlier this month and underscored the conflicts that have 
mushroomed since president mikhail s gorbachev loosened the 
kremlins grip on ethnic groups

president bush declared today i have 
had it with iraqs treatment of us hostages but said he has no 
timetable for deciding on a possible military strike 
bush under pressure from congress to allow more time for 
economic sanctions against iraq to work said the united 
nationsled embargo has not been as effective as he had hoped 
the president escalated the administrations antiiraq rhetoric 
but said the harsh comments of the past few days from senior 
officials should not be interpreted as a sign he had decided force 
was the only way to resolve the gulf crisis 
the embassy is being starved bush said of the us embassy 
in kuwait where a handful of staff members are confined during the 
iraqi occupation the people out there are not being resupplied 
the american flag is flying over the kuwait embassy and our people 
inside are being starved by a brutal dictator 
do you think im concerned about it youre darn right i am 
and what im going to do about it lets just wait and see 
because i have had it with that kind of treatment of americans 
bush said 
the president made the comments to reporters after arriving in 
suburban virginia for a political campaign breakfast for rep stan 
parris rva 
asked if the hostages have become more important in his strategy 
for how to deal with the persian gulf crisis bush replied i 
wouldnt say more but i am very concerned about it 
the president responded with a blunt no when asked if he had 
settled on a time frame for ordering a military strike 
bush gave a pessimistic assessment of the effects of the 
economic sanctions to date the major weapon of the usled 
coalition demanding that saddam hussein pull his troops from 
kuwait 
i wouldnt say they havent been successful at all but they 
certainly havent driven demand to do what he should have done 
which was to get out of kuwait and reverse this agression bush 
said 
a president must keep the safety of americans foremost in his 
mind bush said referring to the treatment of the kuwait embassy 
staff he said it has been brutal it has been oppressive 
nervous lawmakers have urged bush to be patient and let the 
international trade embargo against iraq run its course before 
using force 
were saying play out the sanctions see how long this 
goes rep dante fascell dfla said after he and other 
congressional leaders met with bush on tuesday 
the general thrust was dont do anything unilaterally if we 
are going to proceed to ratchet this up it should be under the 
united nations umbrella caution is the word here said fascell 
chairman of the house foreign affairs committee 
the meeting followed two days of tough talk by the president and 
his top officials on the persian gulf crisis which included 
warnings that the united states would not hesitate to use force if 
provoked 
fascell said bush threw the meeting open to comments from his 
guests and was told if there is a provocation its got to be a 
real one if theres an additional provocation it cant be two 
whales passing in the night it has to be something that can stand 
the scrutiny of the media and of the public and of history he 
understood 
other lawmakers said the president talked a lot at the meeting 
about the american and other hostages still being held in kuwait 
and iraq including those used as human shields at potential 
military targets and personnel at the us embassy in kuwait city 
describing bushs mood sen william cohen rmaine said his 
patience is wearing thin yet cohen said the president will 
continue to pursue the course that were currently on 
members of congress who adjourned their session for the year 
early sunday are nervous that military action might be taken in 
their absence they point to the harsh rhetoric from bush and 
baker bakers upcoming trip to islamic and european countries and 
to stalemated efforts to find diplomatic solutions 
theres concern on capitol hill that this is somehow a 
prelude to immediate military action said senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine 
the congressional contingent asked that bush make no major moves 
without consulting capitol hill noting that the constitution 
reserves to congress the power to declare war 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush promised to 
keep consultations open but he added we must all understand 
however that any such commitment must be hedged given the 
unpredictable and dynamic circumstances of this crisis 
after consulting lawmakers bush also met with senior national 
security advisers bush has sent some 240000 troops to the gulf 
region and defense secretary dick cheney said last week that 
100000 more may be deployed

tamara skiba was 20 when she was sent to the 
kargopol labor camp in the soviet north by the time she got out 
nine years and seven months later she was an old woman 
they broke my spine and took out my female organs they ruined 
one ear and pulled out almost all my teeth she said opening her 
mouth to reveal withered gums and rows of false teeth 
mrs skiba 63 was among an estimated 3000 to 6000 soviets 
who marched to the headquarters of the kgb security police on 
tuesday night for the unveiling of a monument to victims of 
political repression 
the daughter of a highranking army officer she was arrested 
and charged with spying for the west when her father fell out of 
favor with josef stalin in 1947 a decade later after stalins 
death she was released and rehabilitated given a clean political 
bill of health by premier nikita khrushchev 
mrs skibas allegations of mistreatment could not be confirmed 
but medical care in the camps was often rudimentary and survivors 
have alleged that they suffered botched operations and serious 
illnesses that could have been prevented 
tied around her gray hair on tuesday was a white headband saying 
kargopol she carried a banner listing friends who died in the 
camp and marched with others whose relatives or friends perished 
in the camps that dotted the soviet hinterland from 1918 until 
recently 
some marchers carried signs with the names of camps kolyma 
mordovia karaganda 
others bore photographs of those who perished jozef berman 
alexander nebov the kalina family 
holding candles against a bitter wind they exchanged stories 
listened to speeches by reformist politicians and placed red and 
white carnations on the monument outside the lubyanka the kgb 
headquarters and former prison 
this building is a symbol a symbol of lawlessness 
inhumanity and illegality historian yuri afanasyev told the 
crowd 
in moscow a city with scores of monuments to wars poets and 
politicians the new monument is the only one to victims of 
repression 
it is a simple but eloquent marker a rough piece of rock 3 
feet wide and 8 long hewn from the harsh solovetsky islands in the 
freezing white sea 
those islands were the site of a notorious labor camp for 
political prisoners established in the early 1920s more than 10 
million people are believed to have been shot or died of hunger 
cold and hard labor in the desolate islands and dozens of other 
camps across the country 
the soviet union of mikhail gorbachev says it no longer holds 
any political prisoners but some human rights groups claim there 
are still about 20 including proindependence activists imprisoned 
in the ukraine and other republics 
memorial a 3yearold organization devoted to preserving the 
memory of those who perished in the camps erected the monument 
with permission from moscows city council 
vyacheslav igrunov a founder of the group said it initially 
had trouble persuading authorities that the monument should be 
outside the kgb headquarters on dzerzhinsky square feliks 
dzerzhinsky founded the cheka the forerunner of the kgb 
but memorial insisted on the location because so many 
political prisoners began their trip to the camps here under 
interrogation in the basement cells of the yellow stone building 
said igrunov a former dissident who was imprisoned in the 
mid1970s 
among the marchers were several russian orthodox priests 
carrying icons or holy paintings in addition to political 
prisoners many priests and religious activists were sent to camps 
other marchers carried banners condemning the communist party 
and calling for public access to secret police archives the kgb 
cannot wash off the blood said one banner 
this was my father said alla krichevskaya crying softly as 
she held up a faded photograph of a young man in an oldfashioned 
high collar 
i never knew him he was sent to solovetsky after his arrest 
in 1932 a few months before i was born and they shot him in 
1937 
the unveiling of the monument was scheduled to coincide with 
political prisoners day which marks two anniversaries a 1974 
hunger strike by political prisoners and the death in a labor camp 
of yuri galanskov a poet and pacifist he was sentenced in 1968 to 
seven years in a camp and died in 1972

defense minister moshe arens is proposing a 
program to limit palestinians working in israel while creating jobs 
for them in the occupied territories his spokesman said today 
spokesman dan naveh said arens proposal would reverse the 
policy allowing palestinians to work in israel a policy followed 
since israel captured the west bank and gaza strip in 1967 
it is now time to start changing this so israelis will get the 
opportunities in israel and arabs will find jobs in the 
territories said naveh 
arens proposal made tuesday before parliaments foreign 
affairs and defense committee would have to be adopted by the 
government the defense minister believes the proposal would 
increase the palestinians autonomy by making them more self 
sufficient said naveh 
the change would be in line with the policy of arens likud 
bloc it calls for giving the 17 million palestinians in the 
occupied lands limited autonomy while maintaining israels control 
over land seized in the 1967 middle east war 
arens plan would require a change in policy denying 
palestinians permits to build factories that could compete with 
israeli manufacturers this has left the occupied lands as a 
captive market for israeli goods 
the proposal comes at a time when israel is facing increasing 
anger from palestinians and must find jobs for tens of thousands of 
soviet jews who are immigrating to the jewish state 
arab labor in israel became an issue last week after arens 
ordered a fourday sealing of the green line the border between 
pre1967 israel and the occupied lands 
the measure taken after street violence left five dead 
following the temple mount killings of 20 palestinians cut more 
than 110000 arabs off from their jobs in israel 
it gave rise to calls from both left and rightwing parties to 
make the measure permanent israel has an unemployment rate of more 
than 10 percent a figure expected to grow as soviet immigrants 
pour in 
the employment of more than 100000 people that come daily to 
work here and do the work jews want to do is not positive it 
doesnt fit the zionist ethic and it damages israeli society 
arens told the parliamentary committee 
we cannot put arabs in a situation of being the wood cutters 
and water carriers arens added 
assad saftawi a palestinian leader in the gaza strip said 
arens proposal would only make things worse in the territories 
where unemployment is as high as 25 percent 
i do not think arens is serious what i think the main aim of 
the latest israeli measures is a collective punishment he said 
also today arab reports said muti al haj 19 of the west bank 
village of jalkamous died of injuries suffered in a clash with 
israeli soldiers sept 10 
in the west bank city of nablus the army sealed the home of 
haitham jamla who was shot to death tuesday after stabbing an 
armed israeli guard 
in the gaza strip palestinians fired an automatic weapon at an 
israeli army patrol injuring one soldier in the leg the army

for the third year in a row the japanese were the 
worlds top savers last year salting away nearly four times as 
much money as americans according to a survey released today 
switzerland belgium austria and the netherlands were next on 
the annual dollardenominated list published by the international 
savings banks institute 
at the end of 1989 the average japanese had placed the 
equivalent of 40119 in savings and term deposits the survey 
said 
in japanese money the figure was up 11 percent from 1988 to 
about 57 million yen the dollar total dropped about 2 percent 
mostly because the yen weakened against the us currency 
switzerland which japan replaced at the top of the table in 
1987 saw per capita savings fall 19 percent the survey said an 
average swiss had the equivalent of 23418 in savings last year 
many other people living in western europe saved slightly more 
at the end of last year than in 1988 the institute said 
austria this year edged ahead of what was west germany the 
netherlands also pulled ahead of germany but the survey said the 
increase followed a change in dutch statistics 
following germany were norway singapore france canada and 
finland 
the united states ranked 14th with per capita savings of 
10822 up 4 percent from 1988 the united states ranked 8th in 
last years survey and 7th in 1987 many countries figures 
however were boosted by the weakened dollar 
the private genevabased savings group compiled statistics from 
82 countries

the biggest issues in the texas 
gubernatorial race during the campaigns final week are money and 
just whos ahead in the polls 
democrat ann richards contends the race is a dead heat 
republican clayton williams disagrees 
shes never broken 40 percent in any poll insists williams 
press secretary gordon hensley shes the typhoid mary of 
texas politics nobody seems to want to vote for her 
but ms richards outspent by a margin of nearly 21 in the 
states most expensive governors race notes that the most recent 
independent poll shows the candidates tied each favored by 38 
percent of those questioned 
in august the same poll had shown williams with a 13point 
advantage 
this race is even theres no gap at all ms richards said 
jerry polinard a political scientist at the university of 
texaspan american said the major shift has come from supporters 
who are bolting from williams especially after he refused to shake 
hands with ms richards at a joint appearance in dallas 
he put his boot in his mouth again and he closed the gap 
polinard said 
williams says he isnt worried about polls that are bouncing 
back and forth every day adding that his own surveys show him 
with a substantial lead 
on tuesday williams stumbled when asked his position on a 
proposed constitutional amendment dealing with appointments by the 
states chief executive 
williams told reporters he was unfamiliar with the amendment 
the only one tuesdays ballot and was unclear how he had voted on 
it when he cast his absentee ballot 
he said he could give an opinion on the measure if he had a 
halfminute to study it i had the highest grade point in the 
school of agriculture at texas aampm my last semester he said 
all of the comments came in advance of a fort worth 
startelegram poll released late tuesday night that showed 
williams with a 4541 percent lead in a survey that has a 3 percent 
margin of error 
however williams once again dipped into his personal bank 
account to give his campaign a 14 million boost during the final 
weeks 
campaign finance reports filed monday showed that williams had 
spent 204 million including about 8 million in personal funds 
since june 1989 
that has to be some kind of world record for trying to buy a 
governors race said ms richards spokesman bill cryer i 
would be ashamed if i were his campaign it shows he doesnt have 
any support 
ms richards has spent about 117 million 
hensley williams spokesman said ms richards has an 
unprecedented landslide of liberal specialinterest cash dumped in 
from greedy trial lawyers hollywood liberals and others whose 
agendas are contrary to the interests of the working people of 
texas 
were not going to let richards have specialinterest groups 
buy the election for her he said 
ms richards campaign manager mary beth rogers said most 
contributors have given 50 or less 
including money spent by other candidates in the march primary 
the 38 million or more spent on the 1990 governors race easily 
outpaces the 33 million record set in 1986 when democratic gov 
mark white was ousted by republican bill clements 
williams has spent the final weeks concentrating on several key 
themes a war on drugs more prisons and no new taxes 
in television commercials and on the stump hes painted ms 
richards as the liberal and himself as the conservative he 
also sought to capitalize on antiincumbent feelings by dubbing her 
a career politician after two terms as state treasurer and service 
as a county commissioner 
ms richards who rose to national prominence as the keynote 
speaker at the 1988 democratic national convention has criticized 
soaring health insurance costs and pledged consumeroriented 
reforms 
one of her strongest weapons has been a 30second television 
commercial describing williams in his own words 
the ad repeated some of williams verbal gaffes including the 
joke in which he likened bad weather to rape and said if it were 
inevitable just relax and enjoy it he later apologized for 
the comment

two boy scouts whose hiking team was 
surprised by a severe alpine storm died in a hospital today from 
the effects of exposure 
the youths were airlifted to a grenoble hospital tuesday after 
their leader a 22yearold former scout managed to climb down the 
mountain in bare feet to summon help police said 
doctors said the two youths were barely alive when they arrived 
at grenobles sablons hospital with body temperatures below 68 
degrees doctors tried unsuccessfully to restore their heart beats 
the victims were identified as olivier schmit 20 and sebastien 
baron 16 
a third scout michael poursin also was hospitalized but his 
condition was not critical officials said 
prosecutors opened a homicide investigation wednesday into the 
actions of the scout leader emmanuel beninia who was treated for 
frostbite at the hospital and then briefly taken into police 
custody 
the group of seven scouts all aged 16 to 20 and their leader 
had come from a paris suburb to spend the all saints day vacation 
week hiking in the alps 
on monday evening the group camped on a mountainside above the 
town of parlognanlavanoise at an altitude of 8200 feet they 
had hoped to reach a shelter but were forced to stop several 
hundred yards short of the refuge because of poor visibility 
a storm moved in during the night ripping their tents and 
scattering their equipment officials said 
on tuesday morning the storm lifted and the leader of the group 
descended to get help police said he made the descent in bare feet 
because his boots had been lost in the storm 
a helicopter reached the campsite at midday to evacuate the 
hikers 
members of the regional mountain police unit said the scout team 
was wellequipped but apparently made the mistake of not obtaining 
current weather reports one officer said the hikers might have 
changed plans if they had heard the radio forecast of the storm

president roh taewoos governing 
party could face defections of lawmakers and chaos among its 
leadership unless a feud over proposed government changes is 
settled party officials said today 
party leader kim youngsam made the prediction shortly after 22 
lawmakers threatened to withdraw from the government 
the tension in the 9monthold coalition government intensified 
last week when a seoul newspaper published a secret memorandum 
detailing plans to change from a presidential to a parliamentary 
form of government a move criticized by some as a ploy to keep 
rohs party in power 
a forceful constitutional revision would face enormous public 
resistance and bring a national chaos kim said 
under the parliamentary system rohs party would have an edge 
in seats over the presently divided opposition some opposition 
leaders say the party is pushing the reforms because it does not 
have a strong candidate to run for president when rohs fiveyear 
term expires in early 1993 
in a news conference at his home today kim apologized to the 
nation and said the latest political crisis has given him 
distress and humiliation i cannot tolerate any longer 
disclosure of the secret memo was especially a problem for kim 
who had repeatedly denied he had made an agreement with roh for a 
new form of government kim hopes to succeed roh as president 
the memo was signed by roh kim and party leader kim jongpil in 
may the three men merged their parties in january to form the 
governing coalition 
the controversy comes in the third month of a boycott of the 
299seat national assembly by 78 opposition members who charge the 
governing party with railroading bills and reneging on democratic 
reforms 
rohs supporters said kim youngsams warnings about party 
disputes were part of a power play to place his followers in 
control kim has boycotted party duties since last weekend and 
ignored rohs urging that he return to work 
kim said discussions about a new government were prompted by 
social and political unrest 
meanwhile more than 15000 riot police were mobilized today to 
break up radical students trying to watch banned north korean 
movies on at least 15 college campuses around south korea 
there were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries 
it was the fourth time in less than two months that police have 
stormed campuses to block the unauthorized showing of north korean 
movies 
the films salt and escape were shown at at least four 
schools the films reportedly promote a revolutionary cause

president bushs escalation of threats against 
iraq may be aimed at saddam hussein but the message also is bound 
to play well to republican audiences 
with just a week to go to midterm elections growing talk of war 
in the persian gulf is providing a diversion for the white house 
after weeks of pounding on taxes and the budget 
i think americans should be focused on whats going on in the 
gulf and in many ways its too bad we had that dip in attention 
during those two or three weeks said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater only partly in jest 
bush asserted today that he was keeping his persian gulf policy 
totally separate from the political process 
i dont think even the most cynical would ever suggest that a 
president would play politics with the lives of american kids 
halfway around the world bush said 
fitzwater and other bush aides deny any political motivation in 
the new round of coordinated saberrattling by bush and secretary 
of state james a baker iii 
but theres no denying that emphasizing the gulf crisis in the 
closing days of the campaign may help steer the electorates 
attention away from the budget fiasco and the presidents reversal 
of his no new taxes pledge 
on monday bush said in san francisco that he would not hesitate 
to use force if provoked and he discussed possible military action 
against iraq in a meeting with congressional leaders tuesday on the 
gulf crisis 
baker who told a los angeles gathering we will not rule out a 
possible use of force if iraq continues to occupy kuwait embarks 
saturday on a weeklong visit to arab and european countries 
beginning with saudi arabia 
there is considerable speculation that baker will discuss 
military options with saudi leaders 
and the united states was clearly savoring the united nations 
security councils vote monday declaring iraq responsible for all 
damage and personal injuries resulting from its occupation of iraq 
the council said the un would take further measures under 
its charter although the use of force was not explicitly 
mentioned it was the latest in a series of resolutions designed to 
increase pressure on iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
at the white house bush discussed military options with 
congressional leaders and was cautioned by some of them not to 
give up too soon on the economic sanctions against baghdad or let 
impatience draw him into war 
theres concern on capitol hill that this is somehow a 
prelude to immediate military action said senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine 
after stepping up its threats against iraq on monday the white 
house was drying to dampen fears tuesday that fighting was 
imminent 
i would say that its pretty much steady as she goes 
fitzwater said trying to downplay suggestions that bushs 
heightened talk about military options was new 
if thats true im a dismal failure because im trying to 
play it down be calm he said 
asked pointblank whether the gettough rhetoric was designed to 
help focus the final week of the election on the persian gulf 
instead of new taxes fitzwater said 
i dont think there has been a shift i think the big 
factor is simply that the congress is leaving and they finished up 
all the legislation and now this has become a major focus again 
which is probably good 
ed rogers white house political director said there has been 
no effort to gin up bushs speeches for the last few weeks to 
stress his toughness on the persian gulf thats pretty much a 
constant he said 
at the same time rogers said that bush has clearly stepped up 
his partisan attacks on democrats reflecting gop strategy for the 
final week of the campaign 
bush leaves thursday on a crosscountry political barnstorming 
tour for gop candidates many of whom have kept him at arms 
length on tax issues the trip will last through election day 
on tuesday addressing a group of about 500 party workers at a 
hotel rally bush moved easily from denouncing the democraticled 
congress as a hot dog factory to seeking to put a gop seal on 
his persian gulf policy 
in times of crisis and challenge the american spirit has been 
a constant source of strength its true now obviously in the 
persian gulf and its just as true at home today the spirit to 
which republicans are responding

japans largest christian organization has gathered 
nearly 80000 signatures on a petition opposing state funding of a 
religious enthronement rite for emperor akihito officials said 
today 
the national christian council of japan which began gathering 
the signatures in december 1989 is one of a growing number of 
groups opposing the rite called the daijosai or great food 
offering ritual 
the council an umbrella group encompassing nearly all 
mainstream protestant denominations also is planning a hunger 
strike to protest the funding of the ceremony 
in the daijosai to be held 10 days after akihito is formally 
crowned nov 12 the emperor is to have his first communion with 
the gods of shinto which until 1945 was japans state religion 
although the rite has roots going back more than a millennium 
opponents say it conflicts with the postwar constitutions 
guarantee of freedom of religion and its ban on government 
involvement in church activities 
government involvement in a religious ceremony like this is a 
violation of the separation of church and state said the 
petition we oppose government involvement in the daijosai and 
we oppose government funding 
council official natsuko yoshida said the petition is to be 
presented to prime minister toshiki kaifu and other government 
officials in midnovember after the final count has been made 
she said officials had hoped to present the petition earlier 
but the prime ministers office will not set a firm date saying 
they are too busy at present because parliament is in session 
we had originally only hoped to get about 50000 signatures 
yoshida said and though we were able to get more than that we 
are not really satisfied with just the numbers 
she said however that the signature drive was 
revolutionary because it had the support of nearly all 
christian groups in the country 
the catholics and some other groups had been slow to protest 
in the past yoshida said but we all came together for this 
and i think it will create a foundation for conducting future 
protests 
council officials also said that unless the government reverses 
its funding policy they are planning to begin the hunger strike on 
nov 19 and stop it after the daijosai ends on nov 23 roughly 
1000 people are expected to join in the strike they said 
over the past month many groups from a wide section of society 
have voiced concern about the governments handling of the rite 
more than 1500 people have filed suit in a district court in 
western japan claiming the state funding is unconstitutional 
that case opened tuesday in osaka japans secondlargest city 
with each plaintiff demanding a token amount of money in damages 
and a withdrawal of government funding if providing such is found 
in violation of the constitution 
many of the people who brought the suit to court are christians 
but the group also includes buddhists historians and teachers 
last week the head of the japan federation of bar associations 
said government funding could only be seen as a violation of the 
principle of churchstate separation 
government officials say the funding is justified because it is 
intended only to preserve an ancient imperial tradition not to 
promote religion

moslem fundamentalists in iran and 
moderates led by president hashemi rafsanjani agreed to halt a 
propoganda war waged since ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis death last 
year an iranian newspaper said today 
the englishlanguage tehran times said officials from both camps 
in the parliament met monday and decided to stop their war of 
words 
the meeting grouped parliament speaker mehdi karrubi who leads 
the hardliners in the 270seat majlis or parliament and nateq 
noori leader of the socalled pragmatic faction that backs 
rafsanjani 
karrubis brother was arrested last month on charges of 
corruption and irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei 
ordered an audit of the multimillion dollar martyrs foundation 
which karrubi heads 
but karrubi declared his allegiance to khamenei earlier this 
week and warned other radicals in parliament to watch what they 
say 
arguments and fistfights broke out in the majlis earlier this 
month after khamenei excluded most radical candidates from 
elections for a key constitutional body khamenei is a political 
ally of rafsanjani who has been trying to purge the government of 
fundamentalists since khomeinis death 
the hardliners accuse rafsanjani of violating khomeinis 
teachings by seeking to improve relations with the west and irans 
arab neighbors they have also declared khamenei unfit to be 
khomeinis successor

departments covering finance marketing and administration a small

the meridian miss star on bush and taxes 
the congress will push me to raise taxes and ill say no and 
theyll push and ill say no and theyll push again and ill say 
to them read my lips no new taxes 
george bush august 1988 
apparently congress pushed harder than thenpresidential 
candidate bush anticipated 
times and circumstances do change the federal deficit is 
considerably higher than it was when bush made that emphatic 
promise in his acceptance speech at the republican national 
convention in new orleans the president made the decision to 
compromise in the national interest 
but now he has taken to the campaign trail in an attempt to wash 
his hands of responsibility for the biggest tax increase in 
history the democrats in congress made him do it he told 
auidences over the weekend 
well the president obviously knew two years ago that he would 
be pressured to go along with a tax increase he didnt just say 
im against new taxes he went further in declaring his intent to 
resist the inevitable push to raise them it is understandable that 
the presidents public standing and credibility have eroded 
somewhat as a result of his reversal 
the president would be better served politically if he would 
simply admit that his hard line was unrealistic rather than blaming 
the opposition for a tax package that he his staff and republican 
congressional leaders helped craft and approved

the evening telegram superior wis on the budget 
cb scott jones an aide to sen claiborne pell of rhode 
island recently wrote defense secretary richard cheney with a 
startling revelation when tapes of speeches by cheney secretary 
of state james baker and president bush are played backwards the 
word simone can be heard 
jones alerted secretary cheney to his discovery because he 
feared simone might be a code word that would not be in the 
national interest to be known 
pell himself says there may be some merit to it 
jones modestly admits that the whole thing may be a nonevent 
just another mystery in a new technology we are developing 
lets hear more about this new technology 
if for example we played bushs famous no new taxes 
campaign speech backwards might we not hear the spectral words 
im lying im lying and those pious speeches by congressmen 
calling for fiscal restraint wouldnt the reverse speech 
technique reveal a voice whimpering let me keep my pay raise 
no wonder weve had such trouble reading their lips 
 
oct 24 
the bulletin bend ore on the budget 
there may be some comfort in all this budget mess we are 
learning that the definition of rich is not an exact one 
both republicans and democrats want to use new taxes on the 
rich to help balance the budget thats an easy target since 
few of us consider ourselves rich the proposed taxes meet the 
first obligation of a tax proposal they tax someone else 
house speaker tom foley thinks rich starts with an income of 
100000 per year george bush holds to the same figure in part he 
would raise taxes on those with incomes that high by limiting their 
deductions dan rostenkowski the chief house tax writer thinks it 
takes 200000 a year in income to make one rich some other 
members of the conference committee think the floor of wealth is at 
300000 
but everyone is in agreement on one thing an income of 1 
million makes one truly rich all are agreed on a new higher tax 
for entertainers for professional athletes and for those few 
leaders of big business who make that kind of money that seems 
reasonable few could argue that earnings of 1 million leave 
anyone disadvantaged

st louis postdispatch on congress record 
the 101st congress has adjourned to the boos and catcalls of a 
disgusted public yet on balance it had a productive session a 
fact of which todays antiincumbent voters should take note 
despite the shortcomings of the process congress did finally 
approve a major deficitcutting measure which for the first time 
in nearly a decade faces the need for new revenue to restore fiscal 
sanity 
it also endorsed the first major revision of the clean air act 
in 13 years promising major improvements in the nations air and 
water both the budget and clean air measures represent the 
resolution of tough political conflicts that completely stymied 
several earlier congresses 
the legislative session was a messy one divisions between a 
democratic congress and a republican president didnt help 
nevertheless the results were impressive democracy still works

the phoenix gazette on obscenity 
despite all the rhetoric and posing of law enforcement officials 
who just happened to be up for reelection juries in fort 
lauderdale fla and cincinnati ohio came to the appropriate 
conclusion law enforcement officers and district attorneys 
should stick to enforcing laws in the streets and stay out of art 
galleries and nightclubs 
the fort lauderdale jury that acquitted members of 2 live crew 
on obscenity charges and the cincinnati jury that acquitted art 
gallery officials for exhibiting photos by the late robert 
mapplethorpe offered a working example of how freedom of speech 
works even unpopular things can be said even some mighty rough 
words can be uttered in the course of an artistic performance 
so once again the juries show themselves as more sophisticated 
in the meaning of americas freedoms than the politicians and 
county attorneys who have attempted to gain politically by 
attacking as pornographic that which is unpopular 
one juror was so unimpressed with the prosecutions effort 
against 2 live crew that she toyed with the idea of writing the 
jurys verdict as a rap number its probably a good thing she 
dispensed with the notion rap isnt all that safe in broward 
county fla these days

the record hackensack nj on israel 
once again the united nations security council has voted to 
condemn israel for its refusal to cooperate with an investigation 
into the killing of palestinians at the temple mount 
the security council is right israels stonewalling of the 
investigation must stop otherwise it looks as though the israeli 
government has something to hide 
many questions remain regarding the temple mount incident in an 
unprovoked attack several thousand palestinians at the al aksa 
mosque threw rocks at israeli worshipers at the western wall below 
and israeli soldiers opened fire on the palestinians 
in the days since the incident tension and hatred between arabs 
and jews have soared with calls for revenge from both sides 
some israeli officials have exacerbated the tension by making 
inflammatory and irresponsible statements the minister of 
agriculture for example said on israeli radio that one possible 
solution to finding an armed arab would be to shoot him in the 
head 
for its own good and for the good of the world israel must 
work to end tensions and restore calm

the providence ri sunday journal on israel 
israeli bravery is becoming israeli defiance and it harms no 
one more than israel itself 
president yitzhak shamir by refusing to receive a united 
nations team seeking to investigate the killing of 21 arabs by 
israeli troops is showing contempt for the very international law

the united states may be israels best friend but american 
patience is not infinitely elastic an arab death and an 
israeli death are equally lamentable

lois lane and clark kent are getting married each looking not 
one day older than they did when they first met in the comic strips 
a halfcentury ago 
theyll make a lovely couple were sure but frankly weve 
always had some doubts about lois

frequently rescued from death or worse by superman in all that 
time shes never guessed that the man of steel and her 
mildmannered fellow reporter are the same guy 
doesnt sound like the kind of reporter wed like to send out on 
important assignments maybe the daily planet should reassign her 
to something a little less demanding 
like writing editorials for example

spartanburg sc heraldjournal on a new hope in lebanon 
as an indirect result of the persian gulf crisis a new light is 
showing at the end of a long tunnel of tragedy and misery in 
lebanon 
fifteen years of insanity have almost destroyed what once was a 
mediterranean coast of exquisite beauty ruins replaced what then 
was rivieralie resorts and casinos highfashion shops and 
bustling business centers 
gen michael aoun leader of a lonely fragment of christian 
opposition has been defeated the reason iraq can no longer ship 
weapons to him or support him in his bloody struggle actually 
aoun chose to surrender rather than fight to the death as he had 
promised to do 
now the general has been given asylum in the french embassy in 
beirut the collapse of his forces means that an agreement reached 
last year will go into effect ending domination of lebanese 
politics by the christian minority a stronger central government 
may arise from the ashes 
frances protection of gen aoun is symbolic for that country 
was there in the beginning and is there at the end 
lebanon was formed in 1920 from five districts of the 
dismembered turkish empire france took over its political affairs 
in 1922 with a mandate to prepare the new country for independence 
the french united the christians in mount lebanon and the muslims 
along the coast under one government and helped to write its 
constitution 
lebanon became completely independent in 1943 with christians 
and muslims sharing power but french troops remained until 1946 
the national covenant establishing christian power was adopted 
before they left 
about 90 percent of lebanons people are arabs and they have 
become increasingly intolerant toward a system of government in 
which particular offices were reserved for certain religious 
groups 
syria which has historical claims to the rule of lebanon was 
invited by the arab league to send in troops as peacemakers during 
a civil war in 1976 they have been there ever since controlling a 
large portion of the country 
factional militias and palestinian guerilla groups continued to 
hold territory fighting for advantage israel aided the christian 
faction and periodically sent retaliatory forces into south 
lebanon 
the result of all these bitter contentions was anarchy and 
bloodletting the american embassy in beirut was dynamited and 
more than 200 us marines were killed in a suicide bombing of 
their barracks 
americans and other hostages are still held in the satanic 
tenements of the moslem section of west beirut palestinians and 
other militias are still armed and dangerous israeli forces still 
occupy a zone of south lebanon 
perhaps peace is now in sight for this beleaguered territory it 
would be to the benefit of all the contending factions to end the 
slaughter and establish a new government chosen by free elections

nrc handelsblad rotterdam netherlands on the us budget 
agreement 
after the lingering negotiations between republicans and 
democrats between the house of representatives the senate and the 
white house at which budget proposals were tumbling all over one 
another the us federal government was briefly closed down and 
president george bush incurred political damage 
it is a start of the purge of the american federal overspending 
from a political point of view the new budget means a change 
congress rebellion against an earlier budget compromise has in the 
end created a result at which more taxes are being raised and less 
is being cut down 
especially wealthy americans are left holding the baby the 
favoritism of the rich elite which profited from the antitax 
sentiment in the united states in the 80s has met with more and 
more powerful resistance from the american middle class the 
democrats in congress have broken through the budget limbo in the 
end and shoved a larger part of the burden through to the americans 
with the highest incomes 
this new tax populism could very well set a trend 
internationally the united states often sets the political tone for 
economic policy in the 80s this was the case with lowering taxes 
and a supplyeconomy the 90s can become the era of rebellion of 
the middle class in europe this will then go at the cost of the 
solidarity

the times of india new delhi on the soviet union 
it might be a blessing in disguise that more people can place 
chernobyl than chernenko the soviet communist partys entirely 
forgettable general secretary who preceded its most memorable one 
has been gravely dishonored even by russian standards 
the passion associated with destalinization is lacking 
replaced by a crueler indifference 
konstantin chernenkos bronze bust has reportedly proved most 
awkward since no one knows what to do with it 
it cant even be exiled to siberia because thats where it 
already is and the citizens of krasnoyarsk are being rather crass 
about playing host to it having already knocked it off its 
pedestal 
 
oct 29 
the times london on the european community summit in rome 
this summit was a disgrace challenged to resolve the chaos of 
farm prices in advance of the gatt round members decided instead 
to bring forward a debate on economic union scheduled for december 
in doing so they almost casually accepted a 1994 date for a new 
central bank to be followed by a single currency and the surrender 
of national control of economic policy 
while few members expect actually to go along with such a union 
come the day anything was clearly better than talking about farm 
prices 
such procedural anarchy is a measure of the shambles of the 
current italian presidency of the ec and of the ecs way of 
doing or not doing urgent business 
this is not the executive decisiveness of europe plc more the 
last days of the austrohungarian empire seizing ever more power 
to the center but careless of what to do with it

the soviet union today defended its recent 
detonation of a nuclear device and said it would have been 
dangerous to dalay the underground test until winter 
the soviets exploded the device oct 24 on the arctic island of 
novaya zemlya less than 500 miles from finland and norway 
following complaints from the nordic nations the soviet 
parliament adopted a resolution today ordering the government to 
notify northern european countries in advance of any nuclear test 
deputy foreign minister vitaly p karpov a nuclear arms 
specialist told a news conference that the test had voluntarily 
been put off for nearly a year but that because of weather 
conditions the test had to be carried out 
the nuclear device was in there for nearly a year every 
warranty for the time period was ending because winter was coming 
and in winter it is impossible to test karpov said if we 
waited until april or may many unexpected things could happen to 
the nuclear charge and we could face a much more dangerous 
situation 
the yield of the device set off 200 yards underground was 15 
to 20 kilotons there were no adverse affects to the regions 
ecology he said 
karpov said he met with the ambassadors from finland sweden 
norway denmark and iceland who protested underground testing 
they said testing could hinder cooperation between the nordic 
countries and the soviet union in the field of ecology karpov 
said i explained why we had to hold the explosion at this 
moment 
he said the ambassadors were aware that only one soviet device 
was exploded this year and that it was a forced test and the 
soviet union took all measures to avoid negative influence on the 
environment 
karpov citing seven us tests and two chinese tests said 
although there would be no more tests this year if it was 
necessary for the defense and security of the soviet union more 
could be carried out in the future 
the parliament ending three days of hearings on nuclear 
underground testing passed a resolution today ordering that 
neighboring countries be notified of underground tests 
the resolution also asked the council of ministers to speed up 
work on a report on the impact of the novaya zemlya test and its 
impact on areas of the far north

a cityrun haunted house was exorcised 
after a nun gave them the devil 
the haunted house featured a room where the devil asked children 
to sign over their souls while a lost soul implored them to resist 
a roman catholic nun sister jeanne mcgue of the gary diocese 
was outraged when she heard about it she mobilized some priests to 
call officials of this chicago suburb to protest 
i read about this in the newspaper and i couldnt believe my 
eyes that they were trying to get children to sign their souls over 
to the devil mcgue said granted halloween is supposed to be 
fun but we have to draw the line this is not childs play 
parks superintendent richard gomez said he closed the devils 
room to avoid controversy 
they felt that kids at this young age are impressionable and 
they didnt need to be exposed to this activity and i agreed with 
them gomez said the main purpose is to provide recreation for 
the kids we will still continue to have the scariest haunted 
house in the region

incumbent mayor tom fink held a lead of 
more than 1000 votes today but the challenger said he wouldnt 
concede defeat until 3400 challenged ballots were tallied 
were gonna stick it out said rich mystrom who trailed 
after all 91 precincts were counted in tuesdays runoff election 
the municipal clerks office said the unofficial count 
including absentee votes gave fink the edge 30338 votes to 
29245 
more than 48 percent of registered voters turned out tuesday 
the election came down to a runoff after neither fink nor mystrom 
gained 40 percent of the vote in a threeway race that included 
former state legislator ha red boucher 
authorities said challenged ballots those cast by voters at 
polling places outside their own precincts would be examined 
today 
fink who appeared headed for his second threeyear term told 
supporters gathered at his headquarters he was pleased about 
leading all night and got a goodnatured round of booing when he 
said the runoff was still too close to call 
it was a remarkable turnaround for a politician who according 
to polls six months ago was rated negatively by 50 percent or more 
of anchorage residents 
for mystrom that dissatisfaction translated into an early 
comfortable lead but it steadily eroded over the last three 
months 
mystrom 46 is a former anchorage assemblyman and former 
advertising executive who led the citys unsuccessful winter 
olympics bid 
fink 62 is an anchorage insurance executive whose first 
mayoral term found him variously at odds with the municipal 
assembly local reporters and unions representing city workers

a judge facing an election next week 
shares his last name with an unpopular federal judge and has 
launched a campaign to make sure voters dont vote against the 
wrong guy 
jackson county circuit judge thomas c clark says he is often 
confused with us district judge russell g clark who angered 
many residents by raising taxes to desegregate kansas citys 
schools 
thomas clarks answering machine at home begins this is not 
the residence of russell g clark his 15second radio campaign 
spot tells voters dont vote against the wrong guy 
the name confusion was once merely annoying but now thomas 
clark worries voters kicking the wrong clark could make him the 
second judge ever to lose a retention election held under 
missouris 50yearold merit appointment system 
to avoid that thomas clark has broken with tradition and 
launched a campaign to keep his bench missouri judges usually 
avoid politics and run on their records 
but the records of the two judge clarks are often confused 
when thomas clark received a 50signature petition this year 
demanding he rehire a fired school principal he sent it to russell 
clark who oversees school desegregation 
russell clark replied with a letter advising him to change his 
name to something like zweerink or zurweste

voters dont seem to like either kansas 
gubernatorial candidate very much and their respective stands on 
abortion dont appear to be enticing constituents 
republican gov mike hayden and democrat joan finney have 
negative overall ratings so large that political consultants say 
neither would stand a chance of election against an opponent that 
voters felt good about 
haydens unfavorable rating consistently has exceeded 40 
percent mrs finneys has climbed past 30 percent during the 
campaign 
mrs finney the state treasurer had an 18point lead early in 
the campaign but political observers think the neckandneck 
contest may be headed for the closest finish ever in a kansas 
governors race 
in a state that has one of the nations most liberal abortion 
laws hayden is the clear pick of prochoice groups 
in a political reversal hayden has declared himself prochoice 
mrs finney is staunchly antiabortion 
it is hayden who has captured the endorsement of molly yard of 
the national organization for women thats a rarity for a 
republican especially one who was endorsed by right to life groups 
in 1986 
mrs finney a roman catholic wants the issue to go away women 
democratic legislators have said publicly theyre having a hard 
time supporting mrs finney because of her antiabortion stand 
in cases of rape and incest we have to look far deeper than a 
reactionary act like abortion she said in september touching 
off a furor 
that widely publicized statement was offensive to large numbers 
of women and turned a lot of voters to hayden says frank ybarra 
the governors campaign press secretary 
mrs finney meanwhile is waging a damage control effort 
shes said she wont propose legislation restricting abortions 
although she says she would sign restrictions into law if they came 
to her as governor 
and shes stopped talking about abortion as the campaign nears 
its conclusion while aides try to downplay her earlier comments 
i dont know how significant an issue it will be said 
finney spokesman mark schmeller polls show its a major concern 
for only 10 percent or so of the voters i think itll probably be 
a wash 
there are other issues in the campaign one is the state sales 
tax 
hayden proposes raising that tax a penny to 525 percent and 
using the estimated 215 million in new revenue to reduce school 
property taxes 
mrs finney has proposed putting a 1 percent sales tax on goods 
and services now exempt raising 460 million to lower school and 
local government property taxes 
mrs finney says haydens plan is inadequate he says her plan 
would devastate kansas business and agriculture by adding to the 
cost of state products sold elsewhere 
it has been a negative campaign by kansas standards 
hayden has questioned mrs finneys competence saying shes 
unable to manage the treasurers office much less the entire state 
government 
mrs finney has accused hayden of twisting her positions to make 
her look bad and of airing mudslinging advertising 
the latest figures show hayden outspending mrs finney 13 
million to 274000 during the fall campaign much of his money has 
gone for television commercials 
in one kansas first lady patti hayden asks voters if they know 
which candidate for governor opposes capital punishment even for 
people who murder children 
a finney tv commercial shows blobs of mud being slapped on a 
picture of mrs finneys face with the announcer explaining which 
charge by hayden each spat represents 
at the conclusion the announcer says all of this makes joan 
finney look pretty good and the governor just another mudslinging 
politician

highlevel representatives from more than 150 
countries who converge on tokyo in two weeks for the coronation of 
emperor akihito likely will have another agenda getting money 
japanese officials expect the nov 12 ceremony and parade to be 
a replay of the february 1989 funeral of emperor hirohito when 
dozens of visiting foreign officials sought greater economic 
assistance 
japan recently surpassed the united states as the largest donor 
of government aid to the third world 
it wasnt because they all loved hirohito said robert orr 
director of the stanford japan center and an expert on japanese 
foreign assistance 
i expect the same thing this time theyre coming because 
they have other interests they want some of that japanese money 
during the funeral diplomacy then prime minister noboru 
takeshita had talks with 40 foreign dignitaries and then foreign 
minister sousuke uno met with 69 the foreign ministry said 
japans foreign aid in 1989 was 9 billion compared with 77 
billion from the united states the parisbased organization for 
economic cooperation and development announced earlier this year 
but japan ranked 12th of 18 major donor countries in terms of 
aid as a percentage of gross national product it was 10th in aid 
on a per capita basis 
japan is in the middle of a fiveyear plan which should 
distribute about 50 billion roughly twice the aid of the previous 
fiveyear period 
with the us economy apparently tumbling into recession the 
importance of tokyo to fundseeking statesmen has become even 
larger 
us treasury secretary nicholas brady stopped in tokyo early 
last month as part of a global fundraising mission for the 
multinational military buildup against iraq 
days later japan pledged an additional 3 billion to the 
effort including 2 billion in aid to middle eastern nations 
facing hardships because of the crisis 
the past week has shown just how crowded the corridors of power 
in japan can become with aid seekers 
nguyen co thach made the first official visit to japan in 12 
years by a vietnamese foreign minister and headed home with a 
promise of a 180000 grant for his countrys national television 
station the japanese foreign ministry described the grant as the 
first major economic assistance to hanoi since 1978 when vietnam 
invaded cambodia 
moscow mayor gavril popov also came to tokyo seeking loans to 
help convert state businesses into private enterprises such as the 
retail distribution system 
another visitor south african black leader nelson mandela 
discovered the limits of japanese largesse monday when tokyo 
rejected his request for 25 million for the african national 
congress which has been at the forefront of the fight against 
apartheid 
prime minister toshiki kaifu responded that japan does not give 
assistance to political parties and instead offered funds to 
grassroots groups working to improve living and educational 
conditions in south africa 
mandela labeled japans contribution as absolutely 
insignificant compared with packages from other much poorer 
asia nations 
generally the political objectives of japanese foreign aid have 
not been clearly defined 
as a sign of changing times however japanese officials point 
to their decision to temporarily freeze a 54 billion loan package 
to china to protest the crushing of the 1989 prodemocracy movement 
in beijing 
wed like to support those countries working harder for the 
democratic process said takanori kitamura director of the 
ministrys research and programming division 
orr describes such statements as a major change in the 
rhetoric whether its a major change in policy remains to be 
seen

two people who lead programs providing clean 
hypodermic needles to drug addicts to prevent the spread of aids 
received awards of 50000 each on wednesday from the drug policy 
foundation 
the foundation which advocates decriminalization of illegal 
drugs and treating drug abuse as a health problem not a law 
enforcement problem gave the awards to jon c parker founder of 
the national aids brigade and david purchase founder of the 
tacoma wash needle exchange 
national drug control policy director william j bennett has 
criticized such needle exchange programs saying they muddy the 
antidrug message by enabling people to continue using illegal 
drugs 
parker was acquitted in a widely publicized trial in boston for 
providing free needles to addicts and he sought arrest on similar 
charges during a recent tour of numerous cities 
we will try to do it openly in several states and try to push 
the system parker said in an interview before the tour began 
i dont think they should waste money arresting people trying to 
save lives 
he faces charges in new york city jersey city nj lowell 
mass and redwood city calif however police in baltimore and 
washington among other places declined to arrest him 
parker a former addict who is a yale university graduate 
student in public health said 35 percent of addicts not in 
needleexchange programs in boston and new haven conn tested 
positive for the aids virus compared to 13 percent in boston and 
28 percent in new haven for those in such programs 
parker said there was more aids already in new haven than in 
boston when his programs started five years ago 
purchase got approval from tacomas police chief before he 
started offering a oneforone exchange of used syringes for clean 
ones at a table on a downtown sidewalk in august 1988 the program 
which serves up to 350 users each week was ruled legal last 
january 
the drug policy foundation also gave a 10000 award to arnold 
and mae nutt of beaverton mich who became active in making it 
easier to get marijuana for medical use after their son contracted 
cancer he was debilitated by chemotherapy until he got relief from 
the drug which his parents had to obtain illegally 
another 10000 award was given to three people from liverpool 
england psychiatrist john marks allan parry who runs a needle 
exchange program and pat ohare the executive editor of the 
international journal on drug policy 
the money for the foundations awards came from richard j 
dennis who earned millions when he was a chicago mercantile 
exchange broker and who now supports the foundation and other 
groups that advocate some form of decriminalization of illegal 
drugs

with encouragement from republicans and the 
supreme court blacks are pressing for the creation of new minority 
congressional districts next year a demand that threatens 
oncesecure democrats 
creating a black congressional district in virginia for 
example could require stripping three democratic congressmen of 
their most reliable supporters 
comparable situations exist in alabama north carolina south 
carolina georgia florida and texas according to an official of 
the lawyers committee for civil rights under law 
the conflicting agendas of blacks and longterm white democratic 
incumbents present an unusual opportunity for republican gains when 
new legislative district lines are drawn next year to conform to 
the 1990 census 
the final census figures wont be available until next spring 
but preliminary data indicate that 19 house seats will shift most 
of them going from northern industrial states to the sun belt 
democrats are far stronger than republicans in state 
legislatures where the new lines will be drawn through alliances 
with blacks as well as through court action republicans hope to 
neutralize at least partially that democratic advantage 
the gop tactic is driving a wedge between democratic party 
leaders and their most reliable constituency 
theres going to be a real serious problem between blacks and 
the democratic party establishment said hank sanders a black 
alabama state senator 
even in virginia where gov l douglas wilder is black 
tensions are high between civil rights organizations and party 
officials 
paul goldman the white chairman of the virginia democratic 
party complains that civil rights groups have threatened 
virginia they say if you dont do this or you dont do that were 
going to sue you 
we will oppose any friend or fight any foe to ensure that 
there is a black congressional district in virginia in 1991 said 
jack gravely president of the state naacp 
wilder has approached such proposals with extreme caution the 
closest the nations first elected black governor came to endorsing 
the concept was when he told the state naacp that he saw no legal 
prohibition to such a district 
at the same time wilder warned blacks against redistricting 
alliances with republicans saying it would be wrong to write off 
one party and get in bed with the other not knowing whats in that 
bed you might get bit 
to emphasize his point the governor cited president bushs veto 
of civil rights legislation 
democratic concern about creation of a black district in 
virginia is based on the fact that its likeliest location would 
strip blacks from the districts of reps norman sisisky lewis 
payne and owen pickett all democrats 
goldman referred to all three as good democrats who have 
worked hard for the party and added that as party chairman he 
would take a hard look at any lines that are drawn that would 
affect them or make it harder for them to get elected 
civil rights leaders contend that legally the democrats have no 
choice 
basing his view on a supreme court decision frank r parker 
director of the voting rights project of the lawyers committee 
said if there is racially polarized voting and 
minoritypreferred candidates regularly are defeated the failure 
to create a majority blac where one can be created is a violation 
of section two of the voting rights act 
parker acknowledged there is considerable disagreement over what 
constitutes a majority black district 
for example in alabama sanders said it would be possible to 
create two districts in which 55 percent of the population would be 
black 
but in neither case would a majority of the voters be black and 
neither of them would be truly winnable in terms of a black 
person he said 
i think we have to have one district at least 65 percent 
black he said 
assemblyman david gantt chairman of the new york assembly 
reapportionment committee said he was not prepared at this early 
stage to speculate on the percentage needed for black majority 
district 
there is a varying attitude as to what constitutes a minority 
district whether you try to put 100 percent or 65 percent he 
said im not sure where we will come down on that particular 
issue 
like other black democratic elected officials gantt is wary of 
forming alliances with republicans 
while we may win the battle we may end up losing the war he 
said my understanding is they would like to take every minority 
and put them into one district and they may also end up picking 
up more conservative people in those areas contiguous to that

factory orders for manufactured goods inched 
up 01 percent in september but would have fallen except for the 
added cost of oil products the government said wednesday 
the commerce department report points to a rather fragile 
state of affairs in the manufacturing sector stephen s roach 
senior economist with morgan stanley amp co said 
the department said orders of durable and nond the report said excluding 
petroleum orders were down 11 percent 
orders for durable goods bigticket items expected to last 
more than three years fell 14 percent to 1252 billion after a 
09 percent decline in august it was their third drop in four 
months 
nondurable goods orders which include petroleum products 
advanced 16 percent to 1193 billion in september but excluding 
oil nondurable orders were down 07 percent 
nondurable orders had jumped 47 percent after the aug 2 iraqi 
invasion of kuwait the department also blamed most of that 
increase on petroleum price increases after the invasion disrupted 
the worlds oil supplies 
orders continue to show sluggish behavior in the manufacturing 
sector said evalina tainer senior domestic economist with first 
national bank of chicago on the whole i think were moving 
sideways 
factory orders are a key economic barometer of manufacturing 
industry plans and a decrease may forecaefense capital goods orders a 
barometer of business investment plans turned up 70 percent to 
384 billion but didnt even offset last months drop of 100 
percent 
defense orders which jumped 120 percent in august after the 
iraqi invasion fell back 67 percent in september to 78 billion 
excluding the defense category orders rose 03 percent 
all major durable categories posted declines except for 
nonelectrical machinery up 62 percent to 227 billion these 
orders thus regained their 52 percent loss a month earlier 
but transportation orders dropped 68 percent to 328 billion 
after a 10 percent gain the previous month a large decline for 
motor vehicles helped offset a 20 percent increase in aircraft 
orders excluding transportation orders rose 12 percent

romanians waited in long lines at 
stores wednesday hoping to stock up the day before a tough 
economic reform package frees prices on basic goods but the wait 
was in vain 
bucharest stores were nearly empty and shoppers who joined 
snaking lines for the few available items were angry and confused 
by the planned changes 
most grumbled about lack of information on the reforms and few 
believed they would yield quick results 
car owners waited up to 10 hours at gas stations despite 
guarantees that gasoline and other energy prices would not 
increase 
economics minister eugen dijmarescu promised that the price 
liberalization thursday would not affect the cost of housing or 
basic foodstuffs but he did not specify which prices would be 
raised or by how much adding to the confusion 
such information was available but apparently only on request 
commerce ministry official gheorghe oana told a reporter that 
prices of milk bread sugar meats and other staples would not 
rise before jan 1 
but some food prices were to rise thursday with a kilogram 22 
pounds of carrots going from four lei about 11 cents to 10 lei 
for example he said 
on request the commerce ministry provided figures reflecting a 
doubling of prices thursday for clothes public transport and 
furniture among other items footwear and leather goods were to 
triple and postal and phone rates to rise by about 70 percent 
but most romanians had no access to such information 
im upset we are being kept in the dark for so long one 
bucharest man said this is not at all what we were led to expect 
in the election campaign 
the national salvation front which took power in the december 
revolution that ousted communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
promised slow reforms and social protection but after the front 
won overwhelmingly in may elections premier petre roman sped up 
reform 
in july legislation was passed on selling failing stateowned 
industries last month the government slashed their credits and 
energy subsidies 
in addition to the price reforms the national currency was to 
be devalued thursday by more than 50 percent to encourage exports 
the rate will be 35 lei to the dollar 
with the reforms already in place nibbling away on earnings and 
wage increases still only a promise some romanians feared the 
worst 
all i know is that life is no longer affordable ioana 
ionescu a cook told a reporter 
another woman working in bucharests only laundromat said she 
makes 2300 lei a month and the average wash now costs a fifth of 
that 
she charged that government arguments that prices must go up to 
reflect market realities is merely a coverup a view at least 
partially shared by some experts 
in the short term companies are continuing the old habit of 
raising prices to cover inefficient production and losses said 
stefan boboc of bucharests economic studies academy 
but potential public rage over price hikes is likely to be muted 
because many goods available on paper at low official prices have 
in fact been lacking for years except for a much higher price on 
the black market 
in an interview finance ministry price director constantin 
prigoreanu blamed both corruption and low production for the 
scarcities 
production has dropped by more than 20 percent this year for a 
variety of reasons that probably include less fear at the workplace 
than under ceausescu also many store managers have been selling 
under the counter for bribes 
they are widely suspected of withholding goods until the new 
prices come into effect 
the government believes real market prices will kill the black 
market and turn the economy around 
but the countrys emerging unions charge the reforms will only 
harm consumers and not improve the economy unless corrupt managers 
who survived the communist downfall are ousted 
viorel marcu president of the bucharest chapter of the drivers 
union said there was a thin layer of committed reformers at the 
top 
but under it rests a very thick layer of red and these are 
the people who we have to deal with he said

minnesotas conservative republican 
party shelved its reservations about arne carlson and backed him 
for governor in place of jon grunseth who quit the race because of 
sexual misconduct allegations 
but the partys 14member executive committee tuesday left the 
question of carlsons running mate to the minnesota supreme court 
carlson wants joanell dyrstad his running mate in the september 
primary but sharon clark who was grunseths running mate has 
refused to step aside 
clark today filed a petition with the minnesota supreme court 
seeking a hearing to determine whether she has the right to the 
second spot on the ticket or whether carlson can make his own 
choice 
what if a governor and lieutenant governor were running 
together and the lieutenant governor decided to step down does 
that mean the governor candidate has to step down also clark 
said tuesday 
with only a week to go before tuesdays election the gop 
executive committee voted unanimously to unite behind carlson even 
though many consider the state auditor too liberal said party bob 
weinholzer carlson supports abortion rights 
we encourage all republicans to support arne carlson 
weinholzer said 
under the law carlson as runnerup in the primary would have 
become the gop candidate anyway after grunseth withdrew amid 
allegations he had an affair and swam nude with teenage girls 
grunseth has disputed the allegations 
carlson who had jumped into the race last week as a writein 
candidate as pressure mounted on grunseth to drop out faces 
threeterm democratic gov rudy perpich 
weinholzer said the party had no choice but to let the supreme 
court decide on carlsons running mate 
we have said that arne carlson is our candidate for governor 
we are supporting him weinholzer said he has picked his 
lieutenant governor the court may decide to overturn it that is 
out of our hands

mechanical glitches are plaguing a trial 
run of the armys chemical weapons incinerator on this pacific 
island but officials expect to finish destroying deadly stockpiles 
on schedule 
its been a rough first few months for the johnston atoll 
chemical agent disposal system the first of nine incinerators 
planned to rid the united states of its aging chemical weapons 
the hightech incinerator criticized by pacific island leaders 
and environmental groups has operated just 22 percent of the time 
since testing began in june officials said 
the army conducted the first media tour of the island and the 
incinerator plant tuesday about 70 reporters and photographers 
were given a tour 
the 240 million plant was built to destroy 300000 aging 
chemical weapons moved here from okinawa in 1971 and 100000 rounds 
en route from germany 66 percent of the us stockpile at this 
flat windswept island 800 miles southwest of honolulu 
about 1300 people civilian contract workers at the plant and 
military members live on the island which has no indigenous 
population 
the environmental protection agency will decide whether to allow 
the army to destroy more weapons after the test period is completed 
late next year the operation is expected to wind up by 1995 
charles baronian deputy program manager for the plant said 
officials had hoped to have the plant working 70 percent of the 
time during a 16month test although the glitches wont doom the 
program baronian called them very depressing for an engineer 
its not unusual for a brand new plant to have these kinds of 
problems baronian said however were seeing more of these 
types of problems than frankly we anticipated 
the main problem baronian said is debris jamming a conveyor 
that carries away nerve gas rocket parts after incineration any 
breakdown in the system shuts down the entire plant 
the glitches do not release any nerve gas and do not endanger 
plant employees still baronian said plant managers would rather 
err on the side of caution and shut down for any problem no matter 
how minor 
the army will use what it learns from this plant at eight 
planned mainland incinerators that are to destroy all aging weapons 
by 1997 as required by congress 
those plant sites are umatilla ore tooele utah pueblo 
colo newport ind aberdeen md anniston ala lexington 
ky and pine bluff ark the army decided the safest plan was to 
build incinerators where the weapons are stored 
besides the breakdowns the project has suffered from a public 
relations problem some pacific leaders openly worry the plant may 
be used to incinerate hazardous waste and chemical munitions from 
mainland storage sites 
the south pacific forum an organization of regional 
governments claims the use of johnston atoll could make the region 
the toxic waste disposal center of the world 
president bush addressed those concerns saturday when he met in 
honolulu with leaders of 11 pacific nations bush told them the 
united states is following strict environmental guidelines and will 
use the plant only on weapons already on johnston island and those 
from europe a small cache of world war iiera weapons also will be 
brought from the solomon islands 
brig gen walter l busbee program manager for chemical 
demilitarization said johnston would be out of the chemical 
weapons business when incineration winds up in 1994 
he said the plant would be unable to operate safely beyond 1994 
without extensive renovation and would not have the capacity to 
handle weapons from other sites he also cited the prohibitive 
costs of operating such a large complex at such a remote location 
the plant was running during tuesdays twohour tour and 
destroyed 79 m55 nerve gas rockets before reporters left the 
island the plant has destroyed about 3500 rockets since june

iraqi troops are looting abandoned 
embassies in kuwait and some asian workers trapped in the country 
have died of starvation an escaped kuwaiti businessman said 
wednesday 
the businessman who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
un blockade against iraq would fail because jordanian trucks are 
bringing in fresh vegetables and in any case the iraqis are used 
to hardship 
he said he escaped in an eightcar convoy which took two days to 
cover a 30mile trip his claims could not be independently 
verified but other escapees have described similar conditions 
at a news conference he painted a picture of a looted and 
frightened kuwait with almost no food available 
asians were the number one casualties of starvation he 
said ive seen with my own eyes some of these laborers digging 
garbage and looking for food 
thousands of asians were kept in a compound without food and 
water for 10 days after the aug 2 invasion and nobody knows how 
many died he said 
my company had a thousand asian workers the first few days 
they were surrounded and not allowed to go to their camp or any 
place many of them were sick and god knows how many were dead not 
by bullet or anything but by starvation he said 
all the hospitals are functioning only for emergency and what 
the doctor can do with his bare hands theres no medicine 
nothing he said 
the iraqi army is digging in and camping in schools anyone 
caught with more than a weeks supply of food or harboring a 
foreigner is immediately executed he said 
kuwaitis are being pressured to become iraqi citizens and every 
week about 100 iraqi families arrive to move into houses left by 
fleeing kuwaitis 
we are waiting for a big hit he said nobody is believing 
in the peaceful solution 
the iraqi soldiers in kuwait may be tired but they are fiercely 
loyal to saddam hussein they are used to living on meals of dry 
bread tea and perhaps some cheese if they are good he said 
theyve been living on that for the past eight years he 
said referring to the 198088 iraniraq war do you expect the 
blockade is going to work on them 
jordanian trucks are all over kuwait he said i saw them 
bringing vegetables and taking furniture and computers and hitech 
stuff back 
he also said iraqi soldiers had stripped a years supply of food 
from kuwaiti warehouses and that he had watched abandoned 
embassies being looted 
for every embassy he saddam surrounded after they leave he 
takes every possession inside the embassy he said 
after annexing kuwait saddam ordered diplomats to move to 
baghdad then he cut water and electricity supplies and refused to 
let any food into the diplomatic compounds only the united states 
and britain still have diplomats in kuwait city 
the businessman said that many kuwaitis who have held out since 
the invasion now want to leave as saddam increases pressure on them 
to become iraqi citizens 
saddam has cut gasoline supplies to any car with kuwaiti license 
plates to be able to get gasoline you had to change your tag 
from kuwaiti to iraqkuwait you have to have iraqi citizenship 
the businessman said 
and if you change it that means you have to be drafted he 
said 
the businessman said the iraqis had looted every piece of 
hightechnology and construction equipment some trucks and 
bulldozers taken by the army got an instant khaki paint job 
the only thing left in the highway patrol department he said 
is the floor and the ceiling 
the iraqis also carted away satellite equipment from the 
department of communications worth about 1 billion he said 
even the light poles are pulled out street signs have been 
pulled out because its big high value its made out of 
aluminum he said 
in the last days he started even collecting scrap metal from 
damaged cars for his defense industry he said 
they put us back 50 years he said its going to take at 
least to my point of view 25 years of building to repair the 
damage that has been done in kuwait

it may be the mother of parliaments but lately 
the house of commons sounds more like the school yard 
having denounced opposition leader neil kinnock last week as a 
cryptocommunist prime minister margaret thatcher is now 
taunting him about his height 
the exchange came on tuesday with mrs thatcher feeling 
combative after another onewoman battle with the other 11 leaders 
of the european community the issue was a single european currency 
and closer political ties mrs thatchers position as she 
summarized it for the house was no no no 
kinnock had disturbed the prime minister by inviting her to 
declare her support for deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe 
who politely disagrees with mrs thatchers opposition to a single 
european currency 
the deputy prime minister is too big a man to need a little 
man like you to stand up for him mrs thatcher barked at the 
5foot9 kinnock 
kinnock attempted a counterpunch dont you appreciate that 
even now your tantrum tactics wont stop the process of change 
he asked mrs thatcher 
kinnock she retorted would have abandoned britains 
sovereignty and its coinage for the sake of being little sir echo 
and saying me too 
mrs thatcher is 4 inches shorter than kinnock but with high 
heels and an imperious manner she somehow looks taller when glaring 
at the labor party leader across the table that divides the 
commons 
on wednesday the newspaper pundits declared mrs thatcher the 
winner 
she prevailed wrote matthew parris of the times by neither 
reason nor persuasion and certainly by no felicity of language it 
was won by selfassurance and by just standing there and 
shouting 
the commons has always been prone to rowdiness 
but its getting worse especially during the twiceweekly 
15minute sessions known as prime ministers question time 
she has lost all inhibition said andy roth an american who 
edits a house of commons inhouse bible parliamentary profiles 
what makes it worse now is the particularly bad relationship 
between thatcher and kinnock he added in an interview 
most of them are brought up on the oxford union debating 
tradition of youre a moron im a genius but quite often they 
have a good relationship outside parliament with these two theres 
nothing its become a bareknuckle fight 
even abuse has its formalities members refer to each other as 
the honorable gentlemen or the honorable lady 
it makes for bizarre combinations 
in an exchange about iraq labor lawmaker andrew faulds urged 
mrs thatcher to try negotiations and then sputtered you 
stupid negative woman 
i seem to hear the stench of appeasement in the air the 
rather nauseating stench of appeasement mrs thatcher replied 
you love war faulds shouted and speaker bernard weatherill 
had had enough 
that is very bad behavior from the honorable gentleman 
weatherill admonished he must not shout in that way 
all around laborites and tories shouted at each other and 
pandemonium raged conservative party chairman kenneth baker sat 
behind mrs thatcher distractedly chewing a rolled up order paper 
in between dutiful supportive smiles 
thats the british parliament the 1000yearold body which as 
mrs thatcher bayed above the tumult has shown the way in war and 
peace 
i believe the traditions and example of this house have gone 
the world over with admiration she said i believe they have 
served not only this country well but served europe well this 
house kept sitting when the lights of europe went out

after menacing the west with sovietled 
military might for more than three decades the warsaw pact 
reportedly will cease to exist as a military alliance next year 
a senior hungarian official said wednesday the sixnation 
alliance would end joint military maneuvers in december and would 
stop operating as a military alliance in june 
thereafter the waraw pact would function only as a political 
forum he added the official who spoke to selected reporters on 
condition of anonymity gave no further details 
the warsaw pact was formed in 1955 in the early years of the 
cold war as a soviet response to the north atlantic treaty 
organization originally comprised of the soviet union albania 
bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany hungary poland and 
romania the alliance was reduced to seven members after albania 
withdrew in 1968 
the pact began to lose cohesion with the start of liberalization 
within the soviet union that led to the advent of democracy in 
east europe last year and a further weakening of the alliance 
which was reduced to six members with the unification of germany 
at nearly completed conventional arms talks with the 16nation 
nato warsaw pact members are basically negotiating as individual 
countries the pact nations often advocate positions closer to 
those of the west than to moscow 
the kremlin is withdrawing its forces from several former 
satellites including hungary which was among the east bloc 
nations that ousted the communist party last year 
col anatoli kirilov deputy commander of the soviet troops in 
hungary said wednesday that all his soldiers would be out of the 
country by june 30 1991 as scheduled under an agreement signed in 
march 
by late october more than half the 50000 soviet troops had 
left the state mti news agency reported 
hungary announced earlier it would leave the military arm of the 
warsaw pact next year unless the military functions ceased last 
week czechoslovak president vaclav havel said the pacts military 
structure would be abolished and turned into a body with a 
consultative political function the czechoslovak state news

seven years after new york theatrical 
producer roy radin was shot to death in the midst of a movie deal 
the lights went up today on the cotton club case a tale of 
drugs and greed in 1980s hollywood 
deputy district attorney david conn opened the trial by telling 
the jury he would prove that three men on trial killed radin on the 
orders of reputed miami cocaine dealer and chief defendant karen 
delayne laney greenberger 
the trial is expected to explore deal making in hollywood its 
ties to the cocaine trade and how hustler magazine publisher larry 
flynts private militia got involved 
the prosecutor alleged that mrs greenberger 43 ordered the 
killing because she was being cut out of profits from the cotton 
club movie deal she had helped organize between radin and 
producer robert evans 
each of the defendants were involved in a conspiracy to kidnap 
and kill roy radin conn said and each defendant did it for 
one purpose only for financial gain and for their own personal 
greed 
on trial are mrs greenberger and three former bodyguards for 
flynt all four defendants could face the death penalty 
the jury was told how radin was taken to a remote canyon and 
shot at least 10 times in the head conn said a stick of dynamite 
was then placed in radins mouth and ignited to destroy his face 
and prevent identification 
prosecutors contend greenbergers feeling that she was being 
pushed out of any profits from the movie deal and a dispute over

president bush declared wednesday i have had 
it with iraqs mistreatment of american hostages but said the 
united states has not moved closer to war 
he also said he was willing to wait longer for economic 
sanctions to hurt iraqi president saddam hussein 
bush expressed disappointment that the sanctions have not had 
more impact on saddam i know some of our partners thought that 
the economic pressure by now would have come close to compelling 
him to withdraw he said ive not had a view on that 
the president also voiced unhappiness that representative of 
other countries are traveling to baghdad to deal with saddam on 
hostages and the gulf crisis 
every time somebody sends an emissary that gives saddam 
hussein a little bit of hope that there might be some way that he 
can stop short of doing what he must do get out of kuwait 
unconditionally free these people that are being held against 
their will and have the legitimate government restored bush 
said 
the president did not single out any country but officials from 
the soviet union france and britain have visited iraq recently 
the president used two news conferences and a political speech 
to turn up the verbal heat on iraq it was the third consecutive 
day of blistering attack by bush against saddam 
bush heatedly rejected suggestions that he was trying to divert 
attention from the budget debacle that sent his poll ratings into a 
nose dive just before important congressional elections 
i dont think any decent honorable person would ever suggest 
anything of that nature bush said adding that he was offended 
by the suggestion 
with 250000 american troops poised for conflict in the gulf 
congress is pressing bush to allow more time for sanctions to work 
administration officials said bushs saberrattling was intended 
to signal saddam that the united states is not bluffing and to call 
attention to the plight of american hostages 
in particular bush deplored the conditions endured by american 
diplomats in kuwait where iraqi forces have cut off water power 
and food to the us embassy 
our people inside are being starved by a brutal dictator 
bush said and do you think im concerned about it youre darn 
right i am 
and what am i going to do about it lets just wait and see 
because i have had it with that kind of treatment of americans 
bush said he did not know how long the diplomats could hold out 
before they might be forced to withdraw he said that if iraq 
blocked a resupply effort it would be directly contravening a 
mandate from the united nations and we would view that very 
seriously 
speaking about the un sanctions bush said they had not been 
totally effective 
he said i am prepared at this juncture to wait to see if 
economic sanctions will work at this juncture 
bush said he did not know how long he would wait theres no 
date of that nature in mind he said 
the state department said there were some signs of real 
shortages in iraq in industrial goods raw materials machinery 
and other products the embargo on oil exports is costing baghdad 
25 billion a month based on a 31 a barrel price said 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
no one can say at this point how rapidly these shortages will 
translate into meaningful decisions particularly since saddam 
hussein has made clear this his army will be the last to be touched 
by shortages and that he does not care how much the people of iraq 
may suffer to protect that army she said 
she cited press reports that american hostages were being 
singled out for particularly harsh treatment we understand that 
conditions are appalling in some detention facilities 
miss tutwiler quoted returning western hostages as saying that 
miles hoffman an american who was shot while trying to evade 
capture by iraqi forces was in deteriorating condition and in 
serious need of medical care 
she said iraq has ignored us demands for the immediate 
evacuation of all americans particularly the sick detainees 
with medical needs like mr hoffman have become the victims of 
saddam husseins barbaric guest policy she said 
at a separate news conference iraqs ambassador mohamed 
almashat indicated iraq will not allow supplies to be shipped to 
the embassy in kuwait we have said time and time again there is 
no reason for those embassies to be there almashat said only 
the british and the americans have kept their embassies open in 
kuwait city 
bush said his tough comments are not intended as a rationale for 
military action 
you dont use pretext when you have force deployed you 
dont need any pretext you just do whats right i am concerned 
about the lives of americans held against their will 
in another development bush met at the white house with vatican 
secretary of state cardinal agostino casaroli 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush expressed 
appreciation for the vaticans support for the un sanctions 
both leaders expressed the hope that a peaceful resolution to 
the current crisis could be found fitzwater said

rival shiite moslem factions agreed to 
begin a ceasefire wednesday and withdraw forces but past truces 
quickly collapsed and some officials wonder how much control the 
warlords are willing to relinquish 
police reported the ceasefire between the proiranian 
hezbollah or party of god and the syrianbacked amal movement 
began at midnight their threeyear battle has killed at least 
1100 since june 1987 police estimate 
a joint communique indicated they expect further meetings to 
discuss a possible prisoner exchange pending a comprehensive and 
final settlement under the auspices of syria and iran 
the moslem voice of the nation radio said iranian foreign 
minister ali akbar velayati was due in the syrian capital of 
damascus this week to work on an agreement putting an end to the 
amalhezbollah dispute 
the pact bolstered president elias hrawis efforts to implement 
an arab leaguebrokered peace plan to end lebanons 15yearold 
civil war which has claimed more than 150000 lives 
the government said efforts to demilitarize beirut and 
surrounding hills is progressing quickly 
there have been dozens of failed ceasefires in the feud for 
control of lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys largest 
sect 
the present ceasefire was called after meetings between senior 
leaders of the two factions the talks in anjar east of beirut 
were attended by brig gen ghazi kenaan syrias military 
intelligence chief in lebanon and irans ambassador to syria 
mohammad akhtari 
hezbollah which is blamed for many terrorist attacks is 
considered to be the umbrella organization for extremist groups 
holding foreign hostages in lebanon including six americans 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said fighters of both factions still hold their 
positions in south lebanon where some of the worst clashes took 
place 
we dont expect them to withdraw unless syria and iran succeed 
in working out a political settlement to the conflict the 
spokesman said 
hezbollah and amal say they will withdraw fighters from a 
15mile coastal strip that includes beirut 
agriculture minister mohsen dalloul announced earlier wednesday 
that the rightwing christian lebanese forces militia led by samir 
geagea also agreed to withdraw from the warbattered capital 
the other main militia the druse moslem progressive socialist 
party led by walid jumblatt has also consented to pull out of the 
city 
we break the good news to the lebanese people who are longing 
for peace dalloul announced after a fivehour meeting with 
geagea and defense minister albert mansour 
dalloul a shiite and defense minister albert mansour a greek 
orthodox catholic have been assigned by the government to 
negotiate the militia withdrawal 
the government has not yet set a deadline for the withdrawal 
but hrawi is expected to press for it as soon as possible 
hrawi announced the plan after the syrian army and lebanese 
troops crushed rebel christian gen michel aouns forces in an 
eighthour offensive oct 13 
morethan 500 people including about 200 syrian soldiers were 
killed and 1200 wounded 
the collapse of aoun who fled to refuge in the french embassy 
removed a major obstacle to the peace plan hrawi was elected last 
november to implement 
aoun opposed the accord because it did not guarantee a complete 
withdrawal by syrias 40000 troops in lebanon who he considered 
an army of occupation aoun and hrawi are maronite catholics who 
have dominated lebaneses politics since the nations independence 
from france in 1943 
the syrians have said they will pull out of beirut and other 
cities to the bekaa valley in eastern lebanon within six months of 
the plan being implemented 
but many believe other rival commanders fear making the first 
move to withdraw and leave their forces exposed to attack 
geagea for instance faces threats from syrianbacked 
christians 
jumblatt whose 200000member druse sect if one of the smallest 
in lebanon has been critical of hrawis government and has vowed 
to keep government authority from extending to his stronghold in 
the chouf mountains southeast of beirut

president corazon aquino once counted 
the press as an ally in her fight against the late ferdinand 
marcos now she feels like a victim of journalistic 
oppression 
she told members of the foreign correspondents association of 
the philippines on tuesday that her administrations greatest 
political contribution was the restoration of democracy notably 
press freedom after nearly two decades of authoritarian rule 
in that fight of course we had the help of a host of local 
and foreign newsmen mrs aquino said yet when the dust of 
battle settled one realized almost immediately that the press was 
never really a combatant never truly an ally that it was on the 
front lines only as observer 
the press she said is not only an inconstant ally it is 
also not a proper one and is an impractical one not only is it 
contentious it is at its best critical of organized 
government of history of humanity itself 
mrs aquino was thrust into politics and into the antimarcos 
movement after her husband the former sen benigno aquino was 
murdered in august 1983 on his return from exile to lead the 
opposition 
the local and the foreign press portrayed mrs aquino as a 
grieving widow a simple housewife who was a reluctant challenger 
to marcos and later as a champion of democracy after a people 
power revolution in february 1986 swept her to power 
in the aftermath of the revolt newspapers mushroomed and a 
dozen talk shows competed for television and radio air time 
meanwhile an army of reporters and photographers hounded mrs 
aquino wherever she went 
in the beginning the presidential palace tolerated the 
familiarity of the press towards mrs aquino the president 
sometimes addressed by her nickname cory fielded questions during 
what reporters call ambush or curbside interviews 
but after a series of coup attempts involving marcos loyalist 
officers and later military reformists who plotted the overthrow of 
the late president security was tightened and such interviewa were 
not allowed 
the move was understood but with resentment among some 
reporters and columnists who felt presidential aides were taking 
the first steps in throwing a cordon sanitaire that deprived 
mrs aquino of feeling the real pulse of the people 
then numerous government scandals broke out dominating the 
headlines and talk shows slowly the criticism hurled at cabinet 
and other government officials was reaching mrs aquino herself 
some of mrs aquinos bitterest critics in the local press were 
among those who had marched with her in antimarcos demonstrations 
a common theme of their attacks is that her government lacks 
direction and is just as corrupt as that of marcos 
mrs aquino has often complained that the press today does not 
report on the achievements of her government and the effort it is 
making to improve the lives of ordinary filipinos 
she says that sometimes officials feel that the country we 
read about is not the philippines but a terrible cursed land in an 
outlandish world created by the imagination of reporters and 
columnists 
but mrs aquino has not indicated she is sorry she fought to 
restore press freedom 
nevertheless she said the sometimes abusive and 
sometimes licentious press that we sometimes have is preferable to 
a controlled press that reflects only one side of the news 
she said that there has been no indication of media repression 
in fact she said the reverse could be true and the harassed 
government could be the one feeling a bit of journalistic 
oppression

americans consumer spending jumped 11 
percent in september the government said wednesday outpacing a 
05 percent growth in personal income and contributing to the 
lowest savings rate in three years 
the commerce department report shows consumer purchasing power 
obviously is under intense pressure in the aftermath of the 
persian gulf oil shock said stephen s roach senior economist 
with morgan stanley amp co 
nevertheless roach added consumers are really sort of 
clinging tenaciously to their lifestyles their spending is holding 
up just fine 
however the federal reserve reported separately on wednesday 
that consumers and businesses confidence in the eonomy was 
waning in many regions of the country every one of the central 
banks 12 districts was reporting either slower growth or an actual 
decline in economic activity 
most districts reported that retailers were generally 
pessimistic they blamed lower consumer confidence brought on 
by greater uncertainty and higher fuel prices said the federal 
reserves report based on information collected through oct 19 
the commerce department said that americans incomes reached a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 470 trillion in september a 
238 billion increase over august 
at the same time it said spending reached a rate of 373 
trillion up 399 billion from a month earlier it was the biggest 
increase since a 12 percent gain last june 
in its report on the thirdquarter gross national product on 
tuesday the department had said consumer spending from july 
through september rose 36 percent well above the 02 percent 
advance from april through june 
but roach said spending will drop to the 1 percent vicinity 
during the current quarter 
theres no way well be able to hold the 36 percent pace up 
in the weak income and low savings environment he said 
consumer spending represents about twothirds of us economic 
activity and roach said the lower level of consumption this quarter 
means a temporary decline in overall economic growth 
but he said his company was not projecting two consecutive 
quarters of declining gross national product the total output of 
the nations goods and services 
the commerce report said the rate of americans savings as a 
percent of disposable income fell to 35 percent down from 41 
percent in august and the lowest since a 33 percent rate in 
october 1987 
the report said americans income after taxes increased 04 
percent up from a 02 percent gain in august 
the spending and income figures were not adjusted for inflation 
when adjusted spending rose 03 percent after declining 01 
percent in august disposable or aftertax income fell 03 
percent on top of a 05 percent drop the previous month 
a key component of the income category wages and salaries 
rose 174 billion up from 600 million the previous month 
the 399 billion increase in personal consumption which 
includes everything except interest payments on debt was up from a 
201 billion gain in august 
spending on durable goods bigticket items expected to 
last more than three years totaled 487 billion up from 477 
billion from august 
nondurable spending rose 11 billion to 12 trillion following 
a 106 billion gain in august spending on services was up 182 
billion to 20 trillion after a 182 billion gain the previous 
month

areas where dozens of people die each day of starvation relief 
workers said wednesday

singhs attempts to block construction of a hindu temple on the 
disputed site deepening the crisis in his beleaguered coalition

a lawyer for a georgia death row inmate on 
wednesday accused the state of using an illegally obtained 
jailhouse confession to convict his client and hiding this 
information from defense lawyers 
john boger arguing before the supreme court in behalf of warren 
mccleskey said the state for nine years withheld from defense 
lawyers a written statement from the inmate to whom mccleskey 
allegedly confessed o the 1978 slaying of an atlanta police 
officer in a furniture store robbery 
the reason it was held back is clear boger said it was 
the smoking gun 
but assistant georgia attorney general mary beth westmoreland 
denied that the state withheld the statement or concealed it from 
the defense she said mccleskeys lawyers simply failed to ask for 
it 
the states position is that counsel made a mistake and this 
man shall die because of that mistake is that your position 
justice thurgood marshall asked ms westmoreland 
yes your honor she replied that is our position 
a federal judge last year reversed mccleskeys murder conviction 
after ruling that the state had violated his constitutional rights 
in obtaining the confession to inmate offie evans 
but the 11th us circuit court of appeals reinstated the 
conviction ruling that mccleskeys lawyers had forfeited their 
right to challenge the constitutionality of the confession when 
they failed to raise the issue in his initial appeal in 1981 
boger argued wednesday there was nothing in the written record 
of the case to suggest that a statement from evans existed 
it was finally obtained in 1987 after a georgia supreme court 
ruling that police investigatory files are covered by the states 
open records law 
that statement he said provided defense lawyers with their 
first clue that evans had been coached by atlanta police detectives 
before he was sent into a cell adjacent to mccleskeys to obtain 
incriminating statements 
boger said the statement also led defense lawyers to an atlanta 
prison official who testified that he had witnessed atlanta 
detectives coaching evans before sending him to talk with 
mccleskey 
we should not have our client go to the electric chair because 
we could not ferret through this game of 20 questions the state was 
playing here he said 
boger said the confession was the key evidence in the states 
case against mccleskey he said the only other evidence was the 
testimony of mccleskeys codefendant that mccleskey was the 
triggerman and the conflicting testimony of witnesses who were in 
the furniture store when the police officer was killed 
the key to this case was the confession that offie evans came 
forward and said warren mccleskey gave to him in the jail boger 
said arguing that the appeals court was profoundly wrong to 
conclude that use of an illegally obtained confession was 
harmless error 
the appeal marked the second time the justices have reviewed 
mccleskeys death sentence in a landmark 54 ruling in 1987 the 
court held that state death penalty laws cannot be challenged on 
constitutional grounds even if statistics indicate the laws are 
being applied in racially biased ways 
mccleskeys argument in that appeal was based on an exhaustive 
statistical study showing that killers of whites in georgia draw 
the death penalty far more often than do killers of blacks

former national security adviser john m 
poindexter testified wednesday before the special federal grand 
jury that is continuing the investigation of the irancontra 
affair 
poindexter who is appealing his sixmonth sentence for lying to 
congress and obstructing lawmakers inquiries about the sale of 
us arms to iran and covert military aid to nicaraguan rebels was 
questioned behind closed doors by prosecutors for independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh 
it was poindexters second appearance before the grand jury 
which is known to be investigating whether other former reagan 
administration officials obstructed efforts by congress to learn 
about the irancontra affair 
poindexter who served as president reagans national security 
adviser from late 1985 until the irancontra scandal unraveled in 
late 1986 declined to comment about his testimony 
former white house aide oliver l north whose three felony 
convictions stemming from his involvement in the irancontra affair 
were set aside in july has testified on several occasions before 
the same grand jury 
the grand jury has not met since last summer 
walsh has said he will try to conclude his investigation by next 
spring but his timetable may be delayed by a dispute with the bush 
administration 
the dispute involves walshs request for documents from the 
office of bush when he served as vice president in the reagan 
administration according to sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
among other things walsh is seeking documents to determine what 
knowledge former bush aide donald gregg had of the covert 
operations to arm the nicaraguan rebels 
gregg now us ambassador to south korea has denied knowing 
about norths involvement in the contra resupply operation until an 
aug 1986 meeting with felix rodriguez a former cia agent who was 
a friend of gregg 
before that meeting gregg said he had only general knowledge 
that north was involved in helping private citizens give 
humanitarian assistance to the rebels 
rodriguez told lawmakers that he sought the meeting with gregg 
and his assistant samuel j watson iii to express concerns about 
corruption within the covert arms operation 
prosecutors are also trying to determine what knowledge if any 
bush may have had of the contra resupply operation 
a briefing memo for the vice presidents may 1986 meeting with 
rodriguez mentioned that the session was being held to discuss 
resupply of the contras 
gregg told congress that contra resupply was not discussed 
during the may 1986 meeting with bush and said he didnt know why 
the reference was included in the briefing memo

rodriguez because we had never discussed the contras

mayor marion barry took a new slap at the 
judge who sentenced him to jail wednesday and suggested his own 
status as a recovering addict could be a benefit if he wins 
election to the city council 
one thing ive learned about recovering from substance abuse 
is that you have to do something meaningful something that makes 
you feel good barry said during a taping of the phil donahue 
show im sharper now and more prepared to do this job than i was 
two or three years ago 
barry who announced near the start of his drug and perjury 
trial that he would not seek a fourth term as mayor is one of 
eight candidates competing for two citywide council seats in next 
tuesdays election he has admitted being addicted to two 
prescription drugs and in recent weeks he has also acknowledged 
being an occasional user of cocaine 
in his remarks on the donahue show the mayor had harsh words 
for us district court judge thomas penfield jackson who 
sentenced barry to six months in prison last week on tuesday 
jackson himself criticized the jurors in barrys case during a 
lecture at harvard law school tuesday 
if i had taken from the payroll illegally then i should have 
been held to that higher standard barry said referring to a 
standard that jackson said during sentencing that the mayor had 
failed to meet 
i believe i should have gotten community service barry said 
when asked how he felt knowing that jackson had sentenced former 
reagan administration aide michael deaver to work release after 
deavers 1988 perjury conviction what we here in washington 
dont like is the unfairness 
a studio audience packed with barry supporters burst into cheers 
at that remark in recent weeks barry has suggested that he has 
been a victim of racial injustice at the hands of the judicial 
system 
jackson for his part said in his law school lecture that he 
was not happy with the way the jury addressed the case 
some people on the jury had their own agendas they would not 
convict under any circumstances the judge said at the forum 
we did our duty and that is the only comment i am willing to 
make juror johnnie mae hardeman said wednesday when asked about 
jacksons remarks 
the judge hinted at his displeasure with the panel when he 
discharged them at the conclusion of barrys trial 
some of you endeavored to do your best and the court is 
appreciative of that jackson said sternly after the jury 
convicted barry of a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge 
acquitted him of another and deadlocked on a dozen remaining 
charges 
barry spoke on the syndicated television show only on the 
condition that the fbi videotape showing him smoking crack cocaine 
on the night of his january arrest not be shown

mayor tom fink apparently won his bid 
for reelection by a little more than 1000 votes but city 
officials worked wednesday to examine 3400 challenged or absentee 
ballots 
with all precincts counted fink edged democratic challenger 
rick mystrom by 30338 to 29245 votes in tuesdays runoff 
mystrom did not concede 
the public deserves a recount if its real close he said 
the odds are probably against us but this game is not over by any 
means 
the city has two weeks to finish examining the challenged 
ballots those cast by voters at polling places outside their own 
precincts 
city clerk ruby veldkamp said the margin was comfortable by 
anchorage election standards 
we consider 100 votes a landslide she said noting that 
fink beat mystrom by just 29 votes in the oct 2 threeway race 
that included former state legislator ha red boucher and 
forced the runoff 
more than 48 percent of registered voters went to the polls 
finks apparent victory was a turnaround for the republican 
politician who was rated negatively by 50 percent or more of 
anchorage residents according to polls six months ago 
they said fink was out of step with the public fink said of 
his adversaries on the anchorage assembly well the public said 
no finks not out of step you are 
mystrom 46 is a former city assemblyman and former advertising 
executive who led the citys unsuccessful winter olympics bid 
fink 62 is an anchorage insurance executive whose first 
mayoral term found him variously at odds with the municipal 
assembly reporters and unions representing city workers

campaign literature for senate candidate paul wellstone and gov 
rudy perpich 
other than supplying some literature we had no real 
involvement in it said perpich campaign manager john stanoch

deputy police chief david dobrotka said the vice lords gang has 
been linked to street violence and drug trafficking 
gary sudduth vice president of the minneapolis urban league 
said the gang members have the right to distribute literature 
because they are voters

crews worked on the final steps of 
restoring power wednesday to hatteras island cut off from the

we expect to be off the generators by thursday morning said

drove a dredge through the bridge across the inlet last week 
today we are trying to stabilize these cables get them in 
conduit and splice the cable that has been installed slade

among those with problems from the storm itself is daniel

of water into his store he said the water damage and business 
losses from the bridge cut could amount to as much as 100000 
getting full power back will help willis said 
we sell lp liquified propane gas and our auxiliary power is 
so low it doesnt have the voltage to pump lp gas willis said 
weve got close to 100 people that need gas and weve got a

snowstorm last december ms browning said 
this time grocery stores got supplies immediately and fuel 
companies are already here the first couple of days were real 
shaky but after that bottleneck of people trying to leave was 
cleared up they started letting supply trucks in she said

higher oil prices resulting from the mideast 
crisis are driving up farm operating expenses at the fastest pace 
in eight years an agriculture department report said wednesday 
new quarterly figures through october showed farm expenses 
jumped an average of 22 percent from july when such figures were 
last available the expense index was up 56 percent from october 
1989 
a sharp rise in fuel prices since july contributed most to the 
largest quarterly index increase since january 1982 the report 
said 
meanwhile the monthly report by the departments agricultural 
statistics board said that prices farmers get for raw products 
declined 07 percent from september to october but still averaged 
14 percent more than a year ago 
decreases in the prices of broilers milk corn and apples 
were partially offset by higher prices for hogs tomatoes 
strawberries and eggs the board said in its preliminary report 
prices of most food and feed grains were down from september 
although higher prices were reported for oats rice and durum 
wheat soybean and sunflower prices declined while peanut prices 
increased 
the october allhog price increased moderately over september 
while the allcattle price was up slightly the report said 
prices of steers and heifers sold as beef were at a record high 
for october the report said but broiler prices dropped sharply 
from september partly due to large supplies and weaker seasonal 
demand 
department economists say consumer food prices will rise an 
average of 5 percent to 7 percent this year compared with a 58 
percent gain in 1989 the most since 1981 there has been no 
official forecast for 1991 
the net cash income of farmers in 1990 has been forecast at a 
record in the range of 59 billion to 63 billion up about 10 
percent from last year the previous high was 572 billion in 
1988 
net cash income is the amount nationally that farmers have left 
from gross cash income in a calendar year after deducting cash 
expenses it includes government payments and proceeds from crops 
grown previously but sold during the year 
in another method of agency accounting which includes changes 
in inventories depreciation and other allowances during the year 
1990 net farm income may be in the range of 47 billion to 52 
billion compared with 47 billion last year 
based on preliminary figures that could be revised next month 
the october price index for all crops was down 16 percent from 
september and averaged 47 percent less than a year earlier 
the october index for livestock and products was down 12 
percent from september but still averaged 56 percent more than in 
october 1989 
milk prices reflecting steppedup production dropped 60 cents 
from september to an october average of 1360 per 100 pounds the 
october price was down 120 from a year earlier 
the allfruit price index in october was down 64 percent from 
september and 87 percent the october 1989 average lower prices 
for apples oranges and grapefruit were mostly responsible for the 
decline from september 
the report said 
cattle averaged 7510 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally up 10 cents from september a year earlier cattle 
averaged 6870 per hundredweight those are averages for all types 
of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 5690 per hundredweight up from 5430 in 
september and 4660 a year earlier 
corn at 215 per bushel was down from 232 in september and 
222 a year earlier

iraqi officials are growing more concerned 
about a possible war and are taking measures to defend the country 
iraqs ambassador said wednesday 
we seek to avoid bloodshed we once more call for a 
negotiated solution to have a political and diplomatic solution 
ambassador mohamed almashat said at a news conference 
but almashat said the tough rhetoic of president bush and 
secretary of state james a baker iii over the past few days 
heightened the possibility of war 
certainly we are more concerned he said we are taking 
precautionary measures to defend our country 
should war break out almashat said this is going to be a 
bloody conflict 
almashats comments came the day after iraqi president saddam 
hussein ordered military commanders to prepare for urban 
warfare in kuwait according to the official iraq news agency 
on wednesday bush declared i have had it with the 
treatment that americans hostages are receiving in iraq and kuwait 
he said the us embassy in kuwait where several diplomats have 
been holed up since the aug 2 invasion by kuwait is being starved 
out 
bush said however he had no timetable for any possible 
military action to drive iraq from kuwait 
almashat insisted the hostages in iraq are being taken care of 
but he indicated iraq will not allow supplies to be shipped to the 
embassy in kuwait city 
we have said time and time again there is no reason for those 
embassies to be there almashat said only the british and the 
americans have kept their embassies open in kuwait city 
almashat reiterated his governments position that the kuwait 
situation is a arab problem that ought to be decided by the united 
nations in conjunction with resolution of the palestinian conflict 
the purpose of almashats news conference was to release a 
document that iraq says it seized from files at kuwaits internal 
security bureau after the invasion 
it purports to be a memo from the director general of the state 
security department to the kuwaiti interior minister detailing a 
meeting the security chief had with cia director william webster on 
nov 14 1989 
kuwaiti brig fahd ahmad alfahd said he and webster agreed on a 
number of points which he outlined in the document the document 
was written in arabic with an unofficial translation into english 
we agreed with the american side that it was important to take 
advantage of the deteriorating economic situation in iraq in order 
to put pressure on that countrys government to delineate our 
common border the document said 
the cia has said statements contained in the document are 
fabrications but officials said they have no doubt that iraq 
confiscated files inside kuwait after the invasion 
ali alsabah a spokesman for the kuwaiti embassy said the 
document appeared to have been altered nevertheless he said 
obviously a lot of documents were taken by the iraqis when they 
overran the country seizing government buildings and files 
almashat insisted on the documents authenticity 
we have physical evidence of a declaration of war by kuwait 
against iraq almashat said there was a conspiracy by kuwait 
with the cooperation of the united states

college board trustees announced wednesday the 
most sweeping changes ever in the scholastic aptitude test but 
rejected suggestions that charges of cultural bias prompted the 
revisions 
the new scholastic aptitude test called sati will be 
introduced in the spring 1994 said college board president donald 
m stewart 
it will include less reliance on multiple choice in the math 
section and more emphasis in the language section on reading 
comprehension 
the revisions aimed in part at reducing students reliance on 
test coaches also will allow students to use calculators on the 
math section stewart said at the boards annual meeting 
critics have long charged that the sat the most widely used 
college entrance exam was biased particularly against women and 
minorities 
nothing could be further from the truth stewart said the 
sat has been in almost continual evolution it has never been set 
in concrete 
the new sat will combine the high academically demanding 
standards of the current tests with revisions that increase their 
educational relevance and quality for all collegebound students 
the old sat had 85 verbal and 60 math questions the sati will 
have 7585 verbal and 5560 math questions 
the changes also include the introduction of satii an 
expansion of the achievement tests currently offered with the sat 
satii will include a written essay section language 
proficiency tests for native speakers of japanese and chinese and 
proficiency tests for nonnative english speakers 
bob schaeffer a spokesman for the group fairtest and coauthor 
of the book standing up to the sat said the changes fail to 
solve the problem of the tests bias 
the new sat amounts to little more than rearranging the deck 
chairs on an educational titanic schaeffer said the sat 
should be optional and it should be comprehensively overhauled to 
address its problems 
fairtest and other critics have claimed that the sat tends to 
cover subjects that white male and affluent testtakers are more 
likely to be familiar with 
oftcited examples in the test include the question dividends 
are to stockholders as with the answer being royalties are 
to writers and the use of words such as regatta and aria 
in the vocabulary section 
whites as a group have outperformed minority students and males 
have fared better than females 
in 1988 the national organization for women filed a lawsuit 
that forced the new york state education department to stop using 
the sat exclusively to award merit scholarships the department now 
uses high school grades as well 
the sat administered by the educational testing service of 
princeton nj was first given to 8040 students in 1926 now 
about 1 million collegebound students take it annually 
the 2hour exam currently consists of two multiplechoice 
sections that test verbal and math skills each section is worth 
800 points for a perfect score of 1600 
three years ago the board began field trials of possible sat 
revisions in 1988 the board created a committee of educators to 
evaluate the trials and determine what changes should be 
incorporated 
in september board trustees voted to postpone for a month a 
decision on whether to adopt the changes 
as with the current achievement tests the satii will be an 
optional accompaniment to the sati 
changlin tien chancellor of the university of california 
berkeley said the addition of the asian language achievement tests 
reflects the increasing importance of the pacific rim and 
recognizes the increasing desire among students to study these 
languages 
the satii revisions will be phased in beginning next year

an israeli soldier was sentenced wednesday to 
two months in prison for participating in the beatings of two 
palestinian brothers one of who later died 
three other soldiers were given suspended sentences by the 
military court all four who could have faced a maximum of 20 
years in prison each were demoted in rank 
the soldiers maintained throughout the trial they were only 
following orders from top officers to beat palestinian riot 
suspects the order has since been changed 
also wednesday a spokesman for defense minister moshe arens 
said the minister proposed limiting the number of palestinians 
working in israel the plan would reverse israeli policy begun in 
1967 when israel captured the west bank and the gaza strip 
last month israeli authorities closed off the occupied lands 
for four days following a wave of violence between palestinians and 
jews 
the case of the four soldiers was seen as a test of the armys 
willingness to punish troops convicted of brutality in suppressing 
the 34monthold palestinian uprising 
the threejudge court earlier this month found the defendants 
guilty of the feb 7 1988 gaza strip beating of brothers khaled 
and eyad akkal eyad died hours later at shifa hospital in gaza 
city 
they were charged with aggravated assault because prosecutors 
found no direct connection between the beating and the death 
israel army radio also quoted the judges as saying the 
defendants violated basic norms of an advanced society and 
operated under the distorted concept that everything is justifiable 
for the sake of a military mission 
1st lt ofer reshef was ordered to serve two months in prison 
given a sixmonth suspended sentence and reduced in rank to 
sergeant 
maj yitzak levitt 32 received a threemonth suspended 
sentence and was demoted him to 1st lieutenant the panel said he 
was not directly involved in the beatings but was responsible for 
them 
staff sgt eli shukrun and sgt gad zinbar were each given a 
fivemonth suspended term and reduced in rank to private 
earlier this month the chief army prosecutor ordered an 
investigation of col effie fein who was commander of the 
soldiers unit at the time of the beatings 
in the early months of the uprising officers said they were 
ordered to beat people caught rioting but not strike those in 
custody but many soldiers said the orders were not clear the army 
has since banned beatings as punishment 
arenss proposal to limit the palestinian work force in israel 
was made tuesday before parliaments foreign affairs and defense 
committee said spokesman dan naveh said it would have to be 
approved by the government 
meanwhile israel is under pressure to find jobs for tens of 
thousands of soviet jewish immigrants in a country with an 
unemployment rate above 10 percent 
it is now time to start changing this so israelis will get the 
opportunities in israel and arabs will find jobs in the occupied 
territories said naveh 
the fourday closure of the borders was taken after arabjewish 
street violence left five dead following the oct 8 temple mount 
killings of 20 palestinians it kept about 110000 arabs off from 
their jobs in israel 
a threeman commission appointed by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir to look into the temple mount shootings released its 
findings friday stating that palestinians had caused the violence 
by throwing stones at police and that police were justified in 
using gunfire because their lives were in danger 
the report was criticized by israeli leftwing groups and 
parties as well as by palestinians 
betselem an israeli human rights group said wednesday that

a device capable of detecting the kind of 
plastic explosive that officials say destroyed pan am flight 103 
went into service wednesday at dulles international airport 
james b busey administrator of the federal aviation 
administration said the thermal neutron analysis or tna device 
represents a significant improvement in performance over 
earlier generations of detection technology 
the machine has the capability of detecting the explosives 
that we think were present on pan am 103 the airliner destroyed 
over scotland two years ago busey said 
the dulles detector is the fourth to be installed at 
international airports in an faa program to test capabilities and 
build an enhanced antiterrorist security system at airports 
worldwide 
other tna units are at john f kennedy international airport in 
new york the miami international airport and gatwick airport near 
london 
busey said tentative plans call for similar explosive devices to 
be installed at airports in frankfurt germany and at the 
baltimorewashington airport in maryland 
adaption of the tna device the only technology now believed 
able to detect plastic explosives of the kind that brought down pan 
am 103 coincides with a report from the national academy of 
sciences concluding that the faa is essentially on the right track 
the academy concluded that a combination of the tna automated 
explosives detection system and sophisticated xray screening may 
offer the optimal approach for detection of bulk explosives 
the tna device installed at dulles uses xray screening to 
identify suspect items or areas inside specific pieces of luggage 
the tna machine developed by science applications international 
corp of san diego calif bombards checked luggage with 
lowenergy thermal neutrons and is programmed to detect 
concentrations of nitrogen an element found in explosives 
the dulles unit will be used to screen luggage on united 
airlines international flights it is 40 feet wide and 20 feet 
long weighs 28000 pounds and cost about 1 million 
demonstrating the device for reporters technicians used it to 
detect simulated explosives concealed in a sneaker in a champagne 
bottle and in the false bottom of a suitcase

mayoral candidate and convicted felon 
vincent buddy cianci says he has learned from his mistakes 
it remains for voters to decide whether they forgive him 
cianci was forced to resign as mayor in 1984 after 10 years in 
office when he pleaded no contest to assaulting his estranged 
wifes alleged lover in rhode island such a plea is equivalent to 
a conviction 
when he was mayor 30 people associated with his administration 
were indicted 22 convicted 
his restaurants are in financial trouble and he is behind on his 
taxes 
but now cianci an independent is in a deadheat mayoral race 
with democrat andrew annaldo and independent frederick lippitt 
the current mayor joseph paolino jr who took office after 
cianci resigned did not run for reelection this year instead he 
made an unsuccessful bid for governor in the democratic primary 
providence is the only place where you could see the 
reemergence of someone like buddy said victor profughi a 
political science professor at rhode island college 
a poll of 401 likely voters about two weeks before the nov 6 
election showed cianci was favored by 25 percent lippitt 28 
percent and annaldo 29 percent the wjartv and alpha research 
associates inc poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 
points 
the survey also found the 49yearold cianci had the least 
favorable rating but 50 percent of the surveys respondents liked 
his experience and record 
annaldo 34 is a businessman with eight years on the city 
council 
lippitt 73 a yaleeducated lawyer has racked up a long record 
of public service with 22 years as a republican state 
representative and two years as gov edward d dipretes 
administration director 
in the late days of the campaign issues such as improving the 
citys 42 percent school dropout rate revitalizing neighborhoods 
and fighting crime increasingly have been replaced by personal 
attacks 
at a debate monday annaldo took exception to a lippitt 
commercial that compared him to an old watchdog 
lippitt defended it saying annaldo should have better 
scrutinized city spending when he was with the providence board of 
contract and supply 
cianci accused both opponents of dipping into special pensions 
at taxpayers expense lippitt received a 50000 state pension in 
1987 that he later said he would give to charity while annaldo is 
enrolled in the pension plan of the citys largestmunicipal union 
im getting caught in the crossfire here from the little 
dipper and the big dipper cianci said if i believe either one 
of them one is a cheat the other is a liar the other looks like 
a dog 
cianci has been campaigning on a theme that he never stopped 
caring about providence 
yes i made mistakes but at least i admit them cianci told 
elderly residents at a highrise in the citys italian section 
annaldo has promised to relieve the citys taxpayers by making 
taxexempt universities pay their fair share that issue alone 
is credited with helping him win a tough fourway democratic 
primary 
lippitt is calling for a city tax on meals concerts and 
sporting events 
cianci who backed a midyear tax hike in 1981 opposes new 
taxes 
disclosures by the providence journalbulletin show that cianci 
and his businesses owe 10000 in overdue property taxes and that 
he missed the deadline for filing his state and federal tax returns 
even after receiving a sixmonth extension 
still cianci keeps the pollsters guessing 
with all the negative press about cianci a lot of people are 
ashamed or embarrassed to tell their friends or family never mind 
a pollster that they are going to vote for cianci said tony 
pesaturo president of alpha research theres a lot of closet 
support for cianci how large it is we have no way of knowing

found it under 2 inches of dirt 
his daughter said he found things before but never had a 
chance to return it heath said 
jackowski called annawan high school after he found the ring on 
a chance that someone there might know whose it was 
a teacher in the office when jackowski called knew the hh 
initial on the 1970 class ring must belong to harry heath and

a teenager once accused of supplying cocaine 
that president bush held up during a televised speech received a 
10year sentence wednesday from a judge who said the mandatory 
penalty was too harsh 
us district judge stanley sporkin suggested to keith jackson 
that he ask bush to exercise clemency to reduce the sentence that 
was mandated by congress for defendants who sell drugs near a 
schoolyard 
he used you in making a big speech on the drug trade 
sporkin said referring to the sept 5 1989 address in which bush 
held up a bag of crack that prosecutors charge jackson had sold to 
an undercover drug agent 
the judge called bush a very decent man adding that maybe 
he can find a way to reduce some of that sentence 
the routine drug case of a teenager who had never before been 
arrested became controversial when it was reported that white house 
aides arranged for a drug sale to an undercover drug enforcement 
administration agent so that bush could hold up a bag of crack as a 
prop during the speech 
in two separate trials jurors deadlocked on charges that 
jackson 19 sold crack cocaine to an undercover agent in lafayette 
park near the white house just four days before bushs address 
but he was found guilty during the second trial of selling the 
drug on two separate occasions in july 1989 to undercover agents 
who met him near a high school on capitol hill 
those sales were part of the same undercover operation that led 
to the charges jackson sold drugs near the white house 
i regret that the law compels me to sentence mr jackson to a 
mandatory 10year term sporkin said echoing criticism expressed 
by other federal judges of the mandatory minimum sentences passed 
by congress in recent years for drug offenders 
critics say compulsory minimum sentences contributed to prison 
overcrowding and deprive judges of power to show leniency in 
appropriate cases 
this is a case in which i believe that the mandatory minimum 
benefits neither the defendant nor society sporkin said both 
would be better served by a lower sentence that would enable this 
high school senior a firsttime offender to rehabilitate himself 
and reenter society rather than spending his youth in prison 
while sporkin was required to impose the 10year minimum he 
declined to sentence jackson to a longer term recommended by 
federal sentencing guidelines for drug distribution near schools 
those guidelines would have provided for a sentence between 12 
years and more than 15 years 
sporkin noted that deas intentional selection of the site near 
eastern high school on capitol hill was a mitigating factor in 
departing from the guidelines 
nothing in the trial testimony indicated that the defendant 
would have transacted any business near eastern high school a 
school which he did not attend but for the suggestion of 
government agents sporkin said 
the purpose of the schoolyard statute is to deter drug 
transactions near schools not to encourage the government to set 
up dangerous drug deals near school children sporkin said 
but in this case the government has chosen repeatedly to bring 
drug transactions to locations where they would not otherwise 
occur 
sporkin also noted jacksons youth and the intense media 
coverage his case has received warrant a downward departure the 
judge said 
the defendant has already endured far greater public 
humiliation than most similarly situated drug offenders sporkin 
said

unless the 1991 rainy season is wetter 
than last winter water supplied to california farmers for 
irrigation could be reduced by half to twothirds state and 
federal officials say 
urban water users who rely on state reservoirs could suffer cuts 
of 13 percent if the drought runs into a fifth year officials 
said federal deliveries to municipal customers could drop 25 
percent to 50 percent 
in an annual droughtoutlook conference titled what if 
1991 is dry state federal and local officials said tuesday that 
another critically dry winter could be catastrophic for many 
sectors of californias economy and the environment 
i hope we dont have to experience the what if situation 
said chet bowling drought coordinator for the federal central 
valley project the largest water supplier in california 
a draft report released tuesday by the state department of water 
resources said a fifth drought year would leave california as bad 
off as it was in 1977 the driest year on record 
this year the state water project and the central valley 
project cut farm deliveries by 50 percent and the cvp cut 
municipal supplies by 25 percent to 50 percent depending on each 
citys contract it was only the second time in the history of both 
projects that deliveries were disrupted the first time was 1977 
agriculture suffered an estimated 480 million in 
droughtrelated losses in 1990 
if the drought continues the state water project estimates 
reductions to agriculture of 63 percent while the federal project 
cuts would be about 50 percent 
the state report said san francisco and some other bay area 
cities could be forced to cut water use by half some cities in 
southern california already are curtailing some water uses 
most of californias available water 82 percent according to 
the us geological survey is used for irrigating crops 
california leads the nation in water use at 303 billion gallons a 
day 
agriculture accounts for more than 16 billion of the states 
300billion plus annual economy 
while the drought that began in 1986 is less severe than 
197677 the state report said it poses an unprecedented threat to 
fish and wildlife 
californias population of 30 million people and their needs 
for water and space has combined with the drought to create what is 
truly a natural disaster the report said 
although water authorities acknowledge that it is too early to 
forecast what kind of winter california will have most of the 
states rainfall is recorded in december january and february 
the report said there were some disturbing historical trends 
looking back in history dry years and wet years seem to 
cluster slightly more than would be expected by chance but no one 
so far has been able to develop a predictive model for california 
for next year from these irregular patterns 
storage in californias major reservoirs as of oct 1 was about 
60 percent of average

banking regulators moved wednesday toward 
greatly expanding the requirement that independent appraisers 
assess the value of many homes before buyers receive mortgages 
the federal reserve board by a 51 vote offered for public 
comment a rule change that would require appraisals on all real 
estatebased loans of 50000 or more the current rule adopted in 
june set a 100000 cut off 
but members of congress led by rep doug barnard dga 
complained that the higher limit excluded too many home sales and 
that regulators were ignoring legislators intent in the appraisal 
reforms included in last years savings and loan law 
acording to the national association of realtors 535 percent 
of home sales in september would have required appraisals under a 
100000 cut off while 845 percent would need an appraisal under 
the 50000 limit 
barnard who sponsored the appraisal reforms argued in a letter 
to the federal reserve that faulty appraisals were one of the chief 
factors contributing to the sampl crisis sampls lost huge sums on 
loans secured by property worth much less than appraisals 
indicated 
the 1989 sampl law starting in july 1991 requires banks sampls 
and credit unions with federally insured deposits to use 
statelicensed appraisers before making real estatebased loans 
federal reserve board member martha r seger who voted against 
considering a lower cut off argued that most sampl problems were 
found in commercial real estate loans well over 100000 not in 
the singlefamily home loans which would be affected by a lower cut 
off 
this is an anticonsumer piece of legislation when you get 
right down to it because the cost of these appraisals will be borne 
by the consumer the person who wants to buy the existing home 
she said 
board member wayne d angell voted in favor of seeking comment 
on changing the rule but he said he would probably vote against 
the change 
however the other four board members said they were concerned 
that a 100000 cut off would be out of line with congress intent 
in last years law and they said the feds rule should be 
consistent with other agencies standards 
other financial institution regulators already have adopted the 
50000 cut off they are the office of the comptroller of the 
currency the office of thrift supervision and the federal deposit 
insurance corp

prime minister charles haughey won a vote 
of confidence in parliament on wednesday after bowing to pressure 
and dismissing a top aide 
the aide brian lenihan is running for president but his 
campaign has suffered because of a scandal arising from reports 
that lenihan lied about his role in a political crisis eight years 
what i have to do i do with great sadness and great sorrow 
said haughey after he stripped lenihan of his titles of deputy 
prime minister and defense minister parliament gave haugheys 
government an 8380 vote of confidence 
haugheys fianna fail party has 77 seats in the 165seat 
parliament and governs with the support of the progressive 
democrats who hold six seats the progressive democrats reportedly 
had insisted lenihan leave the government 
the main opposition parties fine gael and the labor party 
voted against the confidence motion two opposition lawmakers did 
not vote 
in an act of political loyalty lenihan and his sister 
education minister mary orourke who are also members of 
parliament both voted to support haughey despite his dismissal of 
lenihan 
labor party leader dick spring had earlier called haughey a liar 
and lenihan an irish version of richard nixon 
this is a debate about greed for office disregard for truth 
and about contempt for political standards spring said 
wednesday 
the controversy stems from events that occurred in 1982 after 
the fine gaelled government of garret fitzgerald lost a confidence 
vote 
haughey lenihan and other leaders of the fianna fail party were 
accused at the time of trying to persuade thenpresident patrick 
hillery to call them to head a government without holding a 
national election which would have been illegal 
haughey and lenihan had always denied the charge but last week 
a political science graduate student produced a tape recording of 
an interview in which lenihan gave a detailed account of 
telephoning hillery 
lenihan has insisted he never phoned hillery but his 
conflicting accounts of the event elevated an arcane political 
issue into a question of his truthfulness 
lenihan the early frontrunner for next wednesdays presidential 
election has fallen far behind mary robinson the candidate backed 
by labor 
a poll published wednesday by the irish independent newspaper 
showed mrs robinson favored by 52 percent lenihan by 31 percent 
and fine gaels austin currie with 17 percent 
haughey said he continued to support lenihan for president of 
this nation of 37 million people 
brian lenihan has been a friend a loyal and trusted colleague 
with whom i have served for well over a quarter of a century he 
has done great service to the irish people haughey said 
haughey 65 and lenihan 59 are allies from the days they were 
cabinet members in the 1970s under prime minister sean lemass 
haugheys fatherinlaw

countrys leading dissidents who was often detained for his 
anticommunist activities

who gave up his political affiliation upon his appointment as head 
of state said the countrys affairs would have to be handled

the interior minister indicated 
wednesday the government might be ready to hear the demands of the 
medellin cocaine cartel in hopes of freeing seven kidnapped 
journalists 
julio cesar sanchez said his government is prepared to listen 
to the complaints even of those who find themselves outside the 
law 
the interior ministers statement aired over the rcn radio 
network could signal a reversal in the government policy of not 
negotiating with drug traffickers 
his comments came in response to a question about seven 
journalists kidnapped by the medellin cartel the past two months 
including francisco santos editor of the countrys leading 
newspaper el tiempo and diana turbay daughter of former 
president julio cesar turbay 
in a speech wednesday president cesar gaviria did not refer to 
his ministers comments saying only that colombia would meet its 
international obligations concerning narcotics 
however the president did not publicly reject last weeks 
proposal by a representative of the drug traffickers to seek united 
nations mediation in their conflict with the government 
the cartel issued a statement tuesday saying it kidnapped the 
journalists and marina montoya the sister of colombias ambassador 
to canada it threatened to kill its hostages if the government 
launches a new offensive against drug traffickers 
in his radio interview sanchez said the cartel may have some 
legitimate complaints 
he added the goverment is ready to hear the legitimate 
complaints of any citizen the reason for being a democratic 
government is that even those at the margin of the law can demand 
guarantees 
in a statement to local media the cartel said it had learned of 
a government plot to kidnap the relative of a drug baron and 
exchange him for the journalists 
if something of this nature happens our response will be 
immediate and we will execute the detained journalists the 
statement said 
sanchez responded using threats to ask for justice is not 
appropriate 
judicial police chief col oscar pelaez said security forces 
never planned to kidnap anyone but rather only intend to capture 
criminals 
the medellin gang has been blamed for killing about 550 
colombians since the government and drug traffickers began battling 
each other in august 1989 
a group of political and church leaders have offered to try to 
mediate between the government and the cartel they were responding 
to a request by drug traffickers presented last week by lawyer 
guido parra to find a negotiated solution to the conflict 
parras proposal included seeking mediation by the united 
nations 
colombias cali and medellin drug cartels supply most of the 
cocaine consumed in the united states and europe

a woman who won 10 million in a contest 
sponsored by mcdonalds and nbc but lost it because her daughter 
works for the fastfood chain has sued to regain her prize 
charles and thelma bellows filed a lawsuit tuesday in bay county 
circuit court seeking the 10 million prize plus damages and legal 
fees 
from 1030 am to 8 oclock at night we were millionaires it 
was so fast it was hard to believe charles bellows said 
the lawsuit names mcdonalds corp nbc inc the mcdonalds 
franchise where they bought the ticket and a company that judged 
the contest 
the bellows say they should be allowed to keep the prize because 
their married daughter is not a member of their immediate family 
mrs bellows 49 was named on national tv oct 12 as the winner 
in the mcmillions on nbc contest 
she received the winning ticket the day before when she bought a

national republican campaign committees have 
suffered multimilliondollar drops in receipts and spending 
compared to the last nonpresidential election campaign a federal 
agency said wednesday 
the gop committees still have spent far more this time around 
than their democratic counterparts which did not experience a 
decline in campaign fundrasising the federal election commission 
said 
as of oct 17 the fec said the republican national senatorial 
and congressional committees had received 30 million less and 
spent 26 million less than in the same period during the 198586 
cycle 
at the same time the level of financial activity at the 
democratic committees remained on a par with the previous offyear 
campaign cycle 
republican party strategists have said gop fundraising efforts 
were hurt by president bushs change of heart on taxes bush 
abandoned his nonewtaxes campaign pledge this fall and agreed to 
a package of spending cuts and new taxes to help reduce the federal 
deficit 
nevertheless the gop managed to outspend the democrats this 
year by more than 118 million according to the fec 
the three gop committees raised and spent 159 million from jan 
1 1989 to oct 17 1990 the three democratic committees raised 
37 million and spent 40 million in the same period 
the republicans contributed nearly twice as much as the 
democrats directly to candidates 18 million compared to just 
over 900000 the fec said coordinated expenditures or indirect 
aid to candidates came to 74 million for the gop and 58 
million for the democrats 
the gop also has transferred much more money to state party 
committees than the democrats 37 million compared to 16 
million 
in addition the national republican party operates two joint 
fundraising committees that have distributed 19 million to 49 
senate candidates the fec said democrats have filed a complaint 
alleging that the committees the republican senatorial inner 
circle 1990 and 199091 are illegally circumventing campaign 
spending limits

a jury on wednesday decided that prizefighter 
mike tyson fondled a woman at a dance club in 1988 and awarded the 
woman 100 in compensatory damages 
the fivewomen oneman jury was scheduled to return to federal 
court thursday to hear testimony on tysons financial status before 
ruling on punitive damages 
the woman sandra miller asked for up to 25 million in 
punitive damages in her civil lawsuit 
the jury deliberated about 4 hours before finding that tyson 
the former heavyweight champion grabbed millers breasts and 
buttocks after she refused his advances at bentleys disco on dec 
10 1988 
tyson who had denied that the incident ever took place showed 
no outward emotion as us district judge michael b mukasey read 
the verdict which found the fighter had committed battery but not 
assault 
tyson said he was satisfied with the verdict if they thought 
it was serious they would have given her more than 100 bucks he 
said 
when asked how she felt miller a 26yearold computer 
operator said great that they know that he did it 
in closing arguments earlier wednesday tysons attorney robert 
hirth told the jury miller had concocted the allegations to obtain 
money from tyson 
you should send a message that if sandra miller wants to 
engage in a getrichquick scheme she should buy a lottery 
ticket hirth told jurors 
us district judge michael b mukasey instructed the jury to 
decide separately whether tyson committed assault or battery 
he said assault did not require a finding of contact but could 
include an overt menacing act a finding of battery requires 
actual contact he said 
the trial was in federal court because tyson lives out of state

police drove 14000 displaced people out 
of a shantytown and burned their makeshift hovels to ensure they do 
not return witnesses said wednesday 
the displaced people who fled war and famine in southern sudan 
have been moved to a camp in jabal awlia about 25 miles south of 
khartoum their movements can be controlled more easily there 
because they have to pass checkpoints to go to the capital 
although the government says 80 percent of the facilities in the 
new camp are finished witnesses say it has no water and those now 
living in the area are not happy to have the southerners come in 
the government announced last year it would dismantle 
shantytowns around khartoum where an estimated 2 million displaced 
southern and western sudanese have been living a 198485 drought 
in the western sudan brought many refugees to khartoum 
because of the war the southerners are not welcomed by the 
northerners the government has accused the war refugees of 
straining the capitals limited resources and increasing the crime 
rate 
rebels in the south claim that the christian and animist 
residents of the region are persecuted by the central government of 
the north where the population is moslem war has been raging in 
the south for seven years 
when the military government decided to dismantle the camps last 
year the three southerners on the ruling 15man revolutionary 
command council protested it was unclear why the government 
decided to enforce the decision now 
witnesses said the evacuation of the bentiu camp started 
saturday evening and ended tuesday they said smoke could still be 
seen wednesday coming out of the camp that police burned down after 
the evacuation 
there were no reports of violence being employed to empty the 
camp 
the bentiu camp named after a town in the upper nile region 
where most of the inhabitants fled from was made up of makeshift 
huts made of wood sticks tin and orange plastic sheets it was 
better know as hilat al shook or village of the thorns because it 
was full of thorn trees 
the government has been having problems carrying out its 
evacuation of another shantytown called takamul the inhabitants 
there have built mud huts and are refusing to move

louisiana legislator david duke said wednesday 
that hes inclined to run for governor in 1992 
duke a republican state representative and former ku klux klan 
leader ran an unsuccessful but strongerthanexpected race for the 
us senate this fall 
dukes comments came as part of a heated discussion on jesse 
jacksons syndicated television program which is scheduled to be 
broadcast over the weekend 
when jackson asked duke if he was inclined to run for governor 
of louisiana in 1992 he replied i am inclined 
duke supporters cheered his responses but often jeered at 
comments from others in the audience and on the panel of which duke 
was a member 
dukes sharpest exchanges were with gloria allred a womens 
rights lawyer who shook her finger at him and described his remarks 
about reverse discrimination as garbage 
you give womens rights a bad name duke shot back amid 
cries of witch from his supporters 
jackson urged both panelists to calm down 
the overflow crowd of about 200 included supporters of both 
sides ranging from members of the conservative young americans for 
freedom to representatives of the liberal american civil liberties 
union 
when a black man in the audience came forward with what he said 
were photographs of duke in nazi and klan uniforms duke said 
i am sorry to say that i participated in these organizations 
i have certainly grown up in my life and we all have the right to 
do that 
much of the program focused on the civil rights bill recently 
vetoed by president bush 
this bill is about racial discrimination duke said we 
have got massive racial discrimination going on right now in 
america but now its against whites 
some booed that remark 
dukes legislative assistant glenn montecino said duke 
originally accepted an invitation to appear on the show with the 
understanding it would be a oneonone discussion with jackson 
duke withdrew after being told he would be on a panel with 
several black activists but agreed to appear when the panel was 
revised 
also on the panel were rep kweisi mfume dmd and richard 
viguerie a conservative fundraiser 
duke viguerie and ms allred are white jackson and mfume are

the air force on wednesday delayed 
atlantis classified flight next week because of problems with a 
spy satellite aboard the shuttle 
details are classified and it is too early to predict a new 
launch date the air force said in a twosentence statement 
the air force described the problem as anomalies discovered 
during cargo testing capt marty hauser a pentagon spokesman in 
washington refused to say when the problem was detected and 
declined to discuss the flight further 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said the 
satellite was to spy on iraq 
top nasa managers on tuesday scheduled atlantis launch for nov 
9 the shuttle was cleared for flight following a fueling test last 
week that found it free of dangerous hydrogen leaks 
a fueling test on tuesday cleared the shuttle columbia for a 
december astronomy mission nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said it 
was too soon to know whether that mission would be affected by 
atlantis delay 
we dont know how to set dates or how to plan because the 
extent of the problem the satellite aboard atlantis is unknown she 
said 
sources estimated the delay would be one to two weeks 
it is the seventh shuttle flight dedicated entirely to the 
defense department two more defense department missions are 
planned both next year but their cargoes are unclassified 
the bottom line is its no longer affordable to maintain 
secure operations for a mission said a pentagon official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the delay was disappointing news for the national aeronautics 
and space administration which had been hoping to close the year 
with six shuttle flights nasa had planned for nine missions this 
year but was plagued by hydrogen leaks on columbia and then on 
atlantis 
columbias leaks were detected in may during fueling for the 
astronomy missions first launch attempt three more tries followed 
before nasa stopped to send up discovery with a sunexploring 
satellite earlier this month 
atlantis was grounded in june when hydrogen escaped during a 
fueling test

the security councils next move against 
baghdad is a resolution that would put iraqs frozen assets into an 
escrow account to pay for war damages us ambassador thomas r 
pickering said wednesday 
pickering told reporters the resolution would allow iraqi funds 
and property frozen for the duration of the crisis to be put into a 
compensation account 
the assets from each countrys escrow account would not be 
divided until the crisis has run its course because there is no 
way of assessing total costs until then 
on monday the security council voted to hold iraq liable for 
human rights abuses and war damages during its occupation of 
kuwait but that resolution did not contain a means of distributing 
iraqi funds the new resolution apparently would provide such a 
mechanism 
pickering said the council could begin deliberating the measure 
later this week or early next week 
he becomes president of the council for the month of november 
with powers to sway the pace of negotiations and help set the 
bodys priorities 
pickering alluded to the escrow account plan monday when he 
told the security council that iraq would be liable for full 
compensation for the losses and damages it has caused by its 
illegal invasion and occupation of kuwait 
iraq has about 4 billion in overseas assets of which about 
800 million are in america that money could be used to help 
rebuild kuwait if its government is restored after an iraqi 
withdrawal 
other countries are suffering billions of dollars in losses in 
indirect economic losses due to higher oil prices loss of trade 
and loss of remittances from foreign workers who had been in iraq 
and kuwait 
jordan alone figures it will lose about 2 billion poland 
estimates similar losses

a womans recollection of watching 
her father molest and kill a playmate with a rock 21 years ago is 
full of inconsistencies his lawyer said wednesday at the start of 
his murder trial 
a prosecutor promised during her opening statement to provide 
evidence that george franklin sr asked his wife to wash a 
bloodstained shirt a few days after the slaying 
franklins daughter eileen franklinlipsker told police she 
saw her father use a rock to kill 8yearold susan nason on sept 
22 1969 she said she repressed memories of the slaying until last 
year when they flooded back as she looked at her own young 
daughter 
douglas horngrad one of franklins lawyers said 
franklinlipskers memories are faulty 
the truth is that mrs lipsker tells different versions of 
different stories to different people at different times he 
said 
horngrad told a san mateo county superior court jury there is no 
evidence linking franklin to the girls slaying defense attorneys 
have suggested police overlooked other possible suspects in the 
investigation more than two decades ago 
franklin 51 a former san mateo firefighter faces a possible 
life sentence if convicted 
the last touch that susie felt was not one of love it 
was a touch of lust and perversion prosecutor elaine tipton 
said 
franklinlipsker has said her father threatened to kill her if 
she told anyone what she had seen she has said she saw her father 
sexually attacking her friend then moving toward the girl with a 
rock raised over his head 
the girls body was discovered three months later in a ravine 
off a highway a bloodstained rock was lying neaby authorities 
said 
for 20 years this crime remained unsolved tipton said 
the terrible event remained deep in the mind of eileen franklin 
for 20 years the defendant lived his life pretending to know 
nothing of the disappearance and death of this young child 
the franklin family lived down the street from the nasons in 
foster city south of san francisco when the child was slain 
horngrad said franklinlipsker initially told her brother and 
mother her memory returned during a hypnotic trance later she 
said she had lied because she thought the story was more believable 
than the truth horngrad said 
horngrad suggested the real reason she had changed her story was 
that her mother a lawyer told her hypnoticallyinduced evidence 
is inadmissible in california courts 
franklinlipsker also has changed details of her story such as 
whether her sister was with her when the slaying occurred the time 
of day it occurred the setting and where she was when she first 
remembered the incident horngrad said 
franklinlipsker was expected to testify next week her sister 
janice franklin who testified during a preliminary hearing in may 
that she and eileen were molested by franklin when they were 
children was also scheduled to testify

mahmoud atta wanted in israel on terrorism 
charges has been turned over to israeli authorities the state 
department said wednesday night 
atta who also uses the name mahmoud elabed ahmad was placed 
in israeli custody last evening and immediately taken out of 
the united states said spokesman adam shub 
last friday the imminence of the transfer and threats from a 
terrorist group to act if it were carried out prompted the 
department to issue an unusual alert that terrorists might be 
planning an attack on passenger ships in the eastern mediterranean 
sea 
the department said then it had specific and credible 
information about such an attack that may be undertaken at any 
time 
wednesday evening shub said he had nothing to add to the alert 
atta 37 and a us citizen has been accused of taking part in 
the 1986 machine gun attack on a bus carrying jewish settlers in 
the occupied west bank the driver was killed and a passenger 
wounded 
he was arrested in the united states three years ago on aug 
31 the supreme court rejected his last appeal in a court battle to 
avoid extradition 
the abu nidal organization a terrorist group of which atta was 
a member has threatened to attack us interests if atta were 
extradited the department said 
the abu nidal organization is believed responsible for some of 
the bloodiest terrorist attacks in recent years 
it was another group however led by abu abbas that hijacked 
the italian cruise liner in egypt in 1985 one of the hijackers 
shot and killed a wheelchairusing american leon klinghoffer in

the russian parliament voted wednesday to start a 
500day transition to a market economy on thursday putting it on a 
collision course with president mikhail s gorbachev and the 
national legislature 
gorbachev and the supreme soviet legislature agreed oct 19 on a 
compromise economic rescue plan that is slower and less radical 
than the 500day plan 
russia the largest of the 15 soviet republics has declared 
sovereignty from the central soviet government it claims the right 
to put its own economic reform plan into effect on its territory 
which covers twothirds of the soviet land mass 
it is unclear who will be obeyed if the russian government led 
by gorbachevs leading political rival boris n yeltsin gives 
economic orders that contradict the national government 
already the central government has warned bank officials they 
will be fired if they carry out a new russian republic law creating 
independent banks according to deputy russian premier gennady 
filshin 
the russian parliament also challenged the kremlin by claiming 
control over the republics natural reso for the 
newspaper moskovskaya pravda 
i spent the whole day here asking people what concrete steps 
they planned to take and no one could give me an answer he 
added gesturing from a balcony overlooking the parliaments marble 
meeting hall 
grigori yavlinsky a deputy prime minister of the russian 
republic and one of the authors of the 500day plan told reporters 
the parliament should set up a committee of economic advisers to 
suggest specific measures 
but yavlinsky expressed doubt that russia would be able to put 
the 500day plan into effect at least in its original form 
maybe in august we could have done it but its too late 
now he said noting that the national parliament has adopted the 
compromise plan and the countrys economy has worsened 
figures released wednesday by the russian republics committee 
on statistics show that production of consumer goods rose 58 
percent in the first nine months of 1990 but demand rose even 
faster creating chronic shortages 
the committee said rationing of food and consumer goods is 
widespread and prices are rising it also said industrial output 
dropped 25 percent housing construction is down and russias 
exports to foreign countries declined 7 percent 
the 500day plan contains a detailed timetable for scrapping the 
70yearold central planning system under which moscow bureaucrats 
have told thousands of factories farms and small businesses what 
to produce and how much to charge 
the plan calls for transferring significant economic power 
including the right of taxation to the republics it also 
envisages breaking up government monopolies selling stateowned 
property to private citizens and converting collective farms into 
private plots 
gorbachevs program was a compromise between the 500day plan 
and a more cautious reform plan proposed by prime minister nikolai 
i ryzhkov the compromise omits any timetable although officials 
suggested it would take one and a half to two years to put into 
effect 
the compromise also would leave the central government with 
strong economic powers including control over the money supply 
banking and taxes it hedges on decollectivization calling for the 
rental rather than sale of land to private farmers 
yeltsin and other critics of the compromise have charged it 
would produce rapid inflation by lifting state price controls and 
indexing workers wages and benefits to rise accordingly 
the 500day plan calls for retaining price controls on key 
commodities and household necessities such as food and clothing 
throughout the transition period

wont be marching for a while after offending oregonians with a 
halftime spoof of the spotted owl timber controversy 
the incomparable leland stanford junior university marching 
band known for shows that poke offbeat fun at current events 
was banned from the field for one game because of a weekend 
performance in eugene oregon 
offended spectators from the university of oregon booed and 
stanfords own supporters swamped its athletic department with 
angry telephone complaints 
the band saturday took on the northern spotted owl a threatened 
species at the center of a bitter battle between the logging 
industry and environmentalists measures to protect the owls 
habitat in the old growth forests of the pacific northwest are 
opposed by loggers who say their livlihood is threatened 
trees and spotted owls are disappearing like crazy and 
everybody wants to know why the announcer said during the 
halftime show 
mr spotted owl mr spotted owl your environment has been 
destroyed your home is now a roll of brawny paper towels and 
your family has flown the coop the announcer continued what 
are you going to do me im going to disneyland 
band members spelled out spot then formed pot on the 
field 
slogans and signs at demonstrations over the owl controversy 
often depict the threatened bird as a menu item 
the oregon ducks and their fans were not amused by the show 
the stanford band is known for this kind of shtick i guess 
they must try to be obnoxious said steve paul band director at 
the oregon school this game they ridiculed the logging industry 
and the environmental movement and lots of fans were offended 
it would be like if my band came down to the oakland coliseum 
and made light of the earthquake said don jackson principal of 
south eugene high school many oregonians have suffered personal 
losses from the closing of paper mills he said 
it wasnt the first time the stanford band has been banned the

their pants during a nationally televised game 
in a 1975 performance the band offended spectators over the 
patricia hearst kidnapping when they formed a hearstburger 
all buns and no patty 
the band wont be marching in this weekends game against 
washington state stanford said the musicians could march in two 
later games including the big game against the university of

the script the insensitivity to the situation in oregon they were 
embarrassed she said of the complaints

greed drugs and a lust for hollywood glamour 
led to the producer roy radins murder a prosecutor told jurors 
wednesday as the cotton club case began 
but the lawyer for a key defendant called the case as a 
frameup 
deputy district attorney david conn said he would prove that 
three men on trial killed radin seven years ago on the orders of 
miami cocaine dealer karen delayne laney greenberger a 
codefendant 
conn said mrs greenberger feared being cut out of profits from 
the cotton club movie deal she helped arrange between radin and 
producer robert evans 
evans is a former head of paramount pictures who invoked fifth 
amendment protection against selfincrimination and declined to 
testify at a preliminary hearing last year he is under subpoena 
for the trial 
mrs greenbergers lawyer blamed the radin killing on one of her 
lovers alleged cuban drug dealer milano bellechasses and 
implicated another former lover who is on trial with her 
laney greenberger did not hire did not pay anyone to kidnap 
or murder roy radin said miami lawyer edward shohat she 
didnt do it 
it is true unfortunately that laney greenberger was at that 
time of her life a drug dealer he added but that does not 
make her roy radins killer 
he suggested radins death was the result of a drug theft 
unrelated to the movie deal and that men who surrounded mrs 
greenberger framed her 
you will see that laney greenberger was set up was used was 
literally and figuratively framed to the take the rap for the 
murder of roy radin shohat said 
the attorney said mrs greenberger tried to warn radin he was in 
danger the night of the killing telling him there are all these 
men around me and i have no control 
mrs greenberger 43 once was evans girlfriend the three men 
on trial with her were once bodyguards for hustler magazine 
publisher larry flynt 
she is accused of hiring william mentzer 41 her former lover 
and alex marti 29 to do away with radin the fourth defendant 
robert lowe allegedly drove the car to the killing site 
each of the defendants were involved in a conspiracy to kidnap 
and kill roy radin conn said and each defendant did it for 
one purpose only for financial gain and for their own personal 
greed 
radin 33 has been described as a man of excesses an obese 
cocainesniffing impresario from new yorks long island who sought 
to expand his show business connections to hollywood 
the jury was told how mrs greenberger arrived at radins hotel 
in a chauffeurdriven limousine the night of may 13 1983 conn 
said that en route to dinner at la scala in beverly hills the 
limousine stopped mrs greenberger got out and mentzer and marti 
toting guns got in 
radin was taken to a remote canyon and shot at least 10 times in 
the head conn said he described mentzer putting a stick of 
dynamite in radins mouth then igniting it to destroy his face and 
prevent identification 
outside the jurys presence shohat asked again to sever mrs 
greenbergers trial from her codefendants so that he could more 
openly discuss the three men superior court judge curtis rappe 
refused 
shohat suggested to jurors that mentzer who was hired by mrs 
greenberger as a bodyguard and became her lover also worked for 
bellechasses he was mentzer first warned her she might be cut out 
of profits from the cotton club deal 
shohat acknowledged that mrs greenberger worried about losing 
her share in the cotton club 
but he insisted she was more upset about the theft of 1 million 
in cocaine and cash from her sherman oaks home he said she hoped 
the cotton club profits would help make up the loss 
all four defendants could face the death penalty if convicted

two federal courts on wednesday upheld a stay 
of execution for a man convicted of killing four people during a 
robbery a decade ago 
maurice oscar byrd had been scheduled to die by lethal injection 
at 1201 am cst thursday but the execution was blocked last week 
by a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
which wanted to hear more arguments in the case 
that ruling was appealed to the entire court by the missouri 
attorney generals office but the nine judges in a 54 decision 
refused wednesday afternoon to lift the stay of execution 
the state appealed again but the us supreme court upheld the 
stay wednesday evening 
byrd who has been on death row since 1982 would be the fifth 
missouri death row inmate to be executed this year and the sixth in 
two years 
since the us supreme court allowed states to resume use of the 
death penalty in 1976 there have been 141 executions nationwide 
officials at the potosi correctional center about 75 miles 
south of st louis said they were making preparations to carry out 
the execution in case the stay was lifted 
he seems to be in a good frame of mind said prison 
spokesman phil banks who said he had spoken with byrd hes just 
quietly watching television 
byrd 35 was convicted in 1982 of shooting to death a cafeteria 
manager and three cooks in a shopping mall in the st louis suburb 
of des peres authorities said the employees were herded into the 
managers 10by10 foot office oct 23 1980 and gunned down one 
by one as they stood 
byrd confessed to the murders in may 1981 after being arrested 
in savannah ga for the murder of a liquor store employee 
byrds appeal is based on two issues the composition of the 
jury and the requirement for unanimity among jurors on certain 
instructions during the sentencing phase 
the 8th circuit found that the missouri supreme court refused to 
review those issues when it said that byrd had exhausted his state 
remedies

less than a week before the election 
minnesota republicans have a new gubernatorial candidate but the 
lieutenant governor spot on the gop ticket remained in doubt 
wednesday 
the secretary of state delayed the printing of supplemental 
ballots to reflect john grunseths withdrawal from the 
gubernatorial race until after his running mate makes her case in 
court for staying on the ballot 
theres no precedent for any of the decisions ive made 
secretary of state joan growe said i think we have to anticipate 
anything at this stage given the kind of year weve had 
grunseth the gop nominee dropped out of the race sunday amid 
allegations he tried to get teenage girls to swim nude with him 
nine years ago and had a mistress during both of his marriages 
arne carlson the runner up in the gop primary who later mounted 
a writein campaign was chosen by the state republican partys 
executive committee to take grunseths place on the ballot 
the 14member committee later decided the party wasnt empowered 
to fill the vacancy but growe said state law required carlson as 
the gop primary runnerup to become the nominee he faces the 
democratic incumbent rudy perpich 
because the governor and lieutenant governor run as a team in 
minnesota growe also decided that joanell dyrstad carlsons 
writein running mate should replace grunseths running mate 
sharon clark on the ballot even though clark didnt withdraw 
clark petitioned the minnesota supreme court to reverse growes 
decision arguments were scheduled for thursday 
i have won the endorsement of the party i have won the 
primary election and i have been certified by the state canvassing 
board clark said i have a constituency of my own and that 
constituency deserves to be represented on the republican ticket 
growe a democrat said she also delayed the printing of ballots 
because it was possible other legal challenges may be filed she 
said she will wait until friday before directing county auditors to 
print ballots with carlsons and dyrstads names 
i believe we need to wait until the final resolution of the 
matter in the courts growe said 
republican party chairman bob weinholzer said he hadnt heard of 
additional legal challenges 
it appears like she growe is encouraging somebody to file a 
lawsuit because she keeps talking about it he said 
carlson a moderate who often has been at odds with the gops 
dominant conservative faction won unanimous support from the 
partys executive committee 
realistically 99 percent of the people vote for governor not 
lieutenant governor weinholzer said

president bush said wednesday he was fed up with saddam 
husseins harsh treatment of us hostages iraq later said it 
would allow american families to visit the captives for the 
holidays 
egyptian president hosni mubarak and a british commander 
meanwhile warned the likelihood of war in the region was 
increasing 
but iraqs ambassador to the united states mohamed almashat 
said he sought to avoid bloodshed and reiterated iraqs offer to 
negotiate if other middle east conflicts were included on the 
agenda the united states has rejected such linkage 
mubarak said the persian gulf crisis has become so dangerous it 
could explode at any time and he urged our brothers in 
iraq to realize the danger their aug 2 invasion of oilrich 
kuwait has caused 
the commander of british forces in the gulf warned that an 
attack against iraq is increasingly likely air chief marshal sir 
paddy hine said a joint team culled from the royal air force royal 
navy and army is developing plans for military strikes 
saddam hussein seems reluctant at the moment to accept the 
judgment of world opinion he said it is looking increasingly 
unlikely that saddam hussein will withdraw unconditionally from 
kuwait 
bush said his patience was wearing thin with saddam over the 
1000 american hostages in iraq and kuwait 
the embassy is being starved bush said of the besieged us 
mission in occupied kuwait the people out there are not being 
resupplied 
do you think im concerned about it youre darn right i am 
and what im going to do about it lets just wait and see 
because i have had it with that kind of treatment of americans 
bush said 
later wednesday an information ministry spokesman in baghdad 
said the iraqi government is prepared to allow families of 
americans in iraq to visit during the christmas and new years 
holidays no other details were available and there was no 
immediate reaction from the state department 
the offer to american relatives appears to be part of an overall 
iraqi offer to all relatives of its foreign guests to visit the 
captives several britons have already done so including wives 
visiting their husbands being held in iraq 
its probably just another psychological ploy said dawn 
bazner whose husband mark early in the crisis was videotaped 
asking saddam to let foreign women and children go speaking from 
palm desert calif she said im hoping that we wont have to 
visit mark there but if it comes down to it i will go 
a few diplomats have held out at the us embassy in kuwait 
defying an iraqi order to close missions in the annexed nation 
iraq has cut utilities and surrounded the compound with troops the 
british embassy also remains open 
the administration of former president reagan used the safety of 
americans as a justification to invade grenada in 1983 the bush 
administration also cited the safety of americans when he sent 
troops to panama in 1989 
in baghdad information ministry spokesman latif jassim said the 
united states was spreading false reports on the conditions of 
foreign guests to seek an excuse to attack iraq 
baghdad calls the hundreds of westerners held in iraq and kuwait 
to deter attack by the multinational force deployed in saudi arabia 
guests many have been sent to strategic sites as human 
shields 
i want to tell you that our guests live in good conditions at 
some places better than many iraqi families but bush perhaps wants 
an excuse jassim said 
cbs radio quoted jassim as saying he will make available to us 
television networks videotaped messages from american hostages to 
their families to show they were not being mistreated 
the united states has more than 210000 troops in the gulf 
region the largest force sent abroad since the vietnam war and 
washington plans to send 100000 more about 100000 soldiers have 
been deployed by other nations 
the 13nation force including troops from several moderate 
arab nations faces about 460000 iraqi troops stationed in 
southern iraq and kuwait 
egypt along with saudi arabia has led arab opposition to 
saddam speaking to reporters wednesday in cairo mubarak said he 
hoped our brothers in iraq will understand well that the 
situation is very dangerous and could explode at any time 
if war comes iraq will be ruined and it will harm all of 
us mubarak said 
at a news conference in washington iraqs almashat spoke of 
peace 
we once more call for a negotiated solution to have a 
political and diplomatic solution we seek to avoid bloodshed he 
said 
he reiterated that iraq was ready to begin negotiations on the 
crisis if issues such as israels occupation of the gaza strip and 
west bank were included in the talks 
we seek a peaceful solution to all of these questions 
almashat said all of them together now 
former west german chancellor willy brandt announced he is 
traveling to baghdad next week at saddams invitation 
i think its most important now to listen to what the people 
in baghdad think to listen to whether they think theres a way out 
of their isolation said brandt who won the 1971 nobel peace 
prize for his efforts to bridge the cold war gap between west 
germany and the soviet union 
about 400 germans are among thousands of foreigners stranded or 
held in iraq brandt said he was going as a private citizen not a 
representative of bonn 
almashat also reiterated claims that iraqi agents in kuwait had 
seized a secret document showing the cia and kuwaiti intelligence 
were plotting against iraq before the invasion 
peter earnest a spokesman for the us intelligence agency 
said the document is fake 
in other developments 
in israel a defense ministry official said the army has 
distributed 3 million gas masks to protect civilians from a 
possible iraqi chemical attack 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani said his country had asked 
iraq to end its occupation of kuwait tehran television reported 
the official iraqi news agency said switzerland would ship 
about 30 tons of medicine to iraq

portauprince haiti ap about 1000 people marched 
wednesday to support the presidential campaign of the former head 
of a paramilitary army that terrorized the nation for nearly 30 
years 
supporters of candidate roger lafontant brandished placards 
hostile to foreign intervention and to the council that is 
organizing the elections radio metropole reported 
about 250 organization of american states and 300 united nations 
observers will monitor elections slated for dec 16 the electoral 
council is still determining whether lafontant is eligible to be a 
candidate 
a former interior and defense minister under deposed dictator 
jeanclaude duvalier lafontant headed the tonton macoutes a 
dreaded paramilitary force that kept the duvalier family in power 
for 29 years 
human rights organizations have accused lafontant of many 
atrocities 
in 1987 the last attempt at free elections collapsed when thugs 
linked to the army shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters at 
polling places 
lafontant was seated on the roof of a fourwheel drive vehicle 
during part of wednesdays demonstration which began in a seafront 
square at 11 am and dispersed several hours later in the bel air 
slum said the radio station 
organizers had intended to end the demonstration in front of the 
presidential palace where lafontant was to speak but access to 
the square was blocked by police 
the demonstration was organized by the union for national 
reconciliation a neoduvalierist federation which nominated 
lafontant at a meeting oct 18 
lafontant is charged with plotting against national security 
but the court has never delivered an arrest warrant lafontant has 
been under army protection since he returned from abroad in july to 
run for president 
the armys pampering protection of lafontant makes us wonder 
about the sincerity of its commitment to defend democracy said 
presidential candidate louis dejoie jr a moderate 
article 291 of the 1987 constitution bans criminal supporters of 
past dictatorships from running for public office until 1997 
the electoral council has discretionary power to decide on the 
eligibility of candidates and it is to make its decision on 
lafontants candidacy by nov 6 
in a press release tuesday the army high command said it 
would observe the strictest neutrality during the electoral 
process 
dejoie said the army had promised to be neutral in 1957 when it 
rigged elections in favor of francois papa doc duvalier the 
army also promised to guarantee security in 1987 dejoie said

call it the turkey vote 
some voters are pushing none of the above as a better option 
in a year when they think the ballot choices are more suited for 
stuffing than for public office 
the nota option has been listed on nevada ballots since 1976 
and won six times 
the idea has attracted attention in massachusetts especially 
from liberals who are scratching their heads over the choices to 
replace gov michael s dukakis democrat john silber and 
republican william weld 
silber a toughtalking university president alienated some 
democrats with his blunt statements about women and minorities 
weld an advocate of conservative stands on fiscal policy and gun 
control offers little comfort to liberals thinking about defecting 
from the majority party 
both candidates have participated in namecalling and negative 
campaigning 
the pioneer valley prodemocracy campaign wants election 
officials in six communities to count the nota vote this year says 
group spokesman randy kehler 
it seems to be striking a very responsive chord he said 
the group will hand out nota stickers to voters on election day 
kehler said adding that election officials he had spoken to seemed 
interested in the groups proposal 
margaret nartowicz of the amherst town clerks office said nota 
votes would be counted in that community 
kehler said the nota option would be more than a mere expression 
of dissatisfaction if nota won more votes than the candidates he 
said it would force a new election with new candidates 
voters need this option when the political system is not 
giving them candidates to their liking kehler said 
in nevada the nota option has been on the ballot in statewide 
races since 1976 but that state doesnt provide for new elections 
if nota wins instead the candidate with the secondhighest vote 
count gets the office 
don mello a former democratic nevada state senator introduced 
the nota legislation in the mid1970s after finding widespread 
dissatisfaction among voters in the postwatergate years 
back in 1975 i would go doortodoor and i found so many 
people who said we would vote for you but were not going to 
vote mello said i started thinking what can i get on the 
ballot that will get people to go to the polls 
the nota choice gives people a way to register their 
dissatisfaction with candidates at the top of the ballot while 
voting for other offices he said 
curtis gans who heads the nonpartisan nonprofit committee 
for the study of the american electorate in washington dc said 
voter participation numbers in nevada dont necessarily bear out 
the theory that nota increases voter participation 
in the 1988 presidential election nevada had a 448 percent 
turnout of eligible voters below the national turnout of 5015 
percent of eligible voters 
i dont think it will make a lot of difference gans said of 
the nota option as a way to bring out the vote 
still he supports the idea 
im for it because id rather have active protest than passive 
protest gans said 
bruce buchanan an associate professor of government at the 
university of texas said he doubts nota would introduce real 
change into elections 
i think its a bit of a gimmick in that its one of those 
answers that appeals to people because it seems emotionally 
satisfying and would have an immediate impact he said

the government on wednesday ordered canadian 
companies to ignore a us bill that would prohibit them from 
trading with cuba external affairs minister joe clark said 
the us proposal has cleared both houses of congress and needs 
only presidential approval to become law proposed by sen connie 
mack dfla and known as the mack amendment it would make it 
illegal for us subsidiaries abroad to do business with cuba 
this is an intrusion into canadian sovereignty clark said 
adding that diplomatic pressure and protests of the bill have had 
no effect 
the order prevents canadian subsidiaries from complying with the 
mack bill if it becomes law and forces them to notify the 
government of any instructions or directives they receive that 
relate to the measure 
this action demonstrates our determination to block measures 
that infringe on canadian sovereignty said justice minister kim 
campbell it is the government of canada which makes the laws and 
policies that govern international trade and commerce by 
canadabased companies 
the bush administration has opposed the amendment but it is 
attached as a rider to legislation the president wants including 
measures to implement the trade embargo against iraq for its 
invasion of kuwait 
the bill has not yet reached the white house and may not for a 
few days a white house official said once it is received the 
president has 10 days to sign it or veto it 
derek burney canadian ambassador in washington said this week 
he doesnt know whether bush will sign the bill 
the complication for them is how they weigh their support 
for our known view against the broader interest that this bill is 
intended to serve burney said 
canadian subsidiaries that would be affected by the bill did 
about 26 million of business with cuba last year 
canada and the united states have been feuding over trade with 
cuba since the early 1960s when the americans banned trade with 
havana and first sought to extend the prohibition to subsidiaries 
of us firms 
the canadian order announced by clark and justice minister kim 
campbell is the first to be issued under 1984 legislation known as 
the foreign extraterritorial measures act 
the government passed the act after the bank of nova scotias 
caribbean branches were subpoenaed by a florida grand jury 
investigating drug dealing

magellan will resume making pictures of 
venus on nov 7 or 8 after engineers fix a computer programming 
flaw that is causing a wobble in the spacecrafts twin solar power 
panels nasa said wednesday 
meanwhile a soviet scientist working on the magellan project 
praised the american mission but said more spacecraft should be 
sent to venus to better learn how the planet works geologically 
magellan is a beautiful mission but this is not the end 
geologist alexander basilevsky said during a weekly briefing on 
nasas closedcircuit television system 
basilevsky works for the ussr academy of sciences vernadsky 
institute of geochemistry and analytical chemistry in moscow he is 
one of three soviet guest investigators on the magellan project 
magellan temporarily suspended its 744 million mapmaking 
mission friday because of the solar panel problem and because its 
communications with earth were being impaired by a lineup of venus 
the sun and earth 
engineers determined that a flaw in the spacecrafts computer 
software was causing the wobble said steve wall magellan 
experiment representative at the national aeronautics and space 
administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
they problem should be fixed in time to resume mapping nov 7 or 
8 when the planetary alignment will no longer hinder 
communications wall said 
the solar panels are essential for recharging magellans 
batteries to keep the spacecraft running but the wobbling hasnt 
hurt their ability to gather solar energy 
the orbiter was launched from space shuttle atlantis on may 4 
1989 
at 9 pm est thursday the sun will be almost directly between 
earth and venus that lineup started hindering magellans 
communications with earth more than a week ago 
magellan uses radar to penetrate venus thick clouds to make 
pictures and maps it will map at least 70 percent to 90 percent of 
the planets surface 
since mapping formally started sept 15 the orbiter has made 
pictures of numerous volcanoes huge solidified lava flows 
extensive quake faults los angelessized meteorite impact craters 
and 600milewide milehigh bulges created as molten rock pushes 
upward from inside the planet

the take has surpassed everyones 
expectations in the year since slot machines and card games became 
legal in this black hills town founded during the gold rush of the 
1870s 
players wagered more than 253 million and about 75 gaming 
houses were licensed during the first 11 months of limitedstakes 
gambling in the town where wild bill hickok was gunned down in an 
1876 poker game 
this is the best thing to happen to tourism in south dakota 
since mount rushmore franklin hotel owner bill walsh said 
actors dressed as hickok and calamity jane will fire guns on 
main street at noon thursday to celebrate the first annversary of 
legalized gamblings return 
people wearing halloween costumes strolled down main street 
wednesday night and a best costume contest was held 
walsh told reporters deadwood was reborn over the last year as 
gaming halls spent an estimated 35 million to revamp downtown he 
predicted a large turnout for the thursday celebration 
deadwood is fun again walsh said 
mayor bruce oberlander said the changes have disrupted 
residents lives but most are pleased with the results 
i think when you go through 20 or 30 years of development in 
six months thats a lot to swallow at one time oberlander said 
a lot of people i think are happy with whats happening now 
a year ago state and city officials estimated deadwoods share 
of gambling taxes and license fees could give the city about 
500000 a year to be used to restore aging buildings the city has 
already received 62 million as its cut of the first years 
action 
gambling taxes also have contributed nearly 786000 to the 
state and more than 196000 to lawrence county 
a statewide vote in 1988 amended the south dakota constitution 
to authorize deadwood gambling the legislature limited bets to 5 
don gromer executive secretary of the state gaming commission 
said officials expected up to 20 gaming halls with 300 slot 
machines and card games to open in the first year by september 
the 75 gambling halls had 1900 slot machines 91 blackjack games 
and 27 poker games he said 
the gambling industry has created about 1400 jobs in deadwood 
industry officials estimate casinos already have spent more than 
30 million to renovate historic downtown structures 
success came with a price however 
state and city officials have scrambled to keep tabs on the 
rapid growth which has caused parking problems and strained water 
and sewer systems in the narrow city built in a canyon retail 
stores have nearly disappeared from main street as buildings have 
been converted into a long stretch of casinos to handle crowds of 
gamblers 
it also has brought a more hectic lifestyle to what was a quiet 
uncrowded town among the changes 
an association of gaming halls has helped support a local 
program that helps gambling addicts 
the coowner of one casino was shot and killed in september in 
what authorities said was an apparent attempted robbery an air 
force sergeant was charged with murder 
mayor bruce oberlander said many people are upset that its no 
longer easy to find motel rooms parking spots and uncrowded bars 
when they visit deadwood but they dont realize the businesses 
were struggling to survive before gambling drew crowds he says 
if we hadnt done this to deadwood we wouldnt have had a 
deadwood oberlander said its a changed deadwood but i 
think weve kept a lot of the mystery or romance of deadwood 
walsh said people who mourn the loss of the old deadwood are 
holding a wake for the wrong corpse the citys best period was the 
boom times of the frontier or the early years of this century not 
the recent years when businesses made money during the summer 
tourism season and then tried to hang on during the colder months 
he said 
the old deadwood was alive with people having fun walsh 
said its fun again to come to deadwood and its a healthy 
experience to see the restoration projects that are being done

the official saudi press agency which made note of the 
impromptu meeting gave no details of the talks among egyptian 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid syrias farouk alsharaa and 
saudi prince saud alfaisal

appreciated the soviet efforts stressing moscows adherence to 
resolutions calling for unconditional iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
and the restoration of the alsabah monarch in kuwait 
in cairo however gorbachevs suggestion that the arabs should 
lead the way in finding a settlement to the 3monthold crisis was 
dismissed by egypts leading governmentowned newspaper 
alahram said in its lead editorial wednesday that the proposal 
serves iraqi president saddan husseins strategy of stalling on 
the belief that time is on his side 
in baghdad information minister latif jassim wednesday said 
there cannot be an arab solution without the american forces 
leaving the gulf 
the crisis has split arab ranks most of the 21 arab league

liberation organization yemen and libya among them have 
expressed some sympathy for saddam

the mother of an 8monthold boy cried 
somebody killed my baby after the infant was found dead in a 
hospital crib his breathing tube pulled out and his heart monitor 
disconnected 
somebody did this theresa bostic insisted wednesday through 
her tears it didnt just come out somebody did this somebody 
did this 
homicide detectives are investigating the death of nigel bostic 
who was hospitalized in montefiore medical center since sept 17 
for breathing problems caused by a constricted trachea he was 
found dead monday afternoon said hospital administrator fred 
yaeger 
the boy was found face down in his hospital crib by a nurse 
monday said brian k regan vice president of administration at 
montefiore hospital 
the infants cardiac monitor had been disconnected and a 
tracheotomy tube which helped him breathe had been removed from 
his throat and was found under his body along with the ribbons 
that were supposed to hold it in place regan said 
this is clearly a tragic situation we are doing our best 
to find out what happened we are conducting a vigorous inquiry 
regan told a wednesday news briefing at the hospital 
a review of the babys care by a panel of doctors nurses and 
hospital administrators found the quality of the nursing care was 
very good regan said 
nigel had recovered and was scheduled to be released from the 
hospital on either tuesday or wednesday the administrator added 
regan acknowledged that the hospital hadnt called the police 
after failing to resuscitate the baby because at the time of the 
death there was no indication of any problem that would require 
notification of the police 
regan said the hospitals responsibility was to call the city 
medical examiner to report an unexplained death which it did 
monday 
it is reasonable and prudent to expect the hospital to call 
the police if they see a criminal event said ellen borakove a 
medical examiners spokeswoman they have the same obligation as 
anyone else to call the police 
an autopsy was completed late tuesday but the cause of death 
was still under investigation said ms borakove 
an initial police report said george and theresa bostic didnt 
learn of their sons death until tuesday more than 18 hours after 
it was discovered 
however both the parents and regan said medical personnel 
called the parents around monday evening summoning them to the 
hospital where they were informed of their sons death 
the parents then called police 
hospital administrators did not welcome us with open arms 
said sgt roscoe smalls a detective squad supervisor 
mrs bostic said only the parents and hospital staff were 
permitted in nigels room which was surrounded by windows 
how could anybody see him suffering and not do anything she 
asked somebody had to see my baby suffering 
mrs bostic and her husband a security guard have older 
children from previous marriages nigel was the only child from 
their marriage

the white house played a different tune 
wednesday after telling a middle school band it wasnt polished 
enough to play hail to the chief to welcome president bush to 
cape cod 
the advance team for the thursday visit told the school 
principal the band couldnt play the presidential anthem because 
only military high school and college bands are allowed to perform 
for the president school officials said 
the organizers also said the band couldnt handle the songs 
ruffles and flourishes school officials said 
the rejection came monday after two weeks of rehearsing but 
community pressure got the white house to bend said charles 
liberty principal of mashpee middle school the advance team 
reversed itself and notified the school wednesday the band will be 
allowed to perform the tune liberty said 
the white house referred questions on the matter wednesday to 
the advance team a member of the team who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said he had thought there was a policy the bands had to 
be highschool age or above but that the rejection was reversed 
because of community reaction 
i thought we did have a policy on who gets to play hail to 
the chief the team member said we dont want to upset the 
community 
not everyone in this cape cod town is willing to forgive 
the advance team is afraid the kids are going to choke or play 
the wrong thing said band leader michael persico theyre 
crushed this is the only gift these kids could offer their 
president and theyre being told its not good enough 
bush was scheduled to speak for 25 minutes in support of local 
republican candidates then meet briefly with supporters 
were really now incensed that our school is good enough to 
visit and our kids are good enough to visit and now their best 
effort isnt good enough for the president said david robbins 
whose 12yearold daughter deborah plays the clarinet in the band 
robbins isnt exactly impartial hes chairman of the 
democratic town committee other parents like robin trimble 
mother of 13yearold saxophone player john trimble said politics 
are to blame 
it seems like politics are coming into it at this point 
everyone is saying its the other persons fault ms trimble

an american attorney on wednesday 
dismissed a news report that a us drug enforcement agency courier 
might unwittingly have carried the bomb that blew up pan am flight 
103 over scotland 
lew kreindler leading counsel for us relatives of the 
victims said the nbctv report on tuesday was an old story 
that surfaced a year ago in a british newspaper he said he had no 
doubt that the drug policing agency had checked it out and would 
continue to investigate 
an inquiry is taking place in dumfries scotland into the 
december 1988 bombing that killed 270 people aboard the jetliner 
and in the village of lockerbie 
it appears to me that someone wants to focus attention away 
from pan am security procedures and toward something which relieves 
pan am of responsibility it seems to me an attempt to grab public 
attention the attorney said 
he added without elaboration that the dumfries inquiry was 
providing good answers 
the us drug policing agency said it was looking into the 
possibility of one of its couriers being involved 
the nbc report claimed that pan american world airways flights 
from frankfurt were used in a cyprusbased operation to fly 
informants and suitcases of heroin from the middle east to detroit 
without security checks and that a courier might have been tricked 
into taking aboard the airliner a bomb that had been subsituted for 
drugs 
michael jones pan ams security manager at londons heathrow 
airport the last stop of flight 103 told the dumfries inquiry 
wednesday that the airlines security was second only to that of el 
al the israeli airline 
sixty warnings and threats had been received by pan am world 
airways so far this year said jones 
he said pan am frequently received warnings bulletins and even 
direct threats in the months leading up to the lockerbie bombing

shark took his arm in its jaws and shook him like a pit bull a

watching a movie it just came up and latched on and wouldnt let 
go

the shark apparently came up and shook him like a pit bull 
said brevard county firerescue spokesman mark francesconi

a tourniquet until an offduty paramedic fishing in the area 
arrived and bandaged the wound 
spratt 50 of melbourne beach was in stable condition 
wednesday at holmes regional medical center in melbourne after 
surgery for severe lacerations to his arm hospital official said

john holtyn moved in with his daughter wednesday 
a day after his tidy home burned in in a devils night arson fire 
francine smith watched her garage burn after saving the family 
cars 
the holtyns and ms smith believe they were among the victims of 
arsonists who celebrated the illegal holiday tradition known as 
devils night by setting scattered blazes citywide 
firefighters and thousands of blockwatchers remained on guard 
for the tail end of the fire spree wednesday night and appeared to 
be winning few fires were spotted by reporters driving around the 
fogshrouded city or reported by citizen patrol groups 
thirtyfour youths were arrested for violating a special curfew 
police said 
although devils night is oct 30 the night before halloween 
arson fires also are set the night before and the night after 
tonights halloween and the basic thing were trying to do is 
make sure the kids are safe said volunteer patrol organizer ray 
wright 
fire and police officials on wednesday refused to discuss the 
number of fires set mayor coleman young said the number would be a 
revealed a news conference thursday or friday 
last year the mayors office reported 223 fires between oct 29 
and oct 31 with 115 of those on oct 30 leaders of the 
firefighters union who backed a young opponent in last years 
mayoral contest counted there were 412 fires over the three days 
the unions count included blazes in rubbish and in trash bins the 
city counted only structure fires 
the worst devils night came in 1984 when 810 fires were set 
over three days 
this years fires left a haze over some commuter routes and cut 
visibility to six miles at the city airport late tuesday 
on the surface its very very clear that we still have a 
devils night problem young said wednesday but those problems 
are much more under control today than they were 
the holtyns moved to their daughters house on wednesday holtyn 
said vandals torched the vacant house next door and the flames 
spread to his home

started burning said john holtyn 65 
ms smith clutched her nightgown as she watched flames she 
believed to be intentionally set destroy her garage and spread to 
another next door whats wrong with people anyway she asked 
wednesday 
patrol organizer wright said he saw only one small fire in his 
neighborhood down from six area blazes the same night a year ago 
were trying to really go for zero tolerance for any kind of 
incidents like that well be out again tonight he said 
wednesday 
wright said his patrol group seized one youth and took him to 
the police station he was pouring gas he was trying to set a 
garage on fire he said 
blockwatchers in some neighborhoods reported no vandalism in 
this area we had none not one brush fire said patrol captain 
sims charlemagne whose group represents 20000 residents living 
near the citys western border 
in southwest and northwest detroit we have now buried devils

involved mostly vacant uninsured properties

off by the soviets and others as an expensive failure apparently is 
alive and spying after all

miles high then a computer programmer in canada followed a trail

satellite launched from the shuttle atlantis on march 1

toronto who took the observations of three other satellite 
observers and tracked its course backward to the hushhush launch

higher oil prices caused by the persian gulf crisis 
are giving alternative energy sources another day in the sun but 
they still are too expensive to generate much enthusiasm 
officials and commentators in the united states and japan the 
countries with the greatest appetites for imported oil are urging 
greater use of alternative energy 
price minister toshiki kaifu recently told parliament the 
government was making a vigorous effort to ensure stable energy 
supplies by securing petroleum sources and promoting the 
development and use of alternative energy sources 
most alternatives still are too costly or technologically 
troublesome for largescale use however despite the increase in 
oil prices since iraq seized kuwait on aug 2 
nuclear coal and natural gas are competitive to oil but when 
it comes to new energy it will take a long time because of 
technical problems and problems of economy said toyoaki ikuta 
president of the institute of energy economics 
the problems of economy might be solved by higher prices but 
the technical problems cant be solved as quickly he said 
japans need for new sources first became clear with the 1973 
arab oil embargo which quadrupled prices the government began the 
sunshine project a research program on such technologies as solar 
energy and coal liquefaction 
four years later the government followed with the moonlight 
project for technologies like fuel cells a process to produce 
electricity from a chemical reaction 
annual budgets of the projects total about 400 million 
some of the biggest names in japanese industry including 
mitsubishi sumitomo yamaha and toshiba are developing wind 
turbines fuel cells and photovoltaic solar energy converters 
which use sunlight to convert protons into electrons to produce 
electricity 
obayashi corp is pioneering a super energy conservation 
building it claims needs only a quarter the energy of ordinary 
buildings 
about 2 million home solar water heaters countless solar cell 
batteries and many other cleanenergy products suggest new 
technologies deserve some credit for cutting japans dependence on 
imported oil which has fallen from about threefourths of total 
energy needs in 1973 to less than 60 percent 
analysts say that is not the case 
liquid natural gas nuclear power coal and conservation by 
industry are the main reasons for reduced dependence on oil 
according to a study by masukawa shigehiko a business 
administration professor at bunri college 
the government estimates new energy sources will provide only 5 
percent of total needs by the end of this decade largely because 
of technical problems including the unreliability of energy that 
varies with the weather 
price is a constant obstacle 
wind power is competitive at current oil prices but solar and 
fuel cells are not expected to be competitive until the 21st 
century said hidetatsu inaba of the new energy foundation which 
is linked to the government 
oil prices of 50 to 60 a barrel might begin to make solar 
power more attractive said yoshizo yasuda a senior managing 
director at kyocera corp which produces photovoltaic solar cells 
despite recent remarks by kaifu and others about the importance 
of alternative energy sources there has been no new japanese 
government funding or initiatives since the gulf crisis began 
the iraqkuwait situation is still only a shortterm problem 
so we arent thinking of changing the longterm plan an official 
of the ministry of international trade and industry said speaking 
on condition of anonymity

witch doctors told story musara his 
stomach distended to double the size of a football was bewitched 
westerntrained doctors said the 36yearold office clerk had 
cirrhosis of the liver and his bloated belly was a symptom 
evil spirits casting spells was the more believable diagnosis to 
musara the product of a culture steeped in superstition but both 
healers prescribed similar treatment tablets and herbs rich in 
vitamin b and lay off those nine bottles of beer a day 
it doesnt really matter what the diagnosis is just as long 
as the treatment is right said dr chris mccormick who treated 
musara you should never disbelieve the power of traditional 
african medicine 
about fourfifths of the 95 million people in this southern 
african nation prefer the mystical rituals and elixirs to western 
medicine according to a study by the university of zimbabwe 
in the last decade the witch doctors called nangas have 
regained some of the respect they enjoyed in ancient african 
culture 
zimbabwe is one of the few african countries to give them 
official status through the 24000member zimbabwe national 
traditional healers association the association was formed soon 
after independence in 1980 
during british colonial rule in what was called rhodesia white 
settlers condemned witch doctors as pagans and devil worshippers 
nine decades of laws against witchcraft reduced the number of 
people learning traditional medicine and rapid deforestation after 
independence made the 500 varieties of healing plants in zimbabwe 
more difficult to find 
its unfortunate so much has been lost said gordon 
chavunduka head of the healers association and a university 
professor of sociology 
there was once a time when people had a pain they just walked 
into the bush and picked the plant the whole country is our source 
for medicine and many of us dont realize that 
the rediscovery of herbal medicine stems from the high cost of 
modern medical treatment as well as tradition 
a bottle of 30 vitamin c tablets costs the equivalent of 325 
nearly a days pay for the average worker visiting a 
westerntrained doctor costs up to 10 just for the consultation 
going to a nanga on the other hand costs 250 to 5 
depending on the illness and form of treatment 
joseph harrison a 49yearold nanga says many of his remedies 
were passed down through generations of his family and new ones 
come from his dreams 
two of harrisons remedies are hloni an animal quill that 
when pressed to a patients forehead discourages enemies from 
seeking revenge and a yellow powder he describes as the best 
aphrodisiac in southern africa 
traditional medicine is practiced in many african countries 
witch doctors in central africa suture wounds with the snapping 
jaws of live soldier ants in tanzania and uganda traditional 
healers treat epilepsy and blindness with herbs 
zimbabwean nangas in feather headdresses claim they can heal 
ailments ranging from sprains to cancer and mental disorders by 
throwing bones chanting incantations and stirring mixtures of 
herbs and animal parts 
mccormick the physician who treated musara said part of the 
witch doctors success was attributable to the belief of their 
patients 
i know of several people who have been cured because of their 
blind faith in traditional healing he said 
sometimes that faith can have tragic consequences 
in the reception room of a township clinic a few miles southwest 
of harare 6yearold regis nyamba lay on a bench his head swollen 
to four times normal size by encephalitis that had made him 
permanently retarded 
he had been taken to a nanga 
regis could be a healthy boy today if he came to my clinic 
first said a physician treating hin who asked not to be 
identified healers will have a bash at something and if it 
doesnt work they send the patient to me by then it is often too 
late 
regular doctors accuse traditional healers of being unhygienic 
and using untested medicines 
a zimbabwean aids victim claimed he contracted the deadly virus 
from a nanga who used a contaminated razor in treating him 
nangas accuse westerntrained physicians of arrogant 
intellectualism 
some western doctors dont understand that part of the success 
behind traditional medicine is the interplay of the spiritual and 
physical worlds said chavunduka head of the healers 
association

they circled through st patricks cathedral 
lutheran and roman catholic clergy women in white cassocks men in 
black along a left aisle then the center singing lift high the 
cross 
the processional showing both the new basic cohesion and 
lingering external variations of the two traditions opened a 
special service last sunday marking the 25th anniversary of 
lutheranroman catholic dialogue 
this truly is the day that the lord has made cardinal john 
oconnor roman catholic archbishop of new york told the mixed 
throng of about 2000 worshippers 
lutheran bishop william lazareth head of the metropolitan new 
york synod of the evangelical lutheran church in america led the 
assembly in a joint confession of faith 
we do the people chorused to each of a series of questions 
about beliefs in god his manifestation in jesus christ and work of 
forgiving grace for humanity 
lazareth said catholics and lutherans whose 16th century 
founder martin luther led the protestant break from rome have come 
closer together in official doctrine regardless of various 
patterns of ethical discipline 
such diversity was evident in the contrasting makeup of about 
200 clergy on hand the catholics all men to which that church 
limits ordination while lutheran clergy included both women and 
men 
but they all walked together on this occasion and a woman 
lutheran minister her cassock tied with a red sash took the high 
pulpit to read the gospel from john 83136 beginning 
jesus then said to the jews who had believed in him if you 
continue in my word you are truly my disciples and you will know 
the truth and the truth will make you free 
the lutherancatholic talks longest running of several 
protestantcatholic dialogues began in 1965 near the close of the 
second vatican council and its sweeping roman catholic reforms 
it has been a remarkable history of interchurch 
relationship says the rev h george anderson president of 
luther college in decorah iowa and longtime lutheran cochairman 
of the dialogue team 
as the team launched a new round of talks at a recent meeting in 
erlanger ky anderson was succeeded by lutheran bishop harold 
skillrud of atlanta cochairman for the catholics is archbishop j 
francis stafford of denver 
we are moving organically with our various topics says 
stafford noting that the team now is taking up ways the two 
churches use scripture and tradition 
on once sharply dividing issues including those that caused the 
16th century split in christianity the talks have found broad 
areas of convergence and consensus 
excerpts from several of these agreements were read at the st 
patricks services interspersed with prayers hymns psalms and an 
exchange among worshipers of peace be with you and christ be 
with you 
behold how good it is and how pleasant where brothers and 
sisters dwell as one the congregation recited from psalm 133 
in the 16th century split key protestant demands were summed up 
in slogans such as only christ as mediator not mary or saints 
only scripture as authority not tradition and only faith 
not works as justifying salvation 
reconciling understandings have been found on all those matters 
despite continuing differences in emphasis 
one of the first agreements came shortly after the talks began 
on the nicene creed setting forth basic christian beliefs and 
affirmed both by catholics and lutherans as well as most major 
protestant denominations 
concurring statements came in 1970 on holy communion or the 
eucharist and on ministry and in 1978 on church teaching 
authority affirming that christ preserves the church in truth 
and in which lutherans recognize value in a modified papacy 
an accord in 1983 on justification by faith affirms that 
salvation comes only through faith in christs free gift 
adding that faith results in good works the statment adds yet 
the justified cannot rely on their own good work or merits as 
though they were not still in need of mercy 
a 1990 report on one mediator the saints and mary still to 
be released in full says both catholics and lutherans agree on 
the unique mediatorship of christ and see that as guiding views 
of the saints and mary 
lazareth noted that catholics see some church teachings as 
infallible while lutherans prefer to speak of the churchs 
indefectability in referring to gods preserving it from errors 
on essentials 
such differences should not preclude a closer union than now 
exists between these two churches he said 
oconnor said past battles sometimes have blinded the churches 
to the basic condition of our understandings and of our unity 
that unity for which christ himself prayed at the last supper 
pleading with his father that all may be one 
in unison the two bishops catholic and lutheran intoned 
blessings to the people

most wizards make magic with 
wands crystal balls or an old potion or two 
paulo coelho doesnt buy that hokey stuff he makes literary 
magic with a toshiba personal computer 
coelho a newwave sorcerer with a touch for turning yarns of 
witchcraft and mysticism into bestselling books has in one magic 
leap become brazils no 1 literary sensation his three novels 
brida diary of a wizard and the alchemist have been 
brazils top best sellers for more than two months 
the trio soon to be translated into four languages have sold 
more than 13 million copies and grossed almost 1 million in two 
years in a nation where half of the population of 150 million is 
illiterate 
this is a divine gift from the spirits beyond crooned 
coelho sitting barefoot on a black couch with leopard fur pillows 
in his beachfront apartment his legs crossed and arms extended in 
the lotus position to attract positive forces 
maybe so but coelho has cleverly tapped into brazilians 
traditional love of african voodoostyle cults generally lumped 
together under the term macumba and descended from yoruba and bantu 
religions practiced by slaves 
some 90 million brazilians of all races and classes for years 
have freely mixed elements of the predominant roman catholicism 
with native indian faiths european witchcraft and spiritism to 
form the uniquely brazilian cults 
last year nationwide sales of occult books grew twice as fast 
as all others with coelho leading the blitz 
magic is inside all of us the author says we can all use 
it to find happiness i merely bring this idea to the peoples 
eyes 
the message has struck a deep chord in a public mired in 
fourdigit inflation deteriorating social services and rising 
unemployment 
coelhos latest novel brida a steamy tale of a young irish 
woman named brida ofern who is initiated as a witch in spains 
pyrenees mountains was panned outright by major magazines as an 
esoteric poorly written jumble of metaphysical tales drowned in 
diffuse mysticism 
but brazilians love it the 100000 first edition copies sold 
out in weeks as the book roared to top of bestseller lists a 
second edition is due out to meet soaring demand 
even president fernando collor de mello and economy minister 
zelia cardoso de mello are avid fans having read all three books 
theyve even called coelho on several occasions 
the more society becomes materialistic the more people search 
for spiritual fulfillment said nelson motta a rio cultural 
editor coelhos books are about just that the search for the 
soul 
coelho born in rio on aug 24 1947 appears to be a man torn 
between modernday logic and ancient superstition 
after earning a law degree at rios candido mendes college he 
became a buddist harekrishna child of god and shintoist and 
indulged in just about every hallucinogenic drug known 
coelho tried to be a playwright journalist and musician but 
nothing clicked he said until he experimented with black magic 
and demons called on him in his copacabana apartment one night in 
1974 
it was two days of horror said coelho his eyes brimming 
with tears but my destiny was forever marked 
in 1981 he said he felt a craving for the forces sold all 
his belongings and toured western europe morocco and transylvania 
romania by car with 17000 in cash in his pockets 
during a visit to the dachau nazi concentration camp in munich 
germany coelho says a spirit appeared before him and persuaded him 
to become a fullfledged wizard 
during the fiveyear initiation coelho roamed the far corners 
of the earth from the pyramids of egypt the sahara desert and 
the atacema desert in chile to elvis presleys graceland mansion 
in memphis tenn 
in 1986 he completed his oath walking six hours a day for 70 
days from the pyrenees mountains along the sacred path of 
spains northern coast to the city of santiago de compostela 
coelho says the regnum agnus mundi order is an honorary sacred 
society of wizards founded in 1492 by a group of magicians in a 
tiny village in northern spain 
he drew on his travels to write the the alchemist and 
diary of a wizard both of which are now in their 39th 
editions 
today coelho hardly cuts the image of a wizard he sports 
running shoes bleached jeans tshirt and leather jacket silver 
bracelet and a butterfly tattoo on his left forearm 
the only drug he takes now is aspirin his saltandpepper hair 
and fu man chu beard are kept meticulously trimmed 
coelhos home office smacks of corporate taste architect lamps 
chordless telephone computer file cabinets fax and answering 
machine with a message giving callers a spiritual blessing 
only the framed wizard diploma from the spanish order regnum 
agnus mundi his 18thcentury steel sword and wooden serpent 
scepter hint the presence of a sorcerer 
his manner direct and disarming coelho has mastered media 
promotion one tv talk show host recently asked what powers he 
possessed and coelho responded wryly i can control the wind 
just let me know what direction and ill pucker up and blow 
but coelho doesnt take the spirits lightly three times a day 
he locks himself in a room sitting crosslegged and wearing his 
black cape to meditate 
despite the deluge of fan mail and phone calls from bankers 
stock brokers and corporate executives asking for spiritual advice 
coelho refuses to give private sessions read cards or palms or 
tell fortunes 
if i opened a magic school or started my own religion id be 
rich he said but the spirits would strike me down if i did

every fifth election highprofile national 
politicians rediscover the candidates in the lowprofile campaigns 
for seats in the state legislatures 
this is one of those years 
with congressional redistricting coming up intense costly 
campaigns shaped and subsidized by the national parties are being 
waged for swing seats in targeted legislatures 
there are 6144 legislative seats at stake in 46 states on 
tuesday if fewer than 50 of those seats change parties in just 
the right branches of just the right legislatures it could have a 
marked impact on congressional elections for the next decade 
thats why vice president dan quayle had lunch one day last week 
at an elegant home in suburban philadelphia an exclusive 
2500andup affair that bankrolled a final campaign push by 
candidates seeking to hold the narrow republican edge in the 
pennsylvania state senate the republican national committee said 
the event raised 150000 
president bush ronald reagan and cabinet members also have 
been active in the republican drive to elect more legislators 
looking for leverage when political draftsmen sit down next year to 
chart new congressional districts 
theres never been a cycle where weve seen the white house so 
actively involved said norman cummings political director of 
the republican national committee 
nineteen house seats will be shifted to reflect the 1990 census 
most of them into southern and sun belt states where republicans 
have run strong in national elections eight states will be gaining 
house seats 13 will be losing them and all the political maps 
will have to be redrawn for 1992 congressional elections 
a state redistricting plan must pass each branch of the 
legislature then be signed by the governor the party that 
controls all three steps can draw district lines that favor its 
congressional candidates the party that holds one of the three can 
bargain for better terms 
both bush and quayle have campaigned for gop candidates for the 
florida senate now narrowly democratic democrats are battling to 
reverse narrow gop majorities in the senates of michigan indiana 
and ohio and to hold their edge in illinois 
in two of the biggest reapportionment gainers california with 
seven new house seats and texas with three democrats have solid 
legislative control both are electing governors to succeed 
retiring republicans in florida which gains four seats a gop 
governor is in a close contest for reelection 
overall democrats dominate the legislatures and theyve waged 
an intensive campaign to keep it that way tim dickson executive 
director of their redistricting campaign project 500 said the 
national party has invested well over 1 million in targeted 
legislative races this year with most of the money spent early in 
the year on things like polling opposition research consultants 
and campaign planning 
with those sophisticated techniques spreading down the ticket 
the cost of legislative campaigning is going up everywhere there 
are television commercials computerized mass mailings telephone 
banks with automated messages all the tools and tactics of modern 
campaigning 
ohio gov richard f celeste said when he first ran for the 
legislature 20 years ago his campaign cost 9000 now we have 
state senate elections where they spend half a million he said 
democrats control both legislative branches in 29 states 
republicans in 8 with 12 legislatures divided between the parties 
nebraskas one house is nonpartisan 
the democrats are trying to reverse narrow gop margins in some 
contests crucial to redistricting among them pennsylvanias 
senate where a democratic gain of three seats would turn it 
around 
democratic gov robert p casey is a runaway favorite for 
reelection and that compounds the problem for republicans his 
ticket strength could help some democratic legislative candidates 
and because of his lead state campaign funds that would go into a 
closer gubernatorial test have been trickling down into legislative 
contests 
republican cummings said much the same thing is happening in new 
york where democratic gov mario cuomo is headed toward landslide 
reelection and the gop is trying to hold the state senate 
new york will draw new lines for 31 congressional districts 
after its likely loss of three house seats in reapportionment the 
new congressional map will have to be approved by each branch of 
the legislature and signed by the governor holding control of the 
senate would give the republicans a bargaining position in dealing 
with a reelected cuomo and a democratic assembly they cant draw 
the map but they could veto it 
their situation in pennsylvania is similar 
pennsylvania i believe loses two congressional seats 
quayle said at a campaign stop in media pa they should come 
from democratic districts thats where the population has eroded 
but if in fact theres gerrymandering going on obviously 
republican congressmen are going to be in serious jeopardy 
thats why this election is so important

covering the television industry is a lot 
like being stuck in a twin peaks episode specifically the one 
from last season in which a dancing midget spoke in reverse 
not that there is an unusual number of short people in the tv 
business its just that mostly they talk in doublespeak 
networks trot out stars and shows sing their praises in press 
conferences and then get rid of them the next day 
programming executives get kicked upstairs only to do the same 
job they did before except now they have bigger more confusing 
titles 
as a reporter trying to get the head of network programming on 
the phone for an interview means entering reporter hell 
if its something that behooves cbs nbc abc or fox 
broadcasting co chances are you can get say brandon tartikoff 
with his new title of president nbc entertainment group on the 
blower in a nanosecond 
behooves as in id like to interview brandon on how nbc is 
the greatest network in the history of the modern world 
ask a probing question as in what is abc going to do about 
cop rock a ratings bomb that costs big bucks to produce and 
network entertainment president robert iger says what weve got 
working here is a complicated blend of vested interests 
in all fairness the men who control primetime programming for 
televisions four broadcast networks have big powerful 
timeconsuming positions talking to reporters is not a daily 
priority keeping your job is 
you know youre in a shaky business when the most senior network 
entertainment head is 39 years old and has been on the job less 
than two years abcs iger 
with the exception of cbs jeff sagansky who took over as 
entertainment president less than a year ago the network 
entertainment programmers will from time to time sit down for an 
indepth interview with a reporter 
when he does the two are not alone the head of publicity also 
is present just in case the programming chief misspeaks mostly 
its in case the reporter misspeaks in his or her story misspeaks 
meaning not just a factual error but telling the unvarnished 
truth 
this is what makes television journalism different and more 
frustrating than covering the local zoning board for example 
each network has a dizzying array of publicists whose jobs 
consist of making sure that reporters dont bother busy network 
executives with dumb questions and that all information supplied 
by the networks is cast in the most positive of lights ie avoid 
candor at all costs 
shows are not canceled they are placed on hiatus stars do 
not quit or get fired they have creative differences with 
whom is not always clear programs do not have poor ratings they 
have breakout potential or valuable demographics 
television is not alone in its attempt to put spin control on 
every utterance tv did not invent oliver norths plausible 
deniabilty or write george bushs infamous read my lips no 
higher taxes promise 
covering politics too is fraught with obstacles to the truth 
so is the cop beat the window dressing in television however 
boggles the mind the networks dont try to conceal their courting 
of good publicity they revel in it 
each year they get together and sponsor the press tour in which 
tv columnists and writers from across the country gather in los 
angeles to be wined dined and spoonfed celebrity interviews for 
three weeks straight 
advance tapes of upcoming television programs arrive by the 
mailbag fox recently sent tv critics a minature high school locker 
crammed with gourmet cookies to promote its new teen fantasy show 
parker lewis cant loose 
the home network of the simpsons also dispatched a box full 
of simpsons dolls simpson bumperstickers and simpson masks to 
herald the fall premiere of its hugely successful cartoon series 
hey if youve got the money spend it business is business 
after all if such trinkets can endear a network to the stoney 
heart of a tv critic more power to fox 
except none of this heightens anyones job performance it 
doesnt result in better programming or better reporting about the 
world of television or easier access to the people who make the 
ultimate decisions about what is beamed into your living room 
it does however blur all the lines between reality and 
fantasy leaving the networks with the mistaken impression that if 
they put enough gloss on it and dish out enough money they can 
control every aspect of tv including what is written about it 
all of this makes about as much sense as the new seasons opener 
of twin peaks in which a giant offered a profound clue to 
finding the murderer of laura palmer 
the owls are not what they seem said the extremely tall 
man 
 
elsewhere in television 
fox makes a tv movie working trash the fox broadcasting 
cos first original tv movie debuts nov 26 and stars george 
carlin ben stiller and leslie hope

at the ridge grocery here jack ricketsons 
behindthecounter observations confirm what polls and pundits say 
southerners want lotteries just like everybody else 
ricketson and his wife doris whose tiny store sits on a hilltop 
five miles from the north carolina line sell livestock feed 
groceries and chances in virginias state lottery 
most players spend a dollar or two on the games but folks 
passing through from other parts of the south typically bet more 
as much as 20 
its cause they dont have it ricketson says meaning a 
lottery 
it appears much more of the bible belt will have it in the 
aftermath of this falls elections georgians will elect a lottery 
backer whichever gubernatorial candidate they pick tuesday 
louisianans last month repealed a constitutional ban on lotteries 
a prolottery initiative in arkansas was favored in opinion 
polls but was knocked off tuesdays ballot by an oct 26 state 
supreme court decision 
only three southern states virginia florida and kentucky 
are among the 32 sponsoring lotteries now but traditional 
opposition even in fundamentalist areas shows signs of eroding 
will every state in dixie eventually offer the games 
i think so says duke university economics professor philip 
cook an authority on lotteries the polls as a rule show strong 
support 
carolyn shaw hopes such predictions are wrong shes with the 
georgia council on moral and civic concerns which is using 
speeches and mass mailings to try to slow the momentum for a 
lottery 
its as bad as having an illegal numbers racket in your 
state she says its wrong to have the state doing that 
besides she said lotteries can become addictive can victimize 
the poor and can discourage the public from supporting needed 
taxation for the functions such as education that the games often 
support 
the moral stigma attached to gambling can still be felt 
at ross general store in the florida panhandle town of century 
many of the cars which crowd the parking lot when theres a big 
lotto jackpot bear license plates from neighboring alabama yet 
even while laying down a wad of bills for tickets some customers 
swear theyre against the game says loretta hawthorne the store 
manager 
theyll come in here late at night and buy em and tell you 
theyre for somebody else she says with a smile 
louisiana voters in october overturned a lottery ban prompted by 
a notoriously corrpt game a century ago opponents decry the new 
version as a bloodsucker but supporters say it will add tens 
of millions of dollars in revenue to the economically depressed 
state 
in georgia surveys of voters have found as much as 72 percent 
support for a lottery the candidates in tuesdays gubernatorial 
election democrat zell miller and republican johnny isakson 
debate how not whether georgias lottery should operate proceeds 
will go to education both say 
the fight moves next to the legislature the atlanta 
constitution has editorialized a lottery is a poor way to raise 
public money clearly however georgia is going to have a 
lottery 
arkansas came close to a lottery vote opponents challenged its 
constitutionality and the state supreme court less than two weeks 
ago struck the ballot proposal ruling its wording was incomplete 
in mississippi gov ray mabus backs a lottery to help pay for a 
180 million package of school reforms in the last legislative 
session the state senate turned down a housepassed bill to let 
voters decide on a lottery 
north carolinas state senate passed a lottery measure for the 
first time in the last session but the house never voted on it 
lottery bills have gotten nowhere in alabama tennessee and south 
carolina 
professor cook says historic opposition to lotteries in the 
south and elsewhere has been led mainly by governors and 
legislative leaders who were resisting the will of the majority 
in taking that position cook is coauthor with charles 
clotfelter of the book selling hope state lotteries in 
america both teach at duke in durham nc 
recalling the lottery referendum in florida cook says they 
do have their fundamentalist region but every region of the state 
voted for it 
people see it as innocuous he says 
mores of society change says bruce r smith publisher of 
gaming amp wagering business a trade publication sincere people 
in their beliefs who were opposed to gaming in any form 30 years 
ago are probably still opposed to it today whether they have the 
same kind of strength i really wouldnt know 
support for lotteries is documented in dollars for the fiscal 
year ended in june state lottery sales totalled 202 billion 
according to smith about half goes to payouts and after 
administrative costs roughly 37 percent on average is state 
profit 
when proceeds go to useful purposes such as education or 
programs for the elderly that becomes part of lotteries appeal 
says saul leonard of laventhal and horwath a philadelphiabased 
business consulting firm that produces an annual report on the 
gambling industry 
another selling point is that people have been gambling since 
time immemorial leonard says indeed in the south lotteries 
were staged 120 years ago to provide for disabled confederate 
veterans 
but the basic reason lotteries are spreading isnt their 
familiarity or noble goals its greed something that no region 
lacks 
as leonard puts it people do like to hope for that pot of 
gold at the end of the rainbow

it was a quiet night at king tuts wahwah hut 
bar if quiet is the word for an east village saloon where 
tattooed toughs gather to booze play pool and listen to heavy 
metal 
gradually a very different crowd filtered in they wore 
tshirts with the legend queer nation emblazoned over a map of 
the united states and settled in under the ultravioletlit 
painting of a skull on fire 
a beefy pool player was about to take a shot when he noticed a 
pair of the newcomers standing beside him his jaw dropped 
the two men were kissing mouth to mouth 
oh no oh no the man with the cue cried retreating in 
revulsion to the other side of the table stop that 
they ignored him this was why they had come to agitate to 
confront people they blame for an increase in attacks on 
homosexuals they are queer nation one of several militant gay 
organizations which have discarded polite persuasion in favor of 
grabthembythelapels defiance 
there are queer nation chapters in san francisco los angeles 
boston detroit philadelphia providence toronto boulder colo 
and ithaca ny fourhundred people attend biweekly meetings in 
new york 
where groups like the gay mens health crisis responded to aids 
by lobbying for help and by providing services to sufferers the 
new generation actup the aids coalition to unleash power 
takes to the streets 
actup has thrown bagels and noodles at a hotel where president 
bush was appearing blocked wall street disrupted services in st 
patricks cathedral all protests against what it claims is 
political business and religious indifference to the epidemic 
it is a whole new attitude said randy shilts a national 
correspondent for the san francisco chronicle and author of the 
critically acclaimed account of the aids crisis and the band 
played on 
the new militants are rebelling against straight society but 
also against older gay people said shilts 39 
it is a pattern that repeats itself in many social movements 
radicalization followed by retrenchment and new radicalization 
said jim jasper an assistant professor of sociology at new york 
university 
the newcomers become disappointed in how ossified the old 
groups are and take their own action jasper said

any faggot gets within a onefoot range im going to knock 
him out the pool player declared loudly to anyone who would 
listen 
but more militants crowded into the little room outnumbering 
the regulars were here and were queer were here and were 
queer they chanted 
the chanting grew so loud it drowned out the heavy metal music 
and the pool player who was shouting shut up shut up to no 
avail 
later outside the bar the homosexuals singled out a skinhead 
who had shouted a slur they shouted homophobe and pointed 
their fingers at him 
they left well be back and well be stronger they 
chanted and were here were queer were fabulous get used 
to it

it is safe to say that the 50 demonstrators who visited king 
tuts wahwah hut on that summer night and had staged a 
kissin at the alcatraz bar down the block earlier in the 
evening won no converts they didnt expect to 
we are breaking down the barriers of unspoken segregation 
said queer nation spokesman jay blotcher 
it isnt going to happen in a week this harkens back to the 
woolworth counter in the south and the blacks coming back again and 
again and again like them we are a disenfranchised minority 
fighting for our rights 
queer nations founders were active in actup and remain 
members we felt that there were other issues such as the 
increase in violence against gays and lesbians that had to be 
addressed said cofounder alan klein 
two of the four men who helped found queer nation had themselves 
been victims of gay bashing and klein said the group was formed 
because the men felt there was no organized response to attacks on 
homosexuals 
the group organized its first demonstration in april when a 
thousand marchers protested a pipebombing outside a gay bar that 
injured three people 
through sept 30 of this year there have been 88 antigay 
crimes in new york city said capt charles senzel of the police 
departments bias unit police said there were 47 such crimes for 
all of 1989 and 43 for 1988 
but the gay and lesbian antiviolence project which provides 
legal help and counseling for victims of gay bashing gave much 
higher figures it listed 425 antigay crimes in the city through 
the end of september compared to 338 for all of 1989 according to 
david kirschenbaum a spokesman for the group 
police said privately the wide discrepancy may be due to the 
fact that police have to prove an attack was based on the victims 
sexual orientation 
our message is gays and lesbians will no longer be silent 
victims blotcher said we are here and were a force to be 
reckoned with 
another group the pink panthers patrols streets to protect 
gays the members carry no weapons but walkietalkies cameras and 
whistles the purpose of the cameras are to photograph gay bashers 
the patrols apprehend 
the group claims 200 members all trained in selfdefense 
according to founder gerri wells and is patrolling greenwich 
village 
we will hold people for the police and we will bash back if 
necessary said ms wells a lesbian we will use equal force 
to hold a gay basher fighting to escape 
the panthers have not detained anyone since the group was formed 
in june but patrols have appeared as gays were harassed on four or 
five occasions she said the culprits ran when the pink panthers 
arrived she said 
everyone has a right to defend themselves said inspector 
paul sanderson head of the police departments bias unit the 
local patrols are good as long as they dont get out of hand if 
they grab someone whos been beating up homosexuals and hold him 
until officers arrive thats the kind of citizens action thats 
needed 
if i walk with my lover down the street i face physical or 
verbal abuse said klein thats intolerable i have to make 
important choices i have to confront that bias we have to fight 
for our rights and i think that cant be compromised 
the militants are not always so confrontational 
queer nation goes to shopping malls to distribute leaflets which 
note that gays have existed for centuries and which list some 
famous people who were homosexual the leaflets are partially aimed 
at gay youths who may be despondent or even suicidal about their 
homosexuality blotcher said 
theres no positive reinforcement from society for them he 
said all youre told is you will live a life of alienation and 
disappointment adolescents crave acceptance and this puts some of 
them over the edge 
theres nothing out there to tell the kids hey its ok 
and thats why we do this

in these touchy economic times people with 
money to manage are subjecting even supposedly safe investments to 
some painstaking scrutiny 
when they see the labels insured or guaranteed on a 
piece of financial merchandise they are increasingly asking by 
whom and against what risks 
this pickiness is only prudent many advisers on money matters 
agree given the troubled state of the nations bank industry and 
of the markets for investments ranging from real estate to stocks 
credit contraction is happening says barton biggs at wall 
streets morgan stanley amp co in a current financialstrategy 
report 
or as martin zweig a widely known investment adviser told 
subscribers to his market letter the contraction within the 
banking system is beginning to starve the economy for liquidity 
debt is way too high and is unraveling 
this doesnt mean that such peers of the forecasting realm are 
predicting the end of the world indeed they suggest as the gloom 
on wall street deepens the markets may be getting closer and closer 
to a turning point 
at the bottom of the economic cycle abundant opportunities 
traditionally arise to buy good investments cheap 
but i dont think were there yet biggs declares and the 
current slump has produced some peculiar phenomena that are causing 
reappraisals of what is safe and what is not 
the savings and loan crisis for example has raised major 
questions about how far federal deposit insurance can be stretched 
the depressed share prices of the nations biggest bank holding 
companies some of which stand at their lowest levels in a 
generation have also challenged longheld assumptions about the 
foundations of the financial system 
in this kind of environment savers and government regulators 
are wary of taking promises of safety at face value 
in the mutual fund business for example the securities and 
exchange commission has just effectively barred funds investing in 
government securities from using the words guaranteed or 
insured in their names 
the message to the public the sec said must be clear that 
government backing covers only the items such as treasury bills or 
bonds in the funds portfolios and not the funds themselves 
and the government guarantee extends only to timely payment of 
interest and principal on its obligations it offers no protection 
against fluctuations in market value that occur with the ups and 
downs of interest rates 
the sec action comes at a time when enthusiasm is running 
especially high for funds investing in government securities 
as bad as uncle sams own budget problems may be advisers say 
investors recognize that his promise to pay off on his debts is 
still as trustworthy as just about anybodys anywhere 
this is not necessarily a testimonial to governmental virtue 
rather it involves the recognition that the treasury commands vast 
resources 
unlike many other borrowers furthermore it has the power to 
print new money should its hoard ever threaten to run short 
donoghues moneyletter an advisory publication on matters of 
personal finance seemed to capture the mood of the moment with a 
recent suggestion 
all of our recommended domestic bond funds are either in us 
treasuries or in highgrade corporate bonds 
our choice of these types of funds was deliberate quality is

the information came by various routes and 
methods often by telephone or courier from sources in communist 
countries to western european friends who relayed it to the rev 
blahoslav hruby in new york 
he had developed contacts across europe before during and after 
world war ii in dramapacked experiences that enabled him to alert 
americans to communist repressions throughout the cold war 
after its end the old cold warrior a moniker he gamely 
bore died oct 22 of congestive heart failure at the age of 78 
one way or another the documents get to me he once said in 
an interview sometimes i dont know all the details of how and 
dont want to know because it might jeopardize someone but we get 
them 
a native czech presbyterian minister and wartime us army 
intelligence captain in the office of strategic services hruby for 
his last 28 years edited the monthly journal religion in communist 
dominated areas 
the interreligioussponsored journal a prime source to 
churches embassies us intelligence offices universities and 
other periodicals kept a steady revealing watch on religious 
abuses under communism 
the churches must help those who are being harassed because of 
their faith and they must tell the truth to the world he said 
often exhorting church conventions to take stronger stands against 
soviet religious persecution 
his information on arrests imprisonments and religious 
suppression gathered in smuggled documents and other roundabout 
ways focused early attention on many eventually freed prisoners 
only last july after communist rule ended in czechoslovakia 
hruby visited his homeland and met with many dissidents whose 
freedom he had worked for 
one of them now the countrys president vaclav havel thanked 
him saying you were among the few who paid attention to the 
oppressed at a time when it was not at all lucrative 
hruby who studied theology and philosophy in czechoslovakia 
switzerland france and germany was involved as a protestant 
minister in early struggles against nazism broadcasting on french 
radio to nazioccupied czechoslovakia 
he escaped from paris just before the nazi takeover and aided 
fleeing jewish refugees in marseille and later in portugal 
providing them with false baptismal certificates 
in the united states he joined the oss in 1942 and after 
assignments in washington and london served in gen george 
pattons third army and was with it when it entered czechoslovakia 
in may 1945 
after the war and the communist coup in czechoslovakia he 
returned there as a naturalized american to establish contacts with 
people devoted to democracy several close friends later were 
executed 
back in the united states he served radio free europe as editor 
and adviser on religion behind the iron curtain and later was 
european director of the american fund for czechoslovak refugees in 
munich germany 
in 1962 he launched religion in communist dominated areas 
initially under auspices of the national council of churches which 
includes most major protestant and orthodox denominations 
the council dropped the project in 1971 but the work was 
continued under a separat interreligious organization the 
research center for religion and human rights in closed societies 
i saw so much under hitlers dictatorship and what happened 
under the communists he once related i watched it with my own 
eyes he said people must never remain silent about such 
crushing of human rights 
he sometimes worried that people seemed brainwashed by 
rhetoric of detente which approves of all russias conquests and 
oppression he called such appeasing gestures a deceptive 
fraud 
however he said there always remained a spirit of resistance 
in the free world a resistance to the pressures of the communist 
bloc not only on religious freedom but on political and national 
freedoms 
hruby was regularly attacked in the communist press prior to the 
1989 collapse of communism in eastern europe he had been ailing in 
recent months and his wife olga also a czech native has served 
as the journals coeditor 
in a brief telephone conversation after communism fell he said 
its like the sun coming out there still will be plenty of 
problems after all the years of oppression but its a new chance 
now to build free societies we should all thank god

europe reported a tremendous upsurge in religious affiliation 
in yugoslavia hungary and romania 
the delegation sponsored by the appeal of conscience 
foundation said more and more people in those countries are 
turning to religion for solace and hope in the face of vast 
economic and political changes 
however the group also reported a growing chauvinism combined 
with strong religious and ethnic rivalries that threaten to 
heighten tensions and destablize new governments formed since the 
end of communist rule 
rabbi arthur schneier president of the interfaith foundation 
which works to promote religious freedom said that at a time of 
economic hardship and social upheaval many east europeans are 
turning to god but some also are turning against their 
neighbors of a different ethnic religious or national origin

families who attend religious services weekly contribute to 
charity but of those who dont worship regularly only 58 percent 
contribute to charity

the outlaws had made a sizeable dent in the 
evenings beer supply by the time charlie papazian rose to deliver 
the invocation he raised a glass of frothy ale grinned through 
his beard and led the crowd in the familiar chant 
relax dont worry have a homebrew 
up went a hundred glasses and down went the beer 
down went sal pennacchios bme porter a rich black ale with a 
toasty aroma and down went john quinns spiced brown ale redolent 
of chocolate and cinnamon down went a nutty germanstyle ale and a 
malty golden pilsener and down went several other brews that will 
never be found at your neighborhood tavern 
the beers were the star attraction at the annual dinner of the 
outlaws of homebrew one of a growing number of clubs around the 
nation devoted to home beer brewing the dinner the food was 
bratwurst and sauerkraut drew more than 100 people to brooklyn 
brewerys distribution warehouse on a dark industrial block in 
brooklyn 
its estimated that somewhere between 500000 and 1 million 
people in the united states brew their own beer homebrewing has 
been legal since 1978 and by all accounts is in the midst of a 
heady spurt of growth 
i think people are paying more attention to what theyre 
putting down their mouths said papazian whose book the 
complete joy of homebrewing is the hobbys bible 
membership in the american homebrewers association which 
papazian founded in 1978 is up 41 percent in the past year and is 
expected to top 10000 by years end there are at least 150 
homebrew clubs in the country and 1200 retail supply shops 
its growing tremendously said seth schneider the general 
manager of crosby amp baker a brewing supply manufacturer and 
distributor in westport mass were still on the steep part of a 
growth curve 
the growth in homebrewing has mirrored the development of 
microbreweries small breweries that typically devote themselves 
to fullbodied highquality beers these beers account for a 
microscopic 15 percent of the national market but loom large in 
the world of homebrewers 
there is a strong symbiotic relationship between homebrewers and 
microbrewers homebrewers are microbrewers most loyal customers 
microbrewers frequently sponsor the homebrewers organizations and 
events 
the outlaws of homebrew dinner for instance was sponsored by 
brooklyn brewery which provided the warehouse and two varieties of 
its own beer company founder steve hindy is himself a homebrewer 
who likes to tinker with recipes in his kitchen before trying them 
out in the brewery 
actually right now im brewing something i call a chocolate 
stout at home he said 
the attractions of homebrewing are several foremost is the 
ability to make good beer quality has improved mightily in the 
past decade as homebrew suppliers have become increasingly 
sophisticated 
a homebrew rivals the best beer youve ever had said 
schneider it hasnt traveled it has more body it hasnt been 
filtered and you can make it exactly to your taste 
some of those tastes are exotic some would say bizarre 
homebrewers have been known to toss all manner of ingredients into 
their brew spruce beer cherry beer and ginger beer are among the 
more common of the strange brews 
sal pennacchio treasurer of the outlaws of homebrew recalls 
what happened last november when his wife was about to toss out the 
halloween pumpkin the result was is pumpkin ale which won third 
prize in a national homebrew competition it tasted he said 
just like pumpkin pie 
i think thats the great thing about homebrewing pennacchio 
said with a little experience you can create anything you 
want 
not everyone wants a pumpkin ale of course but a more 
runofthemill brew is a simple thing to make beer essentially 
consists of malted barley yeast hops and water with those 
ingredients and a few rudimentary pieces of equipment a bucket 
some plastic tubing a siphon an airlock valve a capping tool 
and caps and bottles anyone can make beer in their kitchen 
equipment for a novice costs about 45 ingredients for two 
cases of beer run about 15 or roughly 35 cents a bottle but that 
can vary widely depending on the kind of beer being made 
a survey a few years ago by the american homebrewers association 
found that the overwhelming majority of homebrewers were white 
males somewhat to the chagrin of those who champion the hobby 
brewers also tend to be married well educated and divided almost 
evenly among cities suburbs and small towns 
the glibbest generalization said schneider would be 
adult males with facial hair 
beyond that he said hes noticed that homebrewers are 
frequently computer buffs indeed one of the busiest meeting 
places for homebrewers is on compuserve information services beer 
forum a sort of electronic saloon for personal computer 
owners 
the fact is brewers are a gregarious lot they are in their 
element at an event like the outlaws dinner drinking beer and 
swapping brewing notes with abandon 
were out for a good time said pennacchio and to have 
good beer

in this glamorous tax haven moneys playground by 
the sea the idle rich are making room for the busy bustling rich 
aristocrats still risk fortunes at the casinos velvetcovered 
tables but the 380acre principality is catering to a new breed of 
wealth and power 
it seeks the working rich who may spend a week in monaco not 
six months like the grand dukes of a century ago to check on an 
industrial investment watch the grand prix or attend a business 
convention 
on a stroll through the casino gardens youre more likely to 
meet carpet salesmen from toronto than european royalty last year 
monaco welcomed 50000 conventiongoers 
tourism now generates only onefourth of the 5 billion gross 
national product gambling once the governments mainstay brings 
in only 4 percent 
banking accounts for 35 percent and light industry 27 monaco 
now has 50 banks and more are coming 
prince rainier who has ruled since 1949 sought to preserve and 
capitalize on monacos reputation for glamor when he called for 
economic diversification 
the government has put its money behind prestige and luxury 
said a public relations officer for the principality it used to 
bank on the very rich today it has sought to develop a clientele 
of the slightly less rich 
hotel statistics are revealing monaco has 2400 rooms 80 
percent in the luxury category going for 200 to 450 fewer than 
100 rooms cost less than 50 
officials try to keep industry and tourism apart hardly any of 
the 3 million daytrippers who spilled from trains and buses last 
year went near the industrial park on fontvieille a peninsula 
reclaimed from the sea 
many of the monacos 700 industrial companies are there most 
are in such hightech nonpolluting fields as pharmaceuticals 
cosmetics and engineering 
a value added tax on the new commercial activities is the 
largest source of revenue in monacos annual budget of 510 
million 
fontvieille accommodates both factories and company 
headquarters stacked atop each other in skyscrapers nearby are a 
new sports stadium threestar hotel heliport and monacos only 
lowincome housing 
it was the brainchild of prince rainier who saw the future of 
his tiny realm in real estate a forest of skyscrapers eyesores to 
many visitors looms against a background of steep mountains 
dwarfing hillside villas built in the 19th century 
commercial or residential space in monaco generally is more 
expensive than in paris and new york a tworoom apartment in 
fontvieille rents for 3000 a month and cheaper accommodations 
are hard to find 
housing has become a major headache the government gives 
priority for stateowned housing and rent subsidies of up to 50 
percent to the natives called monegasques but demand exceeds 
supply 
many apartments are owned by investors who spend little time in 
them at night dark windows make patches on luxury highrises 
nightlife revolves around a few expensive discotheques and 
clubs and cultural events geared to the wealthy establishment 
young residents complain of little to do monaco has only one 
movie theater no discount or department stores no major shopping 
center 
there is virtually no unemployment yet monegasques about 
4500 in a population of 27000 worry about the future 
the problem is not finding jobs for young monegasques its 
finding jobs suited to their educational degrees and 
qualifications said stephane valeri 28 
he heads the association of young monegasques founded in 1986 
to handle their employment and housing problems and help them start 
businesses citizens now own less than 3 percent of commerce and 
industry in monaco but valeri said new opportunities were opening 
in services and the law 
were very attached to our history our traditions and to the 
royal family he said were just trying to make monaco better 
for the year 2000 
in addition to the myth that all ar rich which the government 
tries to dispel monegasques have a reputation as poor workers 
some monegasques adopt a superior attitude and feel they 
can get away with anything because they know they cant be fired 
a government spokesperson said on condition of anonymity 
the 5000 italians who cross the border each day to work in 
hotels and restaurants envy the privileges of monegasques 
including comprehensive health insurance higher wages and the 
first crack at vacant jobs 
residents of this fiscal paradise except for french nationals 
who have arrived since 1957 pay no taxes on income capital gains 
or on an inheritance if it comes directly from a parent or spouse 
security and respectability are basic tenets the police force 
has 400 members who help tourists direct traffic and discourage 
pursesnatching and other crimes 
monaco is the type of place where you think twice about 
dropping candy wrappers said a retired greek executive who has 
lived here 35 years you feel very safe and life is very calm 
a dress code confines bathing suits to the beach and forbids 
going barefoot shorts are permitted but men are not allowed to go 
bare chested expulsion from monaco is the punishment for 
violations 
officials know the future depends on physical expansion besides 
putting the train station underground architects unveiled plans

truth has been critically wounded 
at the very least by partisan journalism that inflames the bitter 
ethnic rivalries of this patchwork nation 
yugoslavias freewheeling press once the most open of eastern 
europe has become increasingly provincial entangled in local 
conflicts 
the trend is evident in all six yugoslav republics but the 
staterun press and television of serbia seem to lead in the way 
headlines scream hellish police hunt on serbs over accounts 
of routine investigations in croatia an article on federal reforms 
aimed at creating a market economy is introduced with serbian 
economy knifed in back 
accusations flying between communistruled serbia the largest 
republic and the freely elected governments of slovenia and 
croatia have created such animosity that yugoslavia may not 
survive 
serbs and croats the largest ethnic groups in this nation of 24 
million have been rivals since 1918 when the country was born as 
the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes it was reconstituted as 
a communist republic in 1945 
political and economic differences accentuate the ethnic 
divisions in a power struggle that began with the death in 1980 of 
josip tito who founded the postwar nation and held it together 
croatia and slovenia want yugoslavia to be a loose confederation 
of sovereign states serbia insists on a modern federation with 
power still centralized in belgrade the serbian and federal 
capital 
slobodan milosevic serbias populist leader says he will 
enlarge the republic to take in serbs from other regions if the 
federation disintegrates 
when croatian police tried to recover hundreds of guns stolen 
from government armories by local serbs banner headlines in serbia 
said croatian police throw serbian infants around and 
fascist terrorists sent to subjugate serbs 
stories below the headlines in the dailies politika and politika 
ekspres did not support the allegations they quoted 
wellinformed sources unnamed and not described echoing 
serbian claims that croatian police recruited fascist 
terrorists to harass the 500000 serbs in croatia 
poison seeps from the pages of politika in all directions 
said croatian writer slavko mihalic everybody is denounced for 
one thing or another and that includes any serbs who dare oppose 
milosevic 
media in slovenia and croatia have accused milosevic repeatedly 
of fomenting ethnic turmoil 
in the croatian parliamewnt deputy stjepan mesic waved a copy 
of politika and declared milosevic is guilty of stirring up the 
trouble in croatia 
belgrade television reported allout civil war between serbs 
and croats in croatia although no one had been killed or seriously 
injured 
to tighten the gripon serbian media milosevic and his 
communist supporters have fired or demoted hundreds of 
independentminded journalists 
after the latest round of 20 demotions the daily vjesnik in 
zagreb capital of croatia accused serbs of pushing their 
hardline concepts to the brink of intercommunal violence to avoid 
holding free elections serbia has scheduled elections for dec 
9 
civil war may be the last refuge for hardline communists 
vjesnik declared 
calls for fairness by opposition parties and independent 
journalists are ignored by serbian television and the 
oncerespected politika 
in june police with clubs broke up a demonstration against 
biased coverage beating several intellectuals and opposition 
leaders 
television did not show what happened and said protesters 
attacked the police a television newscast in croatia that included 
footage of the violence was not broadcast in belgrade 
twothirds of what the belgrade media say is lies said vuk 
draskovic head of the opposition serbian renewal movement which 
threatens to boycott the december elections unless unbiased 
coverage is guaranteed 
serbian television nicknamed milosevision in belgrade 
agreed to carry brief opposition statements it insisted all 39 
registered groups have equal time however even though only three 
have significant followings 
serbian television nicknamed milosevision by residents of 
belgrade carries short campaign speeches by opposition leaders 
only on its third channel seen in just onesixth of the republic 
ante markovic the federal premier is popular with yugoslavs 
generally but not with milosevic who objects to his 
marketoriented economic reforms and attempts to form a national 
political party 
markovic has described in the press as an enemy of the serbian 
people out to plunder our republic 
in an effort to counter such treatment the premier announced a 
weekly federal television program to present fair coverage of 
national issues tv belgrade refused to cooperate effectively 
keeping the onehour program off the air in serbia 
serbian media make their most abusive attacks on the ethnic 
albanian majority in the republics southern province kosovo 
albanians in kosovo have demonstrated regularly against 
milosevics abolition of selfrule in the province and serbian 
police have killed at least 60 in the past 18 months 
the serbian press portrays the demonstrators as terrorists 
who attack security forces with heavy machine guns and mortars 
no serbs have been killed or seriously hurt 
international human rights groups that condemn the repression 
are sworn enemies of the serbs and members of the us congress 
who visited kosovo were mercenaries in the pay of the albanian 
lobby the belgrade papers say

in its 25th year the brawny ford bronco continues to be the 
leader in the fullsize utility vehicle segment 
bronco sales may have fallen 13 percent in the 1990 model year 
but ford still sold 54505 of the hardy trucks sales for the 
category as a whole meanwhile dropped 20 percent 
introduced in august 1965 as a 1966 model the bronco won early 
raves for its mix of car and truck attributes and its ability to 
offer both utility and personal transportation its biggest year 
was 1978 when 82343 broncos were sold in the 1980s ford began 
producing a smaller version the bronco ii which ford replaced 
with the 1991 explorer 
the test vehicle a 1991 silver anniversary bronco carries on 
the tradition of the original 
the lowest part of the door opening was at my knee level there 
was no handle to help me climb up and inside so i had to grip the 
steering wheel and hoist myself in it wasnt graceful it was a 
challenge 
the engine was a gashogging 58liter v8 that got about 13 
miles per gallon in mixed cityhighway driving coupled with a 
fourspeed automatic transmission it produced 200 horsepower 
the bronco operated in both twowheel and fourwheel drive i 
just pushed a button on the dash to go from one to the other since 
the front wheels had automatic locking hubs fourwheel drive 
allowed me to climb over everything though the offroad ride was 
quite bouncy as i hit rocks and potholes 
twowheel drive also offered a rather mushy ride and it took 
some planning to make turns without going over curbs and hitting 
tree limbs the broncos rear antilock brakes worked wonderfully 
keeping the large rear end from swaying out of control in sudden 
stops 
inside there was plenty of room for anyone to stretch out in 
the two front bucket seats a huge deep storage box in addition 
to a regular glovebox on the dashboard was located between the 
seats and kept frontseat passengers a good distance apart 
letters and numbers on dashboard gauges were large and easy to 
read but i did have a problem finding the power window and door 
lock buttons at night the buttons were on the lower half of the 
doors but they were not lit 
the broncos front seats leaned forward to allow passengers to 
climb up and into the rear seat area the door openings were wide 
allowing good access but i had to give the front seatbacks a 
really good shove to return them to their locked position 
the rear bench seat was cushioned and comfortable for two adults 
but might be a bit confining for three goodsized adults since the 
seat is squeezed between the vehicles two wheel wells 
the rear cargo area behind the seat was spacious and nicely 
carpeted and you could fold up and take out the rear seat for even 
more storage area but watch the tailgate its big and heavy and 
requires both hands for a smaller person to handle 
fit and finish on the test truck was good save for some grease 
that oozed up from where the transmission shifter attached to the 
steering column 
bronco buyers are predominantly men 822 percent and married 
734 percent ford spokesman woody haines said california has the 
highest bronco usage followed by illinois michigan florida new 
jersey and texas 
most bronco buyers have annual household income of between 
30000 and 45000 nearly a third have some college education 
and 133 percent are in managerial jobs haines said 
he added that the major competitor is the chevrolet suburban 
which starts at more than 15600 for a base model the test 25th 
anniversary bronco had a base price of 24866 but the 
lowestpriced bronco starts at 18195 according to haines 
consumer reports magazine ranked the 1988 bronco average in 
owner reports of trouble

to cable news network turner network 
television and headline news media mogul ted turner has added yet 
another building block atop his tv empire 
you can find in the supermarket checkout line 
no its not tv guide but it is near the national enquirer 
you know how it is youre stuck behind someone with an 
overburdened cart waiting patiently to purchase your piddling pile 
of groceries theyre writing a check youve got cash 
what to do 
watch television 
in 13 stores across the country the atlantabased turner 
broadcasting system and connecticutbased actmedia have just 
completed an unprecedented sixweek test in which tv monitors were 
installed in every checkout line 
it provides the latest example of how far turner will go in 
attempting to create his own global village it also represents a 
new marketing tool brilliant in its simplicity 
what better way to sell something than to flash it before the 
eyes of a captive consumer audience 
some of the networks hemmed and hawed said wayne locurto 
president and chief executive officer of actmedia turner went 
bonkers 
pushing products on people going nowhere in a hurry is nothing 
new efforts are underway to pipe television and advertising into 
doctors waiting rooms 
but turner and actmedia are the first to beam live television 
into grocery stores 
the checkout channel as they call it works like this 
tv monitors with builtin sound sensors blink on whenever 
someone stands in line on the tube are eightminute segments 
culled from cnns headline news each segment contains two minutes 
of commercials during the daytime the spots are tailored to 
women in the evenings they are geared to working couples and 
singles on the weekend they are family oriented 
one of teds missions is to have cnn available everywhere all 
the time said scott weiss vice president of special products 
for tbs we have a division that has licensed cnn for use in 
hotels and airlines 
rest easy to date there are no plans to pipe the 24hour news 
channel into public restrooms 
but no place it seems is forever safe from the intrusion of 
the boob tube and attempts to make bigger advertising bucks 
we are exploring every opportunity where you might find 
yourself standing in line with nothing to do weiss said 
the concept for the checkout channel originated at actmedia 
locurto said and was offered to the major networks only turner 
however was ready to put up money immediately 
at a cost of 75 million actmedia one of the countrys largest 
instore advertising firms installs the hardware tbs at a cost 
it wont disclose provides the programming 
to do so turner assembled a new department of about 30 editors 
writers and producers to furnish the 24hour channel with its 
eightminute the average wait in the checkout line segments via 
satellite 
each installment is updated as news events dictate and the 
channel can go live with major breaking stories 
the test period ended two days before halloween for the next 
few months turner and actmedia will review the channels 
performance confer with advertisers and store managers and try to 
make sure all are happy 
if actmedias revenue projections prove true everyone should 
be 
the advertising firm has estimated that the channel will bring 
in 100 million annually by 1993 
actmedia plans to equip 275 stores a month beginning next 
spring resulting in 5000 stores with television monitors by 1992 
that means 60 million people each week will be watching 
there is substantial cost to program a network of this 
nature weiss said but this is really the wave of the future 
youre going to see television everywhere you go 
according to weiss and locurto the reception has been 
overwhelmingly positive 
the only negative response came from people thinking that this 
was going to increase the costs of their groceries locurto said 
once we explained that we were paying for it the response was 
terrific 
not one of the 13 test markets which represented more than half 
of the nations top supermarket chains asked that the monitors be 
removed locurto said 
the financial payoff for the stores comes from a split of the 
advertising profits with actmedia for turner the benefit comes in 
getting two free commercial segments in each eightminute 
installment and the opportunity to expose cnn to a greater number 
of people than its current 50 million subscribers 
at the aampp in atlanta shoppers loved the checkout channel 
were doing excellent said assistant store manager mike 
jackson it pacifies people in the lines especially on our 
busiest days 
locurto insists that the checkout channels advertising is not 
intended to encourage impulse buying foods such as campbells 
soups are advertised next to nonedible products such as ford 
escorts and floridas walt disney world 
we look at it as another television network locurto said 
its another way to expose all kinds of products 
but jackson at the aampp said he saw a lot of shoppers leave the 
checkout line to pick up things that caught their eye on the tv 
the flickering monitor also reminded people of things they had 
forgotten to put on their grocery lists jackson said 
werent some customers annoyed by the new machinery werent the 
checkers distracted by the noise 
naw the girls up at the registers didnt mind it one bit 
jackson said i did have one complaint though some guys wanted 
to know why we couldnt keep it tuned to a certain football game so 
they could sit there and watch it 
is every potentially boring circumstance now open to television 
is nothing sacred to televisions cable czar 
well weiss replied laughing they did think about churches i 
dont think they would have let us in he said but i bet 
somebody would watch it

four months ago the associated press first

when business was booming carpenter tony gonzalez stood atop 
his world chicagos gleaming new highrises now hes back to 
earth remodeling an occasional kitchen or adding a room 
medicalequipment salesman brian dillon makes fewer trips 
through his rocky mountain territory since higher gasoline prices 
nearly doubled travel costs in florida new mother myra delessio 
put off buying a dining room set clips discount coupons more often 
and watches for sales 
growing numbers of middleclass americans jolted by job 
insecurity and other forces beyond their control have been 
retrenching and rethinking in preparation for what some experts 
believe will be a long economic winter 
government figures released this past week show the nation is 
still enjoying the longest economic expansion in peacetime history 
but many private economists say that information masks the truth 
they point to rising unemployment falling home sales and the grim 
christmas foreseen by storekeepers 
on a historical scale the suffering is relative bread lines 
arent forming but average people are definitely feeling a pinch 
in the fading glow of the highflying 1980s cutbacks at home 
office and factory have the look and feel of bad times 
matters seem to have worsened just in recent weeks part of it 
is due to higher energy prices from the persian gulf crisis which 
has made many americans more careful with their money others fret 
about paying more taxes as a result of the longdelayed federal 
budget agreement 
we think were in a recession and the recession began some 
time in the summer said david h resler chief economist for 
nomura securities inc in new york 
albert sindlinger a veteran forecaster whose wallingford pa 
firm tracks householdspending trends as a measure of the economys 
health is even more convinced he says the recession began in 
january 
part of the debate about whether the country is in a recession 
stems from the enormous size of the us economy which by some 
analyses is a hodgepodge of economies that dont behave the same 
way while factories in seattle work overtime wall street fades 
while silicon valley prospers and dallas rebounds philadelphia and 
detroit struggle 
im not sure the word recession fits any more the country 
is not one said jay goldinger of capital insight inc a beverly 
hills calif financial consulting company consumers and 
investors in the west for the most part still have a positive 
outlook 
but for people like gonzalez the chicago carpenter dillon the 
denver salesman or mrs delessio the new mom from jacksonville 
fla economic semantics arent important 
people arent coming in and saying im in a recession 
theyre saying im really worried about our finances and feel 
were not doing as well as we ought to be doing said victoria 
feltoncollins a financial planner and psychologist with offices 
in california the psychology has such a greater effect than the 
actual economic indicators 
donald l badders president of the national foundation for 
consumer credit in silver spring md said the number of families 
seeking advice from the foundations 500office network has risen 
noticeably in the past month alone 
arthur andersen amp co executives report that in recent months 
about 50 percent more companies have asked them to hold financial 
planning seminars for employees current and laid off partly due 
to the tenuous economic picture 
badders said his counselors are seeing more people from 
layoffplagued financial services and banking companies in the 
northeast elsewhere others have complained of a drop in income 
due to cutbacks in hours or the loss of a spouses parttime job 
what they need is some general help in figuring out how to get 
by on the income they have badders said 
sindlingers latest household liquidity survey shows more 
families are reporting less cash on hand after bills are paid as 
of late october more than half those polled in 38 states reported 
less liquidity and felt they were in a recession in july it was 28 
states 
for the last three or four months eight out of 10 
households are telling us income is down because their fixed 
costs are up insurance medical cotate taxes 
sindlinger said 
and what does the federalsts local and s government do it raises 
taxes 
were setting ourselves up for a depression that is parallel to the 
1930s i know ive lived through it said the 83yearold 
forecaster whose business was started with help from president 
herbert hoover 
so far there appear to be few changes in americans billpaying 
patterns delinquencies of outstanding installment loans such as 
credit cards and auto loans have held steady over the past few 
months at around 25 percent saysov 4

tough times call for tough measures in household financial 
planning here are some basic suggestions from a few of the 
experts 
draw up a budget listing all monthly income and expenses 
stick with it 
put aside emergency cash to cover anywhere from three months 
to a years expenses the amount will depend partly on factors like 
job security job counseling centers say it takes an outofwork 
person at least a month to find another job for each 10000 he or 
she might have been been earning 
keep emergencymoney in a safe easily accessible account like 
a money market fund shortterm certificates of deposit or treasury 
bills 
should a layoff occur review all options concerning severance 
pay an average worker receives a weeks pay for each year employed 
at a company either in a lump sum or periodic payments 
whether you receive it all at once or over time depends on when 
a layoff occurs and the companys financial health if its just 
before year end it might be better to take the money in separate 
payments because severance is taxable in the year its received 
if the employer is shaky it could be best to take the lump sum 
says steve weinstein tax manager for the arthur andersen amp co 
accounting firm but he says that option can terminate any 
obligation of the employer to continue paying benefits such as 
health insurance 
review all borrowing options can you get an interestfree loan 
from a relative a homeequity line of credit you can borrow 
from your individual retirement account without penalty provided 
you return the money within 60 days says weinstein but its wise 
to avoid credit card cash advances which usually carry hefty rates 
of interest some near 20 percent 
lower debt it may be more beneficial to reduce your 
outstanding credit card balance than keep money in a 6 percent 
savings account 
get help if you cant pay your bills the nonprofit national 
foundation for consumer credit will work out a payback plan with 
your creditors for a nominal fee and in some cases free of 
charge it has 500 offices throughout the country call 
1800388cccs to find one close to you 
be honest with your creditors in many cases if youre a month 
or two behind in your mortgage payments the mortgage holder will 
try to work out some type of temporary revised payment plan 
theres no way lenders can help any if you dont communicate 
with them said ronnie j wynn president of the mortgage bankers 
association 
review your investment mix and goals set some money aside no 
matter how little for things like your childrens college 
education home improvements or retirement 
you cant do effective asset building as an afterthought 
says weinstein

as northeastern voters prepare to go to the polls 
on tuesday their mood can best be described as anger at an 
enveloping recession at record taxes and billiondollar budget 
deficits and at incumbents 
the three biggest issues are the economy the economy and the 
economy said thomas ferguson a political science professor at 
the university of massachusetts at boston youre looking at 
declining real estate values and youve got a lot of people losing 
their jobs 
in massachusetts and in three maryland counties residents will 
vote on taxbusting referendums incumbents in some hardhit states 
are running for their political lives and some quit rather than 
face the voters wrath 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts rode his states 
prosperity to the democratic presidential nomination but when he 
lost and massachusetts went into a tailspin he raised taxes and 
said he would not run for reelection 
democratic govs william a oneill of connecticut and madeleine 
kunin of vermont also raised taxes and bowed out of the primaries 
still republican candidates seized on their unpopularity 
accusing them of budget mismanagement and big spending their 
democratic replacements tried to disassociate themselves from the 
incumbents they dubbed as political insiders 
two incumbent republican governors john r mckernan of maine 
and edward d diprete of rhode island ran for reelection and 
faced tough challenges the ramaining four incumbent governors who 
are up for reelection seem safe 
govs robert casey of pennsylvania and willaim d schaefer of 
maryland both democrats held the line on taxes and both states 
declared budget surpluses for the fiscal year ended june 30 new 
hampshire has no income or general sales tax and republican gov 
judd gregg opposed both 
democratic gov mario cuomo of new york appears assured of 
winning a third fouryear term despite a record 18 billion tax 
increase a state credit rating that is the third worst in the 
nation and a recent poll that found that 56 percent believed new 
york was headed in the wrong direction 
he faces a weak campaignbungling opponent pierre rinfret an 
economist and political novice who was chosen when no more 
prominent politician agreed to run and cuomo has been able to stay 
in front of the issues 
he anticipated the economic downturn and began to address it 
last january talking about how the problems in new york were of a 
national scope starting from washington said lee miringoff 
director of the marist college institute for public opinion in 
poughkeepsie ny he was able to deflect a lot of tension 
otherwise laid at his doorstep by talking about national political 
leadership 
the only question is whether cuomo can reach or top his record 
65 percent of the vote he received in 1986 a boost for a possible 
run for the presidency the tightest races appear to be in 
massachusetts maine and rhode island 
in massachusetts democrat john silber on leave as president of 
boston university and republican william weld a former assistant 
us attorney general both cmpaigned as outsiders who would 
return the states economy to good health both defeated their 
partys endorsed candidate in the primary 
silber opposes question 3 a referendum that would roll back 
taxes and some fees to their 1988 level weld supports it 
backers say massachusetts residents already pay the sixth 
highest taxes in the country and that during the last seven years 
the dukakis administration has increased spending from nearly 7 
billion to more than 13 billion 
if the referendum is approved opponents say it would roll back 
1 billion already collected and spent and cost massachusetts 6 
billion over three years forcing cutbacks in education programs 
for the elderly and other services 
referendums in montgomery anne arundel and baltimore counties 
in maryland would limit annual increases in property taxes to as 
low as 2 percent a year or would peg them to the previous years 
inflation rate montgomery county one of the wealthiest in the 
nation is a suburb of washington 
in maine us rep joseph e brennan a democrat is trying to 
unseat the republican incumbent mckernan brennan charged that 
mckernan failed to move quickly enough to counter the faltering 
economy brennan served two fouryear terms as governor before 
changing offices with mckernan in 1987 
rhode islands diprete is in danger of losing the governors 
office to democrat bruce g sundlun a millionaire businessman who 
is trying to unseat him for the third time diprete reversed 
himself on a pledge of no new taxes 
lowell p weicker jr former threeterm republican us senator 
who is running as an independent for the connecticut governors 
seat is favored to break the democratic partys twodecade hold on 
the office 
in vermont republican richard snelling gov kunins 
predecessor is the favorite to succeed her 
the only major races in new jersey and delaware are for the us

embroiled in neckandneck if not cutthroat races to retain those 
offices 
add in helms who some polls show trailing harvey gantt the 
first black north carolinian to win his partys nomination for the 
us senate and tuesday could yield a southern shift back to the 
democrats 
if the democrats are able to win then what had been very 
steady republican gains over the last 10 years may be held in 
check and thats a very dramatic thing said bob joffee of 
masondixon opinion research a nonpartisan polling firm 
in florida and alabama incumbent republican governors bob 
martinez and guy hunt are running no better than even in some 
polls martinez trailed former sen lawton chiles early on and 
hunt the first republican governor in alabama since 1874 appears 
to have lost an early lead to democrat paul hubbert who built the 
state teachers union into a powerful political lobby

governors the races have been particularly nasty texas republican 
businessman clayton williams appears to have lost his lead after 
refusing to shake hands with democrat state treasurer ann richards

taxes loom like storm clouds over the prairie in 
key elections tuesday in the midwest threatening two governors 
scrambling for their jobs and a third candidate bidding for his 
first term 
in a political turnabout republican govs kay orr of nebraska 
and mike hayden of kansas both firsttermers have been cast by 
their democratic rivals as big spenders responsible for raising 
income or property taxes 
and in illinois democrat neil hartigan has appointed himself 
the pennypinching conservative while branding gop opponent jim 
edgar the taxpromoting liberal 
in this year the candidate who grabs the tax issue first gets 
the benefit out of it said jim nowlan a public policy professor 
at knox college in galesburg ill 
people are responding to the antitax rhetoric because of this 
concern that spending more wont change anything he added 
theres a very sour mood toward government and politicians on the 
part of the public 
the impact of such sentiments will be realized tuesday as nine 
midwest governors seven incumbents are seeking reelection are 
chosen and eight us senators bid for new terms 
the kansas gubernatorial and illinois senate challengers hope to 
make the record books as the first women in those jobs iowas 
senate race already is historic the 11million campaign is the 
most expensive ever 
though hotbutton issues such as abortion have been debated the 
dominance of the antitax mood reflects wider economic concerns in 
a region still vulnerable despite its recovery from the 80s farm 
crisis and manufacturing decline 
in september for example michigan and illinois posted 72 
percent jobless rates highest among 11 major states and rising 
oil prices and the persian gulf crisis have escalated talk of 
recession 
the midwest is particularly sensitive to dislocation in the 
economy said david axelrod a chicagobased political 
consultant 
we were the first ones in the recession in the early 80s and 
the last ones out when theres economic turmoil it tends to favor 
challengers he added citing the gop in ohio and democrats in 
illinois 
in those states two governors whove had presidential 
hankerings leave office illinois republican james thompson 
retires after a record 14 years ohios richard celeste a 
democrat is legally barred from a third consecutive term 
nationally the gop regards ohio as one of its best 
opportunities to grab a democratic gubernatorial seat state 
attorney general anthony celebrezze jr has emphasized populist 
themes republican george voinovich a former cleveland mayor 
claims credit for his citys fiscal revival 
in illinois taxes have seized the spotlight edgar secretary 
of state favors making permanent a twoyear 20 percent income tax 
increase hartigan state attorney general opposes it 
in kansas democratic state treasurer joan finney blames hayden 
for high property taxes resulting from statewide reappraisal and 
implementation of a classification system completed in 1989 
hayden counters by claiming mrs finney doesnt know anything 
about state government 
the race is a hobsons choice with both registering mammoth 
negatives in polls said burdett loomis a university of kansas 
political science professor 
youve got a governor presiding over a huge property tax 
increase whos not especially popular he said youve got 
this woman whos not perceived as especially competent maybe even 
dangerous in not being up to the job 
abortion also is an issue mrs finney opposes it hayden is 
prochoice 
in nebraska mrs orr the states first woman governor has 
been criticized by opponent democrat ben nelson an attorney for 
her 1987 endorsement of an overhaul of the states income tax 
system 
she initially denied it caused increases but now says steps 
have been taken to remedy the situation 
in minnesota gov rudy perpich once considered vulnerable has 
been on the sidelines watching the tumult in the gop party created 
by the 11thhour withdrawal of challenger jon grunseth who was 
accused of marital infidelity and swimming nude with teenage 
girls 
state auditor arne carlson who had launched a 11thhour 
writein campaign replaced grunseth on the ballot 
minnesota gop sen rudy boschwitz says the republican turmoil 
has overlapped into his race against college professor paul 
wellstone who has surged dramatically in the polls in recent 
weeks 
in iowa two capitol hill pros are clashing in the senate race 
rep tom tauke vs incumbent democrat tom harkin 
tauke calls harkin a big spender the senator says his opponent 
votes against programs that would help iowa 
tauke opposes abortion harkin is prochoice 
in illinois a republican house member also hopes to knock off 
an incumbent however lynn martin initially considered one of the 
gops brightest prospects has failed to dent sen paul simons 
popularity 
in three gubernatorial contests state lawmakers are 
challengers 
iowa gov terry branstad faces democrat don avenson state 
house speaker 
michigan gov james blanchard is opposed by gop state senate 
majority leader john engler 
wisconsin republican gov tommy thompson is challenged by 
assembly speaker tom loftus 
and in the senate

the 1990 campaign has been a little like the 
capricious new england weather if you dont like it just wait a 
minute 
less than six months ago politicians were at fever pitch over a 
constitutional amendment to ban flagburning reluctant democrats 
feared for their patriotic reputations crusading republicans 
smelled blood 
its hard now to recall the passion and acrimony generated by 
that once blazing concern and harder still to find traces of it on 
the campaign trail 
ephemeral fickle call the season what you will but issues 
came and went almost as quickly as movies of the week until the 
campaign came home to roost in voter pocketbooks 
the only national issue is the economy taxes economic 
leadership and fairness its driving the entire electorate said 
analyst stuart rothenberg publisher of the political report 
when candidates first hit the campaign trail months ago 
recession worries were hypothetical and budget negotiations were a 
speck on the distant horizon 
emotional values issues were the political currency of the 
moment some candidates pledged their allegiance to the 
flagburning ban others stoked the controversy over federally 
funded obscene art 
bigstate gubernatorial candidates waged a spirited competition 
over who would order the most executions deny the most paroles 
propose the harshest penalties for drugusers 
congress was put on the defensive for voting itself a pay raise 
and then became enmeshed in the savings and loan scandal the 
issues proved potent in a smattering of races and planted the 
first seeds of antiincumbent richvspoor sentiment among 
voters 
abortion also took a brief turn on center stage but the waters 
got muddied and the issue lost its fire both parties ran 
candidates with a full range of positions states meanwhile 
failed to impose the serious restrictions anticipated in the wake 
of a 1989 supreme court decision and abortion moved to the wings 
in most races 
the spotted owl flew by and prompted intense debate in the 
northwest but the conflict over whether to protect forest habitat 
for the tiny owl at the expense of logging jobs never broadened 
into a compelling national issue and environmental concerns 
colored only scattered races across the country 
communism fell and the peace dividend arose early in the 
campaign candidates proposed 50percent cuts in military spending 
and argued over whether to use the money saved from the cold war 
thaw to expand domestic programs or reduce the deficit 
then came the latesummer iraqi invasion of kuwait and the 
deployment of us troops to saudi arabia the peace dividend 
vanished like a mirage in the blinding desert sun the nation 
worried about war incumbents looked like statesmen and other 
issues temporarily were swept aside 
politicians of both parties rallied behind president bushs 
policies few of them daring to raise questions or reservations as 
the standoff dragged on without shooting the gulf crisis waned as 
a cutting election issue 
finally in september an economic decline and explosive federal 
budget negotiations combined to produce the potent pocketbook 
themes that dominated the campaigns final weeks 
the battle cry of no new taxes turned into a debate over whose 
new taxes and voters witnessed a confusing chaotic struggle over 
their economic futures 
democrats railed at highflyers and the rich who got richer 
in the 1980s at everyone elses expense lets go and get it from 
those who got it sen barbara mikulski dmd declared during 
floor debate over whether to raise taxes on the wealthy 
the fairness pitch hadnt been particularly successful in 
the past and democratic leaders were not making much headway this 
year from the launchpad of the bipartisan sampl scandal 
the theme was largely ineffective until the democrats received a 
series of assists from bush his reversal on the need for new 
taxes his insistence on a capital gains tax cut his painful 
public wavering on whether to raise taxes on the rich his failure 
to adequately explain his positions 
bush can truly take responsibility for whatever happens on 
tuesday said university of virginia political scientist larry 
sabato he created the democrats best issue one that they could 
never have created for themselves 
the republicans gave the democrats the ammunition agreed 
rothenberg 
analysts were not surprised that pocketbook issues ended up 
being pivotal 
democratic pollster geoff garin said the earlier boomlets 
were brief because its hard to sustain a political debate when 
there is no debate everybodys against drugs everybodys against 
sampl crooks 
the budget by contrast is a real live issue that really does 
raise differences garin said 
others suggested that some republicans drew the wrong 
conclusions from bushs successful use of patriotism and crime 
issues two years ago 
politicians thought they had learned a lesson from 1988 the 
importance of certain symbols the republicans pushing 
identification with them and the democrats trying not to look weak 
on them said rothenberg 
but those were better days 
symbolic issues only work in times of peace and prosperity 
said sabato whenever the economy weakens it always takes first 
place on the campaign agenda

no longer sheltered from the world 
by its checkbook and rigid codes saudi arabia is wielding power in 
the region building its defenses and rethinking its basic tenets 
whatever happens with iraq knowledgeable saudis say there will 
be change in a conservative kingdom without revolutionaries 
however most predict a supercharged evolution at best 
there is bound to be change economically politically 
socially said a prominent jiddah businessman with outside 
pressure it could take two or three years without maybe five 
he said he expected freer expression and more criticism in the 
press there might be pressure groups such as professional 
associations in the meantime he added he did not want to named 
barring an uprising change depends only on king fahd and accord 
among the nearly 5000 members of the alsaud family saudi arabia 
is a private company with little pressure to go public 
the shock of the crisis will make us think about ourselves 
said an influential prince who also asked for anonymity i think 
we have too much power we need checks and balances 
he said the crisis has opened the society somewhat as hundreds 
of foreign reporters probe matters once kept strictly private 
substantial change is coming he added but at saudi pace 
since the early 1970s saudi rulers have kept the outside world 
beyond the horizon avoiding political entanglements and buying 
security with generous grants to arab states and the palestine 
liberation organization 
they spent heavily on sophisticated weaponry and hired western 
defense technicians 
visas were granted sparingly and only with a purpose for 
consultants salesmen managers laborers moslem pilgrims were 
welcomed to mecca and medina but then sent home again 
after fundamentalist saudis seized the holy mosque at mecca in 
1979 and were dislodged only after days of bloody fighting the 
kingdom retreated farther into strict islamic conservatism 
secure in a microcosm of its own design saudi arabia lavished 
hundreds of billions of dollars on gleaming new cities storybook 
palaces industrial complexes and luxuries unequaled in the world 
when saddam hussein took kuwait and headed toward us we 
called the army and found no one there said one saudi official 
we realized we had better do something fast 
western defense contractors said they epect saudi arabia to 
triple its armed forces quickly adding conventional land weapons 
to support its hightech air force 
already saudi arabia is using new muscle in the neighborhood 
when yemen objected to western troops in the area the saudis 
withdrew special status for nearly 2 million yemenis in the 
kingdom perhaps as many as 750000 went home within a month 
similarly saudi arabia abruptly halted aid to jordan and then 
cut off its oil supply 
we learned who our real friends were said prince abdullah 
bin turki bin faisal secretary general of the royal commission for 
jubail and yanbu and a widely respected young saudi 
many saudis expect the greatest impact to be on the society 
itself caught between a strict reading of the 1400yearold koran 
and the latest texts of the harvard business school 
an englishlanguage television network offers american sitcoms 
but roseanne has a prayer intermission censors blank out words 
that might offend such as underwear jews and beer in one a 
character delivered the old line hum a few bars of it and the 
word bars came out 
liquor is banned and selling it is a felony but favorite brands 
are available on the black market with an extra zero behind their 
normal price 
faced with a threat saudi arabia realized how much it depended 
on its 4 million asian african and western workers a third of its 
nurses went home within days of iraqs invasion of kuwait 
saudi arabia will be kinder and gentler toward foreigners 
said a filipino business executive but also its people will 
start to question things not take them at face value 
saudis echoed this theme 
we must be strong because we are strong not because we have 
the money to be strong said nihal alomari a riyadh journalist 
crisis opened us up to a new reality said mohammed ishgi of 
the jiddah chamber of commerce we want to be a nation that the 
west respects that can dirty its hands do the work and not have 
to call a sri lankan to fix the plumbing 
he added a proviso heard widely among saudis foreign diplomats 
and western residents with long experience in the kingdom 
there will be change but at our pace the shah modernized 
iran so fast that people got lost now they have to go back 
again 
when the united states dispatched 200000 troops to the region 
many saudis expected reverberations from such heresies as 
pistolpacking women wearing trousers and driving 
but most found a greater effect from nearly 200000 kuwaitis 
seeking refuge from an emirate where men voted and women went 
unveiled 
ive never seen an american but i see kuwaitis said an 
executive of a bank branch reserved for women they tell their 
leaders what they think this is a good idea 
she said she was shocked after the invasion of kuwait when some 
members of the saudi royal family sought shelter at a palace in 
jiddah protected by a private army it was only for them not 
for us she said after that things become clear 
no serious opposition challenges the alsaud family not only 
because of strict censorship and rigorous measures against 
dissidents but also because saudi arabia offers a comfortable 
life 
you dont get many bombthrowers here a senior western 
diplomat said its not that kind of place 
the last time saudi arabia faced a major threat when egyptian 
leader gamal abdel nasser sent troops to yemen and moved north in 
the early 1960s president john f kennedy sent help but also 
demanded reforms 
as a result saudi arabia abolished slavery in 1962 and 
introduced education for women 
this time us officials said privately such pressure is not 
likely 
how the kingdom evolves depends largely on events saudi and 
foreign analysts say investment has stalled and billions of 
dollars have been transferred elsewhere at the same time oil 
production rose toward 8 million barrels a day at windfall prices 
under most scenarios the economy is unlikely to change 
drastically more in doubt the analysts say is how king fahd and 
his brothers will react to the political and social lessons 
there already is stiff religious resistance to us troops 
called the children of satan by some guarding holy soil 
a lasting american presence would drastically change the way 
of life here said thierry mauger a french author and veteran 
saudi observer 
the most radical proposals suggest an elected consultative 
assembly such as the one kuwait had before it was suspended under 
emergency conditions in 1986 
king fahd has hinted of a consultative body and chambers were 
built in riyadh for that purpose but nothing has materialized 
a leading jiddah journalist said the royal family will provoke 
serious discontent if it does not allow greater press freedom 
lobby groups and other means of airing public opinion 
major change is inevitable there is no doubt about that 
observed an intellectual who also directs a major saudi company 
if the rulers are smart they will stay ahead of it

david packard one of the patriarchs of 
silicon valley is more visible these days at the computer giant he 
helped build as the firm copes with dramatic corporate changes 
neither packard 78 nor william hewlett 77 both 
multibillionaires are returning to daytoday management of 
hewlettpackard co 
but packard still chairman and hewlett retired director and 
former president participated in an analysis of the companys 
recent woes that led to a shakeup at the highest levels earlier 
this month 
chief executive officer john a young now shares top 
decisionmaking powers with chief operating officer dean morton 
several vice presidents notably lewis platt richard hackborn and 
bill terry were given more authority and are considered as 
successor to young in the next few years 
packard is careful not to suggest that hes taking over command 
again or undermining young in any way 
hes going to be managing the company and he has bills and my 
complete support on what hes plans to do said packard 
but the fact that packard is getting more involved is an 
indication of the companys concern about its direction 
packard has been more visible and more involved in consulting 
with john on changes in the companys management structure and its 
organization said company spokesman roy verley what is 
significant about this change is weve attempted to set ourselves 
up a bit for ultimate succession of management in the next few 
years 
analysts say the change in youngs duties obviously made him 
weaker and cast some doubt on the companys leadership 
my opinion is young didnt do that on his own volition he got 
pressure from his board to create that office and bring morton 
in said john b jones of montgomery securities in san francisco 
but packard looks at it in a more benign way comparing young to 
a star quarterback and saying bill hewlett and i are going to be 
coaching him from the sidelines were not going to be calling the 
plays but we are going to give him whatever help and coaching he 
needs 
hewlettpackard ends its fiscal year today on halloween but 
unless it comes up with a quick trick its not likely to be treated 
any better on wall street 
the stock price has dropped during the past year from a high of 
50rsqb to a close tuesday of 26 
in the first nine months the company posted revenues of 96 
billion up from 85 billion in 1989 but earnings during the 
period fell to 537 million from 583 million 
analysts anticipate hewlettpackards yearend numbers when 
released in two weeks will show similar growth in revenues to 
about 132 billion and a further drop in earnings 
unless they produce some surprises the investment community 
will be very critical of them said jones 
packard said he is more concerned about making sure that his 
companys corporate values are right and that our business 
direction is sound the company is looking to strengthen itself 
for the long run he said and isnt worried about quarterly 
profits or the current stock price 
what packard is signaling is that they have not made analysts 
happy for some time which is why the stock is sitting at a buck or 
two above book value jones said 
historically hewlettpackard is not a company that hacks 
expenses to please investors rather the company believes in 
building morale and camaraderie for the longterm its benevolent 
attitude toward employees and customers dubbed the hp way 
has made it a model for hightech companies in silicon valley for 
half a century 
that attitude which some disgruntled employees say was 
beginning to wither is evident in the companys effort to pare 
down from a peak of 95000 workers in 1989 after the purchase of 
apollo a workstation maker current employment is 92000 
worldwide including more than 20000 in the san francisco bay area 
and 37000 overseas 
the cuts are gradual and continuing said verley rather 
than firing workers the company is trimming through attrition 
hiring controls and a workforce rebalancing program that allows 
workers to find other jobs in the company 
perhaps as significant as the sharing of power between young and 
morton is the streamlining of the organization below them 
the new system is more centralized and allows for example all 
the computer systems businesses and sales forces to report to one 
individual platt who has responsibility for profits and losses 
hackborn likewise is in charge of peripherals and terry is in 
charge of measurement systems 
those three areas comprise the bulk of hewlettpackards 
business 
platt has the largest revenue sector nearly 50 percent of the 
companys total with minicomputers workstations service and 
computer systems software

usx corps decision to make its steel 
operations a separate company came as no surprise to many analysts 
who expect the energy and steel giant to sell its metals business 
eventually 
someday youre going to see this company in two major pieces 
two separate entities said greg drahuschak a steel analyst with 
butcher amp singer in pittsburgh its the only way i can ever see 
that the shareholder is going to get the benefits of the two 
businesses 
usx said its board of directors voted tuesday to transfer the 
business carried out by the uss steel division to a wholly owned 
subsidiary usx chairman charles a corry said the move will 
provide the flexibility for any steel restructuring undertaken by 
the company 
usx also reported its thirdquarter earnings dropped 68 percent 
from a year earlier with gains in the energy segment but a 26 
percent income drop from the steel division 
usx spokesman william l keslar said the move to separate the 
steel division was not prompted by takeover strategist carl icahns 
proposal to spin off at least 80 percent of the steel business in 
the form of a dividend to shareholders the proposal by icahn 
usxs largest shareholder with a 133 percent stake was rejected 
by other shareholders may 7 
icahn considers steel a drain on usxs marathon oil co and 
texas oil and gas corp 
keslar said the boards vote simply puts uss on the same 
footing as marathon making it a subsidiary 
somewhere down the road if you want to spin it off its 
certainly easier to do it as a subsidiary than as a part of the 
company he said its simply providing the means to have that 
flexibility 
icahn said in a telephone interview from his mount kisco ny 
office that the change is a step in the right direction but they 
have to take a lot more steps to separate the two companies 
so far its lip service to what has to be done he said 
this does not really help to reflect the values of the stock 
charles bradford an analyst with ubs securities in new york 
said he expects usx to try to sell a small part of the company 
perhaps 20 percent in a public offering by the end of the year 
that will establish what the company is worth he said 
they can sell a small piece now and sell the rest later on 
andrew v lefty palm chairman of the united steelworkers of 
americas chief negotiating committee said the steel divisions 
new status raises questions that will be addressed in contract 
talks 
essentially were not supportive of the idea of splitting up 
usx said usw president l lynn williams we think the 
longterm best interests of our members are best served by the 
steel division remaining a part of usx and being provided the basic 
strength of an energy company 
the union is negotiating a new contract for 18000 union members 
employed by usx in seven states the two sides have set a nov 10 
target date for a new pact 
earnings for the 1990 third quarter totaled 163 million or 63 
cents a share compared with 175 million or 62 cents a share in 
the same quarter of 1989 earnings per share increased mainly 
because of a significant reduction in preferred stock outstanding 
usx said 
quarterly revenues totaled 511 billion compared with 442 
billion up about 16 percent 
in the companys energy division operating income increased 47 
percent to 278 million on sales of 37 billion compared with

the steel segment reported operating income fell nearly 26 
percent to 63 million on sales of 13 billion from 85 million 
on sales of 13 billion in the third quarter of 1989

the petroleum industry as a whole did not reap a 
thirdquarter windfall from the persian gulf crisis a leading 
trade group said in a defense of big oil against charges of 
profiteering 
the thirdquarter earnings statements released by several oil 
companies show that oil companies have not gouged the public 
american petroleum institute president charles j dibona said at a 
press briefing tuesday 
dibona said total operating income was unchanged from the third 
quarter of 1989 and below the same period in 1988 based on reports 
from 18 top us petroleum companies 
industry earnings were actually something of a mix ranging from 
double and tripledigit increases in profits at some companies to 
doubledigit decreases at others 
amerada hess corp for example reported a 4405 percent 
increase in earnings based largely on profits from successful oil 
futures trading 
it shows they were able to judge the future better than other 
people dibona said 
in response to the api report some industry foes still 
contended the companies were taking advantage of the gulf crisis 
which began with iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
its wrong for them to say theyre not doing quite well 
said edwin s rothschild energy policy director for citizen 
action a consumers group in washington they are making lots of 
money while people are hurting 
while income from operations was unchanged total net income for 
the 18 companies cited by dibona showed an increase of 165 percent 
for the quarter according to apis figures net income includes 
special onetime items such as amerada hesss gains in the futures 
market 
as analysts had predicted the production branches of big oil 
companies the socalled upstream end of the business made 
plenty of extra money as oil prices shot up during the crisis 
but the refining and marketing divisions the downstream 
end generally did not do as well they had to shell out higher 
prices for the crude oil they imported 
in addition dibona said oil profits have been kept down as the 
companies refrained from passing along all of the higher crude 
costs in retail prices for gasoline and home heating oil 
christopher dyson of the ralph nader consumer group buyers up 
said he believes oil companies were trying to conceal how well 
theyre doing 
theres a lot of little accounting tricks which oil companies 
can do with their profit figures dyson said that tends to 
make them look less dramatic than they are 
dyson declined to offer specifics but said for example that 
oil companies can try to hide their profits by putting large sums 
into funds that will be used for eventual environmental cleanups at 
drilling sites industry analysts have said oil companies do this 
but they point out it is an accepted accounting technique that 
shows up in public statements from the corporations 
dyson also found fault with apis use of industrywide 
statistics 
i would argue first of all that there were some companies that 
did very well he said its nice the oil companies broke even 
because a lot of other industries such as the airline industry 
are losing billions of dollars because of this crisis 
citizen action acknowledged that oil companies showed restraint 
in pricing shortly after the invasion so it has backed off on its 
allegations of pricegouging at least for now 
among the big oil companies that showed higher net income in the 
third quarter were amoco corp up 577 percent atlantic richfield 
co up 219 percent occidental petroleum corp up 09 percent 
phillips petroleum co up 1046 percent texaco inc up 249 
percent and unocal corp up 532 percent 
among those showing lower net income were chevron corp down 
34 percent mobil corp down 288 percent shell oil co down 
332 percent and sun co down 706 percent 
exxon corp reported quarterly earnings that were unchanged

chrysler corp which said it needed 
the united auto workers to give it relief from labor costs has a 
new tentative agreement very similar to contracts at general motors 
and ford 
the company and union reached a tentative agreement tuesday 
afternoon after 27 straight hours of bargaining there was no 
strike and the 63000 uaw members covered by the agreement worked 
without a contract for about a halfday 
uaw president owen bieber bragged at a news conference that the 
union had reached its goal of bargaining a pattern agreement used 
at each of the big three 
its a pattern settlement and a pattern settlement in all 
respects bieber said its a total pattern settlement 
chrysler vice president anthony st john the companys main 
negotiator agreed the contract was mostly patterned on uaw deals 
with general motors corp and ford motor co 
the tentative agreement reached today with the uaw contains 
elements of the pattern but also some provisions which addresses 
needs specific to chrysler he said 
bieber and st john declined to talk about details of the 
contract pending a monday union leaership meeting in detroit if 
it wins approval by the group of local presidents and bargaining 
council chairs the contract will be sent out for rankandfile 
ratification 
it appeared that the union and company agreed to push for a new 
production schedule at chryslers profitable st louis ii minivan 
plant which has about 3500 employees 
last november members of uaw local 110 in st louis 
overwhelmingly rejected a move endorsed by the company and the 
uaws leadership to change from a normal twoshift production 
schedule to one involving three crews two shifts and a 20percent 
production increase 
the company said the change would have swollen the plants 
employment by 1000 to 1300 workers but union members turned down 
the proposal saying it could cut out overtime 
st john said also the company and union agreed to continue the 
30andout retirement program that allows an employee to get 
retirement benefits after 30 years of service regardless of age 
the company had pressed for pension payments to be held until 
the worker is 60 years old 
there are elements in this agreement that are particularly 
helpful to chryslers case st john said 
bieber and st john declined to answer questions about 
healthcare provisions which were seen as a major sticking point 
in the talks in the gmford pattern agreement there is no change 
in the method of coverage but the union and the companies agreed 
to look for ways to cut costs 
chrysler said it spent 684 million on healthcare last year 
chrysler has nearly one retiree for every active worker a higher 
proportion than gm or ford a higher percentage of retirees 
increases a companys healthcare bill 
the uaw reached an agreement with gm on sept 17 after that 
contract was ratified it took just six days for the union and ford 
to reach a tentative agreement which was ratified earlier this 
month 
the union canceled an extension of its chrysler contract at 
midnight monday but told members to report to their jobs as usual 
tuesday while bargaining continued 
late tuesday morning bieber and chrysler chairman lee iacocca 
held a 1hour private meeting which broke up about four hours 
before the tentative agreement was announced 
the agreement came a day after chrysler reported a thirdquarter 
loss of 214 million mostly from incentive costs and lost 
production due to the retooling of its minivan plants in st louis 
and windsor ontario those are among the companys most profitable 
factories 
analysts said that despite the loss chrysler is in decent 
financial shape 
theyve got 3 billion in cash said david healy of 
investment bankers barclays de zoete wedd in new york city 
theyre not in financial trouble at all far from it they will 
be profitable for the year

citicorp the nations largest banking company 
said today that by the end of next year about 2000 jobs will be 
eliminated through an ongoing reorganization of its corporate 
business 
the disclosure provides the first indication of the size of 
layoffs since the companys retrenchment in corporate financing 
activities began several months ago 
bank profits generally have been battered in recent months by 
writeoffs related to loans for commercial real estate and by a 
decline in lending activity for buyouts 
citicorp spokeswoman anne luzzatto said the layoffs are mostly 
middle management and professionals in lending and deal making she 
said they were expected to be completed by the end of 1991 
the corporate business division which covers japan europe and 
north america and australia had about 17000 employees and plans 
to reduce expenses by more than 250 million annually she said 
the wall street journal was the first to report on the actual 
number of layoffs today quoting michael callen the executive in 
charge of the division as saying as many as 700 people in north 
america have left so far with an additional 400 employees to be 
notified by year end 
luzzatto said about half of the remaining 900 intended cuts are 
employees in asia and europe 
the rest of the 450 cuts will come from businesses targeted for 
sale by the end of 1991 she said 
some of the largest personnel cutbacks have come in the 
leveraged loan division where business is off because of the 
decline in leveraged corporate buypouts and equipment finance and 
leasing luzzatto said 
other reorganization moves include the consolidation of 
citicorps 18 corporate finance offices in the united states into 
six primary locations and concentration of commercial real estate 
activity into nine offices rather than 21 locations she said 
no such personnel reductions are planned for the consumer 
banking operation which employs 77000 people according to the 
journal story 
the journal report also said citicorp chairman john reed is 
considering strategic alliances with other large global banks 
reed reportedly told the harvard business review in an interview 
that is to be published soon that strategic alliances under which 
citicorp would swap portions of its business with other major banks 
could help build a stronger capital base

a connecticut company says it has just 
the answer for hospitals looking for a better cheaper way to 
dispose of infectious medical waste cook the stuff in a giant 
microwave 
nothing is emitted into the air and the treated waste which 
takes up just oneeighth of its original space can be dumped into 
an ordinary landfill says abb sanitec inc 
its a brand new solution said david c knesel spokesman 
for forsyth memorial hospital in winstonsalem nc which bought 
a sanitec unit for 500000 in february 
abb sanitec has gained regulatory approval in two states and is 
seeking the goahead in six others for its system which grinds up 
and decontaminates infectious medical waste 
one of the main attractions of the system for hospitals is its 
relatively low cost which is saving forsyth more than 200000 a 
year in waste disposal so far forsyth is the only us hospital 
using the system which is subject to a statebystate review 
in addition to north carolina the system has been given thumbs 
up in california and is under consideration in new jersey ohio 
new york massachusetts pennsylvania and texas according to abb 
sanitec president john l cusack 
the abb sanitec system has been sold to 10 hospitals and waste 
disposal companies in france germany switzerland and italy since 
1986 cusack said 
the system is manufactured in west germany and sells for 
500000 to 600000 he said the company makes the system in two 
sizes and can set the unit on wheels so that two or more small 
hospitals could share it cusack said 
abb sanitec is a unit of asea brown boveri inc the us 
subsidiary of abb ltd of zurich switzerland 
the patented system comes in a selfcontained computerized 
20by8foot metal box that looks like a large trash compactor 
waste is dumped into the box sent through a shredder and zapped 
for a halfhour with microwaves leaving nothing but a pile of 
small garbage pieces thats less harmful than normal kitchen 
garbage 
it looks like potpourri when it dries out forsyths knesel 
said its colorful actually its got all kinds of different 
colors and different pieces 
microwaving the waste exposes it to high temperatures that 
destroy microorganisms said v james mclarney director of the 
division of health facilities management for the american hospital 
association 
he said microwaving is an environmentally sound method but that 
it is just one of many technologies being developed to dispose of 
medical waste including treating the waste with chemicals or 
radiation and incineration 
since there are not yet national regulations regarding the 
disposal of medical waste individual states approve disposal 
methods mclarney said 
to use a new technology requires that the state include that 
new technology on the list of accepted treatment alternatives he 
said 
the problem of medical waste disposal made headlines in 1988 
when needles syringes and other products washed up on shores in 
the northeast hospitals facing stringent disposal laws pay up to 
50 cents a pound to dispose of their medical waste according to 
the aha 
the abb sanitec system costs between 7 and 10 cents a pound 
cusack said 
knesel said forsyth had been spending 270000 a year to have 
its infectious medical waste hauled in refrigerated trucks to a 
special medical waste incinerator with abb sanitec the cost has 
dropped to 60000 a year he said 
we figure this unit will probably pay for itself by 1992 
knesel said 
some hospitals have considered building their own incinerators 
to dispose of their waste but the high costs of adding 
pollutioncontrol systems and strong public sentiment against 
incinerators make that option more difficult he said 
knesel said that was exactly the case with forsyth a 926bed 
hospital and one of the largest in north carolina 
we were planning to build our own incinerator and really 
were disturbed about having to do so he said its politically 
impossible in this state to build a medical incinerator there 
are protests everywhere and we really had better things to do than 
to deal with an irate public about an incinerator 
in california where one sanitec unit was bought by a waste 
disposal company the device was easily approved for statewide use 
said nancy smith a health program adviser for the state department 
of health 
california officials evaluated the unit for its ability to 
disinfect medical waste and for harmful emissions smith said

to some western creditors premier 
ante markovic forged an economic miracle by slashing inflation from 
2500 percent to near zero in six months and saving yugoslavia from 
bankruptcy 
the 65yearold pragmatist stopped the runaway price spiral 
boosted hard currency reserves and pushed foreign debt below 16 
billion for the first time in more than a decade 
but the gains have proved temporary inflation is creeping 
upward again and unemployment is rising many businessmen complain 
that markovics reforms have gone too far and are disrupting 
yugoslavias transition to capitalism from communism 
markovics main antiinflationary tool the newly convertible 
dinar currency pegged at seven to one german mark spells problems 
for many companies even those considered closest to western 
business practices 
the exchange rate introduced jan 1 restored confidence in the 
yugoslav currency after it had plunged in value against western 
currencies but companies now say the exchange rate should be 11 or 
12 dinars per mark to make their products more competitive 
unemployment already 17 percent nationwide could top a quarter 
of the work force as the reforms take hold 
inflation also has become a problem again after plummeting from 
an annual 2500 percent in 1989 to zero in the second quarter of 
this year inflation took a 7 percent jump in september the annual 
rate could far surpass the governments 17 percent forecast 
tight credit and a wage freeze helped throttle inflation but 
one result is that yugoslav products have become even more 
expensive at home than many imported items 
if i go to the supermarket and cheese from hungary and 
austrian margarine are cheaper why should i buy yugoslav asked 
alenka ogrin a tourist guide from ljubljana 
western investors have been scared away from yugoslavia by 
simmering ethnic and political tensions more than anything 
markovic now needs social stability to consolidate his reforms 
matija skof president of sloveniales one of yugoslavias 
largest trading companies halved profit targets to 10 million 
this year after sales prospects dwindled at home and abroad 
founded in 1948 to export furniture sloveniales deals in 
everything from household goods to helicopters 
but skof still sees some reasons for optimism 
were still notching up a real growth rate of 5 percent on 
last years sales of 135 billion he said we reorganized as 
a private company in july and were running like one on the 
profit motive 
under yugoslavias selfmanagement system companies are 
technically owned by their workers markovics reforms are supposed 
to weed out unprofitable companies buoyed for decades by state 
subsidies cheap bank credits and a weak dinar the debts of many 
companies are virtually impossible to calculate 
markovic premier since march 1989 is determined to revitalize 
the economy by ending wasteful subsidies but some critics say his 
measures are too harsh 
political squabbling among yugoslavias six republics 
complicates the issue 
slovenia and croatia where centerright parties ousted 
communist governments in free elections this year are pushing for 
a new loose confederation of sovereign states in a common market 
the southern lessdeveloped republics of serbia 
bosniahercegovina montenegro and macedonia are still in communist 
hands ahead of elections later this year they tend toward a more 
centralized federation 
serbian authorities are vetoing reforms they say are against 
their interests they have subsidized wheat prices and refused to 
shut giant lossmakers like smederevo steel works that employs 
16000 workers 
there was a dream that markovic could save yugoslavia but its 
now clear that we need political reorganization before we can talk 
about economic programs said danilo slivnik domestic editor at 
delo slovenias leading daily newspaper 
socialism is still entrenched in over half of yugoslavia so 
how can freemarket reforms work he asked 
slovenias social planning institute estimates that 40 mostly 
large enterprises in yugoslavias richest republic will face 
bankruptcy this year including showcase ski producer elan 
with only 8 percent of the countrys population slovenia 
produces more than 25 percent of yugoslav exports in 
lessdeveloped republics many more enterprises could go bust 
markovic was right to stop inflation with harsh measures but 
he should have let up in june and given the economy a breathing 
space skof asserted 
the federal government says rising exports prove the economy is 
rebounding other observers disagree 
its just an illusion asserted one analyst at a bank in 
ljubljana the capital of slovenia companies are exporting 
because they have no home market and its easier to get paid from 
abroad even if that means selling at a loss and eating into their 
capital

eastman kodak co ordered by a court to 
pay 9095 million in damages to polaroid corp said today it 
suffered a 206 million loss in the third quarter 
kodak said its earnings would have increased 19 percent without 
the judgment against it 
the photographic company said the loss which translated to 64 
cents per share compared with earnings of 510 million or 93 
cents per share in the same period a year earlier 
the us district court in boston earlier this month awarded 
4542 million in damages and 4553 million in interest to 
polaroid in a 14yearold patent infringement suit against kodak 
both kodak and polaroid have appealed the decision but kodak 
decided to take a 9095 million charge against its thirdquarter 
earnings to cover the costs of the award 
while no money has yet changed hands and the litigation has 
yet to be finally resolve this charge to earnings is appropriate 
at this time kodak chairman kay r whitmore said in a statement 
without the charge earnings would have been 358 million up 19 
percent from 300 million a year earlier kodak said 
sales increased 5 percent for the quarter to 477 billion 
compared to 454 billion in the same quarter last year 
whitmore said kodaks strong sales gains in international 
markets were partly offset by lagging us shipments that reflected 
the weakening economy in this country 
earnings for the first three quarters of 1990 totaled 377 
million or 116 per share down 36 percent from 589 million or 
182 per share in 1989 
without the polaroid charge earnings would have been up 60 
percent to 941 million 
this third quarter was only the fourth time kodak has ever taken 
a loss the last time was in the fourth quarter of 1989 when kodak 
took a charge of 273 million to pay for a restructuring program in 
which 7500 jobs were cut and about 20 businesses were sold or 
consolidated 
that restructuring was announced following depressed earnings in 
the first three quarters of 1989

a japanese company has agreed to pay 35 million 
to 41 victims of arsenic poisoning blamed on mining operations in a 
case first taken to court 15 years ago officials announced 
wednesday 
sumitomo metal mining co and the plaintiffs accepted the 
compromise plan recommended by the supreme court according to a 
court official speaking on condition of anonymity 
eighteen of the victims are still alive the rest were 
represented by family members 
tatsuro kamata a spokesman of sumitomo metal mining said in a 
statement that the company agreed to pay the amount not as 
compensation but as a token of sympathy he said the agreement did 
not refer to the question of the companys responsibility for the 
poisoning 
the plaintiffs had demanded a total of 166 million in 
compensation kamata said 
an official of the environment agency also speaking on 
condition of anonmity said residents near a mine on the 
southernmost main island of kyushu suffered arsenic poisoning from 
fumes he said the mine had been burning ore containing arsenic 
since 1920 to manufacture arsenic acid for agricultural use 
arsenic poisoning damages the nerves liver skin and other 
human organs kamata said sumitomo metal mining received mining 
rights for the toroku mine from nakajima mining co in 1967 as a 
payment for nakajimas debts to sumitomo but sumitomo gave up the 
rights in 1973 without ever engaging in mining or any other 
operations at the mine he added 
in 1975 23 victims filed suit demanding 6 million in 
compensation from sumitomo for poisoning 
a district court ruled in 1984 that as the owner the company 
was responsible for compensation whether it operated the mine or 
not it ordered sumitomo to pay 43 million and a high court 
upheld that ruling in 1988 
another group of 18 filed suit in 1984 and the previous rulings 
were upheld again in march this year nine of those 18 have died

the price of oil could easily explode to 
100 per barrel if war broke out in the persian gulf a panel of 
experts told a senate committee wednesday 
theres no limit said john lichtblau of the petroleum 
industry research foundation it depends on how much panic there 
is 
with the bush administration rattling sabres in iraqs 
direction sen joseph lieberman dconn presiding over a hearing 
of the senate governmental affairs committee echoed growing 
concern in congress about what will happen at the pump if war 
breaks out 
the day the war starts prices will explode said lichtblau 
one of several experts on the oil industry to appear before the 
panel 
oil prices hovering in the 33 per barrel range could easily 
triple said professor fariborz ghadar of george washington 
universitys business school i would not be surprised if oil 
prices reached 100 per barrel ghadar said 
translating a crude oil price increase into a higher price at 
the pump is an inexact science but some industry experts use a 
ratio of 12 cents more per gallon for every 5 increase in the 
price of a barrel of crude 
at 100 per barrel under that formula gasoline could rise to 
nearly 3 per gallon 
the witnesses told lieberman that with oil production already at 
or near capacity oil consuming states could do little beyond 
releasing oil reserves onto the market 
tapping oil reserves would have to go beyond the use of the us 
governments strategic petroleum reserve said professor ma 
adelman of the massachusetts institute of technology it would have 
to occur globally 
in addition to the strategic reserves there are the oil reserves 
held by private companies as well as substantial reserves held by 
japan and western european nations witnesses said 
the reasons for the sharp price rise the experts said would be 
fear that war would disrupt supply lines combined with the 
likelihood that a gulf war would curtail saudi arabias 
oilproducing capabilities 
conversely if iraqi president saddam hussein suddenly ends the 
crisis by withdrawing forces from kuwait the price of oil could 
drop just as suddenly to levels below those that preceded the aug 
2 invasion iraqi witnesses said 
that range is likely to be reached approximately 48 hours 
after the crisis is over lichtblau said 
if the stalemate continues it is likely that oil prices will 
remain about where they are but they could jump quickly with any 
disruption of a supply system already straining to meet demand 
this is a very tight market ghadar said a pipe blowing 
up in nigeria a fire in venezuela some other disruption could 
be enough to spread panic and push prices higher 
in the second of three hearings on the oil industry lieberman 
continued to pursue the question of whether oil companies and oil 
producing nations are unfairly gouging consumers 
in the past few months there has been an enormous transfer of 
wealth from the many oil consuming nations including the united 
states to the few oil producing nations lieberman said saudi 
arabia alone would reap a 50 billion windfall if oil averaged 30 
per barrel over the course of a year 
the answers lieberman received were not encouraging to 
consumers the witnesses said there was little the united states 
could do to break up the opec cartel in the meantime the simple 
laws of supply and demand would govern the price of oil 
witnesses rejected as unworkable for example liebermans 
suggestion that saudi arabia unilaterally lower the price of its 
crude in exchange for us military support the market would 
quickly absorb the cheap saudi oil and no other countries would be 
compelled to lower their prices lichtblau said

in addition mortgage applications nationwide have fallen about 
20 percent from the peak summer months although part of that is 
seasonal wynn blames sluggish economic conditions or prolonged 
worries about a recession 
people who may have had an interest in buying a house are just 
walking away he said 
many are opting to renovate the homes they already have that 
has helped builders and carpenters like 50yearold gonzalez keep 
busy as the rate of new commercial and residential building 
declines 
still gonzalez has tightened his belt i dont go out that 
much i cant afford it i cant buy the running shoes i want i go 
to kmart seven dollars gonzalez said 
the northeast is among the hardest hit big layoffs on wall 
street and in new englands hightech corridor have contributed to 
a plunge in real estate values and sales that translates into less 
demand for appliances furniture and other home incidentals 
even in the pacific northwest one of the economically strongest 
regions the rate of home sales and home appreciation has slowed 
wes lynch spokesman for the washington state association of 
realtors said seattle area homes that once sold within weeks now 
languish on the market for up to half a year 
i suspect a lot of washingtonians are waiting for the other 
shoe to drop said lynch referring to uncertainties posed by the 
persian gulf ordeal and the new federal budget 
both those situations have helped drive up interest rates 
although the federal reserve the nations central bank has 
signaled its intention to ease credit 
higher rates curtail consumer spending because they make 
borrowing more expensive rates on 30year conventional mortgages 
have risen to an average 1012 percent in october from 981 percent 
four months ago 
some economists argue that part of the sluggishness around the 
country can be traced to the changing nature of the population 
edward yardeni chief economist for prudentialbache securities 
inc said this change is particularly acute among members of the 
freespending postwar generation now getting into a more 
financially conservative middle age 
most baby boomers have almost every material good known to 
mankind but people in their late 30s and early 40s are no longer 
speculating in real estate and buying expensive foreign cars he 
said i think theyre more selective in their purchases 
thats true for mrs delessio a 29yearold insurance claims 
representative on maternity leave 
we started cutting coupons watching sales we wanted to get a 
new dining room set but weve postponed it until after christmas 
weve been making an effort to save more said mrs delessio 
with annual family income of around 60000 
ironically if more consumers behaved like mrs delessio her 
husband philip could be out work hes a 33yearold sales 
representative for a leather goods wholesaler whos largely 
dependent on the health of the nations retailers 
when the economy is bad they may not want to buy his 
products mrs delessio said 
dillon who sells medical equipment and earns 175000 a year 
before taxes has swum against the economic tide before the rocky 
mountain region in which he does business never prospered like the 
northeast or west coast during the 80s although conditions have 
stabilized he faces new challenges like filling his car with 
gasoline without losing money 
my travel costs have damn near doubled but my commissions 
havent the 49yearold dillon said adding that hes doing more 
business by phone and has dropped marginally profitable clients 
at the same time dillon said hes tried to invest more in his 
company by upgrading the phone and computer systems youve got 
to stand out among the crowd especially in times of economic 
trouble 
california financial planner and psychologist feltoncollins 
agreed this is an ideal time to look at where you stand 
financially what your goals are and what steps you can take to 
improve yourself 
there are other opportunities as well 
if youre in a steady profession and you dont anticipate 
this type of a situation would hurt you now might be the best time 
in the world to buy some of the things youve been thinking of 
buying badders of the national foundation for consumer credit 
said there are some good buys in homes probably autos 
others see possibilities in the stock market which also has 
taken a beating this year some of the stocks favored by investment 
counselors include drug companies and the blue chips or 
bigname issues with the greatest longterm returns 
stocks will continue to grow in the next five to 10 years the 
dow jones industrial average will probably hit 5000 said lenn 
width a retired lumberyard owner from lynwood wash who belongs

toys r us inc reported sluggish thirdquarter 
sales wednesday an indication that toy stores suffered the same 
dropoff in business as other retailers because of the persian gulf 
crisis 
toys r us said sales from stores open at least a year rose 16 
percent in the quarter ended oct 28 while overall sales were up 
148 percent retail industry analysts believe sales from stores 
open a year or more give a more accurate picture of a retailers 
performance 
the company said its results which it attributed to the 
difficult retail environment were down from the first half of the 
year 
retail sales which were already shaky because of a weakening 
economy slowed markedly after the aug 2 iraqi invasion of 
kuwait many economists say the middle east crisis has undermined 
consumers sense of security and it has also left them with less 
money to spend on extras like toys because of rising energy prices 
retailers are expected to have a difficult christmas season 
because consumers are certain to spend more cautiously this year 
than in previous holiday seasons 
toy retailers are likely to fare somewhat better than apparel or 
general retailers as parents may forgo gifts for adults in favor of 
spending more on children however the toys r us sales figures 
indicate that toy retailers may not be immune from the 
uncertainties expected to plague the overall industry this year 
the christmas season is crucial to all retailers because they 
generally make half their annual sales and earnings at that time 
many retailers are keeping their inventories low and slashing their 
expenses in hopes of holding on to their profits

the international energy agency reported wednesday 
that threats of oil shortages due to the persian gulf crisis are 
easing as opec countries boost output and industrial nations cut 
demand 
in a report made public as delegates from the organization met 
privately the iea predicted the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries will produce 226 million barrels of oil per 
day in the last quarter of 1990 
this would be a slight increase over 219 million barrels in the 
third quarter 
iea chairman ulrich engelmann told reporters after the meeting 
that the situation is somewhat easier than anticipated 
nonetheless he said if something happens there isnt any 
flexibility in the supply situation 
engelmann described the meeting as routine and said the 
delegates devoted most of their time to planning next years 
budget 
the report said total fourthquarter world oil supplies among 
nations outside the former communist bloc should total 534 million 
barrels per day up 400000 barrels from the third quarter 
consumption in the 21 industrial countries making up the iea 
founded in 1973to plan strategy for energy crises should fall by 
800000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter it said 
the latest estimates suggest a better balance in oil supply and 
demand than the iea thought at its last meeting in september 
according to the report 
the reasons are falling demand a moderate thirdquarter buildup 
of opec stocks and increased output by opec members to make up for 
the 45 million barrels per day lost to world markets by the un 
embargo of iraq and kuwait 
there isnt any shortage of supply in oil product markets 
said iea executive director helga steeg 
industrial countries will need to draw on a bit less than 1 
million barrels of oil a day from commercial reserves after new 
years to keep the figures in balance the report said 
short of any demand restraint and draw of government 
controlled stocks the draw of commercial stocks is practically the 
only possible response left to cope with unforeseen demand surges 
or supply disruptions it said 
the iea urged members to keep their strategic petroleum reserves 
as high as possible and warned that the oil market remains 
vulnerable to disruption 
saudi arabia the main staging point for the usled 
multinational forces arrayed against iraq in the gulf has boosted 
production to 8 million barrels per day to help make up the 
shortfall caused by the embargo 
the iea said saudi arabia could keep output at that level but 
probably not increase it much a spell of cold weather in northern 
countries this winter could drive up prices

the small business communitys economic mood 
this year took the steepest drop since the recession year 1982 dun 
amp bradstreet corp said in an annual survey released wednesday 
the survey of 5000 small businesses found that 23 percent are 
pessimistic about their economic prospects over the next 12 to 18 
months rising sharply from 13 percent reporting pessimism in 1989 
the surveys finding is significant because the mood index has 
closely matched shifts in economic growth these past 10 years 
marching together in virtual lockstep said patricia w 
hamilton editor of dampb reports dun amp bradstreets magazine for 
small business which conducted the survey 
roughly 68 percent of respondents said inflation would rise in 
the coming year while only 3 percent thought it would decline and 
17 percent said it would remain about the same 
survey respondents also expressed anxiety over interest rates 
with 47 percent predicting that rates would rise in the coming 
year and only 9 percent saying they would fall 
chief worries among small businesses were in order of

now that british and french diggers have linked up 
beneath the english channel a project executive said wednesday he 
was more confident of raising the billions of dollars needed to 
finish the rail tunnels 
people now believe that the tunnel can be done under the 
channel and the construction risk is perceived as hugely reduced 
alastair morton deputy chairman of the anglofrench consortium 
eurotunnel plc said by telephone 
everything is in place now for completion of the project in 
1993 he said 
diggers working from the english side in one of the three 
tunnels punched a 2inch hole through to the french side tuesday 
night three years after work began on the worlds largest current 
civil engineering project 
the breakthrough came on the service tunnel the smallest of 
three bores and it will be two months before that tunnel reaches 
its full 157foot diameter the first of the two 31mile rail 
tunnels between folkestone and the french port of calais is 
expected to be linked up next year 
eurotunnel timed a new share offering intended to raise 103 
billion to coincide with the breakthrough morton said 
the success of the share sale is a condition for the release of 
an additional 39 billion in loans from banks which already have 
put up 98 billion 
investors already have bought 194 billion of eurotunnel stock 
the tunnel now is estimated to cost 149 billion up 57 percent 
from the initial estimate of 94 billion in 1986 
eurotunnel is expected to open in june 1993 and carry 
passengers cars and freight between london and paris in three 
hours it expects to carry 28 million passengers in the first year 
morton said he was confident the share sale would succeed even 
though it was taking place just before the government plans to sell 
78 billion worth of stock in britains electricity industry 
the giant stock sales are being launched in a stock market that 
has been jittery because of the slowing british economy and the 
middle east crisis many investors have been sitting on the 
sidelines and trading volume has been low 
morton noted the eurotunnel sale already has been underwritten 
by investment firms and expressed confidence that investors have 
plenty of cash on hand 
the project has no government support and eurotunnel has said 
it doesnt expect to pay dividends for years however the stock 
offering includes inducements such as travel discounts 
confidence in eurotunnel has been shaken in the past by 
overruns cost disputes with contractors and management shakeups 
eurotunnel shares were offered at 679 in 1987 and rose as 
high as 1422 this year they fell 6 cents to close at 951 on 
londons stock exchange on wednesday

soybean futures prices closed slightly higher 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade after bouncing off 
threemonth lows in trading dominated by grain dealers corn and 
wheat futures retreated 
the soybean market opened stronger then fell as commercial 
players sold heavily following an unusually large number of 
delivery notices posted against the november contract 
wednesday was first notice day for the november soybean 
contract the first day for traders to indicate their intentions to 
deliver soybeans to those holding obligations to take delivery 
analysts said speculators absorbed most of the commercial 
selling then gladly sold many of those contracts back to the 
commercial players toward the end of the session to avoid getting 
stuck with physical deliveries 
the commercial buying interest surfaced when the november 
contract dropped below 590 to 589 a bushel its lowest price 
since aug 3 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 2 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 261 a bushel corn was 
1 cents lower to 1 cent higher with december at 229 a bushel 
oats were cent to 1 cent higher with december at 121 a bushel 
soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents higher with november at 592 a 
bushel

congress and the white house have once again 
postponed the date by which the federal deficit must be eliminated 
but in their latest change in the budget law they have included 
something new that is drawing raves from some fiscal experts tight 
spending controls 
we never before have had effective expenditure controls 
carol cox president of the watchdog committee for a responsible 
federal budget said wednesday that is incredible progress 
under the original 1985 version of the grammrudman 
balancedbudget law the federal shortfall was supposed to be 
eliminated this year when the law was changed in 1987 the target 
date was pushed back to fiscal 1993 
neither goal is attainable the deficit for the fiscal year that 
ended sept 30 was 2204 billion the second highest total ever 
this years gap is projected to exceed 250 billion a record 
even with the giant deficitreduction bill congress passed last 
saturday 
but that same measure contained extensive changes in the budget 
process that deemphasizes the laws focus on reaching specified 
deficit targets 
instead it groups many kinds of federal spending into three 
separate categories domestic defense and foreign affairs and 
puts a spending cap on each of them 
if the cap is exceeded most programs in that category would be 
slashed by an amount equal to the excess spending a powerful 
incentive to not go beyond the limit 
the creation of the three separate categories is important for 
another reason it prevents lawmakers from increasing domestic 
spending by cutting military programs this satisfies the bush 
administration which has been eager to prevent the 
democraticcontrolled congress from slashing the pentagons budget 
so it could beef up social programs 
they know were not going to cut money in one area and 
switch it to another said house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo 
the three categories will be combined into one in 1994 
other controls have been put on the fastestgrowing category of 
spending benefit programs such as medicare and social security 
these programs will be allowed to grow with inflation and as the 
population increases but any expansion in benefits would have to 
be balanced by an equal cut somewhere else 
some critics of the new law have argued that it shifts 
congressional budget power to the white house that is because the 
executive branch will have the power to decide which programs are 
assigned to each spending category and how deep required spending 
cuts will have to be 
but others argue tat under the old law the administration 
already had the final word on how deep spending slashes would have 
to be if deficits exceeded the ceilings the law set for them 
other changes in the budget law include 
deficit targets in the old law were fixed under the new law 
the targets will be adjusted to reflect changes in the economy 
since economic fluctuations have dramatic effects on government tax 
collections and spending this makes the target much more 
attainable 
some spending such as operation desert shield and the bailout 
of the savings and loan industry will not be counted against the 
deficit target those items were included under the old law for 
the first time emergencies such as funds to clean up after 
hurricanes will also not be counted

oil prices rallied late wednesday to move above 
35 per barrel in a third straight erratic trading session that 
largely ignored news on the persian gulf standoff 
light sweet crude oil had been down about 1 per barrel in early 
trading on the new york mercantile exchange but a surge in the 
afternoon pushed it up by about 2 from the morning lows crude 
settled at 3523 per barrel up 69 cents for the day on contracts 
for delivery in december 
all later contract months closed higher in a market that stayed 
about as sluggish as the two previous lackluster sessions 
compared to normal changes its a wimp today said philip 
l dodge an oil analyst with nomura securities international inc 
there hasnt been anything to signal that were closer to war or 
peace it just gets caught in the middle 
there was no dominant news moving the market although some of 
the move down was attributed to conciliatory remarks from iraq and 
some of the move up was attributed to war rhetoric from the united 
states and britain 
energy analyst thomas blakeslee of pegasus econometric group 
inc in hoboken nj said the late rally came as floor traders 
who had agreed to sell oil early in the day found they had bet the 
wrong way as oil refused to drop they then bought crudeoil 
contracts to avoid losing more money and the price went up 
on the close the market took off blakeslee said you 
found locals caught on the wrong side as it turned positive 
locals realized this market had no oomph to the down side 
future contracts for refined petroleum products also seemed to 
fluctuate with little sense of direction 
home heating oil closed 163 cents lower at 8954 cents a gallon 
on november contracts january and december contracts fell but 
more distant months moved higher for the day 
unleaded gasoline contracts were all higher at the close with 
november delivery up 271 cents to 9644 cents a gallon 
natural gas prices were also mixed december delivery contracts 
fell 48 cents to 236 per 1000 cubic feet

union machinists at the boeing co will cast an 
unusual midcontract vote in november on whether to accept the 
companys new program for dealing with drug and alcohol abuse 
leaders of the machinists union here recommend their 40000 
members at boeing vote the proposal down saying it fosters a 
policestate mentality 
machinists leaders say the plan punishes people seeking 
treatment for substance abuse boeing officials say the union wants 
too much of a hand in what should be a companyrun program 
the machinists struck boeing last year for 48 days before a new 
threeyear contract was approved nov 20 union officials say there 
wont be a strike if the plan is rejected but legal action is 
possible if boeing tries to impose it unilaterally 
bob de lappe corporate director of personnel said the vote was 
the first to be held by machinists in midcontract in the 38 years 
he has been with boeing 
jack daniels spokesman for district lodge 751 of the 
international association of machinists and aerospace workers said 
members of the four seattlearea locals at boeing would vote at 
meetings on thursday and nov 7 8 and 14 results wont be 
released until the 15th he said 
boeing machinists elsewhere including large contingents in 
wichita kan and portland ore also will vote on the proposal 
daniels said at meetings scheduled by local lodges 
de lappe said the new policy which would cover all of boeings 
approximately 150000 us employees is a total shift from 
punitive action to rehabilitative action 
in the past he said employees caught with or using drugs on 
company property were fired the new plan would offer them a second 
chance if they agree to undergo treatment 
boeing negotiated with machinists over the new drug policy in 
late august september and early october daniels said 
it continues to negotiate with the united auto workers which 
represents production workers at the boeing helicopter plant in 
philadelphia the seattle professional engineering employees 
association which represents boeing engineers and technicians has 
approved the plan 
boeings new policy comes as the us department of 
transportation is requiring stiffer substance abuse policies 
including random drug testing for some aircraft workers 
about 3100 boeing workers including drivers flight crews 
groundschool instructors and employees working on certain aircraft 
will be subject to the random tests under the federal rules 
boeing also plans testing when there is reasonable suspicion of 
alcohol or drug possession or use and after serious accidents or 
safety violations individuals who go through a treatment program 
also would be subject to tests 
workers who come to boeings employee assistance program for 
help with a drinking or drug problem will be referred to an outside 
rehabilitation program de lappe said if the testing finds theyve 
been backsliding they will be given one more chance 
people found possessing or under the influence of drugs or 
alcohol can go through rehabilitation but wont be given a second 
chance if they again test positive de lappe said 
as in the past anyone caught selling drugs on company property 
will be fired 
boeing has launched an extensive inhouse education campaign 
about the new policy it also is training supervisors how to 
recognize drug and alcohol problems 
socially we think its the right thing to do de lappe 
said we have a major drug problem in the community and we think 
this may be one way to address it in a positive manner 
the policy makes financial sense because its cheaper to 
rehabilitate people than to hire new ones he said 
but in a letter to union members district lodge 751 president 
tom baker said there arent enough safeguards in boeings plan 
against arbitrary decisions or harassment 
the boeingproposed program is a company program by for 
and to the benefit of the company he says it uses a 
policestate mentality and threats of termination even against 
those who voluntarily seek help

a 9095 million patent infringement 
judgment against eastman kodak co resulted in a 206 million third 
quarter loss for the photographic company 
kodak said wednesday its earnings would have increased 19 
percent for the quarter without the judgment 
the loss which translated to 64 cents per share compared with 
earnings of 300 million or 93 cents per share in the third 
quarter of 1989 without the charge earnings for the third quarter 
of 1990 would have been 358 million or 110 per share 
kodak was ordered by a us district court judge in boston 
earlier this month to pay polaroid 9095 million in a 14yearold 
patent infringement suit over kodaks sales of instant cameras and 
film 
while no money has yet changed hands and the litigation has 
yet to be finally resolved this charge to earnings is appropriate 
at this time kodak chairman kay whitmore said in a statement 
sales increased 5 percent for the quarter to 477 billion vs 
454 billion in the same quarter last year 
the results were pretty much in line with expectations said 
peter enderlin an industry analyst with smith barney harris upham 
amp co in new york sales were a little disappointing but the 
margins were excellent 
kodak benefited from a favorable foreign exchange rate and 
improvements in productivity gains enderlin said 
the company posted gains in its imaging chemicals and health 
segments the only disappointment was the information segment 
which includes kodaks copier and business operations where sales 
dropped 29 percent for the quarter 
i think top management is beginning to lose patience 
enderlin said there may be some fairly drastic steps taken with 
some pieces of that segment if they dont show tangible gains by 
the middle of next year 
earnings for the first three quarters of 1990 were 377 million 
or 116 per share down 36 percent from 589 million or 182 per 
share in 1989 without the polaroid charge earnings would have 
been up 60 percent to 941 million 
kodak last showed a loss in the fourth quarter of 1989 when the 
company took a charge of 273 million to pay for a restructuring 
program in which 7500 jobs were cut and about 20 businesses were 
sold or consolidated that restructuring was announced following 
depressed earnings in the first three quarters of 1989

currencies in domestic trading wednesday after generally finishing 
lower abroad 
gold prices were mixed 
analysts said there was no one force driving the foreign 
exchange market but a variety of factors affected the dollars 
performance against specific currencies 
mike faust a currency analyst with money market services in 
chicago said the dollar gained ground against the german mark on 
speculation that the bundesbank the german central bank might 
lower interest rates 
lower interest rates reduce a currencys attractiveness because 
investments denominated in that currency earn less

in london the british pound was quoted at 19440 compared with 
19485 late tuesday 
faust said the market expected the british government to lower 
rates by as much as half a percentage point 
the dollar had its best showing against the japanese yen which 
was hurt by pessimism over the persian gulf crisis the japanese 
economy is seen as particularly vulnerable should there be a 
disruption of energy supplies from the middle east as the country 
imports 99 percent of its crude oil 
in new york the dollar rose to 130105 yen from 128725 yen 
late tuesday in tokyo overnight the dollar closed at 12935 yen

rising incomes and declining home prices 
boosted the typical american familys ability to buy an existing 
house in september to its highest level in nearly two years a real 
estate trade group said wednesday 
the national association of realtors said its housing 
affordability index rose to 1109 in september from 1075 in 
august that meant a family with a median income of 35239 had 
1109 percent of the income needed to qualify for conventional 
financing to buy a medianpriced home costing 94300 
the median income was 35125 in august while the median price 
of a home was 97100 the realtors said 
the index was at its highest level since a 1112 reading in 
december 1988 
the median means half of the families earn more and half less 
or that half of the houses sell for more and half for less 
a decline in the median home price in september had the 
biggest positive impact on the index reading last month realtors 
president norman d flynn said however the decline failed to 
bring more buyers into the market as evidenced by an 8 percent 
drop in existinghome sales last month 
the interest rate used to compute the affordability index is a 
composite of closing rates for both fixedrate and adjustablerate 
mortgages on existing homes as reported by the federal housing 
finance board it rose from 998 percent in august to 1000 percent 
in september 
changes in the median home price median family income and 
average mortgage rate resulted in a 19 decrease in the monthly 
mortgage payment to 662 in september

soybean futures prices rebounded from threemonth lows wednesday 
on the chicago board of trade in what amounted to a market maneuver 
by grain dealers to transfer some of their storage costs to 
speculators 
on other commodity markets corn and soybean futures retreated 
oil futures were mixed precious metals were mixed and livestock 
and meat futures rose 
soybean futures settled cent lower to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in november at 592 a bushel 
the november contract fell as low as 589 a bushel its lowest 
level since aug 3 before bouncing back late in the session 
analysts said commercial players profited from the days action 
which began with an unusually large number of delivery notices 
posted against the november contract 
wednesday was first notice day or the first day for players 
holding short positions in the november contract to indicate to 
the exchange their intention to settle those sale agreements 
through physical delivery of soybeans rather than by taking 
offsetting market positions 
on the board of trade traders post delivery notices by handing 
over to the exchange clearinghouse their receipts for soybeans 
stored in exchangeapproved warehouses 
as the receipts come in the clearinghouse matches them with 
traders holding obligations to buy soybeans beginning with the 
oldest long position 
the holder of a receipt is considered the owner of the soybeans 
and is obliged to pay the storage costs 
analysts said virtually all of wednesdays delivery notices were 
posted by commercial grain dealers and most of the receipts were 
transferred to speculators most of whom have no interest in owning 
soybeans 
the speculators overwhelmingly refused delivery by selling 
november futures contracts to offset their market positions the 
buyers of those contracts late in the session were mainly the 
commercial players who posted the delivery notices analysts said 
meanwhile the warehouse receipts bounced from speculator to 
speculator and will eventually find their way back to the 
commercial participants 
thus many commercials were able to temporarily avoid storage 
costs for soybeans the most successful commercials also managed to 
effectively sell soybeans then buy them back at a lower price 
it was just like a gravy train said william biedermann 
research director with the commodities brokerage allendale inc 
wheat futures settled unchanged to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 262 a bushel corn was 1 
cents lower to cent higher with december at 229 a bushel oats 
were cent to 1 cent higher with december at 121 a bushel 
crude oil prices rallied above 35 a barrel late in the session 
on the new york mercantile exchange in a third straight day of 
erratic trading that largely ignored news on the persian gulf 
standoff 
light sweet crude oil settled 64 cents to 69 cents higher with 
december at 3523 a barrel heating oil was 163 cents lower to 
03 cent higher with november at 8954 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 12 cents to 271 cents higher with november at 9644 
cents a gallon 
the gold and silver markets ignored the oil rally and closed 
lower on new yorks commodity exchange platinum futures rose 
slightly on the new york mercantile exchange extending tuesdays 
powerful gains 
gold finished 40 cents lower across the board with december at 
38130 a troy ounce silver was 63 cents to 65 cents lower with 
november at 4153 a troy ounce platinum settled 140 higher 
across the board with january at 43840 a troy ounce 
higher cash cattle prices boosted cattle futures on the chicago 
mercantile exchange pork prices firmed amid expectations that cash 
markets will strengthen soon 
live cattle settled 10 cent to 45 cent higher with december at 
7745 cents a pound feeder cattle were 30 cent to 68 cent higher 
with november at 8772 cents a pound live hogs were 07 cent lower

new york ap in a final bid to persuade a judge to give 
michael milken a long prison term prosecutors claimed thursday the 
junkbond financier committed serious crimes beyond those he 
has admitted 
the government said in a closing statement that it 
conclusively proved at a special hearing that milken broke the 
law during three transactions despite scant hard evidence 
presented in testimony 
on wednesday the defense said the government had failed to 
prove its case and that milken should be sentenced only on the six 
felony counts to which he pleaded guilty in april 
us district judge kimba wood has not yet set a sentencing 
date but it is expected to take place next week milken faces a 
maximum 28 years in prison he already has agreed to pay 600 
million in penalties 
in its 40page memorandum prosecutors maintained that evidence 
presented at the eightday hearing establishes that michael 
milken committed serious crimes in addition to his admitted 
crimes 
it said the evidence also strongly refutes milkens claims 
that his crimes were isolated largely motiveless and committed 
reluctantly and at the behest of others 
as in earlier court papers the government claimed milken 
directed a crime spree to consolidate his market power and for his 
personal gain 
the judge will weigh the closing arguments along with the 
testimony and evidence presented at the hearing which she called 
to gain insight into milkens professional character 
despite the governments strong language testimony appeared to 
fall short of clearly linking milken to allegations of stock 
manipulation in wickes cos bribery and misappropriation of storer 
communications inc securities and insider trading in caesars world 
inc 
it did offer suggestions that milkens criminal behavior may 
have extended beyond the narrow charges to which he pleaded guilty 
testimony also presented vivid descriptions of shady behavior by 
underlings at drexels beverly hills calif highyield bond 
department 
milken had been the main target of the governments wall street 
probe from 1986 when he was named by inside trader ivan boesky 
on wickes the government said the record is crystal clear 
that milken ordered the companys stock manipulated upward in 
concert with boesky a former milken subordinate testified that 
milken shouted out a closing stock price which he said amounted to 
a call to manipulate the shares 
no witness though said milken directly ordered the 
manipulation and the defense claimed the main witness lied 
the government based its argument partly on an assertion that 
milken alone had the authority to use the boesky organization for 
illegal purposes several of the charges in milkens guilty plea 
involved lawbreaking with boesky 
the government also said milken illegally offered gratuities to 
favored clients and hoarded lucrative securities in a 1985 takeover 
of storer it also said milken deceived a major client and violated 
drexel policy in the deal 
on insider trading prosecutors said milken knew drexels plans 
to advise caesars about a debt restructuring when he ordered 
traders to buy the casino companys bonds in 1983 testimony was 
contradictory and did not establish a firm milken tie 
the government said milken personally made 553000 from the 
insider trading and that drexel and a major client made additional 
illegal profits 
finally the government memo said that suggestive testimony 
about possible obstruction of justice by milken should be 
considered as evidence of the pervasiveness of milkens criminal 
conduct 
at the hearing witnesses described secret bathroom meetings and 
hints to destroy evidence the defense said milken did not directly 
order any drexel employee to destroy papers give false testimony 
or obstruct investigators

developer donald trump raised new doubts about 
his financial stability wednesday by telling the american stock 
exchange it was unclear whether he would make a big interest 
payment on taj mahal casino bonds next month 
bob shabazian an exchange spokesman said the trump 
organization made the statement in response to a question from the 
exchange where the bonds are traded shabazian said trump didnt 
say whether the payment would be made or not 
the spokesman said the exchange routinely asks companies before 
their interest payments are due if they will meet their 
obligations 
the trump organization is supposed to pay 47 million in 
interest on 675 million in taj bonds nov 15 
stephen bollenbach the trump organizations chief financial 
officer was not in his office when a reporter called for comment 
late wednesday 
the american stock exchange halted trading in the bonds 
wednesday while it made the request of trump shabazian said 
activity in the securities would resume thursday but he said they 
would be trading on a flat basis meaning they would no longer 
accrue interest 
the development signaled new investor skepticism about trump 
who has been juggling his massive debt problems for months and has 
been intensely negotiating with bondholders on a restructuring of 
debts on the taj mahal the glitziest of his three atlantic city 
casinos 
earlier this month trump unveiled a restructuring proposal and 
warned bondholders that the taj mahal might be forced into 
bankruptcy court if the plan is turned down 
the restructuring would give bondholders a nearly 20 percent 
equity stake in the billiondollar taj mahal in return for changes 
in the terms of the junk bonds 
the plan called for the interest rate on the bonds to be lowered 
to 9 percent from their current 14 percent it also calls for the 
nov 15 payment to be met by issuing additional bonds 
some future interest payments would also be made with new bonds 
and the maturities of some issues would be extended under the plan 
wilbur ross a bondholder representative rejected the plan 
saying the 199 equity stake was too low ross represents 10 
institutions that hold about onethird of the taj mahal bonds 
the taj mahal opened earlier this year but like other atlantic 
city casinos has been struggling in an uncertain economy trump has 
been forced to negotiate with bondholders because his three casinos 
which also include trump castle and trump plaza have been 
unable to generate enough cash to pay all their bills 
earlier this year the developer negotiated a 65 million bank 
bailout that was supposed to give him breathing room to repay his 
loans which together are believed to total more than 3 billion

a cotton sale billed as the largest ever 
comes at a time when cotton supplies worldwide already are tight 
industry observers said wednesday 
the sale of 500000 bales to china was announced tuesday by 
dunavant enterprises inc of memphis 
the us cotton industry expects total sales of 15 million bales 
between aug 1 1990 and july 1991 of that total sales abroad 
are projected at 68 million bales 
the dunavant sale is the largest single cotton deal on record 
topping a 1984 sale when china bought 484000 bales from cargill 
inc according to the national cotton council 
the dunavant sale expected to be worth 200 million was 
negotiated over the past several weeks by representatives of 
dunavant enterprises and chinatex cotton import amp export corp of 
beijing 
even before the sale was finished the us cotton market was 
reacting to speculation of a major deal in the works said dean 
ethridge a vice president of sparks commodities inc of memphis 
this has been talked about for weeks i think to the extent 
that anyone is surprised it is to the size of the sale he said 
cotton prices on spot and futures markets hovered around 75 
cents a pound in the days just prior to the sale prices were under 
72 a pound on oct 1 
the dunavant deal will add to market pressures expected to keep 
cotton prices strong for the next nine months ethridge said

the new york mercantile exchange announced steps 
wednesday that likely will drive out some oil speculators on the 
eve of a senate inquiry into what critics have called reckless 
gambling on oil in the futures market 
thehange one of the worlds key markets for petroleum said 
it would raise the amount of cash that must be put up by people who 
buy and sell contracts for future delivery of crude oil heating 
oil and unleaded gasoline 
players in the market will have to put up two to three times as 
much money as they did before iraqs invasion of kuwait sent oil 
prices skyrocketing 
basically what that does is it takes a certain percentage of 
speculators out of the market said thomas blakeslee an energy 
analyst with pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken nj the 
higher the margin the more costly it is for a speculator to be 
involved 
the move came just before a senate governmental affairs 
committee hearing thursday that will explore oil trading on the 
mercantile exchange the hearing was organized by sen joseph i 
lieberman dconn who has called oil traders speculator 
sharks and urged that they be required to put up more money 
mercantile exchange president r patrick thompson said wednesday 
evening that the exchanges move has nothing to do with liebermans 
inquiry and is not intended to drive away speculators thompson 
said there is little speculation taking place on the futures 
market with minimal effect on oil prices 
he cited an exchange study also released wednesday that 
indicates more than 90 percent of trading on the exchange is done 
by participants in the oil industry who conceivably have oil 
production or oil purchases that can be hedged against price 
fluctuations by futures trading 
thompson said the exchange was raising its margins in order to 
ensure participants will be able to pay cash to meet their 
obligations and that the higher margins were needed because of 
increased volatility in recent days 
in order to protect the financial integrity of the contracts 
its appropriate to raise margins thompson said in a telephone 
interview 
lieberman did not accept everything the exchange had to say 
the timing is too coincidental for me not to feel some 
satisfaction that weve influenced them the senator said from 
washington it does confirm the fears that ive expressed over 
the last month or more that there was an irresistible temptation to 
participate in a market which was rising as fast as the oil futures 
market has been when you could become a player with so little 
money on the table 
the exchanges higher margins will take place in two steps after 
the trading sessions on friday and tuesday after the end of the 
trading day tuesday customers who buy a contract for 1000 barrels 
of crude oil for next month delivery will have to put up 12000 
or 14000 during the last six days in which that contract is 
traded 
at current oil prices that means a player would have to put up 
a little less than a third of the contacts value 
it remains to be seen whether thats adequate lieberman 
said 
the senator also questioned the mercantile exchanges method of 
determining how much oil speculation is taking place 
the exchanges numbers consider a market participant to be a 
nonspeculator if he or she is connected with the oil industry the 
only oil deals that are taken into account are those that are left 
open overnight which would exclude any trades made by people 
who get in and out of the market in the same day 
a lot of those that i would consider speculators are closing 
their interest by the end of the day and are therefore not being 
counted lieberman said my concern is that the numbers as 
theyve given them to me underestimate the amount of speculation 
thompson was to appear at liebermans hearing to present the 
mercantile exchanges side another of liebermans witnesses a 
former stockbroker who now works as a financial consultant planned 
to paint a darker view of the oil trading industry 
oil futures prices can be manipulated by traders spreading 
rumors and the eventual effects can be devastating to the economy 
the witness rande leonard of phoenix said in a telephone 
interview wednesday 
the implications are too great to have some jokers messing 
around just jacking up this commodity he said if they want 
to do this to something let them do it in pork bellies orange 
juice cocoa

the united states and panama opened 
negotiations wednesday on a banking disclosure proposal that 
businessmen say would destroy the countrys bank secrecy and hurt 
its overseas banking business 
the proposed legal assistance agreement covers investigation 
prosecution and prevention of crimes in general but its main target 
is the laundering of drug money in panamas international banking 
center 
panama allows banks to disclose information on accounts only 
when a crime that is covered by panamanian law is being prosecuted 
in this country 
the united states is proposing disclosure of all information 
about transactions worth more than 10000 when there is an 
investigation into a crime or violation of laws of the side 
requiring the information according to a draft of the proposal 
obtained by the associated press 
private banking and business organizations immediately stated 
their opposition 
the banking association a private organization of nearly 100 
banks warned in that any such agreement must not place the 
country or the international banking center of panama in a 
disadvantageous situation against countries with service economies 
and similar banking centers 
the association said an agreement should be applied only when 
laws of both countries are violated and not apply to violations of 
tax or foreign exchange laws 
signing the agreement far from solving our problems worsens 
them the association of panamanian business executives said 
by pretending to give the justice department of the united 
states indiscriminate access to any bank account without regard 
for the honorability of the account holder would destroy the 
confidentiality and the possible exodus of a large amount of 
depositors would begin the businessmen said 
this would endanger many jobs this cost would not be offset 
by the economic assistance that the united states has conditioned 
to the signing of this agreement 
part of the 420 million in us aid approved for panama after 
the dec 20 us invasion that overthrew dictator manuel antonio 
noriega was conditioned on the signing of a legal assistance 
agreement 
noriega is jailed in florida awaiting trial on drug trafficking 
charges
