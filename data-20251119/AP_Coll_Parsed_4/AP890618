a canadian court has ruled 
that a former puyallup tribal leader convicted of racketeering in 
the united states is not a political refugee under canadian law 
the unanimous ruling by the canadian federal court of appeals 
could lead to robert satiacums deportation to the united states 
the morning news tribune of tacoma reported in sundays editions 
the court held that canadas immigration appeals board 
incorrectly granted satiacums request to become canadas first 
political refugee from the united states 
the immigration board had agreed with satiacums claim that he 
was in danger of persecution and death if he returned to america 
however that decision was appealed by the canadian department of 
education and immigration which said satiacum sought refuge in 
canada to escape a prison term in the united states 
the case will return to the immigration appeals board but that 
board is precluded from deciding in satiacums favor a second time 
once the board rules again satiacums case will return to a 
hearing to decide whether he will be deported to the united states 
satiacum a resident of tacoma wash went to canada following 
conviction on 46 counts of racketeering in november 1982 after he 
fled satiacum was convicted of 24 counts of embezzlement he was 
not sentenced in either case 
satiacum meanwhile faces criminal charges in british columbia 
that could jeopardize his efforts to win a permanent home in canada 
he is to go on trial nov 6 on charges that he molested a young 
girl under canadian law a conviction on the charge which carries 
a 10year prison sentence would give the immigration minister the 
right to deport him without a hearing 
neither satiacum nor his lawyer david gibbons could be reached 
for comment friday

the pigeon river runs clean and clear for a 
few miles downstream from its source but as it snakes through the 
mountains of western north carolina the stream becomes a foaming 
stinking sewer that looks like root beer smells like rotten eggs 
and carries a dose of deadly dioxin 
the rivers tragic transformation takes place in this little mill 
town of 4700 residents 
it was here 20 miles west of asheville that the champion 
international corp built a paper products plant in 1908 since 
then champions mill has dumped countless millions of gallons of 
dark poisonous wastewater into the pigeon river 
for those eight decades people downstream in tennessee have 
complained time and time again to little avail 
if the tennesseans fear for their health upriver in north 
carolina the fear is for 2000 mill jobs now folks on both sides 
of the state line are waiting anxiously as the rivers fate is about 
to be decided by the us environmental protection agency 
its the classic confrontation between jobs and environmental 
concerns says john marlar the epa official in atlanta who must 
make the initial recommendation it could come within 30 days 
we have received more than 180000 letters on this matter he 
said it has been a unique case in that there are two states 
involved and that they have been unable to reach an accommodation 
with each other and its very very rare when we have to step in 
and take over a states responsibility to monitor water quality the 
way weve had to do in north carolina 
the canton plant which makes envelope paper and milk cartons 
has enormous political clout on its side of the border it is the 
biggest employer in the western end of the state with a payroll of 
2000 workers 
champion has been operating since 1981 without a valid federal 
wastewater discharge permit marlar said in 1984 the state of 
north carolina issued them a permit over our objections and thats 
when we got involved 
people along the river have complained for decades that 
champions steaming hot darkstained and foulsmelling effluent was 
wiping out most of the aquatic life for 60 miles downstream making 
the river unfit for recreation or use as a water supply 
then in 1987 the federally sponsored national dioxin study 
revealed that the bleaching process used to make milk cartons also 
creates chloroform and dioxin one of the deadliest poisons 
that changed everything marlar said 
it also created a furor along the tennessee border 37 miles 
downstream from canton the news was especially disturbing in 
hartford a riverside hamlet two miles from the state line 
the community known locally as widowsville has had a rash 
of cancer deaths over the past 20 years 
were convinced theres a correlation between these deaths and 
the river says charles lewis moore the chief administrative 
officer of cocke county tenn 
he added the epa has recommended that the river be posted to 
prevent people from eating the few bottom feeders catfish and 
suckers mostly that can survive in that muck and mire but what 
about the people who have lived beside it for all these years 
joe hall is one of those people the 50yearold hall who 
operates a grocery and restaurant at hartford said he cant 
remember when the river wasnt black and stinking 
when we were kids we used to have to hold our noses to keep 
from smelling it when we walked back and forth from school he 
said 
at newport 10 miles further downstream local people formed the 
dead pigeon river council to fight for a clean river fran 
ketterman one of the founders had little good to say about either 
the epa or champion 
champion could clean up the river if it really wanted to also 
we didnt even learn about the dioxin from the epa it was 
greenpeace that tipped us off she said 
fish taken from the river have shown high dioxin levels she 
said you should see those fish their bodies are covered with 
huge abscesses and tumors their fins are backwards and their eyes 
are missing 
the pigeon river flows through the center of newport but the 
citys 8500 residents pipe in their drinking water from the french 
broad six miles away 
cocke county loses more than 7 million a year in potential 
development and tourism dollars because of the rivers pollution 
according to studies quoted by moore 
were counting on the epa to clean up this mess he said 
oliver blackwell the manager of champions canton plant says 
there is no hard evidence to bear out allegations about increased 
incidence of cancer in cocke county 
however he quickly adds i know the people in tennessee are 
very upset and concerned we havent done a good job keeping them 
informed of all of our many past efforts to clean up our discharge 
but were working on it and i ask them to be patient and to trust 
us 
the tennesseans laugh when told that blackwell wants their trust 
they say champion was using economic blackmail when it threatened 
to close its canton plant in late december after tennessee 
authorities refused the companys proposal to substantially reduce 
the color in its discharges the dark color prevents sunlight from 
filtering through and sustaining aquatic life 
tennessees refusal was influenced by gov ned mcwherters canoe 
trip down the pigeon river last fall after spending time on the 
river and after learning that champion international the nations 
fifthlargest paper maker had realized 124 billion in profits 
over the past 10 years mcwherter declared tennessee was being 
abused by north carolina 
tennessees refusal to accede on the water color issue and the 
companys subsequent threat to close the plant sent the people of 
canton into a frenzy of fear and anger against the people downstream 
weve been wronged by a neighbor complained north carolina 
gov jim martin 
things got so heated at one point that a north carolina 
legislator proposed that all shipments of tennessees strong brown 
liquid jack daniels whiskey be stopped at the border cooler 
heads prevailed 
i regret all those angry charges and boycott threats says 
blackwell its just that the technology currently doesnt exist 
to completely clean up our discharge 
if ordered to clean up its act completely he says the plant 
would have to close thus throwing 2000 people out of work stamey 
cantons city manager shudders at the prospect of losing the 90 
million worth of annual wages and benefits generated by champion 
weve got our fingers crossed waiting to see what the epa will 
do about champions water permit stamey said we really cant 
make any plans for the future until we know the outcome 
on march 29 the epa issued a preliminary draft of a compromise 
plan that would give champion three years to install the technology 
needed to significantly reduce the color content and toxicity of its 
discharge 
the epas marlar said he thinks champion should be required to 
immediately begin reducing the amount of dioxin released into the 
river but the exact formula has not been worked out

two years ago the epa tested a trout from the river and it had a 
dioxin level of 90 parts per trillion more than three times higher 
than the consumption cutoff level recommended by the government 
sludge taken from the river has tested as high as 260 parts per 
trillion 
if after three years the company has met all of our 
requirements we will issue them a discharge release permit 
marlar said meanwhile as long as they continue to operate 
without a permit they are leaving themselves liable to possible 
legal actions 
blackwell estimated the compromise proposal would mean a 50 
percent reduction of the mills workforce over the next few years 
he said it will cost champion about 300 million to install the 
necessary technology 
but he added it will allow us to remain in operation so 
we can live with this compromise if we have to 
whether the people downstream can accept the threeyear plan is 
another matter 
something should be done right away joe hall said its 
wrong to let a company destroy a beautiful river simply in the name 
of profits

businessmen who shared in a 17 million profit from a government 
contract the official helped to award new york newsday reported in 
its sunday editions 
joseph monticciolo left his government job early in 1988 to 
become board chairman and chief executive of the eagle capital 
group an investment group headed by developer sheldon goldstein 
also sunday the new york times reported that more than half the 
money new york state received from a special discretionary hud fund 
went to projects pushed by sen alfonse damato 
newsday reported that most members of the eagle group also were 
involved in an investment group headed by goldstein that made a 
large profit on at least one deal 
goldstein is a prominent financial supporter of gov mario cuomo 
and damato 
the investment group bought seven housing projects from hud in 
1983 for 109 million after putting up only 550000 in cash three 
years later the group sold the projects for an estimated 17 
million profit the paper said 
while monticciolo was regional director several other hud 
management contracts were awarded to goldstein firms the newspaper 
said 
the eagle capital group was formed late in 1987 one month before 
monticciolo left hud he receives 125000 a year to direct the 
firm he also has received a 15 percent share of the group at almost 
no cost other partners invested a total of 1 million in the firm 
newsday reported that both eagle and monticciolo are being 
investigated by congress as part of a growing probe by congress into 
political favoritism at hud during the reagan administration 
neither monticciolo nor goldstein would comment on the story the 
newspaper said 
a spokesman for eagle said monticciolo had not favored goldstein 
while at hud and had done nothing wrong in the housing projects deal 
meanwhile the times reported that almost a third of the nearly 
38 million in a hud discretionary fund went to projects in new york 
state between 1981 and 1988 the funds were at the department 
secretarys disposal 
more than half of the 12 million the state got went to projects 
supported by damato the times said 
none of the projects is known to be part of the federal 
investigation into hud the paper said 
a swimming pool for island park damatos hometown has been 
criticized as an unnecessary hudfinanced project but the times

poles voted again sunday as the 
solidarityled opposition tried to capture the few open 
parliamentary seats it did not clinch in the first round of the 
freest elections in eastern europe in four decades 
the communist party hoped to soften the stunning rebuff of the 
june 4 voting the independent solidarity union won 252 of the 261 
seats open to it in the new national assembly 
the turnout of the 27 million eligible voters remained a big 
question for sundays second round many said they made their views 
clear in the first round and turned their attention back to the 
economic difficulties of daily life in poland 
all but nine of the 303 elections were being contested only by 
communist candidates and their allies who failed to get firstround 
majorities 
however solidarity sought to bolster its power in the national 
assembly by endorsing the most reformoriented party members in the 
runoff 
eight seats remained undecided in the new freely elected 
100member senate where solidarity candidates took 92 places by 
getting more than 50 percent of the vote on june 4 
solidarity also won 160 of the 161 seats open to independent 
candidates in the 460member sejm or parliament during the first 
round 
only three sejm candidates from the communist party coalition 
reformers who had gained support from solidarity activists in their 
regions won firstround victories 
in addition 33 of the 35 top government officials on the 
national list of unopposed sejm candidates did not receive the 
required 50 percent of the votes cast and they have been replaced 
by 66 new candidates for the second round 
the communists best chance of winning a senate seat was henryk 
stoklosa a rich fertilizer company owner from the western province 
of pila he was the only coalition candidate to outpoll a solidarity 
opponent although he did not get a majority 
the elections are part of political and economic reforms 
negotiated during two months of unprecedented talks between the 
communist government and the opposition the two sides also agreed 
in april to make solidarity legal again

despite efforts by the tehran hierarchy to head off any political 
upheaval after khomeinis death june 3 the moderates or 
pragmatists still face a power struggle with radical rivals who 
claim they are khomeinis revolutionary heirs 
president ali khamenei 49 was swiftly elected the countrys 
spiritual leader by the 83member assembly of experts formed in 
1979 to ensure a smooth succession when khomeini died 
but it is hashemi rafsanjani parliament speaker acting 
commanderinchief and khameneis political ally who has emerged 
as the strongman of the pragmatist alliance 
ahmad khomeini the late leaders 43yearold son appears to 
have been effectively sidelined his political ambitions dashed for 
the time being at least he is a onetime rafsanjani ally now allied 
with the radicals 
rafsanjanis high profile at this critical time underlines that 
for now the pragmatists have wrested control away from the 
radicals who were on the rise before khomeini died 
radicals including interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi along 
with military commanders and political leaders have declared 
allegiance to the new leader 
but that display of unity masks the bitter rivalries that could 
intensify now that khomeini is not around to keep them in check as 
he did for years by alternating his support between the factions 
rafsanjani has favored increasing foreign ties to end irans 
isolation even if he has given little sign of it since khomeinis 
death 
analysts believe that for the time being he has to tread softly 
to avoid accusations he is deviating from khomeinis legacy of scorn 
for irans enemies 
rafsanjani and his allies believe that economic and social 
liberalization are essential after the sacrifices and hardships of 
the eightyear war with iraq 
they believe iran cannot afford to rely on fundamentalist slogans 
to feed and employ its rapidly growing population which is hungry 
for a better life after the war the excesses of the islamic 
revolution and chronic economic problems 
by contrast the antiwestern radicals want to tighten state 
control of the economy and further khomeinis fundamentalist crusade 
among the worlds 800 million moslems 
rafsanjani and his allies may be able to consolidate control if 
they can hold out until august when presidential elections and a 
national referendum on sweeping constitutional changes will be held 
the speaker is the only declared candidate in the aug 18 
election khamanei whose second fouryear term expires in october 
cannot run for a third term 
if rafsanjani gets the constitutional changes through and gets 
elected as well hell be in a very strong position said shahram 
chubin an iran specialist with genevas graduate institute of 
international affairs 
but hell have to move slowly against the radicals cutting 
them off one by one he said 
the reforms are being worked out by a committee formed by 
khomeini before his death to correct what he called flaws and 
imperfections in the 1979 revolutionary constitution the panel is 
expected to recommend investing more power in the presidency and 
possibly scrapping the post of prime minister now held by 
hardliner hussein musavi 
it may also propose downgrading the religious qualifications for 
leadership thus opening the door for men with lesser islamic 
credentials 
khomeinis death apparently ended the concept of veleyate faqih 
or rule by the divine regent and rafsanjani is now likely to push 
for a more secular state

every few minutes a jet leaving kai tak airport 
soars over the sham shui po detention center for vietnamese boat 
people 
pham ngoc quang and the other 6650 vietnamese at the camp want 
to take the flights to the united states and other western 
countries that is why they suffered the long hazardous journey by 
boat to hong kong 
hong kong wants to fly them all back to vietnam 
pham who paid a smuggler eight gold rings for the boat passage 
insists he left vietnam not to be fed but to find freedom 
he is among the growing number of vietnamese who fled their 
homeland not because of political persecution but because of 
economic hardship they have overwhelmed refugees facilities in hong 
kong and elsewhere and prompted demands they be forcibly repatriated 
pham fought for the army of communist north vietnam whose 
overthrow of the usbacked south vietnam government in april 1975 
began the boat exodus more than a million vietnamese have left but 
western nations are increasingly reluctant to resettle them 
boats carrying 369 vietnamese arrived in hong kong on saturday 
bringing arrivals this year to 20327 compared with 19000 in 1988 
a government spokesman said on condition of anonymity in all some 
44000 illegal immigrants from vietnam live in refugee camps in hong 
kong 
on friday local police in tokyo said 105 people found on a 
wooden boat near a southwestern japanese island were vietnamese who 
left home in search of a place where they could enjoy a higher 
standard of living 
for 14 years much of the world considered anyone fleeing vietnam 
a legitimate refugee and they were entitled to quick resettlement 
in the west but as more peasants flooded out in recent years 
officials began considering sending them back 
now many countries are sick of the refugee problem especially 
when faced with people who are not real refugees said prachyadavi 
tavedikul deputy spokesman of thailands foreign ministry 
the anger over boat people is not limited to governments 
about 700 people marched through hong kongs yuen long district 
on sunday to protest the opening in their neighborhood of a new camp 
for boat people they called on authorities to stop allowing 
vietnamese into this british colony 
at an indochinese refugee conference in geneva recently britain 
and hong kong called for the forced return of those not fleeing for 
political reasons hong kong governor david wilson said this was the 
humane course because they would otherwise continue to sail in 
unsafe boats only to suffer prolonged detention in camps 
but vietnam with soviet backing repeated it will not accept 
those forced to return 
the united states said it opposed forced repatriation unless 
economic social and political conditions in vietnam improve 
dramatically 
the conference did not endorse forced repatriation but it 
adopted a plan to screen all new arrivals the plan called for 
encouraging voluntary return and said if this did not succeed 
alternatives would be examined 
some officials in thailand and malaysia have said privately that 
forced repatriation is the only solution and that screening 
procedures dont deter the arrivals 
under screening procedures adopted by hong kong last june only 
143 vietnamese have returned voluntarily even though the united 
nations gives financial aid for people to return 
the harsh boat journey and pirate attacks also have not stopped 
the boat people 
according to suvit yodmani thailands government spokesman two 
vietnamese women arriving there may 30 said pirates attacked their 
boat and killed the other 18 passengers on june 1 fishermen picked 
up three vietnamese after their boat carrying 40 people capsized 
suvit said 
hong kong malaysia and thailand will however benefit from the 
pledges at geneva to resettle 53500 vietnamese refugees over the 
next three years the united states pledged 22000 places 
in hong kong some relief officials say conditions are worse than 
ever and government detention sites are inhumane with no room left 
this week 4500 refugees were living on a remote island in spartan 
filthy conditions with no electricity 
chris bale the director of the relief agency oxfam hong kong 
said many vietnamese were suffering psychological problems from 
being confined in camps for years 
many vietnamese appeared dejected and listless in the sham shui 
po detention center a former army barracks surrounded by a high 
metal wall topped with barbed wire 
across the street a billboard advertising american cigarettes 
features a huge picture of the statue of liberty 
in the camps northern and southern vietnamese clash and refugees 
stage daily hunger strikes to protest their classification as 
illegal immigrants 
just be careful when you walk by some may be very violent a 
government worker warned a reporter visiting sham shui po on friday 
bale said few solutions were offered in geneva to the root of the 
problem the conditions in vietnam that prompt flight 
were talking about one of the worlds poorest countries 
ostracized by the world community for 10 years still bearing the 
scars of a very long and bitter war he said 
he urged the united states to free trade and aid for vietnam by 
normalizing diplomatic relations washington has said it wont do 
that before vietnam resolves the conflict over its decadeold 
military occupation of cambodia

vietnamese boat people arriving in 
hong kong braved the seas hoping for resettlement in the west but 
instead they are finding themselves towed to this deserted island 
tents raised by sticks and branches are their homes wornout 
mats cardboard and plastic sheets are their beds daily meals are 
biscuits and canned food 
litter is spead over the islands tiny paths and slopes its 
stench worsened by the summer heat there is no electricity 
about 4500 vietnamese were on the island during a 
governmentarranged visit by reporters friday 
my future is bleak said 30yearold phan quyen a dental 
technician who fled ho chi minh city formerly saigon i want to 
go to australia anywhere is better than tai a chau life here is 
tough i have not had any rice for 11 days 
le thi chau 31 an english teacher from danang in central 
vietnam said i never imagined it like this its terrible but i 
have sympathy with the hong kong government many many people have 
arrived 
there are no cooking facilities on the island and refugees are 
forced to dig holes for toilets said marine police chief inspector 
au wailam 
there is no hygiene at all he said i feel sorry for them 
but look at the situation in hong kong we just cant cope with it 
a junior officer said the boat people often fight over food and 
space people from northern vietnam clash with the southern 
vietnamese others said 
since may 30 authorities have been towing boats carrying 
vietnamese to the island 19 miles from the city center because no 
other facilities remain in hong kong initially the refugees were 
allowed ashore only to relieve themselves 
the vietnamese spend several days on the island before being 
moved to facilities in hong kong 
western relief agencies have criticized conditions at tai a chau 
when typhoon dot approached earlier this month authorities moved 
some of the vietnamese from tai a chau to a nearby island and others 
to the marine police headquarters on the main hong kong island when 
the threat subsided they were moved back 
besides the vietnamese the only people on the island are chow 
yufook and ng singtai an elderly chinese couple who live near the 
pier they say the vietnamese have ruined their peaceful existence 
i cant sleep at night said mrs chow 62 they are 
annoying the beans and sweet potatoes i grew are gone i cant even 
pick up shells the fish are all scared away by the boats

twentyfive years after congress tore down the 
trappings of racial segregation in america civil rights leaders are 
reeling from setbacks in the supreme court and calling for urgent 
measures to save protections they say are endangered by the latest 
decisions 
what is required is legislative action to address every single 
point the court made and sooner rather than later us civil 
rights commission member mary frances berry said following the 
courts latest decision last week 
failure of congress to act she said could cause a bottomless 
pit of agitation similar to the turmoil that gave rise to the 
landmark civil rights act of 1964 the measure signed into law by 
president lyndon b johnson 25 years ago next month banned 
segregation in public accommodations and its title vii paved the way 
for court action to end to bias in hiring and promotions 
the court is essentially saying hey title vii let me give you 
a good birthday present berry said and the birthday present is 
that we could care less about civil rights or history or any of it 
we are the reagan court and take that 
her bitter tone was echoed by numerous civil rights leaders 
redneck justice meted out with country club manners is no less 
painful than the real thing molly yard president of the national 
organization for women declared in a statement 
in a 54 decision the court on thursday barred use of an 1866 
civil rights law to fight racial harassment although it did 
unanimously uphold the law itself originally passed to help freed 
slaves 
it was only the latest in a stream of 1989 decisions that alarm 
civil rights leaders 
on jan 23 the court in a 63 decision put limits on what state 
and local governments may do to implement affirmative action plans 
striking down a richmond va program that set aside a portion of 
public works projects for minorityowned contracting companies 
on june 5 the justices in a 54 decision made it more difficult 
for workers to prove job bias through the use of statistical data 
on june 12 in a 54 decision the court expanded the possibility 
for white men to challenge longstanding courtapproved plans 
providing preferential treatment for minorities and women in 
government jobs 
the courts new turn has been welcomed by conservatives as a long 
overdue change in direction conservative legal analyst bruce fein 
said legions of lawsuits could be expected challenging 
longstanding consent agreements in government hiring cases the wave 
of litigation will mean progress he said because much of the time 
white males were not party to the initial agreements 
it was like negotiating munich without czechoslovakia at the 
negotiating table he said czechoslovakia didnt fare very 
well it wasnt a very glorious result 
civil rights forces scorn such comparisons saying there were 
ample chances for white men to become parties to the initial 
agreements and that in many cases they did participate in fairness 
hearings i dont think most of the consent decrees were entered 
into in a star chamber with everybody else excluded said patricia 
ireland of the national organization for women 
court decisions since january have taken a heavy toll on what 
civil rights forces had counted as permanent gains she said 
i think our recourse has to be political and i dont mean just 
electoral politics but the politics of marches and demonstrations 
she said 
meanwhile a cascade of criticism rained down on the court 
following thursdays decision 
the court is abandoning its historic role as the principle 
protector of individual rights and liberties for the last 35 
years said benjamin hooks of the leadership conference on civil 
rights 
ralph neas of the leadership conference said that he had spent 
part of the afternoon meeting with congressional aids to discuss 
the range of legislative options and that prospects appeared good 
that civil rights legislation would be introduced this year 
without doubt the supreme court has made it much more difficult 
for minorities and for women to win civil rights cases he said 
he called the latest round of decisions a disaster for all those 
committed to equal employment opportunity 
barbara arnwine executive director of the lawyers committee for 
civil rights under law declared that the court has absolutely no 
appreciation for modernday racism 
this court seems to feel that racism isnt really an issue in 
modern society and that blacks and hispanics and asians are making 
it and that theyre making it at the expense of white men she 
said and thats wrong

soviets had comforted themselves with the belief 
their children would have better lives but glasnost is making them 
painfully aware of how untrue that can be a soviet journalist says 
there was an expression that children are the only privileged 
class said natalie darialova that belief was easy to maintain 
during the decades when officials denied social problems and branded 
acknowledgment as undermining communism 
but under the recent policies of glasnost or more openness 
soviets are finding that the system has failed the children leaving 
them neglected at home or stupefied with boredom she said 
an estimated 300000 are consigned to orphanages that do little 
more than feed and clothe them ms darialova said 
the root of those abuses was the topheavy bureaucracy and the 
corruption that flourished during leonid brezhnevs years as soviet 
leader she said in a recent interview here while on a private trip 
in addition she said societys pressure on women to work and 
their need for the extra income led many couples to neglect their 
children a prominent soviet sociologist reported last year that 94 
percent of soviet women worked and that working mothers spent an 
average of just 30 minutes a week on spiritual communication with 
their children 
ms darialova began investigating the problems of youth in 1985 
when she was assigned by the weekly literary gazette to do a story 
about five children left unattended who died in a house fire 
when she asked local authorities why the parents hadnt been able 
to find someone to watch the children i found that no one was in 
charge of child welfare she said the local soviets councils 
had no authority no money they were the poorest bodies 
under brezhnev social and cultural programs were cut much 
money went to who knows where she said 
the bleakness of life in many soviet cities is in effect a sort 
of child abuse ms darialova said many children have little to do 
with their free time and youthful energy 
that can lead to street crime which soviet figures say has risen 
by about 40 percent in the past year or other antisocial behavior 
one press report bemoaned motorcycle gangs made up of minors who 
like to ride with the wind 
imagine a city with no cultural facilities children can go out 
and buy a bottle of wine and the road to crime is open she said 
adding that by cultural facilities she meant movies and places 
for rock music as well as opera and classical music 
the government has begun an extensive program to combat alcohol 
abuse by upping prices and raising the drinking age to 21 but it 
has not reduced childrens desire to combat boredom through 
intoxication she said 
coming to grips with their childrens problems has been traumatic 
because in general there is much love all their lives is in 
their children russian babushkas grandmothers are famous for 
their devotion 
in discussions i often hear that in brezhnevs time we didnt 
have these problems of course it is frightening when you open a 
newspaper and its more and more problems 
but it is a new atmosphere we now feel the ability to do 
something not to be just obedient employees

wonderful cajun music played with an accordion editor bill 
ferris says the newly published encyclopedia of southern culture 
provides a oneofakind singlevolume reference work

leaves the marrow of the souths contributions and history in 24 
major subjects including agriculture art and literature black 
life law politics and science 
articles focus on every aspect of southern life from defining 
good ole boys and girls to how to prepare collard greens and 
okra to explaining the impact air conditioning has had on the 
regions economic development 
roots author alex haley wrote the forward to the 
encyclopedia which was edited by ferris director of the university 
of mississippis center for the study of southern culture and 
charles wilson professor of history and southern studies at the 
university it is to be unveiled at a gala tuesday in washington 
i testify that this encyclopedia of southern culture mirrors 
the very best of what has lately come to be called the new 
south haley wrote never before has such a volume been 
produced by a team so committed to distilling and presenting our 
southern distinctiveness 
ferris said haley was asked to do the forward because we felt 
his work really was symbolic of our quest to understand the roots of 
all southerners and alex haley has become a spokesman for bridging 
white and black old and young and male and female worlds which 
this volume seeks to do 
the dinner tuesday in the us senate caucus room will have as 
its hosts the states congressional delegation and university of 
mississippi chancellor gerald turner the chairman of the national

the encyclopedia funded by more than 400000 in public and 
private grants including almost 246000 from the national 
endowment features articles by more than 800 experts on various 
aspects of the south 
although most of the entries were written by academic scholars 
with academic jargon edited out other contributors were 
solicited ferris said 
for example the man who wrote the article on mississippi river 
law is a practicing lawyer in vicksburg emmett ward whose law 
practice is focused on the river ferris said 
cheney said shes pleased with the finished product the 4995 
work printed by the university of north carolina press should be 
widely distributed by fall

hundreds of dedicated scholars contributed to this work and 
succeeded in capturing the unique richness of life in the south

a member of the ruling politburo was quoted sunday 
as making conciliatory remarks about dissent but official media 
reported more arrests of student activists and demanded the united 
states give up dissident fang lizhi 
also staterun media said sunday the government will require 
people who are granted travel visas by foreign countries to obtain 
two exit permits from the chinese government instead of one 
the move apparently aimed at keeping dissidents from fleeing 
requires citizens to obtain exit permits before and after they apply 
for visas in recent days large crowds seeking visas have formed 
outside foreign embassies 
qiao shi a standing member of the politburo told a meeting of 
nonparty officials saturday that it is very natural that people 
have different views and doubts under the current complicated 
situation 
the comments reported sunday by the official peoples daily 
newspaper were more conciliatory than past remarks by hardliners 
who now control the communist party 
since the suppression of prodemocracy demonstrations this month 
the government has been waging a nationwide campaign to compel 
greater loyalty to the party 
the newspaper quoted qiao as saying the party would continue to 
promote socialist democracy and improve the legal system 
the frontpage coverage strengthened speculation that qiao will 
replace zhao ziyang as general secretary of the 47 millionmember 
party the party central committee is expected to meet soon to 
formalize zhaos ouster 
zhao is believed to have been stripped of power after opposing 
the decision by senior leader deng xiaoping and premier li peng to 
declare martial law in beijing on may 20 
the subsequent june 34 military attack on beijing claimed up to 
3000 lives according to chinese witnesses and western intelligence 
reports the chinese said about 300 died including many soldiers 
qiao has kept a low profile during his long career as a party 
administrator but is generally considered a conservative because of 
his record as head of internal security and party discipline 
the national television news reported 10 more arrests of 
protesters including three identified as students two were said to 
be leaders of an independent student group representing universities 
from outside beijing 
the third liu huan identified as a spokesman for the student 
movement was accused of absconding with 17000 yuan about 4600 
in student funds 
more than 1300 people have been arrested for rioting and 
counterrevolutionary activities following nationwide uprisings 
sparked by the military invasion of beijing 
the beijing daily said sunday that yang tao a beijing university 
student and one of 21 student activists on a nationwide wanted list 
was arrested in western gansu province saturday 
yang was the fifth student reported to have been arrested or to 
have turned himself in since the list was published june 13 
a beijing court saturday sentenced seven men and one woman to 
death for beating soldiers and burning vehicles during the military 
takeover which met the resistance of thousands of beijing residents 
they were the first to receive the death sentence for battling 
troops during the army assault on beijing three shanghai men 
earlier were sentenced to die for setting fire to a train that ran 
through a barricade set up by protesters in shanghai killing six 
people 
the condemned have three days to appeal their sentences although 
stays of execution are rare execution in china is by a bullet to 
the back of the head 
the peoples daily also carried a letter from a legal expert 
saying the united states was violating both chinese and 
international law by sheltering dissident fang lizhi and his wife 
li shuxian 
chen weidian vice president of the china law society said it is 
normal international practice that foreign embassies dont use their 
premises to shelter criminals 
fang a astrophysicist and prominent dissident fled to the us 
embassy after the military crackdown the chinese government later 
ordered his arrest and has accused the us government of 
interfering in chinas internal affairs by protecting him

workers and drifters in their 20s or 30s account 
for most of the more than 1300 people reported arrested in the 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
but students teachers scientists factory officials and farmers 
also have been charged in the nationwide roundup according to 
reports in staterun media 
some were arrested after days in hiding or flight others were 
turned in by relatives or surrendered 
the official media provide few names and even less personal 
background about those arrested the longest profiles are given to 
those with criminal records 
they are accused of setting army trucks and tanks on fire and 
beating and stoning soldiers sometimes fatally in their efforts to 
stop the army from entering the city to put down the studentled 
protests some are accused of stealing weapons or military supplies 
most of the students are accused of spreading 
counterrevolutionary propaganda 
here are a few of the accused 
bai xinyu 61 was arrested june 11 but police are still 
investigating his case the beijing daily reported during the 
weekend it said bai had been sentenced to labor reform and prison 
many times for hooliganism and attempted murder and regarded 
the confrontation between the army and angry crowds in beijing on 
june 34 as an opportunity to get even with the government 
wu rangyuan didnt burn any army trucks herself but the beijing 
daily charged that she incited others to do so it said the 
46yearold researcher at the chinese academy of sciences 
semiconducter research institute was arrested june 9 and charged 
with agitation and rumormongering 
she incited a gang to attack a traffic center spreading the 
rumor that antiriot police were stationed inside the paper said 
she also spread the rumor that army trucks werent burned by 
rebels but were burned by the soldiers themselves when rebels had 
trouble burning a truck she advised them to torch the tires not 
the metal sides the paper said 
yang tao 19 a skinny history student at beijing university 
described in a wanted circular as having high cheekbones and wearing 
glasses he spent 12 days on the run using an assumed name before 
being arrested friday 
newspapers said yang was a leader in the united association of 
beijing universities the independent student union set up early in 
the seven weeks of student protests the government which organizes 
official student groups called it illegal 
official reports said yang took a train north to inner mongolia 
went east to shenyang returned to beijing and immediately switched 
to a westbound train and got off two days later in lanzhou a city 
where he had once studied there he bought contact lenses to change 
his appearance and traveled to a small hamlet where he checked into 
a guesthouse under the name li jie but the local party secretary 
grew suspicious and reported him to the local police who matched 
him up with the circular 
luo hongjun is among 11 people sentenced to death for their 
roles in the protests he once spent time in administrative 
detention a sentence that can be given by police without a 
trial for beating others 
at about 8 am on june 4 criminal luo rode a flatbed 
threewheeled cart to the youanmen bridge neighborhood and 
leaped on an army supply truck being blocked there from entering the 
city the peoples daily said he began to throw down wildly the 
army uniforms condensed food and other supplies inside and shouted 
crazily to the people surrounding the truck inciting them to attack 
and loot he grabbed a vegetable knife in his own hand and began to 
hack and chop 
there was no charge luo caused any deaths and the report did not 
say why his alleged deeds were ranked among the heinous crimes 
of those who allegedly killed soldiers 
luo and the others sentenced to death have appealed but there is 
no record of a death sentence being overturned on appeal in 
communist china 
death sentences can be suspended two years with the possibility 
of being commuted to life imprisonment for good behavior 
executions are usually with a bullet to the back of the head

in the shadow of a texaco chemical 
plant that topped a federal list for cancer risk a housewife 
complains of odors a school janitor worries about a skin ailment 
and a pregnant woman thinks of moving 
government and industry officials say the report listing texacos 
port neches facility as the nations worst cancer risk is flawed 
but that hasnt convinced the neighbors whose fears it awakened 
sure im worried said michelle thompson 19 who learned 
she was pregnant the same week a congressman caused a stir by 
releasing the 5yearold environmental protection agency list 
i have a son i have one on the way i dont want to live 
around here if theres going to be a threat of cancer she said 
i never even thought about the plant ive only lived here a year 
and it never even crossed my mind now she says she has talked 
to her husband about leaving 
rep henry waxman dcalif released the report june 8 listing 
texacos butadiene plant as posing a onein10 risk of cancer 
though the ranking was hypothetical it was based on the chances of 
contracting cancer for a person living within 200 meters of the 
plant over a 70year period it put texacos facility at the top of 
a list of 205 plants around the country 
government and industry officials said the data was outdated 
based on assumptions and offered no real indication of cancer risk 
and some have chided waxman for prompting unnecessary public fear 
measurements by texas agencies sharply contradict the epa report 
which the epa described as a priority guide to locating pollutants 
and an inaccurate source of actual cancer risk 
state studies also show that cancer deaths in the area around the 
plant reflect statewide trends 
certainly were not saying that its not a problem said 
marcia willhite a toxicologist in the texas air control boards 
research division we have been looking at it in the past and plan 
another monitoring trip in the near future 
on the other hand if i were living in port neches i would be 
pretty alarmed by some of the information im reading in the 
newspaper ms willhite said we just dont see them as 
realworld estimates 
pearl clark whose mother died of cancer and husband is 
undergoing treatment for the disease wonders if the epa report may 
be close to the truth 
i have no proof but i have often wondered about these 
plants said mrs clark 57 i think everybody here has 
wondered 
there used to be a lot more people around here but they got 
scared and moved out said violet smith who has lived across the 
street from the plant for 27 years we were planning to go too 
but we just couldnt afford it 
the texaco plant produces about 300000 tons per year f 
butadiene an ethylene extract used in the production of rubber 
butadiene has been linked to leukemia and lymphomas 
officials at the plant said its design rather than emissions 
affected the epa ranking 
the epa used a list provided by texaco naming every possible 
source of leakage from the world war iiera plant and then assumed 
leakage from every point in constructing what was essentially a 
worstcase model 
texaco has been testing every possible source of leakage annually 
since 1986 and found few leaks said ray fletcher manager of 
technical services at the plant 
the number of actual emissions we have reported since then have 
been well within the accepted range and the number has decreased 
every year fletcher said 
onsite tests have never reflected a hazardous level of 
emissions ms willhite said a level of 220 micrograms per cubic 
meter is used as a guideline for hazardous levels of butadiene she 
said but the highest level ever found near the texaco plant was 20 
mpm in 1984 
the plant is facing possible fines for three nuisance violations 
from odor complaints a faint chemical odor is almost always in the 
air around port neches and nearby communities where petrochemical 
distilling towers dominate the skyline texas is home to 45 percent 
of the nations petrochemical industry 
texaco employs about 850 workers in the city of 14000 
theyre all worried about jobs and they talk about plants 
shutting down said mrs smith recalling past layoffs i know a 
lot of them are concerned about losing their jobs more so than 
cancer

more research is needed to explore the 
potential health risks from the electromagnetic fields produced by 
power lines particularly the effects on the nervous system and 
possible role in promoting cancer a congressional study said sunday 
the paper published by the congressional office of technology 
assessment also said that while most public concern has focused on 
highvoltage transmission lines more attention should be paid to 
exposure to such fields from other sources including household 
wiring and appliances 
it is now clear that 60 hz cycles per second and other low 
frequency electromagnetic fields can interact with individual cells 
and organs to produce biological changes the study said the 
nature of these interactions for public health remain unclear but 
there are legitimate reasons for concern 
the background paper was prepared for ota by three researchers 
indira nair m granger morgan and h keith florig affiliated with 
the department of engineering and public policy at carnegie mellon 
university 
it noted that concerns about health effects of highpower 
transmission lines have prompted vigorous public intervention and 
litigation which has significantly impeded the ability of private 
and public utilities to construct new power transmission facilities 
without adequate research to provide answers to this problem 
the resulting contention could go on for many years and have costs 
significantly greater than the costs of the needed research the 
report said 
the paper said research on socalled power frequency 
electromagnetic fields should include a balanced mixture of 
cellularlevel studies aimed at examining biological mechanisms 
whole animal studies and human epidemiological studies 
the brain and central nervous system it said are natural 
candidates for interaction with fields because they themselves 
utilize low frequency fields for cellular communication and 
functioning the report said a carefully planned research agenda 
is needed in this area 
on the sensitive issue of whether there may be an association 
between exposure to extremely low frequency elf fields and the 
occurrence of cancer the ota papers findings included 
elf fields are not known to cause any damage to chromosomes 
which contain each cells genetic material and hence are not likely 
to be initiators of cancer 
some cellularlevel experiments indicate that the cell membrane 
is the site of the interaction between elf fields and the cell the 
membrane site responsible for this action has also been shown to be 
a receptor for chemical cancerpromoters 
epidemiological studies so far have shown a weak association 
between elf field exposure and leukemia and nervous system cancer 
the report observed that if exposure to fields does turn out to 
pose a health risk it is unlikely that highvoltage transmission 
lines will be the only sources of concern 
power frequency fields are also produced by distribution lines 
wall wiring appliances and lighting fixtures these 
nontransmission sources are much more common than transmission 
lines and could play a far greater role than transmission lines in 
any public health problem it said 
electromagnetic fields are common in nature and appear in all 
living things they hold atoms together generate lightning and make 
navigation by compass possible television and radio sets and 
microwave ovens depend on electric and magnetic fields for their 
operation 
electric fields are produced when electric charges are pumped 
onto wires by electric generators electric fields arise from the 
amount of the electric charge and magnetic fields result from the 
motion of that charge taken together they are referred to as 
electromagnetic fields 
unlike xrays or microwaves electromagnetic fields do not cause 
tissue damage or heating however lowfrequency magnetic fields can 
trigger major biochemical responses critical to the functioning of 
human cells which operate by complex electrochemical processes 
the ota paper said that while recent years have seen dramatic 
developments in scientific knowledge the past several years 
have also witnessed a marked decrease in the level of federal 
research support in this area which has only recently begun to 
reverse 
the navy which operates elf submarine communications facilities 
in wisconsin and michigan undertook about 8 million worth of 
biological effects research between 1969 and 1977 it has continued 
to sponsor ecological field studies in the vicinity of the 
transmitters at a level of about 2 million a year 
over the past decade the main civilian federal source of 
research money has been the department of energys office of energy 
storage and distribution whose research budget rose from 22 
million in fiscal 1988 to 3 million in the current fiscal year 
the states of new york and maryland have conducted research 
programs and california recently adopted a bill requiring the 
states larger utilities to fund a twoyear 2 million research 
project on elf fields 
research support from the electric power research institute 
sponsored by utility companies declined slightly in recent years 
but is now expanding and is projected to reach 6 million in fiscal 
1990

authorities have begun prosecuting builders whose 
shoddy work caused hundreds of new buildings to collapse during the 
armenian earthquake killing thousands of people who would otherwise 
have survived a newspaper said sunday 
workers used inferior materials garbage and even an empty bucket 
rather than solid concrete during construction of some buildings in 
the soviet republic the newspaper socialist industry reported 
the dec 7 quake killed an estimated 25000 people and left 
500000 homeless 
on thursday a government commission formed to probe the quality 
of construction in the devastated earthquake zone gave prosecutors 
the results of its investigation 
thousands of people could have survived the catastrophic 
earthquake in armenia if basic building standards and regulations 
were observed the commission concluded socialist industry said 
the prosecutors office has begun criminal proceedings against 
leaders of building organizations work superintendents and 
designers v nenashev deputy head of the prosecutors 
investigations office told the newspaper 
those convicted of substandard construction and building code 
violations face a maximum penalty of five years in prison 
construction in the soviet union is of notoriously poor quality 
and subject to long delays and theft of materials 
the commissions report on building practices in armenia is 
certain to have nationwide ramifications the soviet union is in the 
midst of a program to provide every family with individual housing 
by the year 2000 
most of the buildings that collapsed in northwestern armenia were 
five or ninestory apartment houses which are common in the soviet 
union 
immediately after the quake soviet officials including president 
mikhail s gorbachev said slipshod construction caused hundreds of 
relatively new apartment buildings to tumble into ruins of concrete 
bits and metal 
why did buildings from three years ago collapse while those 
built with three or five stories under former soviet premier nikita 
s khrushchev are still standing gorbachev asked during a dec 
11 visit to spitak the city hit hardest by the quake 
nenashev told socialist industry that a key junction of one house 
where dozens of people were killed was filled with an empty bucket 
some sort of bars and construction refuse the junction should have 
been a solid monolith of concrete he said 
a photograph accompanying the article showed the metal bucket 
surrounded by rubble 
nenashev also discussed slipshod work discovered in the ruins of 
one 20apartment fivestory stone house built in 1985 in spitak 
the strength of concrete in solid reinforced columns was up to three 
times below required level he said 
reporters visiting another devastated city leninakan shortly 
after the quake saw one broken slab from a collapsed building 
marked this piece of concrete is not to be used indicating it 
was below standard the soviet press has reported that much of the 
concrete was more sand than cement and branded those responsible 
scrap builders 
mortar used in masonry of inner and outer walls of the spitak 
house had no bond strength because it contained no cement nenashev 
told the newspaper rigid horizontal floor disks required for 
buildings in quakeprone areas were missing antiseismic belts were 
not reinforced and were not attached to nonsupporting walls he 
said 
some leninakan residents have said that up until 20 years ago no 
one built anything taller than two or three stories in the 
earthquakeprone area 
the government has launched a program to rebuild the devastated 
area and promised that no buildings taller than three or four 
stories will be put up there the goal is to finish reconstruction 
in two years 
but a commission of the ruling communist party politburo 
complained saturday that rates of restoration work are far from 
satisfactory it said customers and contractors are poorly 
organized and that the reconstruction effort suffers from a shortage 
of manpower technical facilities stone cement and timber

show but when he said he was going to give us the stove and the 
refrigerator well oh my it was just great 
carolyn freeman 70 told carson friday night how she and her 
sister had told city officials for 20 years that they were paying 
their neighbors water bill in addition to their own because both 
lines were connected to their meter 
freeman described how she and ms crow had skimped on water by 
taking sponge baths and eating canned beans to avoid using water to 
wash fresh vegetables 
the city finally relented in april and reimbursed them more than 
800 
when carson asked how they planned to spend the 800 mrs 
freeman said they would buy a new stove and refrigerator

the patrol boats were escorting the refugee vessel out to 
international waters when the 30ton boat suddenly burst into flames 
and sank yonhap the south korean news agency quoted naval police 
as saying 
the incident happened saturday off the southern island of cheju 
yonhap said 
the 45 men and 33 women were ordered to stay aboard the patrol 
boats yonhap said it was not clear whether the government would 
allow the boat people to settle in south korea which does not have 
diplomatic relations with vietnam 
naval authorities had ordered the vietnamese to stay out of south 
korean waters after blocking a may 7 attempt by the boat people to 
land on the western island of uldo the agency said 
hundreds of vietnamese refugees have been allowed to stay in 
south korea or have gone to other countries through south korean 
refugee camps since 1975 when the saigon government fell recently

about 4000 people attended the ceremony in victoria park it was 
the latest expression of this british colonys anger over the 
crackdown by the chinese government which is to assume control of 
hong kong in 1997 
the 33foothigh statue an image of a torchbearing woman that 
was inspired by the statue of liberty is a replica of the statue 
put up by protesters in beijings tiananmen square 
a statue was knocked down but thousands will be erected all 
over the world said szeto wah a lawmaker who presided over the 
ceremony there will be a day when the statue will be erected on 
tiananmen square in beijing 
wah laid a wreath at an empty tomb beside the plastic statue it 
was inscribed to the memory of compatriots who died or were 
injured in the patriotic prodemocracy movement and democracy 
martyrs are eternal 
the crowd sang for freedom a song hong kong activists wrote 
in support of the beijing students who led the china protests 
the statue was built by artists and by students from the academy 
for performing arts the chinese university of hong kong and the 
hong kong polytechnic 
the statue faces north to china wah said he would ask the 
government to allow a permanent place for it 
the original statue was knocked down by a tank in tiananmen

the nations mayors moved sunday toward a 
strong new policy statement advocating higher federal taxes with 
republican mayors firmly in support of the departure from 
administration policy 
the proposed resolution before the us conference of mayors at 
its annual meeting called on congress and the bush administration 
to raise revenues in a fair equitable and progressive way 
the mayors from more than 200 cities neared approval on a wide 
range of resolutions on other issues including one on the drug 
problem that calls for a ban on the possession of semiautomatic 
assault weapons it also calls for converting closed and underused 
military bases to use as prisons and drug treatment centers 
the position on gun control would go far beyond the bush 
administrations current ban on the importation of 
foreignmanufactured semiautomatics it would ban the domestic 
manufacture and sale as well as banning possession 
both the drugs and taxes resolutions were approved with no 
dissent by the conferences resolutions committee and appeared 
headed for approval by the full group at its concluding session 
wednesday 
among the other resolutions was one saying the conference 
deplores recent supreme court decisions that civil rights advocates 
say have weakened affirmative programs aimed at ending 
discrimination in employment it calls on congress to enact 
legislation protecting affirmative action programs 
the problem with these decisions is its just opening the 
floodgates for negative lawsuits trying to undue just literally 
hundreds and thousands of plans all around the country that have 
basically been working pretty well said mayor bill hudnut of 
indianapolis a republican 
although the budget statement uses the word revenues rather 
than taxes there was no disputing that the mayors were advocating a 
federal tax increase the resolution says the money raised should go 
both to reduce the federal budget deficit and to finance new urban 
aid programs 
a realistic evaluation of the deficit problem confirms that no 
effective deficit reduction approach can be implemented without a 
significant infusion of revenues into the federal treasury the 
statement said 
what were being is realistic said republican mayor bob 
isaac of colorado springs colo one of the conferences leaders 
i think its pretty moderate 
most of the debate over the call for new federal taxes came 
earlier in smaller committee meetings and before the conferences 
executive committee republican mayors outnumbered by democrats 
supported the call for higher taxes in those sessions 
bill canary the white houses intergovernmental relations 
director representing the administration here said in an interview 
that the white house made no effort to oppose the resolution even 
though president bush made a campaign pledge not to raise taxes 
our position here has largely been one of observing canary 
said 
the mayors statement goes further in calling for new taxes than 
the group has in the past executive director tom cochran said but 
it does not go as far as a similar group the league of cities went 
last winter in naming a list of taxes it thought should be raised 
including the income tax 
the conference of mayors resolution calls on congress to consider 
reducing defense spending consistent with national security a 
position the mayors have advocated previously mayors deleted a 
proposal supported by republicans that would have called for an 
examination of entitlement programs such as social security and 
federal retirement programs 
oddly it was some of the more liberal democratic mayors who 
opposed the call for higher taxes arguing that the statement might 
not be well received in congress while republicans advocated it in 
the committees 
it makes no sense from a political standpoint to go in there 
and say we need to raise taxes said mayor john o norquist of 
milwaukee 
the mayors statement laments the massive growth of the federal 
budget deficit throughout the reagan administration despite major 
cutbacks in federal spending on urban programs during those same 
yerars it said federal funds for key urban programs have been 
reduced by 82 percent

six highway signs will soon mark what a georgia 
professor believes was the 16th century route through the state by 
spanish explorer hernando de soto 
the national parks service refuses to recognize his proposed 
route but charles hudson an anthropology professor at the 
university of georgia has obtained state approval for the markers 
therell never be complete agreement among scholars about where 
the route is said hudson but i think there is a growing 
consensus that my route is close to the mark and right on it in some 
places 
some claims by local areas that de soto was there are based on a 
trail marked by the federal government in the 1930s and 1940s which 
is now believed to be wrong in some places 
de soto and 600 men explored the southeastern united states from 
may 1539 until 1543 searching for riches and fighting with indians 
de soto and half of his men died during the expedition but they 
are credited as the first europeans to explore the interior of the 
southeastern part of the country

syria has freed 185 palestinian guerrillas 
and allied sunni moslem fighters from prisons in an apparent move 
toward reconciliation with plo chairman yasser arafat arab sources 
said sunday 
the guerrillas 145 members of arafats fatah movement and 40 
members of the sunni moslem tawhid faction were taken to the 
syriancontrolled north lebanon city of tripoli on tuesday the 
sources said speaking on condition of anonymity 
neither syrian officials nor the palestine liberation 
organization had any comment on the report 
the move was seen as part of behindthescenes moves by syrian 
president hafez assad and arafat to bridge a 6yearold rift that 
has long been a key obstacle to arab unity 
the syrian action could signal a new era in relations with the 
plo although earlier reconciliation efforts have collapsed the 
release indicated a stronger syrian commitment to improving 
relations than in the past 
damascus has been increasingly isolated politically since the end 
of the iraniraq war in which it backed persian iran against arab 
iraq the war ended with a unmediated ceasefire aug 20 
syria has also been bogged down fighting the christians in 
lebanon damascus entered that countrys civil war under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate but later sided with the moslem druse militias 
the syrians have held some 2000 palestinians and members of the 
sunni fundamentalist tawhid since 1983 tawhid is based in tripoli 
and has long been allied with arafat 
the palestinians were mainly rounded up in syria after assad 
split with arafat and expelled him from his headquarters in damascus 
the syrians had alleged that arafats efforts to negotiate with 
israel betrayed the arab cause arafat said the syrians tried to 
assassinate him 
among the palestinians held was arafats representative in 
damascus mohammad amali it was not known whether he was among 
those freed 
it was not known where the released palestinians went from 
tripoli but it was likely they would move on to tunis the plo 
headquarters or possibly to plo guerrilla bases in north yemen 
syria has been under increasing pressure from the soviet union 
and moderate arabs to reconcile with arafat 
they made an effort to patch up their differences last year after 
arafats military commander khalil alwazir better known as abu 
jihad was assassinated 
but that attempt foundered because of the deeprooted hostility 
between the two sides 
the worldwide support arafat has gained from the 18monthold 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip and his diplomatic successes since launching his peace 
initiative with israel widened the gulf 
assad has long sought to depose arafat and wrest control of the 
palestinian cause to bolster his prestige in the arab world and his 
bargaining power in any negotiations with israel 
assad and arafat met on the sidelines of the arab summit in 
casablanca morocco in may both sides sought to play down the 
sessions following the failure of last years rapprochement attempt 
however informed palestinian sources said arafat insisted assad 
free the palestinians as a sign of syrias good will

romania summoned hungarys ambassador to 
protest what it said were fascist and antiromanian comments made 
during the reburial of hungarian leader imre nagy who led the 1956 
revolution against soviet rule 
the government issued its protest saturday to hungarian 
ambassador pal szuts in bucharest the romanian capital the 
romanian staterun agerpres news agency said sunday 
the protest is certain to increase friction between the two 
warsaw pact nations relations already have been seriously strained 
by alleged discrimination against romanias ethnic hungarians 
nagys reburial in budapest on friday turned into a 
manifestation clearly fascist antisocialist in nature aimed 
against the hungarian socialist workers party against 
communism and the warsaw treaty said the report 
the government of president nicolae ceausescu was apparently 
galled by the participation at the funeral ceremony of several 
romanian refugees 
nagy and four of his closest associates were solemnly reburied at 
budapests rakoskeresztur cemetery in the same plot where their 
bodies had been dumped following their executions in 1958 
the reburial was hugely symbolic for hungary which has embarked 
on a series of democratic reforms and has rehabilitated nagys image 
in the process the revolt he led was crushed by soviet troops 
while hungary has become increasingly liberal romanian remains 
among the most hardline of the east bloc nations 
thousands of romanians and ethnic hungarian citizens of romania 
have fled the country to escape alleged political persecution and 
worsening economic hardships 
agerpres said heads of diplomatic missions of certain 
countries were received at the foreign ministry in bucharest 
and informed of the romanian protest 
romanian citizens including ethnic hungarians voiced their 
profound indignation at the revisionist and anticommunist 
manifestation held during the reburial of some hungarian 
citizens the official report said 
agerpres said romanian newspapers radio and television stations 
had received many letters and phone calls from angered citizens 
there was no immediate comment from hungary and the hungarian 
ambassadors response during the meeting was not known

combative tactics adopted by republicans to 
wage capitol hills ethics wars are distasteful and demeaning to 
lawmakers a house committee chairman said sunday 
this is not a new tactic for mr atwater and its not a new 
tactic for a lot of other republicans declared house energy and 
commerce committee chairman john dingell dmich on abcs this 
week with david brinkley 
his remark came in response to a question about the resounding 
support accorded gop chairman lee atwater at a republican national 
committee meeting here last week party leaders called for a renewal 
of ethics battles such as the ones that prompted rep jim wright 
dtexas to step down as house speaker and rep tony coelho 
dcalif to resign from the house in recent days 
the democrats keep on winning and winning the congress in spite 
of this kind of campaign dingle said i find it immensely 
distasteful i find it demeaning i find it totally inconsistent 
with the way i believe that campaigns should be conducted and i 
think the american people will react adversely to it 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said on the same 
program that the most effective response to irresponsible words is 
responsible action 
if we pass a clean air act and minimum wage and child care that 
will be the most effective thing we can do to respond to people like 
mr atwater mitchell said 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash however in an appearance 
on nbcs meet the press said he believes president bush and the 
bulk of congressional republicans want bipartisan harmony more than 
ethics skirmishing 
i really dont think the warpath party is the majority of the 
republican party he said he shrugged off the support for atwater 
among state chairmen at the republican national committee members 
last week very frankly i dont think the state chairmen 
represent the rank and file of republicans or the congress 
certainly not the majority of the democratic party 
and i think that members of congress this week both republican 
and democratic ranks showed themselves to want to get back to 
constructive legislation foley said i think thats the new 
mood thats going to dominate 
he said the national committee includes some state chairmen i 
assume who are more aggressive more anxious for combat my view is 
that theyre not typical of the members of the senate or of the 
house republican ranks 
i believe presidents are highminded foley said i believe 
this one wants to achieve specific goals for the american people 
he said efforts to compromise on legislative issues can and 
will be carried out without the bitter recriminations and personal 
attacks of the past in my judgement

with no particular new policy to push vice 
president dan quayle used his recent trip central america to 
dispense hardline rhetoric and display a more experienced us 
leader than the novice who met the latin presidents four months ago 
quayle was well briefed for his threeday tour of guatemala 
honduras costa rica and el salvador where his mission was to 
underline existing us policies he focused on finding ways to 
criticize panamas ruling gen manuel antonio noriega and 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government while singing the praises 
of the democratic governments in the four countries he visited 
he also made points with a consultative approach that went over 
well in a region accustomed to a more dogmatic tradition from their 
northern neighbor 
its not just the reagan administration rambo gungho guy 
going around the world just firing machine guns its someone that 
is willing to engage in dialogue and wants to know what the rest of 
the world thinks said francisco aguilar urbina adviser to costa 
ricas president oscar arias 
quayle was attentive and inquiring he said adding its a 
different dan quayle than the brand new vice president who met 
the latin heads of state for the first time at the venezuelan 
inauguration in early february 
he may not be the foreign affairs expert that anyone would 
expect to come but he sure gives a good impression said urbina 
still quayle publicly upbraided el salvadoran rightist 
politician roberto dabuisson who is accused in many quarters of 
ties to death squad activity 
some who agreed with quayles message that dabuisson should not 
embarrass his partys new president felt nonetheless that the 
blunt admonition lacked the sophisticated tone that latins find more 
appropriate said costa rican presidential adviser guido fernandez 
fernandez former ambassador to the united states participated 
in the quayle visit during his last days as information minister 
before leaving government for a business venture 
stating that latin audiences found quayles shouting for the 
ouster of noriega a bit imperialisticsounding fernandez concluded 
quayle remains in a learning process 
subtlety however apparently was not quayles intention 
he ventured into new rhetorical territory that edged him beyond 
public pronouncements of other top us officials and roused some 
capitol hill concerns that he was trying to make inroads for those 
who would pull president bush more to the right on central america 
seizing on reports that nicaragua was geared up to supply arms to 
panama against a possible us military attack quayle raised the 
specter of a cubanicaraguapanamana axis threatening the 
hemispheres democracies 
quayle also vowed without elaborating that the united states 
will always have a moral obligation to the contra rebels of 
nicaragua 
the salvadoran militarys recent discovery of a huge cache of 
soviet bloc arms gave quayle fodder to accuse the sandinistas of 
arming the salvadoran guerillas 
arias in a news conference with quayle limited his criticism of 
the sandinistas to accusing them of enacting unfair election laws 
but arias also separated himself from quayles stridency 
emphasizing the need to include rather than isolate nicaragua in 
efforts to reach peace 
william walker us ambassador to el salvador defended quayles 
direct style in talks not only with dabuisson but with leftist 
political leaders guillermo ungo and ruben zamora quayle told them 
to urge the guerrillas to lay down their arms 
the vice president handled it beautifully he said just the 
right things he certainly wasnt inexperienced walker said he 
called the trip successful saying it wasnt a spectacular 
breakthrough it wasnt supposed to be that 
the trips initial purpose was a show of support for president 
alfredo cristianis new government in el salvador with friendship 
stops in the three other usbacked central american democracies 
but just before quayle left last week president bush told him to 
step up the focus on panama an administration official said 
there is some administration concern that the organization of 
american states might go too soft on noriega in its effort to 
mediate a transfer of power from him to an elected government said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
quayle emphasized especially with the guatemalan foreign 
minister who is a member of the oas mediating team that the united 
states wants noriega to leave his country and would look unfavorably 
on any resolution allowing him to stay even if he relinquished power 
the trip also solidified quayles personal relationships with the 
latin leaders who observed a more knowledgeable quayle than the one 
they met at the inauguration of venezuelas new president carlos 
andres perez 
i noticed the difference said fernandez in caracas he 
seemed to be astonished meeting new people now he seems more 
relaxed he pays a lot of attention he concentrates very much

calling a sudden election must at the 
time have looked like a stroke one of those cunning 
boltfromtheblue moves that occasionally enliven irish politics 
it became a selfinflicted wound that prime minister charles 
haughey acknowledges may prove fatal to his hold on power 
haughey needed to gain three seats to claim a majority instead 
when the results were completed saturday he had lost three 
the man known as the canniest irish politico of his time said he 
would stand again as the fianna fail partys candidate for prime 
minster and he said he expected to win 
reasonably certain he qualified in the next breath 
quite simply his political judgment is now in question and 
with it the wider matter of his general competence as leader 
john a murphy a professor of history at cork university wrote in 
the sunday independent 
fianna fail said james downey editor of the new nation 
magazine may now have to accept that it is just another party not 
the warriors of destiny as it claims in its name 
haughey 63 three times prime minister of ireland entered the 
legislature in 1957 when the partys founder eamon de valera was 
prime minister 
whenever i wanted to know what the irish people wanted de 
valera said in 1922 i had only to examine my own heart and it 
told me straight off what the irish people wanted 
haughey examined the opinion polls which showed him as the 
darling of 54 percent of the voters in february and concluded that 
the people wanted to give him a majority in the dail or parliament 
inflation was low unemployment had declined interest rates were 
moderate and fianna fail strategists figured the opposition had no 
heart for an election 
it was a kind of stroke and one so synonymous with politics a 
la fianna fail james morrissey wrote in the sunday independent 
but like so many strokes it simply didnt work 
when the politicians hit the doorsteps for the threeweek 
campaign they found the voters angry about cuts in the health 
service peeved about having to buy a license to fish and receptive 
to the programs of the left 
the labor party and the workers party were the big gainers in the 
election adding seven seats to a combined total of 22 plus the 
likely support of one democratic socialist and irelands first green 
party legislator 
but the balance of power lay where it always has with fianna 
fail 77 seats and fine gael 55 seats lowlevel negotiations 
about forming a government something both sides had sworn last 
week they would not do with the other began sunday 
beyond the issues haugheys reputation may have been a bar to a 
majority 
there hovers around him the aura of deals and strokes 
contributing to popular cynicism about politicians murphy wrote 
it was an old doubt 
when haughey was making his successful run for fianna fail leader 
in 1979 fine gael leader garret fitzgerald spoke of haugheys 
flawed pedigree 
his motives can be judged ultimately only by god fitzgerald 
said in the dail but we cannot ignore that these motives have 
been widely impugned most notably but by no means exclusively by 
people within his own party they and others have attributed to 
him an overweening ambition a wish to dominate even to own the 
state 
haughey acknowledged those doubts after winning the 1987 
election ive been around so long now they know i dont eat 
babies he said 
tom macintyre writing in the irish press concluded that haughey 
has succeeed in politics because he is a rogue because it 
speaks to the rogue in us 
we want the rogue in charge mcintyre concluded but we 
dont want the rogue that much in charge

supporters of former president gaafar 
nimeiri were arrested sunday for plotting to overthrow the 
government the army announced 
the armys statement did not say whether the unspecified number 
of soldiers and civilians it arrested had tried to carry out their 
plan 
the capital was calm sunday and there was no sign of military 
activity no soldiers were deployed in the city center or around 
major buildings 
the civilian government of prime minister sadek mahdi issued no 
statement 
earlier sunday 2000 people calling for a return to military 
rule demonstrated in central khartoum however there was no 
immediate indication the protest and the arrests were related 
the communique from the sudanese armed forces general command 
said further details on coup plotters would be announced later the 
statement emphasized that the army remained united and would 
continue to protect the present democratic regime which has been the 
choice of the sudanese people 
military sources identified the leader of the alleged 
conspirators as sadek abdelaziz an officer from the armys armored 
corps division the sources who demanded anonymity refused to give 
his rank 
after 16 years as president the prowestern nimeiri was 
overthrown by the military on april 26 1985 after a widespread 
civil disobedience campaign the coup occurred as nimeiri was 
returning from the united states and he was given political asylum 
in egypt as long as he refrained from political activities 
mahdi came to power one year later in parliamentary elections 
but his weak coalition government has failed to significantly 
improve sudans ailing economy or end the 6yearold civil war in 
the south 
in a rare interview with the associated press in cairo earlier 
this month nimeiri called on the sudanese people to overthrow 
mahdis government which he described as a government of 
thieves to pave the way for his return 
despite warnings from the egyptian government that he was 
violating the conditions of his asylum nimeiri said he sent tapes 
and printed speeches to sudan last month accusing mahdi of causing 
the countrys problems 
nimeiri also told a sudanese biweekly last week that he would be 
returning to sudan within a couple of weeks and that his 
supporters inside the sudanese army and the government would help 
return him to power 
sudanese complain bitterly about mahdis failure to solve their 
problems and sometimes suggest that nimeiris regime was better 
mahdi last year accused nimeiris supporters of trying to 
overthrow the goverment nimeiri acknowdleges only that he sent 
tapes to sudan urging the people to overthtrow the government last 
month and in 1985

the president of the national 
conference of catholic bishops charged that some of the nations 
largest protestant denominations have a plan for proselytizing 
hispanic catholics into their churches in a very deceptive way 
the charge was made by archbishop john l may of st louis who 
commented in a news conference saturday evening and then elaborated 
on them later in an interview during the bishops annual spring 
meeting at seton hall university 
may mentioned the southern baptist convention 
i think thats an unfair statement the rev daniel vestal 
pastor at dunwoody baptist church in atlanta and the unsuccessful 
candidate last week for the presidency of the 145 millionmember 
southern baptist conference said sunday 
i cant speak for all protestant groups but i know the southern 
baptists offer a message of hope and redemption that attracts 
people regardless of race vestal said 
jay strack president of the conference of southern baptist 
evangelists stan hastey executive director of the southern baptist 
alliance a moderate group within the demonination did not 
immediate return telephone calls left with their offices sunday 
morning seeking comment 
at their annual spring meeting held at seton hall university 
this weekend the bishops voted to emphasize evangelization in their 
celebration of the fifth centenary of european explorers 
introduction of roman catholic faith in the americas in 1992 and to 
start work on a document to give black catholics a greater role in 
the church 
minority membership of the catholic church is growing a wave of 
immigrants from spanishspeaking nations and a relatively high birth 
rate have made hispanics the fastestgrowing group of us 
catholics making up an estimated third of the 53 millionmember 
denomination in part because of immigration from the west indies 
and haiti the number of black catholics has risen from 900000 to 2 
million in the past 20 years 
however church officials say conservative protestant groups are 
increasingly wooing minority catholics 
may said fundamentalist churches have a very clearly fashioned 
plan to entice people away from the church in a very deceptive way 
he said some fundamentalist churches go so far as to feature 
catholic art and music in their churches to draw hispanics in and 
then start teaching anticatholic doctrines to keep the new converts 
from returning to catholicism 
in a report to the bishops the rev allan figueroa deck a 
theologian and specialist in hispanic studies said one national 
study has found at least 60000 hispanics leave the church each 
year and a million have left in the past 15 years 
catholic officials also admit the church has driven some minority 
members away through apathy and insensitivity 
deck said that while hispanic catholics struggle to be noticed in 
the catholic church evangelical sects are providing numerous 
spanishspeaking ministers and small churches especially 
appropriate for immigrants who need all the personal communal 
support they can get 
weve been developing leadership among these racial groups 
said vestal of the baptists its a fact that churches grow when 
they are led by people from their own culture 
the southern baptists are very effective in promoting 
leadership within ethnic or racial groups vestal said 
in a pastoral statement by the bishops committee on black 
catholics the nations 13 black prelates said there is a serious 
attrition of black catholics from the church 
sister thea bowman of canton miss a black nun said in an 
emotional appeal to the bishops that black catholics sometimes feel 
like a motherless child in the church 
the pastoral statement proposed by the black bishops drawn up in 
response to a national black catholic pastoral plan devised by 1500 
black catholics at a 1987 congress in washington calls for giving 
blacks more positions of responsibility and integrating 
africanamerican cultural symbols into liturgies and churches 
after two days of business meetings the bishops spent sunday 
largely in religious observances gathering for morning and evening 
prayers and concelebrating mass at sacred heart cathedral in newark 
the bishops were scheduled to meet in excutive session monday to 
conclude the fourday meeting

a death row inmate facing a predawn 
execution for a reno murder continued to reject available appeals 
sunday amid controversy over his 11thhour admission to other 
killings 
william paul thompson 52 said he could see guards preparing the 
death chamber only 10 feet away from his cell 
im looking at the car theyre fixing to take me home in he 
said of the death chamber theyre gassing it up now 
thompson told the associated press on saturday in the only 
interview he granted that he killed six people including the 
contract murder of a federal prosecutor in oklahoma in 1983 
in tulsa okla us attorney tony graham said he wasnt aware 
of any prosecutor in the state who had disappeared or was killed in 
1983 graham said thompsons statement sounds somewhat 
preposterous and he didnt intend to investigate the claim 
said bill price who recently stepped down as us attorney in 
oklahoma city said if a federal prosecutor had been killed in 
oklahoma i would definitely know about it that claim is 
categorically false 
thompson declined further interviews prison officials said 
no reviews by the nevada pardons board or state supreme court 
were planned following thompsons statement wednesday in washoe 
county district court insisting that he die for killing a man in 
reno 
and no 11thhour petitions were likely from the federal public 
defender or the american civil liberties union although assistant 
federal defender pat flanagan said a petition was prepared if 
thompson decided he wanted to try for a stay 
thompson said he didnt want to stop his execution by lethal 
injection because hes ready to die and might kill again if he 
remains alive 
theyre letting a guilty man die with dignity he said i 
never thought id be thanking someone for letting me die never in a 
million years 
he said he has found religion in the past several months and now 
is paying back to society the only thing i have to offer it 
when you give everything you got that should be enough my 
death is payment to everyone ive ever hurt my family the victims 
families 
thompson was sentenced to die for the 1984 killing of a transient 
in reno after that sentence he was convicted of killing two 
brothers who were camping near auburn calif 
thompson said the reno victim just got in my way while he 
was on the run from the killings of the brothers who he said he 
shot because they were drug informants 
he recounted a life of crime and alcoholism that started at age 
12 in texas and said hed spent more than half his life behind bars 
for various crimes 
he said that in 1983 he carried out three contract murders 
including the claimed slaying of a prosecutor in oklahoma for 
things theyd done against my friends i went looking for these 
people 
the other murders were in new york and in kansas he said he 
wouldnt reveal the names of the victims or the people who hired him 
thompson said he wasnt a mafia hit man but i was 
convenient and in the trade and they just asked me if i would do a 
job for them 
the last person executed in the united states was michael 
lindsay executed may 26 in alabamas electric chair the 111th 
person executed since the us supreme court revived the death 
penalty in 1976 
carroll edward cole was the last person executed by lethal 
injection in nevada in december 1985 after confessing to killing 
more than a dozen women as revenge for an abusive mother that 
followed the 1979 nevada gas chamber execution of convicted killer

irans new leader president ali khamenei 
said sunday that irans policy of hostility toward the united states 
must continue staterun tehran radio reported 
speaking on a broadcast monitored in nicosia khamenei said that 
iran had won respect for standing up to the united states that 
global bully and ruffian 
he said antiamericanism was a legacy of the late iranian leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and should be honored 
khamenei mocked the close ties between the united states and the 
late shah mohammad reza pahlavi who was toppled in khomeinis 
islamic revolution in 1979 
america used to regard the head of this country as under its 
own flag and used to treat him as its own property khamenei said 
but the powerful arm of the architect of the revolution and 
father of the islamic republic transformed this country into a 
nation which inflicted the biggest and heaviest threats against 
those same bully ruffian countries of the world he said 
this is the same country but it has turned around 180 
degrees he added 
relations between iran and the united states were severed in 
november 1979 when islamic militants seized the us embassy in 
tehran and took 52 americans hostage the united states froze 
several billion dollars in iranian assets in retaliation 
khamenei was chosen irans new leader by the 83member assembly 
of experts on june 4 the day after khomeini died

thirteenyearold lashanda daniels didnt have to 
spend any time in the library doing research for her prizewinning 
essay on the homeless for five months she slept at a city shelter 
sharing one room with her mother and four brothers 
during the months she spent there miss daniels told only her 
closest friends where she went each night her family has since 
managed to find an apartment but the memories of the shelter remain 
vivid 
first you hate yourself for being in that predicament she 
wrote in a composition that placed second in a citywide contest 
then that feeling of hate spreads towards those around you you 
find yourself being jealous of those who have a home and you feel as 
if everyone looks down on you 
living in a shelter was infinitely preferable to scrounging on 
the streets but it was a depressing and embarrassing experience 
said the timilty middle school seventhgrader 
miss daniels spent some of her free time reading books at the 
shelter but she said her grades slipped during her stay 
in her essay written shortly after she left the shelter she 
described selfpity as the enemy of the homeless 
you feel like you want to just let everything go and sometimes 
that happens if you are not a very strongwilled person it will 
happen she wrote you have to stick to your guns and grin and 
bear it sometimes to make your lifes goal a reality 
the contest what can we do about homelessness was sponsored 
by the police department and a radio station and drew more than 600 
entries other winners suggested remedies such as more government 
aid but none wrote from the personal perspective of miss daniels 
said her english teacher daisy droge 
the essay was all miss daniels work a teacher typed up the 
draft copy and made only minor editing changes said mrs droge 
miss daniels suggestions for the homeless include cityrun 
workshops on getting a job more lowincome housing and more 
shelters but the main thrust of her essay was a call for 
understanding and selfhelp 
i dont care what your situation is or what it may become 
she wrote whether it is homeless or helpless there is a way that 
you as an individual can make things happen for yourself 
before moving to boston last year the daniels family shared a 
oneroom apartment with a grandmother in detroit miss daniels said 
she says the family decided to move to boston because they have 
several relatives in the area and because her mother thought the 
city would be safer for her daughter and four boys ranging from 11 
to 17 years old 
all of the children are in school and her mother is taking 
college courses trying to get training so she can get a good job 
miss daniels said she said she hears only infrequently from her 
father who left the family some time ago 
by the time she wrote the essay her family had been out of the 
boston city shelter for about a month and she said she no longer 
felt embarrassed about her stay there 
my mother was embarrassed she didnt think i could write 
anything that good the teenager said i said well nows 
your chance to see what i can really do 
in may she learned she had placed second in the middle school 
division of the contest half of her 250 prize went to her mother 
and 70 went for summer camp the rest was split between a bank 
account and a lavish lunch with her mother and teacher 
miss daniels says shes determined to go to college and study 
for a career but she cant totally shake her memories of the 
shelter 
every time my mother gets a check i make sure she pays the 
rent so we wont get put out she said 
its not easy she said its a good thing that you have 
somewhere to go that you have a roof over your head but its not 
an easy life

adn said 
some survivors said saturday the plane had slightly lifted off 
the runway but then slammed back down and raced across a field 
smashing trees and other obstacles before catching fire 
scores of passengers were able to leap though areas where the 
fuselage was torn apart or fled down emergency escape chutes adn 
said 
east german authorities had initially grounded the countrys 
fleet of ilyushin62 airliners but adn said five of the aircraft 
were given renewed permission to fly following inspections of those 
planes

national advocates believe new yorks move to 
restrict smoking in public buildings and the workplace statewide 
will help them win over the rest of the nation 
what happens in new york is definitely going to help the 
movement across the country said angela mickel of the 
tobaccofree america project a washington dcbased organization 
funded by the american lung association the american cancer society 
and the american heart association 
with the signature of gov mario cuomo expected sometime in the 
next few days the nations second largest state will have one of 
the nations toughest laws limiting the places where people can 
smoke 
of the 41 other states with some sort of smoking restrictions 
only minnesotas law is tougher than the proposal expected to become 
law in new york california for instance restricts smoking in 
government buildings but not in private offices 
california took the piecemeal approach said mickel 
its nothing like what new yorks doing new york is in a 
different league 
only illinois virginia north carolina tennessee alabama 
louisiana wyoming and missouri have no form of statewide smoking 
restrictions 
the drive to restrict smoking has come amid scientific findings 
that nonsmokers could still contract lung and heart disease from 
breathing other peoples smoke 
recent studies indicate that as many as 5000 nonsmokers die of 
lung cancer each year because of passive smoking but a new 
study says the toll from heart disease and other forms of cancer 
may be 10 times that 
health groups said late last week that new yorks impending law 
the result of a 13year battle in the legislature will provide the 
impetus needed to get the eight states without any smoking 
restrictions to think about adding them 
that may be a tall order in such places as north carolina and 
virginia the nations top two tobacco states virginia at the 
behest of the tobacco industry earlier this year imposed a oneyear 
moratorium on new local smoking ordinances mickel said that came 
after several cities and counties passed laws to restrict smoking 
but the new york law could give courage to lawmakers in other 
states health advocates said 
it really sets a trend and it gives us ammunition said diane 
maple of the american lung association we can point to it as an 
example 
tobacco industry officials disagree and say other states wont 
pay any attention to whats happening in new york 
it sounds like wishful thinking on the part of the antismoking 
community said tobacco institute spokeswoman brennan dawson i 
think that each state is going to be fought very much on a 
casebycase basis i dont think that the new york situation is 
going to be any kind of bellwether 
the proposal before cuomo would require employers in new york to 
provide a smokefree workplace for anyone who requests it and would 
require restaurants to meet customer demand for nosmoking areas 
it would ban smoking in auditoriums elevators gymnasiums 
retail food stores classrooms mass transit taxicabs and ticketing 
and boarding areas in public transportation terminals in bowling 
alleys smoking would be prohibited in the bowling area 
smokers would be relegated to special sections of bingo halls 
hospitals theaters museums libraries shops indoor arenas 
waiting rooms banks restrooms and service counters in food 
establishments 
the new york proposal would still allow smoking in bars and hotel 
rooms at conventions and in private residences limousines and 
automobiles you could smoke in private boxes at indoor arenas at 
private parties and in tobacco shops

antinuclear activists buzzed around 
the us battleship iowa in rubber dinghies trying to keep it from 
anchoring in kiel harbor on sunday but police dragged away the 
intruders the activists said 
eight motorized rubber dinghies and a small sailing boat 
belonging to greenpeace the international environmental 
organization failed to keep the battleship from dropping anchor in 
kiel harbor greenpeace said in a statement from its hamburg office 
a scuffle ensued when west german marine police showed up 
with at least 15 ships and rubber boats greenpeace said 
west german television in an early evening newscast showed two 
motorized greenpeace dinghies just under the iowas giant anchor 
which was hovering in the air it also showed police boats pushing 
the dinghies away 
a banner hung from the greenpeace sailing boat reading no 
nukes in kiel greenpeace 
greenpeace said the iowa may be carrying nuclear weapons 
although the claim has not been confirmed by either west german or 
american officials 
the police pushed off and hauled away some of the activists 
rubber boats ending the protest greenpeace said 
the 58000ton iowa one of the worlds biggest warships later 
dropped anchor in the northern west german citys harbor 
the battleship sailed into kiel as part of the annual kiel 
week nautical show that opened saturday 
earlier greenpeace activists in denmark tried to stop the 
battleship from sailing into the baltic sea en route to kiel 
divers and people in inflatable boats stretched a floating line 
across the path of the iowa as it steamed south through denmarks 
great belt strait 
but the iowa passed right through breaking the rope said 
hans kristensen of greenpeace 
a danish navy torpedo boat accompanied the iowa through the 
strait and military helicopters hovered overhead during the protest 
kristensen said 
the iowa slowed momentarily as it approached the protesters 
line and then continued its voyage to kiel he said 
the iowa was the scene of a disaster in april when an explosion 
ripped through one of the ships gun turrets killing 47 crew 
members the vessel was on maneuvers near puerto rico at the time

nearly 650 labor union members were killed and more 
than 6500 were arrested worldwide last year in a rising tide of 
persecution a westernbased trade union group said sunday 
the death toll was nearly double that reported in 1987 the 
international confederation of free trade unions said in an annual 
survey citing antiunion actions in 79 countries 
the most brutal repression occurred in latin america 
particularly in colombia the survey said repression of unions in 
africa continues to cause concern it said 
the survey also cited harsh repression of workers trying to 
form independent unions in communist romania violations of labor 
rights in turkey and rising government interference in collective 
bargaining in denmark iceland and the netherlands 
the brusselsbased group distributed the report during the 
international labor organizations annual conference in geneva 
the survey said working people continue to be denied basic 
freedoms in all parts of the world 
in extreme cases it said activists work under the constant 
threat of assassination disappearance detention and torture 
while legal and administrative curbs on unions cause increasing 
concern 
the confederations general secretary john vanderveken called 
for stronger government action to halt the rising tide of 
persecution of trade unionists 
some 500 were believed slain in colombia in 1988 the survey 
blamed the almost daily killings and disappearances on paramilitary 
groups guerrillas and hired killers linked to drug traffickers and 
landowners 
in el salvador more than 20 union members were killed in the 
past year the report said union offices were often searched and 
police regularly broke up demonstrations it said 
brazil offered a demonstration of government indifference to 
union repression when chico mendes an internationallyknown union 
leader and environmentalist was slain dec 22 the survey said 
south africa was criticized for last septembers tough labor 
relations amendment act described as a new move against the 
indepedent black trade union movement 
respect for trade union rights has lagged behind other democratic 
reforms in some asian countries such as south korea the report said 
turkeys labor laws still violate many basic rights including 
the right to strike and collective bargaining the survey said 
moves by britains conservative government in the past year to 
dismiss the remaining trade unionists at its intelligencegathering 
center the government communications headquarters were said to be 
in flagrant violation of freedom of association 
the confederation is an umbrella for 142 national trade union 
groups in 97 countries that represent 88 million workers

a 1400yearold mosaic of the roman goddess of 
fortune was sawed out of a stone floor and stolen from an unguarded 
archaeological site in northern israel officials said sunday 
police sent detectives to israels airports and seaports to try 
and stop the thieves from leaving the country with the medallion a 
circular portrait about three feet in diameter 
gabi mazor of the israeli department of antiquities said thieves 
used a power saw and professional techniques to slice the goddess 
from the mosaic floor in the predawn hours friday 
he speculated the thieves specialized in archaelogical theft and 
may work for a private art collector 
the medallion was unearthed 18 months ago in beit shean where 
mazors archaeological team is uncovering one of the largest and 
best preserved byzantine cities in the holy land 
the tile mosaic depicts fortuna roman goddess of fortune and 
protector of cities she is crowned with the ancient city walls of 
beit shean carries a horn of plenty and is draped with a yellow 
red and blue roman cloak 
im furious mazor said we never expected to uncover such 
a beautiful mosaic floor during our digs 
the artwork may now be in the hands of a collector who is 
willing to keep it in his home and never show it around said 
mazor 
he said it was impossible to estimate fortunas value 
its worth as much as someone will pay for it he said its 
unique i have seen tikha on coins before but i know of no other 
mosaic he said using the greek name for the goddess fortuna 
giora solar conservation director of the antiquities department 
said stealing artifacts is rare in israel but common in other 
mediterranean countries where security is usually more lax 
beit shean 75 miles north of jerusalem was a large walled city 
throughout the roman and byzantine periods with 50000 residents at 
its peak huge for ancient times it was renowned for the production 
of fine linens and sat on a main trade route between damascus in 
modernday syria and cairo in egypt 
the excavation has already uncovered a roman temple a large 
theater and one of the largest roman baths discovered in israel 
mazor said the dig area is part of a larger national park that is 
open to the public in the daytime he said the site is guarded until 
midnight but is deserted from the time the guards leave until after 
dawn

libyan leader col moammar gadhafi said the chinese 
government prompted the recent prodemocracy demonstrations through 
its political and economic policies the official libyan news agency 
jana reported sunday 
he also criticized the students who led the demonstrations that 
were crushed by army assaults june 34 
jana quoted gadhafi as saying the students should have created a 
libyanstyle political system instead of setting up disorganized 
pickets and chaos 
gadhafi in an interview with japanese television said it is 
socialism which saved china from ruin and death according to the 
jana report monitored in rome 
chinas opening to the west led to tendencies of imitating the 
wealthy western society and the opening to imperialism and 
consumer markets led the people to run toward vile and unnecessary 
consumer goods he said 
jana reported gadhafi said if china had established a libyantype 
socialist system with peoples congresses the people would 
not have resorted to violence to express their demands 
gadhafi did not mention the hundreds of people killed in the army 
crackdown 
gadhafi also used the interview to make overtures to the bush 
administration 
i believe that the new american administration is wise and has 
learned from past lessons he said according to jana i believe 
president bush is a nonhostile political personality 
he also said he hoped libya would have balanced relations with 
both the soviet union and united states 
libya and the united states had relations strained to the point 
of hostilities during the administration of former president ronald 
reagan us warplanes bombed libya in may 1986 after reagan claimed 
that gadhafi sponsored international terrorism

an expensive showdog who understood 
only french commands was found sunday nearly a week after he got 
out of a cage at ohare international airport and said au revoir to 
baggage handlers 
the 3yearold belgian malinois named korsair valued as high as 
50000 was found taking a breather on a backyard deck a few miles 
from the airport police called to the scene by a homeowner who 
thought the pup was just any old stray used dog biscuits to win 
over the pup long enough to get him on a leash 
he was a little thin and has a small foot injury but 
otherwise appeared in good shape said police sgt roland lischalk 
the dog slipped from his cage on june 12 while his owner 
frenchman daniel paul changed planes at ohare while traveling from 
san francisco to lansing mich 
korsair responds only to french commands and paid not the 
slightest mind to airline employees who chased after him hollering 
in english 
where the dog has been for the past week no one knows but he 
would have had no trouble dealing with the fences surrounding the 
7000acre airport 
hes trained to jump fences said united airlines spokeswoman 
sara dornacker he can jump 8 feet 
the dog was turned over to its handler gerald a rousseau 
korsairs owner values the dog at 20000 because of his 
pedigree stud value and championship record louis auslander 
chairman of the american kennel club said the dog may be worth as 
much as 50000

whats in a name 
is the proper designation for the metropolitian area of 14 
million people at the confluence of the james river and the 
chesapeake bay the tidewater river cities greater norfolk hampton 
roads 
some wags have suggested the areas seven largest cities 
norfolk virginia beach portsmouth suffolk chesapeake newport 
news and hampton simply be dubbed the septuplex cities by the sea 
the eight smaller cities could then be known as the octaburbs 
i think hampton roads has a nice ring to it offered arthur 
l collins executive director of the southeast virginia planning 
district commission 
the folks at hampton roads chamber of commerce of course agree 
if only because they would have to change their stationery if they 
didnt the chamber is pushing the designation for the 17 localities 
clustered around the harbor which laid claim to the hampton roads 
name at least two centuries ago 
the chamber chides those who insist on continuing calling the 
area tidewater an appellation popular in the 1960s and 1970s 
the us postal service even picked up on the moniker using 
tidewater as the areas postmark starting in 1975 
after it was lobbied by the city councils and business groups 
the postal service began postmarking letters in 1983 as hampton 
roads va 
but there are still some holdouts against the antitidewater 
tide both private and public 
there is tidewater tides baseball team and the tidewater regional 
transit board for example the telephone book lists 459 businesses 
who begin their company name with tidewater only 125 use the 
officially approved hampton roads 
we wouldnt change our name for anything said steve 
rubenstein general manager of tidewater gook a virginia beach 
company that distributes gunk solvents along the east coast 
whats in a name asked barbara henley head of the regional 
transit board and a virginia beach councilwoman i dont think 
people identify with hampton roads any better than they identify 
with tidewater 
changing the aaa farm team to the hampton road tides is not an 
option according to the teams general manager i would fight to 
the death because i think its ridiculous said dave rosenfield 
who said he likes the aliteration of the teams current name

cleveland is balking at celebrating the 20th 
anniversary of the day the cuyahoga river caught fire an event 
which became an unwanted trademark and generated a boatload of jokes 
about the polluted waterway 
imageconscious cleveland officials decided against participating 
in an anniversary ceremony this week during which representatives 
from state industry and citizen groups will cruise down the river 
led by the fireboat that battled the blaze 
dale r finley president of the convention and visitors bureau 
of greater cleveland says he works hard to persuade outoftowners 
to invest their time and money in the area but he still hears 
comments about the river fire 
i just wonder how long do we have to go before we dont have to 
continually bring up that there was a brief fire on a river 20 years 
ago finley said 
i dont read stories about washington dc or from washington 
that constantly mention this was the city where lincoln was shot 
he said 
but to others the june 22 1969 fire is indeed worthy of 
commemoration even though it lasted little more than 20 minutes 
when i heard the river had caught fire my first reaction was 
just disbelief said ben s stefanski ii who as clevelands 
public utilities director in 1969 was responsible for monitoring 
city waterways 
one had never heard of a river burning 
william b sekarek a retired cleveland firefighter who worked 
for 17 years on a fireboat crew said the noon blaze wasnt that 
big a deal 
but i guess it was enough for people to try to make cleveland 
look like a jackass for a little while 
oilsoaked debris was ignited by sparks from a passing train and 
that spread as it burned an oil and gasoline slick the flaming 
section floated along igniting two wooden railroad bridges 
the blaze caused about 50000 in damage but the damage to 
clevelands image was worse as jokes and photos of the fiery river 
circulated throughout the nation 
observers such as robert p wysenski the ohio environmental 
protection agencys expert on the cuyahoga river say the 
100milelong river should no longer be seen with shame 
id say the river is still in a recovering condition but 
theres been a lot of good strides made in the last 20 years he 
said theres been a tremendous amount of money and time that has 
been spent 
the fire forced industries along the river to end decades of 
dumping pollutants into the water and it made neighboring 
communities improve wastewater treatment facilities wysenski said 
and clevelanders approved a 100 million bond issue aimed at 
reducing the rivers pollution an estimated 15 billion in public 
and private money has been poured into environmental improvements 
along the river 
yet the cuyahoga still is listed as one of 42 pollution hotspots 
identified by the international joint commission for the greak lakes 
as needing immediate attention to reduce pollution 
the cuyahoga begins near chardon about 20 miles south of lake 
erie meanders south through farmland and drops sharply west to 
akron before it flows north to lake erie

united auto workers union president owen 
bieber lashed out at union dissidents sunday saying their dispute 
with his administration insults the intelligence of union members 
bieber speaking at the opening of the weeklong uaw 
constitutional convention wasted little time in his hourlong 
speech in taking on the new directions movement the biggest 
internal challenge a union administration has faced in 40 years 
to be frank i think those who say that workers dont want 
change in the workplace who insist that the old ways were always 
the best ways are insulting the intelligence of uaw members 
bieber said amid cheers from about 2000 convention delegates 
the new directions movement led by jerry tucker of uaw region 5 
in st louis has criticized the unions administration for being 
too chummy with automakers through joint workermanagement programs 
on the shop floor bieber and his followers have responded that the 
new directions backers arent facing the reality of a changing 
workplace 
it is precisely because we werent afraid to move forward and 
raise new issues and new demands with employers that we have stayed 
ahead of the pack on a whole range of areas where we have 
reconized a need and worked to find solutions for our members and 
their families he said 
labor observers have said bieber doesnt exert the strong 
leadership style of his two immediate predecessors douglas fraser 
and leonard woodcock and that a stronger showing at this 
convention would help defuse new directions 
bieber defending the uaw leadership against new directions 
charges that it has gone soft said the 1millionmember union 
authorized strikes 817 times in the past three years and more than 
2700 members now are on strike 
so let me assure you and let me warn any employers who may 
have formed the wrong idea of where this union is heading bieber 
said where our power of persuasion fails we will use the 
persuasion of power without hesitation 
he also said the recent cooperative agreements might not fit into 
the unions future 
if the joint programs get off the track or if joint programs 
are abused were going to fix them or were going to throw them 
out he said 
in his speech bieber also called for uaw members to gear up for 
the nations 1990 midterm elections a tougher foreign trade 
policy and for corporations to pay more attention to their us 
workers a theme of a current uaw television and print campaign 
the convention concludes friday after reports from several 
committees and elections of officers in which bieber faces no 
opposition

was still at large 
ai toyoshima who arrived in this country just two months ago 
died saturday morning from a single gunshot to the chest 
she was very beautiful very nice said hideo yanagi 15 a 
friend and classmate its terrible what happened its very sad 
i cannot believe that could happen in america

field not far from where police believe she got off a local bus she 
had boarded the bus with a friend at the american language programs 
school in nearby campbell where both were students

african leaders meeting in zaire next 
week will seek an end to angolas 14year civil war by setting terms 
for talks between the marxist government and usbacked rebels 
diplomatic sources and media reports said sunday 
the meeting of nearly a quarter of the continents leaders will 
set a ceasefire timetable and establish contact groups between 
angolas marxist government and the rightwing national union for 
the total independence of angola or unita the sources said 
in a related development a rebel spokesman said unita leader 
jonas savimbi has agreed not to participate in a 10man peace 
commission and he denied reports savimbi has accepted exile 
ivory coast president felix houphouetboigny will mediate during 
the zaire meeting said the sources who did not give exact dates 
for the gathering they said the meeting will place either in the 
capital of kinshasa or northeastern gbadolite 
angolas official angop news agency said the summit will 
legitimize internationally government attempts to end the 
devastating war 
south african news reports sunday said zairean president mobutu 
sese seko a staunch ally of savimbi is principle architect of the 
talks 
alcides sakala a rebel spokesman in lisbon was quoted by tempo 
magazine as saying preliminary talks could bring a transitional 
angolan government as early as july and that savimbi has agreed 
to withdraw to new york for some time 
in washington rebel spokesman manuel mundombe said sakala was 
misquoted 
it was just a rumor that savimbi would accept exile he said 
saturday 
spokeswomen at the state department and the white house said they 
knew nothing about savimbi coming to the united states 
despite offering clemency for rebels angolas government 
repeatedly has refused to treat with savimbi 
diplomats in lisbon suggest the charismatic rebel leader could 
accept a twoyear exile in morocco the ivory coast or the united 
states before returning to stand for presidential elections after a 
period of transitional government 
previous attempts have been blocked by savimbis refusal to sit 
out the peace process despite growing pressure from south africa 
which helped arm the rebels and black african nations 
the rebels have been fighting to share power since angola gained 
independence from portugal in 1975 
the scheduled meeting in zaire follows a usbrokered accord 
under which south africa agreed to give namibia independence and 
halt aid to angolan rebels in exchange for the withdrawal of 50000 
cuban troops helping the luanda government fight savimbis 
guerrillas 
in march the rebels declared a unilateral fourmonth ceasefire 
which sakala said will be extended through july 24

scores of guerrilla officials flew back 
to their homeland sunday many after nearly 30 years in exile with 
promises to fight hard but fair during independence elections 
hage geingob elections director of the southwest african 
peoples organization who fought 23 years against south african 
occupation of africas last colony kissed the tarmac when he 
stepped off a zambia airways plane 
most of the 150 swapo dignitaries sang as they walked to the 
terminal building at sunset they included 11 members of the 
organizations executive committee and politburo 
about 8000 people had gathered to greet them but only 200 were 
left to welcome them because the plane was delayed three hours by 
technical difficulties 
the homecoming was marred by isolated incidents a bus carrying 
guerrilla supporters reportedly was shot at and a stone was thrown 
through the window one person was arrested carrying a firearm in 
the demonstration but the only casualty was a man who apparently 
waved a sign of an opposition party he was stabbed 
most exiles came from lusaka zambia on the same plane that last 
week brought the first of some 41000 refugees due to return to 
namibia under a un independence plan 
sam nujoma president of the guerrilla organization was not 
among returnees officials say they have to make sure it is safe for 
him to return 
in an emotional speech geingob told reporters he knew he was 
home when he saw police at the airport paramilitary police played a 
major role in the war and members have been integrated into the 
regular police force geingob said free and fair elections are 
impossible until the counterinsurgency policemen are discharged 
he said the return of the guerrilla leaders expected to win a 
majority in november elections symbolizes a new dawn of 
reconciliation and peace 
we promise a clean fight but a hell of a fight he said it 
is therefore our sincere hope that the era of the bullet has truly 
given way to the era of the ballot box 
geingob declined to comment on the 200 prisoners held by his 
organization as spies or dissidents he would not say why they 
denied the international committee of the red cross access to the 
prisoners held at camps in other african countries 
that is no longer our problem we have released them he said 
geingob praised those who died in the war 
it pains one to think how happy they would have been to see us 
arrive here today but i know they would not want us to mourn them 
on an occasion like this but to pledge that we shall see through to 
the end what they died for 
south africa agreed to give independence to this mineralrich 
former german colony in exchange for the withdrawal of 50000 cuban 
troops helping angolas government fight usarmed rebels

barely 25 percent of the voters cast 
ballots in sundays runoff elections in another rebuff to the 
communist party following solidaritys triumph in the first round 
the nationwide turnout was 2531 percent the lowest in postwar 
poland according to state electoral commission spokesman bogdan 
szczesniak 
it appeared the turnout would be higher than 25 percent only in 
six provinces where solidarity candidates were in the contests 
initial reports showed solidarity candidates leading in five of 
the six provinces according to local solidarity citizens 
committees they had no figures from the sixth province 
most of the parliamentary seats being contested in the runoff 
were reserved for candidates of the communist party and its allies 
the communists had hoped for a good turnout but most voters stayed 
home in areas where there was no opposition challenge 
in the june 4 voting solidarity clinched 252 of the 261 seats 
alotted the opposition in the national assembly comprised of the 
460seat sejm and a newly created 100seat senate voter turnout was 
62 percent 
sundays runoff became a lackluster contest for the sejm seats 
set aside for the communists 
but solidarity did have a chance to wrap up the remaining eight 
seats in the freely contested senate where it earlier won 92 of 100 
places 
solidarity also sought to build its power in the sejm the lower 
house in the assembly by endorsing reformoriented communist 
candidates 
solidarity secured 160 of the 161 sejm seats open to opppostion 
in the first round of voting only three communist candidates 
reformers backed by solidarity activists received the 50 percent 
of the vote needed to win 
of the 35 top government officials among the unopposed sejm 
candidates 33 did not receive 50 percent they were replaced by 66 
new candidates in the second round 
final results were not expected before monday 
 
after the enthusiasm for the historic first round it seemed many 
voters turned back to daily life in economically pressed poland 
feeling they had made their views clear 
the national election commission comprised of government and 
opposition members to ensure a trustworthy tally reported 86 
percent of the 27 million eligible voters had cast ballots by noon 
compared with 227 percent by that time on june 4 
solidarity leader lech walesa voting near his gdansk home said 
he thought no more than 50 percent of poles would vote 
the lowest previous turnout was 56 percent in june 1988 
provincial council voting but these are the first nationwide runoff 
elections 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski said as he voted in warsaw 
that putting an end to elections with a predetermined outcome was a 
risk for the communist government but was necessary to implement 
democratic reform negotiated with the opposition 
the polish elections are the freest in eastern europe in four 
decades 
so far what is important is that we are talking to each 
other jaruzelski said 
the communists best chance for a senate seat was henryk 
stoklosa the wealthy owner of a fertilizer company in western pila 
province who waged polands most expensive election campaign he was 
the only coalition candidate to outpoll a solidarity opponent in the 
first round although he did not win a majority 
jerzy majka the hardline editor of the communist partys 
trybuna ludu newspaper said the 60odd communists with solidarity 
backing were immoral in a frontpage editorial saturday 
the opposition is working toward making a split in the party 
majka said it is immoral and tasteless that some of our comrades 
are courting solidarity 
the communist coalition did borrow an election tactic from 
solidarity for this round the party stationed supporters at some 
polls in warsaw as solidarity did june 4 
a medical academy student said he was being paid 12 per shift to 
distribute leaflets for the communist coalition outside one polling 
station 
poll watchers in warsaw and krakow and in bydgoszcz slupsk and 
radom where there were senate races with solidarity candidates all 
reported turnouts ranging up to 35 percent by midafternoon 
marek jagielski an engineer said he decided it was worthwhile 
to vote because the sejm has a lot of say about political and 
social matters 
the results of parliaments work depends on who gets the seats 
so i voted for those candidates suggested by solidarity he said 
the rallies speeches and posters that anticipated the june 4 
voting were largely absent before the second round instead 
attention focused on the government changes expected to follow 
the communist party plans a central committee plenum at the end 
of the month to pick a presidential candidate who will nominate the 
next prime minister

mississippis attorney general says he may 
reopen the case of three civil rights workers slain 25 years ago 
which inspired the awardwinning movie mississippi burning 
attorney general mike moore said he is reading the 2800page 
transcript of the federal trial of 19 men on civil rights charges 
and is trying to talk to some witnesses 
the first hurdle we have to jump is whether the evidence is 
enough to successfully prosecute moore said recently second 
is it in the best interests of the people of this state 
word that the case might be reopened came on the eve of a special 
commemoration of the 1964 murders of andrew goodman a 20yearold 
white new york resident james chaney a 21yearold black meridian 
resident and henry schwerner a 24yearold white new yorker 
the three had been conducting a black voter registration drive 
when they left the site of a burned black church in neshoba county 
they were arrested on a traffic violation and taken to jail in 
philadelphia about 60 miles northeast of jackson but were released 
and disappeared june 21 1964 their bodies were found 44 days later 
buried in an earthen dam 
murder charges involving 19 whites arrested in the shooting 
deaths were later dropped in state court but the suspects went on 
trial in federal court seven were convicted of violating civil 
rights law another defendant pleaded guilty eight were acquitted 
and the cases against three others ended in mistrials 
the most time any of those convicted spent in prison was six 
years most of the 19 suspects are still alive 
a fictionalized account of the murders and other events of the 
era were portrayed in the academy awardwinning movie mississippi 
burning the movies release late last year turned nationwide 
attention on philadelphia 
the prospect that the case might be revived arose feb 15 when 
moore asked to meet with former fbi agents roy moore and jim ingram 
we reviewed the facts as we recalled them said roy moore 
the fbis former chief agent in mississippi 
he said the consensus was that if there was sufficient evidence 
there was no statute of limitations on murder murder is murder 
said roy moore who supports prosecuting the case 
ingram said the case should remain close and that he feels the 
suspects have paid their debt to society the people of 
mississippi are ready to move on it happened 25 years ago 
reopening the case is not really going to change things 
district attorney ken turner of philadelphia who has said the 
case could be reopened if the evidence existed would not comment on 
the attorney generals actions 
on wednesday residents of philadelphia miss and philadelphia 
pa will join for a series of events marking the slayings 
events include an ecumenical service at the church where goodman 
chaney and schwerner had been the night they disappeared a bus 
caravan will depart from philadelphia to washington and new york to 
retrace in reverse the civil rights workers journey to 
mississippi

former oakland raider john matuszak the 
hardhitting hardliving football player who played in two super 
bowls before becoming an actor died at age 38 of unknown causes 
officials said sunday 
matuszak was taken from his los angeles home to st joseph 
medical center in burbank on saturday night suffering apparent 
massive heart failure said hospital spokeswoman terri g digges he 
died at 939 pm 
an autopsy sunday failed to determine the cause of death and 
further tests will be conducted said coroner supervisor lilie 
shelton a preliminary police investigation found no signs of foul 
play said sgt tom toutant 
lyle alzado another former defensive lineman who played with the 
los angeles raiders after matuszak retired said it was well known 
that matuszak had a problem with drugs 
but i dont know to what extent what boundary he crossed over 
and what he decided to experiment with or how alzado told knbctv 
in los angeles 
the 6foot9 matuszak who played with the raiders from 1976 to 
1981 was an imposing sight on the field staring down opponents 
with a blackbearded scowl before shooting off the defensive line 
with great speed for his 280 pounds 
nicknamed the tooz his aggressive play and tough attitude 
embodied the oakland raiders spirit in the years they were called 
the evil empire and helped earn the team super bowl victories in 
the 1976 and 1980 seasons 
im just overwhelmed shocked al davis the raiders 
managing general partner who moved the team to los angles said 
sunday we really loved the guy he was our friend 
after sitting out the 1982 season in los angeles with an injury 
matuszak retired to pursue fulltime an acting career in which he 
had dabbled while a player 
it was a very emotional moment when he retired because the team 
meant so much to him recalled former raiders coach tom flores 
he identified with the raiders more than anybody he immediately 
became one of the guys he was offthewall by nature emotional and 
volatile but a lot of that was just for effect 
matuszak generally played the tough guy in guest spots in film 
and television with credits that included the movies north dallas 
forty caveman and ice pirates and the television shows 
mash trapper john md and the fall guy 
he starred in a shortlived 1985 prime time television series

season he was traded to the washington redskins then cut two weeks 
later matuszak joined the raiders as a free agent just before the

matuszaks offfield antics often generated as much notoriety as 
his play he made headlines when he violated team curfew by partying 
in new orleans the night before the raiders beat the philadelphia 
eagles 2710 in the 1981 super bowl the episode landed him in court 
in 1986 an alameda county superior court jury ruled in favor of 
matuszak in a 15 million lawsuit in which the retired defensive 
end was accused of beating up a male stripper and the master of 
ceremonies in a barroom brawl

soldiers who came to sri lanka to disarm rebels at least 800 indian 
troops have died they were deployed to oversee a peace accord 
signed by india and sri lanka in 1987

greeks appeared sunday to be rejecting the 
scandalplagued government of socialist premier andreas papandreou 
but denying a majority to opposition leader constantine mitsotakis 
mitsotakis a conservative favors less control of the economy 
and closer us ties than papandreou who has been in power nearly 
eight years 
the prime minister speaking from the steps of his twostory 
villa in the northern athens suburb of ekali acknowledged his 
panhellenic socialist movement pasok would finish behind 
mitsotakis new democracy party 
but he thanked his supporters for not giving an absolute 
majority to the forces of conservatism the premier refused to 
answer any questions about a possible coalition but noted that 
parties from the left would have a majority in parliament 
mitsotakis refused to concede his party would not win a majority 
what is certain is that new democracy has toppled pasok from 
the government mitsotakis told a cheering crowd outside his 
athens office 
state television said that with 55 percent of the ballots counted 
the new democracy party was getting 451 percent of the vote and 
pasok 386 percent the coalition of left and progress had 128 
percent with the remaining votes scattered among minor parties 
at stake were the 300 seats in parliament definitive results 
were not expected until later monday 
however government computer projections indicated that if the 
margins held new democracy would win 147 seats pasok 122 the 
coalition of left and progress 29 and the two remaining seats would 
be split between two small parties 
voting is mandatory and the interior ministry said 856 percent 
of greeces 789 million voters cast ballots the penalty for not 
voting ranges from a fine to suspension of a passport for one year 
greeks chose from among 25 parties and 3000 candidates but only 
pasok and the centerright new democracy party had any chance to 
lead the next government 
returns showed greece faces the possibility of its first 
coalition or minority government since the return to democracy in 
1974 or months of instability and possible new elections in the fall 
the coalition of left and progress a new alliance of the greek 
communist party and the greek left party hoped to become a power 
broker if no party won a majority 
however papandreou and mitsotakis said they would reject any 
communist support to form a new government 
papandreou and his party handily defeated mitsotakis and new 
democracy in the last national elections in 1985 and held 154 
parliament seats coming into this election 
new democracy had 111 seats followed by the communists with 
nine democratic renewal a conservative splinter group had eight 
seats the left party had one and independents held the remaining 
17 
but the charismatic premier has been stung by financial and arms 
scandals in his government the divorce from his americanborn wife 
margaret and his affair with a woman half his 70 years 
when papandreou voted sunday accompanied by fiance dimitra 
liani he called the balloting a most critical election that will 
decide the future of the land 
tomorrow will be a new and better day for greece mitsotakis 
said after he voted 
mitsotakis 71 portrayed himself as an advocate of a freemarket 
economy and stronger ties with nato the european economic community 
and other western industrialized countries including the united 
states 
he contended papandreou is responsible for the financial scandals 
shaking the government and promised to clean up greek politics and 
jail the guilty 
the largest scandal swirls around the collapse of the bank of 
crete which was owned by greek financier george koskotas who is 
accused of stealing 200 million 
koskotas who is in a massachusetts jail fighting extradition to 
greece has claimed in published interviews that papandreou and 
members of his party took much of the money to finance the election 
campaign the scandal has led to the firing or resignation of eight 
members of papandreous government but the premier denies 
wrongdoing 
papandreou described the outcry over the scandals as part of an 
attempt to undermine his government and programs 
papandreou a former american citizen and economics professor at 
us universities came to power in 1981 promising to pull out of 
nato and the eec and to close us military bases in greece 
but now he says the country has benefited from the western ties 
and he is negotiating a new base agreement with the americans 
still the premier has often been at odds with the united states 
he condemned the april 1986 us bombing of libya which the 
americans said was in retaliation for a terrorist attack his 
government has reacted angrily to us allegations that it is soft 
on terrorism 
papandreou has painted himself as a defender of the welfare state 
in greece and at the same time has argued that his economic policy 
is both sound and effective 
he contends he has been acting to shrink greeces public sector 
deficit the largest in the eec and notes he has reduced the 
inflation rate from 25 percent to 14 percent that is still the 
highest in the common market

federal investigators searched for clues 
sunday into the fiery stuntplane crash that killed astronaut s 
david griggs a space shuttle veteran who was scheduled to pilot a 
mission in november 
griggs 49 died saturday when the world war iivintage plane he 
was flying slammed into a wheat field and exploded while he 
practiced stunts for a weekend air show witnesses and investigators 
said 
it looked like he was clowning around said otis barker who 
was working in his garden about 150 yards from the crash site about 
20 miles west of memphis tenn hed go up then shut off the 
motor and fire it up again 
another witness william h wooden was working in his yard near 
the private air services hangars he was cutting up flying 
upside down and all kinds of ways every kind of way ive ever seen 
them fly those things he said 
wooden said he heard the planes engine stop running he looked 
up and saw the propellerdriven north american t6 training aircraft 
plummeting to the ground 
sandra pearson supervisor of the federal aviation administration 
flight service office in little rock said there is never any 
initial indication of what caused a crash it always takes an 
investigation to try to reconstruct what happened 
besides the faa the national transportation safety board and 
nasa had investigators at the crash site said peter kerwin of the 
faa 
griggs a mission specialist on the shuttle discovery in april 
1985 counted flying among his hobbies according to a biography 
issued by nasa an astronaut since august 1979 griggs had been in 
training to pilot shuttle flight number 33 aboard discovery in 
november nasa said 
nasa said griggs a former navy test pilot and combat veteran 
had logged more than 9500 hours of flying time and had flown more 
than 45 types of aircraft 
three other flights in july september and october are 
scheduled before the november launch nasa spokesman jeff carr said 
a replacement for griggs would have to be named within the next week 
or so adding that it should not be a problem to draw from the pool 
of available astronauts 
carr said the space agency placed no restrictions on what 
astronauts could do in their spare time including risky activities 
you cant lock these guys in their houses these guys have 
thousands of hours of flying experience they take a greater risk 
driving down the gulf freeway in houston than by flying there are 
no restrictions on piloting he said 
griggs who was rehearsing stunts for an air show later saturday 
at clarksville ark was killed on impact said state police cpl 
rick dickinson a spokesman for the arkansas state police 
griggs was to have been the lead performer at the air show said 
the shows organizer robert hudson none of us knew him but we 
were looking forward to having him 
hudson said he was told griggs was very good at flying the 
plane and was if anything overqualified and i guess thats what 
shocked us when we got the news 
we found out right before the show started and we were the 
only ones that knew hudson said we kind of kept it under our 
hat we went ahead and we had a good show 
the plane was registered to greg mcneely a friend of the 
astronaut who was to have participated in the show the faa 
spokesman said 
mcneeleys family which also owns mcneely charter service and a 
private airfield about 150 yards from the crash site remained 
unavailable for comment sunday according to a woman who answered 
the companys telephone the woman who would not give her name 
said she had been told to refer questions to nasa 
griggs who lived in the houston area is survived by his wife 
karen and two daughters alison marie 17 and carre anne 15

socialists and environmentalists scored 
big wins in european parliament elections according to vote 
projections released early monday a few hours after the last polls 
closed 
preliminary results from all 12 countries of the european 
economic community indicated the number of socialist deputies will 
increase from 166 to 192 in the 518seat body based in strasbourg 
france 
although it is still mainly a consultative body the parliament 
could play a major role in the trading blocs efforts to forge a 
single borderless market by late 1992 
voters in belgium west germany greece france luxembourg 
italy and portugal cast their ballots sunday elections took place 
thursday in the other eec nations ireland britain denmark spain 
and the netherlands 
final results involving all 7126 candidates from 178 national 
political parties were not expected to be announced until late 
monday 
each country elected its own deputies to the parliament 
news media projections preliminary eec reports and exit polls 
gave this partial indication of the composition of the new 
legislatures 
greens and other environmentalist parties are among the 
significant gainers after the socialists winning 18 more seats for 
a total 38 
communist parties were losing eight of their 48 seats but an 
alliance of socialists environmentalists and communists would 
control a majority with 270 deputies 
although many of the gains were made at the expense of 
conservatives extreme rightwing parties in france and west germany 
fared well west germanys republican party was expected to enter 
the parliament for the first time with seven seats frances 
national front was holding on to its 10 seats 
projections showed british prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservatives dropping from 45 seats to 26 while the opposition 
labor party would increase its number of deputies from 32 to 51 
the eec or common market used a staggered system of reporting 
results based on pollclosing times in the various countries 
results of the balloting in thursdays elections were withheld 
pending the elections sunday 
results were tabulated for all of britain except northern 
ireland the returns from that british province were not to be 
released until midday monday along with the outcome of the election 
in the republic of ireland 
the socialists with 166 seats were the largest political group 
in the previous parliament 
the parliament meets one week each month in strasbourg 
recent polls have shown many of the 325 million people in the eec 
countries consider the parliament to be little more than a debating 
society but reforms adopted in july 1987 give it more power 
it can veto some eec treaties with other countries amend or 
reject the annual budget fire the 17member executive commission 
and delay an opinion on proposed laws thus preventing them from 
taking effect 
the two other institutions involved in the communitys lawmaking 
process are the executive commission and council of ministers which 
are based in brussels

in 1985 ohio voters put their faith in the 
states coal industry by passing a 100 million bond issue to help 
utilities find ways to burn the highsulfur coal mined in the region 
with less air pollution 
now some utilities and miners say that faith and the investment 
in cleancoal technology could be for naught under president bushs 
cleanair proposal 
bushs proposal would require the nations 107 dirtiest power 
plants including 14 of ohios 50 coalburning power plants the 
most in any state to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 5 million 
tons by 1995 and 10 million tons or half the current level by the 
year 2000 
sulfur dioxide is a major contributor to acid rain which has 
been blamed for destroying plants and aquatic life and damaging 
buildings because prevailing winds go from west to east pollution 
in the midwest contributes to acid rain in the east and canada 
utility and state officials say new technology to burn 
highsulfur coal cleanly wont be ready by bushs deadline and that 
power plants would have to switch to expensive lowsulfur coal mined 
elsewhere 
its probably the worst proposal we could have said larry 
ward president of united mine workers district 6 which covers ohio 
and part of west virginia are we talking about just eliminating a 
problem or putting people out of work 
along with job losses utility officials expect significant rate 
increases 
we have more to lose under this proposal than any utility in 
the country said john dowd senior vice president of 
columbusbased american electric power co the nations largest 
purchaser of coal 
aep which owns nine plants in ohio is the parent company of 
eight utilities that serve 7 million customers in seven states 
dowd said bushs deadlines could mean the end of aeps two 800 
million pressurized fluidized bed combustion development projects in 
brilliant ohio and new haven wva 
pressurized fluidized bed combustion is designed to remove 90 
percent of the sulfur from burning coal by churning it with crushed 
limestone and air in a pressurized combustion chamber limestone 
chemically combines with the sulfur to form a solid that wont go up 
the smokestack 
part of those projects and several others are being funded 
through the cleancoal bond issue so far about 63 million has 
been awarded 
certainly some of those could go down the tubes said howard 
johnson who heads cleancoal technology for the states coal 
development office im sure some of them will be available for 
use in 2000 but some of the more promising technologies are just 
not far enough along and wont be ready until after the year 2005 
if utilities have to switch to lowsulfur coal mined in other 
states gov richard celeste said ohio could lose half its coal 
industry jobs based on an assumption that the plan would erase the 
market for 50 percent of ohios highsulfur coal 
ward said about 4200 union coal miners jobs were at risk in 
ohio and for each one of those theres four or five spinoff 
jobs johnson said the coal industry employs 7500 people in ohio 
but donn young conservation chairman for the central ohio sierra 
club said its necessary to meet those emissions standards as 
soon as possible 
its a fallacy to say therell be a loss of jobs look at the 
impact in the northeast and in canada the fishing industry has 
really been affected by acid rain he said its a matter of 
trading jobs someplace for someplace else 
an alternative to lowsulfur coal would be smokestack scrubbers 
which remove particulates and sulfur dioxide from a plants exhaust 
but cost millions of dollars 
dowd said the employment picture may not be as bleak as some 
union leaders contend because there could be a mix of low and 
highsulfur coal and some plants would use scrubbers to reduce 
emissions 
but we have a responsibility to our ratepayers our customers 
we have to look at the least costly method of compliance and that 
will mean a reduction in employment he said 
dowd said bushs plan would mean higher electricity rates 
were looking at doubledigit rate increases in ohio indiana 
and parts of west virginia but i cant be precise at this time 
he said 
bushs proposals call for power plants by 1995 to emit no more 
than 25 pounds of sulfur dioxide for each 1 million british thermal 
units of energy they produce and by the year 2000 no more than 12 
pounds most large ohio plants emit about 5 pounds per million btu 
and one plant emitted 78 pounds per million btu last year 
according to the ohio environmental protection agency

the share of world oil production held 
by the opec cartel tumbled sharply from 50 percent in 1971 to less 
than onethird a few years ago according to a report released 
sunday 
the study by the international energy agency underscores the fact 
that the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries no 
longer has the strong grip on the world oil market it once did 
the organization has been trying to strengthen its hold on the 
market by instilling more production discipline among its members 
sharp planned cuts in its supply to consuming nations earlier in 
the year helped drive up oil prices leading to higher gasoline 
prices for consumers 
the report which takes a look at energy trends over a 17year 
period said opec produced 254 million barrels of crude a day in 
1971 to account for about half the worlds total output 
in 1980 after two shocks that drove oil prices sharply higher 
the cartels share of the market slipped to 44 percent of total 
output opecs production was 275 million barrels a day 
its share fell further to 32 percent in 1987 or about 196 
million barrels a day total world production that year was 61 
million barrels a day 
the cartel recently agreed on a production ceiling of 195 
million barrels a day in the last half of 1989 to try to keep prices 
at their strong levels 
opec maintains a benchmark price of 18 a barrel the average 
price for a basket of seven crudes monitored by the organization was 
recently pegged at 1768 a barrel it was 1234 a barrel at the 
end of november 
futures prices for west texas intermediate the american 
benchmark crude have soared to more than 20 a barrel in trading on 
the new york mercantile exchange 
the energy agency said world oil production hit a peak of 66 
million barrels a day in 1979 
the share of output held by developing nations in 1971 was 73 
percent or 371 million barrels a day it rose to 77 percent in 
1979 and then fell to 72 percent in 1987 
world demand for oil grew from 496 million barrels a day in 1971 
to 654 million barrels in 1979 and 63 million barrels in 1987 the 
report said 
industrialized nations accounted for most of the demand taking 
up 352 million barrels a day in 1971 and 36 million barrels in 1987 
developing nations including those with centrally planned 
economies like the soviet union posted demand of 144 million 
barrels a day in 1971 rising to 27 million barrels in 1987 
although oil consumption in developing countries has increased 
every year since 1971 the rate of increase has been uneven the 
energy agency said in a statement accompanying the report a hefty 
compilation of statistical tables 
growth in consumption eased it said after oil prices soared in 
the mid and late 1970s 
demand for oil among developing nations is dominated by 
relatively few countries it said 
in 1987 the soviet union registered demand of 91 million 
barrels a day or 338 percent of the total for developing nations 
china ranked second with demand of 21 million barrels a day 
followed by mexico 15 million barrels brazil 13 million
