democrat michael dukakis on tuesday 
denounced a new republican campaign commercial ridiculing him for 
riding in an army tank and asserted that we democrats are for a 
strong defense 
the massachusetts governor toured friendly territory in the san 
francisco suburbs in a state where h found discouraging polls 
showing gop rival george bush leading in the presidential race 
dukakis responded by taking virtually every opportunity to appear 
on network television while refusing to hold a news conference or 
take questions from reporters traveling with him 
he was appearing on abcs nightline program tuesday night for 
a 90minute interview with ted koppel who was meeting him in 
denver dukakis wife and children appeared on phil donahues 
program 
aides said dukakis would be interviewed by dan rather on 
thursdays cbs evening news program in a session expected to last 14 
minutes extraordinarily long for an evening news show his running 
mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas was to be interviewed on the same 
program for eight minutes wednesday 
now theyve got a tank ad has all kinds of misstatements and 
outright falsehoods dukakis said tuesday we democrats are for 
a strong defense 
the bush campaigns tank ad uses videotape of dukakis wearing a 
helmet and riding in the turrent of an m1 tank at a defense 
contractors plant in sterling heights mich last month and 
suggests that he is weak on defense 
dukakis said the tank ad is part of the distortions the lies 
and the misrepresentations weve had in this campaign and there 
have been many 
his campaign advisers vigorously denied the bush ads contention 
that dukakis opposes virtually every new weapons system 
campaign manager susan estrich said dukakis favors the trident ii 
missile the advanced cruise missile the seawolf attack submarine 
the c17 transport aircraft and the yf22 a23a advanced 
tactical fighter 
there are lies damn lies and george bushs commercials she 
said 
press secretary dayton duncan said the ad wrongly claims that 
dukakis opposes the stealth bomber thats a lie he said he 
also said the governor was wrongly accused of opposing several 
missile systems 
on the second day of dukakis tour of northern california a new 
frontpage poll by the los angeles times showed him falling further 
behind bush in this state whose 47 electoral votes are crucial to 
the democrats chances of victory on nov 8 
the poll showed bush leading dukakis among likely voters by 53 
percent to 42 percent with only 4 percent undecided the survey of 
1376 people had a margin of error or plus or minus four percentage 
points 
some dukakis campaign staffers and advisers privately 
acknowledged the times survey was within a few points of their own 
figures 
battling the perception that california was slipping beyond his 
grasp the democratic nominee campaigned in the san francisco bay 
area one of his strongest pockets of support before large 
enthusiastic crowds 
dukakis addressed about 2500 people at diablo valley college and 
toured a day care center affiliated with the twoyear community 
college he spoke monday night at a town meeting in another suburb 
and before a raucus crowd of precinct workers crowded into a 
gymnasium near berkeley 
dukakis delivered stump speeches laced with populist appeals and 
denunciations of bush campaign tactics 
duncan said internal campaign polling showed the complaints about 
bushs campaign tactics were beginning to register among voters 
our polling shows by overwhelming margins people are blaming 
bush for the negative campaign duncan said 
in addition to personal tv appearances by the democratic 
candidates the campaign bought five minutes of air time on nbc 
starting at 955 pm edt on tuesday and repeated a fiveminute 
commercial aired saturday night accusing bush of waging a 
fearandsmear campaign 
emerging tuesday from a 20minute meeting with local black 
ministers and political figures dukakis dismissed reporters 
questions about the polls 
were just going to work hard and were going to win he 
shouted

was among the dead and identified him as douglas harris but listed 
no hometown it said other foreigners killed were kurt lenz of 
switzerland and ervert and ingeborg psiller of france but did not 
provide hometowns

that fernando bellina the pilot of flight 771 swerved the stricken 
craft in an effort to return to the runway but it crashed in a 
pasture witnesses said the twinjet plane broke in two and the rear 
section burst into flames and many of the injured suffered burns

bodies of three victims had not been identified and five peruvians 
were killed including an airline hostess 
chirinos said the four dead foreigners were among at least 19 
nonperuvians aboard he did not have the hometowns of any of the 
foreigners

panicked the pilots apparently tried to level off to land and the 
plane scraped the roofs of some adobe homes before falling near a 
small river

minute after taking off at 1045 am 
the airline said that within seconds after takeoff the pilot 
radioed the juliaca tower saying the plane was losing altitude he 
was returning and asked for emergency crews to stand by 
two months ago the pilots association of aeroperu issued a 
statment claiming the airlines planes were in bad shape because of 
shortages of spare parts 
peru is virtually out of foreign currency reserves because of its 
economic crisis and is unable to import equipment for many of its 
industries 
perus last major air accident occurred dec 9 when a twinengine 
fokker f27 crashed off the pacific coast killing 44 people 
including most of the members of the lianza lima soccer team

an attorney for a rocket expert accused 
in a 1 million scheme to smuggle american missile technology to 
egypt said tuesday that cairo officials claimed the operation had 
been approved by the us government 
marcus s topel an attorney for abdelkader helmy an 
egyptianborn us citizen who was a rocket specialist at the 
aerojet solid propulsion company near sacramento said the american 
government possesses a report from egyptian officials making that 
claim 
topel said he is attempting to obtain the document as part of his 
defense for helmy 40 who is jailed on a nobail warrant pending a 
trial expected to begin next spring 
topel said american government documents also support his 
contention that his client was recruited by egypts defense 
minister lt gen abdelhalim abughazala 
in papers filed monday in federal district court in sacramento 
topel said helmy met twice with abughazala in cairo in september 
1987 and in washington last march the papers said the general asked 
for helmys aid in buying material for an egyptian military research 
and development program 
topel identified the program as a joint effort with argentina and 
perhaps other countries to develop mediumrange missiles 
our investigation has shown these meetings did occur topel 
said in a telephone interview from san francisco we expect at an 
appropriate time in trial to provide more than sufficient evidence 
that the meetings occurred the appropriate time is not now 
helmy his wife and another american were charged last june with 
money laundering and conspiring illegally to export technology for 
sophisticated weapon systems two colonels in the egyptian army also 
were accused in the case but claimed diplomatic immunity 
us authorities claim helmy received 1 million in payments from 
egyptians for his role involving the illicit export of a substance 
called carboncarbon or carbon composite the material is a 
lowradarvisibility compound used in missile nose cones and stealth 
aircraft 
they accuse helmy of belonging to an international export ring 
illegally sending sensitive material to europe and the middle east 
egypt has said it is cooperating with the investigation but 
president hosni mubarak has said the egyptian defendants were guilty 
only of procedural errors and had committed no crimes 
federal prosecutors have declined comment on the defense 
allegations they have until nov 7 to file a formal response in 
district court a hearing is scheduled for dec 1

a mass killer confined to a psychiatric 
hospital since his 1949 rampage in which he gunned down 13 people 
can attend music and horticultural therapy sessions in a geriatric 
unit a judge has ruled 
howard unruh 67 has been hospitalized since sept 7 1949 the 
day after he opened fire on motorists and his east camden neighbors 
dashing through homes and buildings in a murderous rampage 
psychiatrists who have periodically reviewed unruhs case found 
him incompetent to stand trial 
each year courts have considered unruhs hospitalization at 
trenton psychiatric hospital in 1980 unruhs attorney sought 
dismissal of the indictment to permit unruhs transfer to a less 
restrictive facility three years later he was transferred from the 
vroom building for the criminally insane to an intensive treatment 
unit in 1986 he was granted walking privileges around the grounds 
in documents submitted monday defense attorney james klein asked 
the court to transfer unruh to a nearby geriatric unit but during 
tuesdays superior court hearing klein withdrew his request asking 
only that unruh be permitted to attend the special therapy sessions 
judge iv dimartino granted the request 
unruh attended the hearing appearing to be more alert than in 
past court visits he receives medication to keep his schizophrenia 
under control said his psychiatrist dr manolo mempin 
mempin said unruh is the oldest patient in the unit which houses 
29 people most in their 20s and 30s 
audrey holland program coordinator in the geriatric unit 
suggested that the violent nature of other patients in the intensive 
treatment unit could endanger unruh 
hes out of place she said the patients are all very 
young and aggressive 
dennis wixted first assistant prosecutor in camden county 
opposed any change in unruhs hospitalization he called the staff 
at the psychiatric hospital wellmeaning wellintentioned 
therapists who are firmly committed to the belief that no one is 
beyond help 
some demon went into unruhs head and locked his mind at a 
point where it can no longer be reached wixted said were 
faced with that reality

the genteel world of british publishing is 
awakening to the age of the conglomerate and wrestling with the 
question of whether books can be sold like bars of soap 
publishing has become a pitiless world the stuff of boardroom 
battles and heartrending drama no place for gentlemen writes 
margaret pringle in the independent newspaper 
publishing was very much a cottage industry here its now a 
business says joanna goldsworthy a publishing director at 
prestigious victor gollancz business people forget that without 
authors theyre nothing 
such comments have sparked a heated debate about the place of 
corporations especially american ones in british publishing where 
dreamy images of a gaslighted dickensian era linger 
the big guns deny they are cheapening literature and few top 
authors are complaining about the vastly fatter advances being 
offered 
you can find a dickensian publisher but no one wants to 
observes londonbased american agent ed victor its no good 
looking back and being wistful the old days are gone youre not 
going to go out and buy a remington typewriter when you can buy a 
word processor 
the trend toward conglomerates has encouraged some small quality 
imprints to take wing rather as a neighborhood supermarket will 
spawn highquality delicatessens around it 
were the good old days really all that good said ian 
chapman chairman of collins publishers one of britains most 
acquisitive houses 
conditions of employment wages and salaries were appalling 
he said at a recent publishers seminar 
since the mid70s weve had to look to our laurels and become 
much more professional were having to recognize that books should 
make a return on investment but they can still have the same 
love and care he said 
theres no shortage of books in 1987 59837 titles were 
published in britain compared to 36322 a decade before but the 
increase is in output rather than quality hobby and special 
interest books rather than in exciting new fiction 
meanwhile the gentleman publisher is becoming a thing of the 
past 
in february 1986 macmillan in britain bought the small british 
house of sidgwick and jackson for 175 million pounds about 25 
million one year later random house bought the publishing 
consortium cvbc for 175 million pounds about 31 million 
that purchase ended the independence of four noted british 
imprints chatto and windus virago bodley head and jonathan cape 
and gave random house a longsought british foothold virago 
which specializes in feminist literature bought its way out six 
months later and is now 90percent independent 
takeover fever is not exclusively american over the past four 
years britishowned octopus has purchased methuen secker and 
warburg and heinemann three london houses esteemed for their 
independence and the attention they lavished on their authors 
british publisher robert maxwell has bid unsuccessfully for 
harcourt brace jovanovich and is now trying to buy macmillan in the 
united states the two macmillans have common ancestry but are now 
separate companies 
meanwhile the prices paid for books have skyrocketed chatto and 
windus bought michael holroyds threevolume biography of george 
bernard shaw for 625000 pounds about 1 million novelist salman 
rushdie left jonathan cape for viking penguin and a twobook deal 
reported at 850000 pounds about 143 million 
penguin a pioneer of british paperbacks has also become an 
important publishing outlet in the united states 
bookshops reflect the changing status in the business sleek 
chain stores with shopping carts and glaring lights are supplanting 
those quiet musty idiosyncratic establishments of 84 charing 
cross road where one could browse and lose oneself for an entire 
day 
if literature now represents lucre some are wondering at what 
price 
authors at the moment are getting rather a raw deal said 
gollanczs goldsworthy publishing is becoming so much more of a 
business that publishers are forgetting at their peril that 
they need authors 
novelist malcolm bradbury agreed that practices had changed since 
his first novel eating people is wrong appeared in 1959 
im worried the author said in an interview these changes 
in ownership may result in remote companies whose prime interest is 
not in publishing but in publishing balance sheets 
the danger will be if we reach a point where commercial 
pressures become so intense that publishers can only afford to go 
with books that can sell in very large quantities 
octopus purchase of secker and warburg the imprint that gave 
britain george orwell thomas mann and italo calvino prompted an 
anguished open letter from literary agent giles gordon to punch 
magazine 
most of our significant literary houses are now shackled and 
restricted in the hands of managers bureaucracies corporate 
strategies gordon wrote your shareholders may be pleased we 
readers are appalled i beseech you think it possible you may 
be mistaken 
calls to octopus for comment were not returned 
anthony burgess author of a clockwork orange argued in the 
observer that the united states had set the precedent and he saw a 
dilemma for authors 
the impersonality of the whole proceeding is mitigated for the 
author by money but money strangely enough cannot easily 
compensate for the authors sense of being reduced to a commodity 
like soap or peanut butter he wrote 
bradbury said that whatever the problems the changes have 
advantages 
the greater commercialization in the system has improved 
bookselling no end he said more books are bought and newish 
writers are acquiring audiences through this distribution system at 
a far greater speed than they would have done when i started 
writing 
meanwhile bucking the prevailing trend are a few new publishing 
houses seeking to fill the void created by the takeovers 
in september 1986 nigel newton launched bloomsbury press with 2 
million pounds then about 3 million in capital saying the surge 
in conglomerates spurred him on 
newton said bloomsbury offered authors a tailormade service 
increasingly unavailable elsewhere its fiction list includes both 
acclaimed newcomers such as jeanette winterson and mary flanagan 
and such veterans as margaret atwood john irving and paul bailey 
one of its first commercial coups was the purchase of british 
rights to presumed innocent american novelist scott turows 
best seller 
but might bloomsbury itself be taken over 
no it wont said newton weve received offers but are 
committed to autonomy

the uscanada free trade agreement negotiated by 
prime minister brian mulroney dominated the debate tuesday among 
leaders of the three major parties in a critical prelude to the nov 
21 election 
mulroney said the agreement achieved by his progressive 
conservative party was central to canadas future and he described 
his rivals attacks against the pact as scare mongering 
john turner of the liberal party and ed broadbent of the 
socialist new democratic party criticized mulroney and then argued 
about who had most effectively opposed the agreement 
the threehour englishlanguage debate was broadcast nationally 
from ottawa and followed a threehour frenchlanguage debate monday 
night 
mulroney said the agreement scheduled to take effect jan 1 
will allow canada to move ahead and compete internationally to 
assure future prosperity he challenged his foes to outline an 
effective alternative 
they would tear up the free trade agreement and then what they 
offer you nothing but the poverty of protectionism he said 
turner again vowed to battle the pact 
this election is not a popularity contest the issue is the 
future of canada he said he mulroney now wants to turn us 
into a pale replica of the united states 
polls early in the campaign that began oct 1 generally placed 
the conservatives first with at least 40 percent of the vote 
usually needed for a majority government mulroney called the 
election oct 1 after serving four years of his maximum fiveyear 
term 
he won a landslide victory in 1984 and is seeking to put together 
a second consecutive majority government which has not happened in 
canada since 1953 
the new democrats pushed the liberals to third in most polls 
before the debates that would be a stunning setback for the party 
of former prime minister pierre elliott trudeau 
broadbent also strongly attacked the free trade agreement this 
deal must be stopped because it takes away our right to make 
decisions about our own country in our own way he said 
critics of the trade pact say the huge population and economic 
power of the united states would force canada to renounce social 
welfare programs and regional development plans 
what we have here is a deal that touches virtually every aspect 
of canadian life broadbent said 
turner said i hope canadians defeat this deal by defeating mr 
mulroney 
mulroney responded by saying canadians are fully capable of 
competing internationally and there was not the slightest 
justification for raising fears of loss of identity or social 
protections youve been scare mongering he said 
the us senate voted 839 in september in favor of the trade 
agreement signed in january by mulroney and president reagan 
in canada however only the elected house of commons controlled 
by the conservatives passed it liberals in the nonelected senate 
balked and kept the agreement bottled up 
a mulroney win with a parliamentary majority would let the 
worlds two largest trading partners proceed to form a north 
american free trade zone on jan 1 eliminating all tariffs over a 
10year period and dismantling barriers to investment and 
competition 
a gallup poll published tuesday by the toronto star found support 
for the agreement slippng with 42 percent of canadians opposed and 
34 percent in favor the others said they had no opinion or neither 
supported nor opposed the proposal

journalist colin webb says he is steeling himself 
for the day when someone says to him at a cocktail party oh so 
youre in fleet street are you banking or insurance 
for webb editorinchief of press association the domestic 
british news agency this ignominy may be close at hand 
as one newspaper after another flees fleet street for modern 
plants elsewhere banks and other financial institutions are moving 
in along the thoroughfare and the narrow lanes wending south to the 
river thames and north to holborn street 
the short crowded street and adjoining warren of crooked alleys 
and hidden courtyards the haunt of dickens pepys and dr johnson 
was once synonymous with the newspaper industry noisy grubby and 
exuberant 
the man must have a rare recipe for melancholy who can be dull 
in fleet street observed the victorian essayist charles lamb 
now as the capitals fulcrum moves east to the docklands in 
europes biggest urban renewal program fleet street is gradually 
being absorbed into the neighboring city londons financial 
district 
the shells of the newspaper buildings remain largely because the 
entire street has been designated a conservation area to retain its 
dickensian character behind the facades however the presses and 
newsrooms are being ripped out and replaced with trading floors and 
computers 
instead of printers and reporters rushing to meet deadlines the 
street is full of construction workers and lawyers stockbrokers and 
dealmakers 
property values and rents have soared as the conglomerates 
created by londons blossoming financial markets compete for office 
space on the old street of ink 
the first newspaper to capitalize on the property boom was the 
london evening standard its former home on shoe lane was torn down 
to make way for the head offices of accountants coopers and lybrand 
in 1984 the daily telegraph sold its 115 acre site at 135 fleet 
street complete with art deco lobby and penthouse lawn and garden 
it is being developed into the european headquarters of goldman 
sachs the american investment banking firm 
news international which publishes the sun and news of the world 
tabloids will turn its bouverie street site into an office 
development 
the financial times bracken house headquarters went to the 
japanese construction firm ohbayashiin in june 1986 for about 230 
million 
the daily express whose blackfacaded building still frowns 
imposingly over fleet street also is moving out only robert 
maxwells mirror group publishers of the daily mirror the sunday 
mirror and the sunday people has not yet announced plans to leave 
keeping maxwell company are the news agencies the associated 
press directly behind the mirror building and reuters which 
shares the press association building 
andrew saint of the historic buildings and monuments commission 
said the newspaper industry is the last major one to move out 
fleet street proper begins at temple bar an ancient boundary 
marker for the city of london and until the 18th century the spot 
where the severed heads of traitors were displayed 
named after the nearby fleet river that now runs underground it 
was one of medieval londons main eastwest routes for travel 
between the government at westminster and commerce in the city

the writer has covered the american involvement 
in the persian gulf from its inception and traveled the gulf from 
one end to the other with convoys and aboard us warships here is 
his report on what the navy has learned 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
emerging from what a senior commander 
calls a doityourself war in the persian gulf the us navy is 
absorbing and in some cases already applying lessons learned in a 
year of unrelenting tension and sudden bursts of combat 
although not a direct participant in the war between iraq and 
iran the united states sent warships to ensure freedom of shipping 
in the gulf the navy found itself committed to its biggest 
costliest mission since vietnam and by some measures since world war 
i 
between july 24 1987 when the kuwaiti supertanker bridgeton 
struck a mine while under us escort and the iraqiran ceasefire 
on aug 20 1988 navy ships and aircraft engaged in more than a 
dozen armed clashes with iranian forces and encounters with iraqi 
warplanes 
officers say the gulf experience which included the first combat 
use of many computer and weapons systems could lead to many changes 
in operating procedures shipboard equipment and even a revived 
emphasis on survivability in warship design 
it also is prompting a serious look at more subtle questions such 
as stress sailors in the gulf were living under a constant state of 
high alert and performing the technical tasks of missile warfare 
officers often had only seconds to make major decisions 
official concern about stress was given special impetus by the 
july 3 disaster in which the missile cruiser uss vincennes mistook 
an iranian jetliner for a military attack plane and shot it down 
killing all 290 aboard 
us investigators said the pressure of firsttime combat caused 
vincennes radar operators to misinterpret crucial computer data and 
recommended that stress and the human factor be studied for 
future training purposes 
although investigators said the ships aegis radarweapons 
system worked as intended the system is being modified to feed more 
precise information on aircraft threats 
the navy also has made or is planning changes in shipboard 
emergency procedures damage control and firefighting methods as a 
result of the nearsinking of the missile frigates uss stark and uss 
samuel b roberts 
thirtyseven crewmen were killed on the stark when it was hit by 
two iraqi missiles on may 17 1987 and 10 roberts crewmen were 
hurt when it was almost ripped in half by an iranian mine last april 
14 
the gulf inspired the navys first use of computer systems to 
train officers and crews for a specific combat zone the computers 
simulated gulf geography and tactical situations with tapes of 
actual radio traffic for added realism 
the united states had kept a small flotilla in the gulf since 
1949 but it quadrupled after president reagan agreed in mid1987 to 
reflag and escort kuwaiti oil tankers menaced by iran which 
considered kuwait an iraq ally 
the buildup ultimately reached more than 30 warships in the 
region spurring similar moves by five west european governments 
gen george b crist head of us central command and architect 
of the operation said the 600milelong gulf crowded with ships 
oil rigs and besieged by warring neighbors was a learning 
experience for the navy whose strategies are built on longrange 
ocean warfare 
it was a real doityourself comeasyouare operation said 
crist whose floridabased command controls us military activities 
in the middle east there were no books no doctrine 
the navy for example had not run an ocean convoy since world 
war ii and the only officers trained for the task were civilian 
reservists 
teachers accountants and merchant mariners were recalled to 
active duty as liaison officers aboard the kuwaiti tankers 
improvising for guerrilla warfare at sea crist hired 
tugboats as temporary mine sweepers and leased two huge barges as 
floating combat bases after arab states rejected us pleas to use 
their territory 
he said the barges an idea borrowed from vietnam where american 
forces patrolled from bases in enemyheld areas showed it was 
possible to range far afield without a tremendous base 
infrastructure and still project our power 
us officers say the mobile sea bases were instrumental in 
discouraging iranian shipping raids in the northern gulf for seven 
months before the ceasefire their secret nightflying army 
helicopters also caught an iranian minelayer proving that tehran 
was mining gulf sea lanes 
navy ships built to fight submarines and aircraft were 
illequipped to combat irans armed speedboats and chinesemade 
silkworm missiles considered the main threats to us convoys 
gulfbound warships soon were being fitted with new firepower 
machine guns a lasersighted army tank cannon and the radarguided 
phalanx gatling gun that hurls a storm of shells at incoming 
missiles 
even before the july 3 airbus tragedy some us officers had 
criticized the choice of the billiondollar vincennes as being too 
much ship for the gulf aides say however that crist stands by the 
decision which was aimed at countering an iranian missile threat 
some other ideas fizzled or never got started 
navy helicopter mine sweepers toiled six months in the gulfs 
grueling heat and dust without finding a mine vietnamera river 
patrol boats proved useless officials twice considered and 
abandoned the idea of calling in the us coast guard 
five dolphins trained in a topsecret navy project to guard 
against underwater sabotage were sent to the gulf but returned home 
after one died from a virus 
crist said one of his biggest problems was a command structure in 
which the navys gulf commander answered to him while some carrier 
groups in the arabian sea remained under pacific fleet jurisdiction 
to solve the command split crist created a unified joint task 
force middle east directly under his headquarters 
he said that decision could serve as a model for avoiding future 
interservice rivalries in time of crisis 
if you look at it this low intensity warfare is probably 
where were going to be for a long time and commanders have to be 
able to think joint worry about the best the services can make 
available not the parochialism crist said

summer sirens in sizzling colors and clinging short 
skirts ambled down the runway at emanuel ungaros summer 
readytowear show 
while the rest of paris is easing up on summer profiles with many 
dropped hemlines ungaro went his own way fitting draping and 
adding little bows to sexy outfits 
most of the dozens of looks in tuesdays long and somewhat 
monotonous show were variations on last years 
there were countless gorgeous but familiar nippedwaist spencer 
jackets with long points plus plenty of peplums above the 
bodyhugging skirts the newer flowing babydoll jackets in hot 
colors are easier toppers 
varied fabrics were mixed in an outfit another ungaro forte his 
new short skirt is shiny red burgundy or brown patent leather 
teamed up with flowered blouses and jackets 
ungaros flower garden sprouted all kinds of posies in every 
spring color imaginable from pink to robins egg blue to lime 
fuchsia and amethyst the decorators dream prints were heavily 
charged with big peonies and roses but the best flower jackets were 
simpler white pique sprigged with wild flowers 
ungaros pants are original instead of the favorite wide 
pantskirt he chose droopy drawers long or short fluid harem or 
bloomer pants teamed up with the showy flowered fitted tops 
evening wear with plenty of lace and lame was predictably flounced 
and elaborate looking as most of the show did a deadringer for 
couture 
guy douviers styles for guy laroche were much simpler and 
undoubtedly will be less expensive this cleancut collection 
featured short skirts smart pea jackets and long straight pants or 
shorts in red white and navy nautical lines 
careful cut and finish gave blue or grey denim skirts and shorts 
suits smooth city elegance big color prints burst out here too on 
flowered strapless bustier sheaths with puffsleeved boleros other 
feminine lines in turquoise fuchsia and yellow were paneled and 
wrapped like flower petals and with all this color douvier was 
dotty over black polka dots on the hot colors 
jeanlouis scherrer showed a huge group of navyandwhite 
nautical outfits beautifully cut with flowing trousers and neat 
variations on the pea jacket as well as lots of stripes 
scherrer showed full shorts and a striped minijersey but he 
usually preferred less leggy looks a white pique sundress with a 
long swirling skirt and little blue jacket could be a winner 
there were enough safari outfits and jungle prints here to make a 
planter pleased as punch in desert shades of sand and burnt orange 
or printed in green and violet they ranged from sexy tulipdraped 
skirts to belted but full light cotton bush jackets over ample long 
pants 
for afterhours scherrer opted for flowered draped sheaths or 
lacy inspiration in short or long evening dresses of expensive 
lingerie inspiration 
the froths of lace bubbled all over like champagne including the 
soft peach and sky blue dressy evening pyjamas and bustier dresses 
with silk chiffon blazers 
scherrer ended the show with navy lame and lurex sailor suits 
quite handsome indeed for the skipper or first mate on the night 
watch 
valentino also was big on lace but he didnt seem to know where 
to stop pairing it with chiffon prints and huge swaths of 
rhinestone embroidery on some outfits it looked demure on others 
it was rather heavyhanded 
day wear was more successful especially the suits lean short 
and sleek as only valentino knows how to make them he showed very 
pure lines in battlejacket tops or easily fitted glen plaid or 
checked jackets over white pique vests silk blouses underneath 
valentinos favorite trouser line still looked new straight and 
not too full with a cuff at the ankle other trousers included 
short full culottes lean pedal pushers topped by boxy plaid 
jackets 
erik mortensen at balmain was applauded for a collection that 
looked both simple and elegant his idea of the trapeze pants was a 
suit in awning stripes of red or green topped with a neat little 
bolero 
suits were lean dressy and short sometimes cut in diagonal 
twocolored combinations and mortensens clinging ribbed knit 
dresses in hot shades of red orange and yellow were intriguingly 
textured with panels of the ribbed knit cut so the ribbing was 
placed at several angles all over the dress

adrian lecornu leaned against the stump 
of a 400yearold spruce and surveyed the remains of the ancient 
forest on a hill near his indian village 
where trees 6 feet in diameter once towered over the mossy forest 
floor acres of stumps and rotten wood now litter the scarred earth 
they say war is hell said lecornu hydaburgs city 
administrator well logging is not a pretty sight either 
timbercutting is nothing new here a 700mile web of logging 
roads connects this haida indian village to the rest of alaskas 
prince of wales island 
but lecornu and others who depend on the regions dark forests 
and cool waters for subsistence hunting and fishing find it ironic 
that the regions most aggressive and destructive logging is being 
done by the natives themselves what is worse lecornu said is that 
it may be too late to do anything about it 
national environmental groups have been crying foul for years 
over logging in the oldgrowth spruce and hemlock forests of 
alaskas 16 millionacre tongass national forest several islands to 
the north of prince of wales 
but little is heard about native logging even though cutting on 
native land in alaskas panhandle has outstripped the tongass 
harvest in each of the last two years this year an estimated 
15000 acres of native lands will be cut compared to about 9000 
acres in the tongass 
leaders of the native corporations say the logging has boosted 
the regions economy and caused little environmental damage claims 
disputed by other natives who say the logging provides temporary 
profit and longterm harm 
commercial fishermen environmentalists and state wildlife 
biologists also voice concerns but say little can be done to control 
native logging the federal regulations that govern cutting in the 
tongass do not apply to native corporations the panhandles major 
private landowners 
clearcutting which fells all trees in an area is the norm here 
but tongass clearcuts are limited to 100 acres while cuts on native 
lands may stretch across thousands 
in addition native loggers are not required to leave buffer 
strips of trees along salmon streams or to consider the effects of 
logging on wildlife habitat they may also cut on steeper slopes 
increasing the chance for streamclogging silt and landslides said 
jack gustafson a biologist for the alaska department of fish and 
game 
weve got a new kind of logging gustafson said a lot of 
the longterm effects are not fully known we have concerns but we 
dont have the authority to change it 
the stage was set for native logging with passage of the 1971 
alaska native claims settlement act which awarded natives 44 
million acres and nearly 1 billion to be managed by 12 regional 
corporations and 200 village corporations 
logging began eight years ago as southeastern alaskas one 
regional corporation and 12 village corporations started receiving 
the 470000 acres promised them in the act 
even corporate leaders were surprised at how fast the trees fell 
when the timber export market declined sharply in 1981 some 
corporations had to log heavily to pay off startup loans when 
timber prices rose in 1986 logging intensified as corporations 
converted assets to cash perhaps the strongest incentive to keep 
cutting down trees was the 1986 tax reform act under which native 
corporations could sell their operating losses to profitable 
corporations in need of tax writeoffs 
the results of accelerated logging are plain to see 
twenty miles south of hydaburg a 30000acre island is being 
shaved of oldgrowth timber near the chichagof island village of 
hoonah hillsides look like theyve been nuked according to 
ernestine hanlon the angry villager said logging had destroyed her 
favorite spot for collecting the spruce roots she weaves into 
baskets 
the rush to cut has overwhelmed gustafson and other state 
inspectors who enforce the states forest practices act and try to 
protect salmon streams 
this summer in one of the most serious violations klukwan 
forest products inc was fined 7500 and ordered to restore a 
500foot stretch of a salmon stream it had buried under tons of 
logs branches and organic debris 
besides noting the potential damage to salmon runs by such 
careless logging practices environmentalists also say clearcuts 
and the young sameheight forests that follow threaten sitka 
blacktailed deer which depend on old trees for protection from 
deep snow 
but the environmentalists have not pressed their concerns 
concentrating instead on the tongass national forest 
you have to pick your fights said bart koehler director of 
the southeast alaska conservation council there is a better 
chance of changing things on public lands than on native lands 
thats as it should be said richard harris a vice president for 
sealaska corp the regional native corporation and southeastern 
alaskas biggest private landowner private land should not be 
subject to the same constraints as public land he said like any 
corporation sealaska has a responsibility to its shareholders to 
maximize profits he said 
not surprisingly attitudes toward logging in native villages 
depend at least partly on how much the villages have gained from 
logging 
complaints are few in the prince of wales island village of 
kasaan whose corporation sold its timber rights invested the money 
and now pays an annual 10000 dividend to each of its 119 
shareholders 
in hydaburg the rewards have been smaller and the opposition to 
logging has been greater when land was being handed out the 
villages haida corp received mostly scrub timber and is just now 
struggling out of bankruptcy court 
meanwhile sealaska and klukwan corp a village corporation 
based 300 miles to the north are heavily cutting more productive 
lands near hydaburg 
when sealaska sought to cut trees above hydaburgs reservoir the 
city council forced one delay after another worried that logging 
would silt up streams and foul its water supply sealaska had 
planned to cut up to 700 acres in the watershed it stopped in may 
1987 after cutting only 100 acres 
sealaska probably will never touch the watershed again too 
much trouble said hydaburg mayor robert sanderson 
recent efforts to regulate native logging have concentrated on 
putting more teeth in the states forest practices act this summer 
gov steve cowper appointed a panel to review the law 
but any changes will come too late to affect most native land 
several village corporations have exhausted their commercial timber 
stands and the others are expected to run out of trees within three 
years sealaska can log for eight to 10 more years 
the forest will take 100 years to grow back to commercial size 
at least 300 years to become the oldgrowth forest that 
environmentalists are now trying to protect 
how do you manage the land now asked mayor sanderson its 
already stripped all you can do now is let the trees grow back

oliver north offers a shocking and cynical 
view of democracy by arguing that his lies to congress werent 
crimes because other high officials deliberately misled lawmakers 
irancontra prosecutors say 
responding to norths motions to dismiss charges he lied about 
his covert assistance of nicaraguan rebels prosecutors said the 
former white house aides arguments are incompatible with the 
aspirations of our system of government and inconsistent with 
any but the most jaundiced view of the realities of politics and 
government 
the spirited attack on north was offered monday by independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh who consented to a defense motion to 
dismiss a charge that the former marine officer and national 
security council aide obstructed an investigation of who paid for a 
13800 security fence outside his house 
lawyers for the retired marine lieutenant colonel said any 
alleged fabrication of documents in december 1986 to conceal 
payments for the fence by arms dealer richard v secord wasnt 
obstruction of justice because the irancontra grand jury did not 
begin its work for another month 
while conceding a legal deficiency in one of 16 charges against 
north walshs office urged the court to reject a series of defense 
motions to dismiss other counts of the indictment 
prosecutors disclosed new details about norths destruction of 
key national security council documents in november 1986 as the 
irancontra affair was unraveling 
north destroyed original copies of socalled system iv 
documents at the national security council that prosecutors called 
the most sensitive records in the nscs carefully constructed 
system of document control 
there is also evidence he purposely withheld from nsc files 
original copies of documents that were the sole record of the 
events and activities described therein prosecutors said 
they also ridiculed norths defense that he was not warned that 
lying to congress in unsworn statements could result in criminal 
prosecution 
the defense had claimed that north was the first government 
official to be prosecuted for alleged falsehoods in unsworn 
statements to lawmakers 
norths lawyers recounted a history of lies to congress by top 
government officials including secretary of state john foster 
dulles false denial of cia involvement in a 1958 plot to overthrow 
indonesian president sukarno 
prosecutors said such a rebuttal reflects a shocking and 
cynical view of the relations between the peoples elected 
representatives in congress and officials of the executive branch 
norths defense in effect is an argument that lying is so 
ingrained and pervasive a practice in washington that despite 
laws clearly making it a crime for ordinary nonofficeholding 
citizens to make false statements to government agencies 
executive officers lack fair notice that there is not an implicit 
exception putting them above such laws prosecutors said in 
papers filed in us district court 
among the charges against north is that he drafted false letters 
in 1985 to the house permanent select committee on intelligence and 
a house foreign affairs subcommittee 
north also is charged with making similarly false statements 
during a 1986 briefing to members of the intelligence committee 
the three 1985 letters which were signed by thennational 
security advisor robert c mcfarlane falsely stated that north and 
other national security council officers were not involved in any 
covert efforts to raise money to arm the contras 
mcfarlane has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of 
withholding information from congress about covert contra aid by 
sending the letters and in testimony in 1986 
the congressional queries were made following news reports 
linking north to covert assistance to the contras at a time such 
aid was banned by the boland amendment 
north responded with calculated falsehood intending to derail 
further investigation and generally succeeding prosecutors said 
of charges that the former nsc aide drafted letters that falsely 
denied his involvement in covert aid and fundraising 
north could foresee that when the committees received false 
denials and explanations which he intended to offer them their 
predictable responses would be to cease further inquiries in this 
area prosecutors said 
north himself was enabled to continue his secret support of 
the contras which culminated in the illegal corruption of the iran 
initiative prosecutors said referring to charges that north 
conspired to illegally divert usiran armssale profits to the 
contras 
prosecutors dismissed norths argument that the diversion was 
not illegal on the ground that the government weapons had become 
the property of secord and his former partner albert hakim when 
they were sold to iran 
secord a codefendant along with hakim and former national 
security adviser john poindexter was a sham middleman in a 
classic fraud prosecutors said 
separate trials have been ordered for each defendant no date 
has been set for norths trial to begin

the government is preparing to buy into small 
private businesses in some third world countries as part of an 
effort to boost us exports 
the 10 million to be invested by the overseas private 
investment corporation opic was authorized in a littlenoticed 
bill signed by president reagan to extend the agencys life and 
give it some new roles 
a vital key to increasing our efforts righting the us 
trade deficit and creating new domestic job opportunities will be 
the rate at which we gain footholds in the developing countries by 
establishing a physical presence through direct investment opic 
president craig a nalen said in a statement monday 
opics main role is to insure us industry abroad against the 
risk of hostile action by other governments with the aim of 
encouraging american business to invest in the third world it is 
one of the few government agencies to operate at a profit 
the legislation will permit the corporation to take an equity 
position in smallscale projects in subsaharan africa and the 
caribbean basin nalen said 
rick hornberg in charge of opics contacts with congress said 
the investments can help fledgling businesses by buying some of 
their stock and lending money to their owners the us government 
will be allowed to buy no more than 30 percent of the stock in any 
company 
when the sponsor of a new business cant raise enough money to 
get started it may be too much of an interest burden for a new 
company to borrow it all he said 
the new law enables the us government to supply some of the 
capital as an investment with the expectation that in 10 years or 
so it can sell its shares and get out hornberg said 
the program is authorized for four years and hornberg said he 
hoped it would be renewed if successful 
there is no list of specific countries where the government will 
be permitted to invest but it will be limited to those where opic 
already operates he said that would eliminate nicaragua and south 
africa

the reagan administration is preparing for a 
new round of talks with taiwan and south korea about what it 
considers unfair efforts to bolster their trade balances by 
manipulating the value of their currencies 
the omnibus trade bill passed by congress this summer required 
the treasury department to determine if four newly industrialized 
asian countries taiwan south korea singapore and hong kong 
are artificially holding down value of their currencies relative to 
the dollar 
the report delivered to the house and senate banking committees 
on monday found that singapore and hong kong while running large 
trade surpluses impose few restrictions on trade 
taiwan and south korea however keep their currencies 
artificially low and impose tariffs and other barriers to free 
trade the report said 
the failure of the taiwan dollar and korean won to appreciate 
significantly against the us dollar keeps prices of american 
exports to those countries high and the price of us imports of 
taiwanese and south korean products low 
a senior treasury official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
noted that the united states has discussed the exchange rate issue 
with tawian and south korea before but said the trade bill 
represented a very significant change in terms of perception 
although it does not specify penalties against countries 
manipulating their currencies the bill requires the administration 
to assess the result of the negotiations in six months 
if theres a lack of progress we will have to report that 
the official said the new talks will begin as soon as we can 
effectively commence the dialogue he said 
in general the treasury department said it was pleased by the 
progress of the united states and its economic allies in 
stabilizing exchange rates since the louvre accord in february 1987 
members of congress and economists have expressed alarm at the 
14 percent rise at an annual rate in the value of the dollar from 
lows nine months ago saying it will hamper progress on whittling 
down the trade deficit 
however the report said the dollar by rising this year had 
simply rebounded from a drop it characterized as a temporary 
overreaction to the october stock market crash and that the dollar 
was still lower than before the crash 
it seems unlikely that movements in the dollar so far this 
year will significantly alter the outlook for sustained trade 
improvement it said 
the report strongly endorsed efforts by japan which had the 
largest trade surplus with the united states to stimulate its 
economy in an effort to increase import buying 
it said west germany which had the second largest trade surplus 
with the united states has also moved in the right direction but 
said its performance is less striking 
overall the official predicted the us current account which 
includes trade in merchandise and the flow of investment dollars 
across borders will shrink by 20 billion this year from a peak 
in 1987 of 154 billion 
the official said the improvement should continue next year but 
declined to say by how much many private economists maintain the 
deficit will not shrink further without an additional drop in the 
dollar 
economists worry that the united states status as the worlds 
biggest debtor nation it owed 368 billion at the end of last 
year makes it vulnerable to a sharp drops in the value of the 
dollar or skyrocketing interest rates should foreigners decided to 
pull their money out 
but the treasury said such concerns are exaggerated or 
unwarranted it said the us debt in comparison to the size of 
its economy is modest by international standards and said the 
united states remains an extremely attractive place to invest 
in another part of the report the administration said its 
policy of coordinating intervention in currency markets with other 
major industrial nations has proved more helpful than previously 
thought in stabilizing exchange rates even though the 
interventions were small relative to total currency trading 
it said the united states spent 85 billion to prop up the 
value of the dollar as it was falling in 1987 and sold 14 billion 
in dollars to curb its appreciation this year

im just thinking he said tipping back his baseball cap 
i cant just march in there and take my things out the rest of 
it the house will come down on my head 
castillo was one of tens of thousands of atlantic coastal

population of 38000 and the storm killed 21 people in the area 
some residents picked through rubble seeking prized possessions 
or building material 
the cobblestone streets were littered with piles of wood and 
rusted metal some women gathered to obtain governmentprovided 
rice beans milk and cooking oil 
the soap is already gone said argentina casco de gutierez 
as she carried provisions back to what was left of her woodenplank 
home 
the hurricane winds of more than 125 mph destroyed the wooden 
homes many that dated back to the last century when the socalled 
miskito coast belonged to great britain a few structures made of 
concrete withstood the storm 
the view from a helicopter of the city showed virtually no roof 
unscathed most were torn off completely 
the citys only hospital suffered severe damage but was open 
monday an official reynaldo aguilar said 150 bluefields 
residents suffered injuries mostly shock

wife gave birth to a daughter the day after the hurricane struck 
she doesnt have a name he said of the infant im going 
to call her joan

church a shelter where he and about 800 other people are staying

fighting the leftist government for seven years 
he said no request for us aid had been received from the 
nicaraguan government and none was expected

the mercy mission of six former marines to clear 
mines in vietnam is an exchange of good will that the vietnamese 
hope will blossom into diplomatic recognition an infusion of aid 
and the lifting of a trade embargo 
three of the americans who are going on the jan 9 mission gene 
t spanos of rosemont ill robert dalton of davidsonville md 
and frank noe of stoughton mass were at the vietnamese mission 
to the united nations on monday 
they met with ambassador trinh xuan lang head of the vietnamese 
mission and reviewed their planned nineday trip to former 
battlefields below the demilitarized zone including khe sanh where 
marines withstood a 77day siege in 1968 
their sentiments were expressed in a plaque presented to vietnam 
with the inscription in the hopes of preserving the peace we 
come to vietnam once again this time to help the preservation of 
human life 11th engineers january 1989 
the humanitarian peopletopeople visit is private and is 
being paid for by an anonymous businessman the other marines in 
the group returning to vietnam from the 11th engineer battalion 
3rd marine division are nate genna of west roxbury mass 
william johnson of manchester conn and mike wallace of 
langdon kan 
the mission to verify the vietnamese claim that they have 
removed all of the land mines the americans planted 20 years ago is 
the latest in a series of gestures between the two countries to 
improve relations vietnam one of the poorest countries in the 
world badly needs us aid it likely would receive with 
normalization of diplomatic relations 
nguyen xuan oanh a member of vietnams national assembly and a 
key economic adviser conferred with american businessmen this 
month on a rare visit to the united states 
oanh said again that vietnam will withdraw its 100000 to 
120000 troops from neighboring cambodia by the end of 1990 a 
condition washington has imposed before it will recognize the hanoi 
government 
and just last month the united states and vietnam began joint 
searches for witnesses of wartime plane crashes in efforts to find 
the remains of some of the 1757 americans missing in action and 
presumed dead the united states says it has no evidence that any 
of them are alive but it is seeking an accounting 
at a joint news conference monday lang said the mines had all 
been cleared at the cost of thousands of civilians killed 
particularly from the end of the war in 1975 until 1978 when land 
was being cleared for farming and housing 
spanos said the 11th engineers planted about 100000 mines below 
the demilitarized zone between 1966 and 1969 and left them intact 
when they pulled out he said american veterans visiting hospitals 
in vietnam had seen children who had been killed and maimed by old 
mines 
no one knows for sure said spanos basically what 
ambassador lang has said is true that a lot of areas have been 
cleared but exactly where these people are still coming up from 
being injured we want to go back review walk the terrain write 
our reports and submit our findings to both governments 
they will be working with reconstructed battlefield maps and 
have asked the vietnamese for a team of their counterparts to 
accompany them 
the ambassador and spanos agreed that the most important part of 
the mission is a better understanding between the countries 
they are welcome said lang they return without any 
animosity from the beginning of this year till now from 60 to 80 
american teams have visited vietnam journalists congressmen 
senators scholars and tourists these visits will contribute to 
better understanding 
spanos said letters of support his team has received from 
americans across the country veterans and nonveterans has been 
phenomenal

republican sen dave durenberger 
challenged democratic opponent hubert h humphrey iii during a 
debate monday night to stop all negative campaign advertising and 
humphrey refused 
durenberger in his opening statement during the hourlong 
televised debate at carleton college here told humphrey that 
minnesotans dont like nasty ads and are turning off to the 
candidates because of them 
tonight i am taking all my commercials off the air that have 
any reference to you and im asking you to do the same thing 
durenberger said 
humphrey who has trailed durenberger by more than 10 percentage 
points in all recent independent polls said he wont stop running 
advertisements that focus on the 10year veteran senators record 
its important for the people of minnesota to know the 
record humphrey the state attorney general responded during 
the forum sponsored by the league of women voters of minnesota 
the people of minnesota youre going to rehire someone or 
youre going to hire someone new humphrey said 
durenberger said after the debate that he would respond to 
humphreys commercials with paid air time if he has to but will no 
longer run ads such as two recent ones that portrayed humphrey as 
being soft on crime 
humphrey told reporters campaigns are on the record and i 
wish this would be a nicer campaign but frankly his records not 
very good for minnesota 
humphrey focused his attacks on a senate ethics committee 
investigation into comments durenberger made to supporters in 1987 
that the committee determined had the appearance of leaking 
sensitive national security information the committee took no 
action but humphrey said it rebuked durenberger

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen is bringing his attack on republican campaign ads 
from factories to churches to farmers in hopes of winning a 
backlash vote in key states 
the texas senator travels today to the dakotas and to montana 
its the first time since a single stop in minot nd in july 
that the democratic ticket has made an appearance in that region 
the trip will include a visit to white sd where the bentsen 
family first came to the united states from denmark besides 
showing democratic interest in those states normally a gop 
stronghold bentsen will keep up his strident attacks on the 
republican tactics 
those efforts have taken on nearly a missionary zeal as the 
democrats struggle to come from behind in the final two weeks of 
the campaign 
theyre bearing false witness against michael dukakis 
bentsen told a rally at the greater paradise baptist church in 
little rock ark on monday night and were going to set that 
record straight 
the truth is catching up and the power of the truth will 
prevail said bentsen who joined the church in singing the 
battle hymn of the republic 
bentsen launched his final 16day campaign push in the 
republican city of grand rapids mich on monday he told 
reporters there the republican campaign had racial overtones 
because of its focus on the case of convicted murderer willie 
horton jr who raped a maryland woman last year after horton had 
escaped from a massachusetts prison furlough 
they are obviously dealing with a black man who in that 
instance had raped a white woman and that certainly came through 
in the ad said bentsen asked what came through he replied 
racism 
from the michigan businessmen bentsen flew to cape girardeau 
mo where he told clothing workers that the republicans were 
trying to distract them from issues where the democrats had the 
more attractive policies issues like trade the minimum wage and 
health insurance 
in the evening church rally in little rock bentsen challenged 
bush to drop these false ads and move on to more substantial 
issues and he addressed the potential democratic problem of voter 
apathy among blacks 
dont let anyone tell you your vote doesnt count he said 
north dakota south dakota and montana havent voted for a 
democratic presidential candidate since lyndon johnson in 1964 but 
the party believes there is great dissatisfaction there this year 
with the reagan administrations farm policies gop nominee george 
bush and his choice of dan quayle as a running mate said mike 
mccurry bentsens press secretary 
although the three states have only 10 electoral votes between 
them the democrats feel they can make an inroad into the socalled 
electoral lock the republican ticket appears to have on such 
states 
were poaching on what is presumed to be republican 
territory he said

a sixstory building in manhattans garment 
district collapsed monday killing one man and injuring at least 10 
people including a woman who was trapped for more than eight hours 
in the rubble 
the collapse caused a major disruption of rail and subway 
service and street traffic just before rush hour 
about eight hours later a body was pulled from the rubble and 
tentatively identified as the buildings owner frank desantos who 
had been last seen on the roof police chief robert johnson said 
johnson identified the injured woman pulled from the rubble as 
robin fischer who was conscious and talking when rescued and was 
taken to bellevue hospital she was in critical but stable 
condition in the emergency room early tuesday said nick marletta 
the hospital administrator on duty 
at midnight officials believed that all people had been 
accounted for including two earlier thought missing said homer 
bishop chief of operations for the fire department rescuers 
continued clearing the rubble with machines 
nine people suffered what were described as minor injuries when 
the buildings west wall and the interior structure collapsed fire 
commissioner joseph bruno said 
six of the injured were taken to bellevue hospital and three to 
st vincents all were reported to be in stable condition 
service on most west side subway lines the long island rail 
road and the port authoritys transhudson lines was halted for 
more than an hour in response to fire department concerns about 
vibrations and noise 
jeff burgos who watched the collapse from his store across the 
street said it made a sound like a swoosh i watched the 
top floors crumble as they fell men were actually coming out of 
the side of the walls climbing down the debris it looked like 
they didnt have a choice 
the cause of the collapse was not immediately known but fire 
department spokesman efrain parrilla said a trench had been dug 
along one wall of the building where it adjoined a parking lot he 
said the wall had been propped up with 2by4 boards 
city buildings commissioner charles m smith said there was some 
sort of work being done on the building monday but he didnt know 
the nature of it he said no permits had been issued however and 
no plans had been filed for work at the building 
the building on west 31st street housed a handbag 
manufacturing company and other fashionrelated businesses 
parrilla said 13 people were believed to have been in the building 
when it collapsed about 3 pm 
tax records show the owner to be a manhattan company named 63 
associates which is listed in the telephone book under a different 
address but its telephone service was disconnected 
service was temporarily halted on all subway lines running near 
the building which is between broadway and fifth avenue to reduce 
underground vibrations that could cause further collapse and noise 
that could hamper searchers 
in addition streets around the site were closed clogging 
traffic at the start of the evening rush 
a little more than an hour after trains were stopped transit 
agencies were told they could begin resuming service as long as 
trains did not exceed 10 mph 
the transit authority estimated the disruption was affecting 
125000 people per hour its a major major disruption said 
spokesman bob previdi its going to be a very long rush hour 
the collapse apparently occurred when the wall of the building 
fell away and the interior floors tumbled to the ground what 
remained was a partial shell of the building leading authorities 
to worry that the remaining walls might collapse 
a crane was brought in just before 8 pm to pull down the 
unstable brick facade of the building so rescue workers could 
safely continue to search for the missing people 
its an immediate danger and a constant threat to rescue 
workers said smith only air and memory is holding the front 
of the building up he said it would take from 24 to 48 hours to 
finish going through the rubble

soviet citizens may see some westernstyle 
campaigning for the first time next spring under a draft law that 
would permit competing candidates television time and a campaign 
staff 
the law says candidates for the 2250 seats in the new congress 
of peoples deputies will be given time off from work to campaign 
free public transportation within their district and access to the 
staterun media 
they also may ask 10 friends to help them campaign 
but it seems competing political parties are still out of bounds 
and unaffiliated candidates will be restricted in what they can 
advocate since the constitution defines the soviet union as a 
socialist nation led by the communist party 
the program of the candidate must not contradict the 
constitution or soviet law says the draft election law published 
in weekend newspapers 
the election proposal is part of an overhaul of the government 
proposed by president mikhail s gorbachev at the party conference 
in june the lengthy draft laws are to be debated in the media 
before the current supreme soviet legislature considers them in 
november 
traditionally soviet elections have had only one candidate for 
each position so campaigning was limited to a biography and a few 
nights to meet the candidate election officials obtained 99 
percent turnouts by persuading busy citizens to have a relative 
vote on their behalf 
fledgling opposition groups like the democratic union may be 
restricted by a requirement that candidates for territorial 
districts be nominated by workers groups of at least 500 people 
but the draft law offers a chance to such large groups as 
nationalistic organizations in latvia lithuania and estonia that 
have won official approval by advocating not just cultural freedom 
but also economic reforms akin to those of gorbachev 
among the groups the peoples front of estonia and the 
lithuanian restructuring group have said they plan to put forward 
candidates 
the draft law also gives candidates complete immunity from 
arrest and prosecution without approval of the central election 
commission a provision that a legal expert writing in the latest 
edition of ogonyok magazine said is necessary to ensure deputies 
against unjust persecution 
imagine an unprotected deputy controls the prosecutors 
office exposes illegalities tries to fight the mafia and 
courageously criticizes the police and prosecutors at a session of 
the council said an yakovlev a professor of law at the 
academy of sciences 
this cannot be a reality because tomorrow he will be arrested 
on trumpedup charges and he will have nobody to protect him 
in the same article however yakovlev said constitutional and 
election reforms will leave the deputies powerless as long as 
bureaucrats control the budgets 
the draft law calls for creation of a new congress of peoples 
deputies that will meet once a year and elect an unstated number of 
their members to the supreme soviet the countrys parliament the 
congress also will elect the president to a fiveyear term 
the congress will consist of three groups of 750 deputies each 
the first two groups popularly elected will represent territorial 
districts divided by population and by ethnic group the third 
group will be elected by the communist party trade unions 
cooperatives and other organizations

frozen corpses of two seamen who died during 
a doomed arctic expedition in 1848 contain bacteria that show 
unexpected resistance to antibiotics developed more than 120 years 
later scientists say 
because there is evidence that lead poisoning killed the men 
the researchers speculate that heavy metal pollutants not just 
overuse of antibiotics may play a role in creating disease germs 
that survive drugs 
the proliferation of antibioticresistant bacteria has become a 
major problem especially in third world nations where the drugs 
are used indiscriminately killing vulnerable bacteria and allowing 
resistant bacteria to reproduce 
for example strains of gonorrhea have become resistant to 
spectinomycin penicillin and tetracycline the use of antibiotics 
to keep livestock healthy also has been blamed for the spread of 
drugresistant salmonella bacteria that cause human food poisoning 
but medical microbiologist dr kinga kowalewskagrochowska said 
the study she conducted with colleagues at the university of 
alberta in edmonton has prompted her to speculate environmental 
pollution may spur development of some antibioticresistant germs 
she presented the study monday during the american society for 
microbiologys 28th interscience conference on antimicrobial agents 
and chemotherapy a meeting of 13000 cancer aids and infectious 
disease specialists 
the bacteria came from the bodies of william braine and john 
hartnell two of the 129 men who died in the canadian arctic during 
sir john franklins doomed 18451848 search for a northwest passage 
connecting the atlantic and pacific 
in 1986 the wellpreserved bodies were among three retrieved 
from graves in the permafrost on beechy island west of baffin bay 
in canadas northwest territories by canadian anthropologist owen 
beattie coauthor of the 1987 book frozen in time unlocking the 
secrets of the franklin expedition 
six types of bacteria lying dormant for over a century were 
found in the bowel contents of braine and hartnell 
kowalewskagrochowska said 
the organisms apparently survived 140 years in permafrost 
they grew sufficiently in the laboratory to be identified and 
tested for susceptibility to currently used antibiotics 
she said two of the six strains of bacteria all of which 
belong to the clostridium genus or group of species were found 
to be partly resistant to the antibiotics cefoxitin which was 
introduced in 1978 and clindamycin introduced in 1970 
the surprising discovery may spur revision of the theory that 
the proliferation of bacteria that survive antibiotics is solely 
caused by widespread use and abuse of antibiotics that kill 
vulnerable germs she said 
starvation scurvy and cannibalism apparently claimed the lives 
of most members of the expedition she said the crews sailed from 
britain aboard the hms terror and hms erebus then abandoned the 
vessels when they became trapped in ice but high lead levels found 
in the three bodies on beechy island suggest some of them died from 
toxic lead that leaked into food from solder in food tins she 
added 
resistance to antibiotics may be induced by the bodys reaction 
to heavy metals kowalewskagrochowska said speculating that 
environmental pollution may be contributing to the development of 
resistance to antibiotics by bacteria 
its totally speculative said microbiologist joseph 
kornfeld a spokesman for the american society of microbiology but 
added the hypothesis could be tested by growing modernday bacteria 
with increasing concentrations of lead and determining if they 
start to resist antibiotics 
kornfeld said some chemical component or structural feature of 
modern antibiotics may have existed in 1848 inducing resistance in 
the bacteria found in braine and hartnell 
kowalewskagrochowska said tissue specimens from the corpses 
were kept frozen in sterile containers until bacterial tests were 
performed assuring they really were 140yearold bacteria some 
tissues also contained streptococcal bacteria but those were 
identified as modern bacteria probably from members of beatties 
team who accidentally sneezed on the bodies she added 
the types of clostridium bacteria found can cause gangrene and 
abcesses while related species cause botulism and tetanus 
kowalewskagrochowska said 
clindamycin and cefoxitin are used to treat a variety of serious 
infections including of the lungs and bones 
many have credited franklin with discovering the northwest 
passage but his ships only reached a point not far from waters 
that led to asia according to the world book encyclopedia which 
says norwegian explorer roald amundsen completed the first trip 
through the passage in 1906

michael dukakis declaring his uphill 
presidential effort one for the people of america vowed a 
continued assault on republican campaign tactics and promised to 
balance his salvos with discussion of key issues 
to that end the democratic presidential nominee said monday 
night he would improve the nations secondary schools partly by 
tying some federal funding to improved academic performance 
he offered the plan at a town meeting at hayward high school 
telling san francisco bay area residents i dont know of 
anything that cries out more for presidential leadership than 
education 
dukakis was wrapping up a california campaign trip today faced 
with a new los angeles times poll that showed him trailing 
republican george bush by 11 points in the state which holds the 
top electoral college prize of 47 votes 
the poll released in todays editions of the times showed bush 
leading dukakis 5342 percent in the state the times questioned 
1376 registered voters during the fours days that ended sunday and 
the margin of error was four percentage points 
the massachusetts governor arrived in california late sunday and 
campaigned aggressively monday beginning in los angeles before 
traveling to san diego and then on to san francisco hayward and 
san leandro 
dukakis was heading today to colorado where he was to campaign 
before taping a fiveminute network television speech to be aired 
tonight dukakis also was appearing on abcs nightline and was 
spending part of the day preparing for that 90minute session 
many of dukakis california events were rallies with precinct 
leaders part of an unprecedented democratic party grass roots 
effort in this state he ended his day monday at one such 
gathering telling cheering supporters that either youre all 
crazy or were going to win on the 8th of november 
dukakis saluted the campaign volunteers and promised to close 
the campaign with a flourish 
this one is for you he said this one is for the people 
of america 
for the past week dukakis has focused on bushs campaign 
tactics accusing the vice president of distorting dukakis 
positions and record and using outright lies as part a 
calculated effort to avoid discussion of substantial issues 
im bound and determined that over the course of the next two 
weeks im going to take my case directly to the people of this 
country dukakis told the town meeting in hayward 
dukakis who trails bush in national polls as well acknowledged 
his slip was probably fueled by his failure to respond immediately 
and aggressively to bushs attacks 
im not going to let him get away with that stuff dukakis 
said ill see if i can strike a reasonably good balance 
between assailing the republicans and discussing his proposals 
his spoke briefly to the meeting about his latest the secondary 
education plan and aides distributed a position paper outlining 
the threepoint proposal 
the plan calls for encouraging improvements in science and 
computer teaching by in part tying eligibility for certain 
federal education funding to progress toward national performance 
standards also included is a proposal for job placement services 
for high school students who decide not to attend college 
dukakis issues adviser thomas herman said funding levels for the 
federal incentives included in the plan would depend on efforts to 
reduce the federal budget deficit those incentives would include 
grants to schools that establish model programs for exceptional and 
learningdisabled students

eastern airlines demanded that the customs service 
release a 14 million jetliner impounded after agents found 56 
pounds of cocaine aboard saying it is an ally not an enemy in 
the war against drugs 
mondays discovery of a bag of cocaine aboard an l1011 a day 
after it arrived here from bogota colombia was the fourth drug 
confiscation involving an eastern flight since august 
the customs service said the plane would not be released until 
eastern pays a fine of 896000 or 1000 an ounce and pledges 
to improve drug security 
eastern executives who are appealing 13 million in fines from 
the three earlier seizures said they found the latest action 
difficult to understand 
we are not an adversary we are cooperating with the 
government said abraham azzam a former us drug enforcement 
administration agent hired as the airlines top drug security 
officer 
we provided information about the possible shipment of drugs 
and were being punished for providing the information added 
airline spokeswoman karen ceremsak we dont believe this will 
help the good working relationship we have with the federal 
agencies 
azzam said the miamibased airline is spending 3 million on 
security but drug traffickers will continue to use airliners to 
transport contraband 
agents discovered the cocaine in an orange nylon us mail bag 
with a standard baggage tag flight 505 had proceeded from miami to 
new york on sunday but was seized soon after it made the return 
trip monday customs officials said 
we are not asking eastern airlines to become a law enforcement 
officer said robert gomez assistant district director of the 
customs office at miami international airport someone who has 
access to the airline has to be involved here and in colombia 
the government is not at war with the airlines he added 
but its not enough for the government to do it alone 
in the four seizures since august 494 pounds of cocaine has 
been found aboard eastern aircraft since march 1982 customs has 
seized 20 planes a fourth of them private aircraft at miami 
international airport agency spokesman clif stallings said 
azzam estimated that the latest jet seizure was costing eastern 
40000 to 50000 a day the carrier has trimmed back 
international flights as part of costcutting efforts which 
include a plan to lay off 4000 workers 
the only other eastern plane seized by customs in miami was in 
march 1984 said stallings 
earlier this month an eastern plane with 20 pounds of cocaine 
aboard was seized in bogota flying the same route but was allowed 
to leave four hours behind schedule 
four months ago avianca airlines of colombia said it would no 
longer haul cargo from bogota to miami because of the millions of 
dollars in fines it has had to pay in the united states as a result 
of cocaine seizures chiefly from flower shipments 
no one has been arrested in connection with mondays seizure 
customs said

the uss vincennes came home to an emotional 
welcome after a sixmonth deployment marred by the crews 
accidental downing of an iranian jetliner over the persian gulf 
killing the 290 people aboard 
were glad to be home i assure you of that capt will c 
rogers iii said after the guidedmissile cruiser docked at san 
diego naval station on monday this is a nice place 
rogers 400man crew cheered loudly as he walked down the 
gangway the captain got a kiss a hug and flowers from his wife 
sharon 
after a brief welcoming ceremony the sailors poured off the 
ship into a sea of relatives friends and fellow servicemen 
hi daddy youre home a little girl said as she waved to 
her father 
petty officer 3rd class steve hile of niles mich got a warm 
embrace from his girlfriend vallita lawwill 
i dont even know what we were doing there hile said 
its a tragedy that it happened but im glad im home and im 
alive 
the vincennes mistook the airbus jetliner for an iranian f14 
fighter jet when it shot the aircraft down july 3 according to the 
official pentagon report on the tragedy 
the report concluded that the warships crew misinterpreted 
computer and radar data because of the stress of being in combat 
for the first time at the time the vincennes was in a firefight 
with several iranian gunboats 
rogers disputed that conclusion monday its my opinon that 
stress was not a factor he said 
given all of the information available and in view of the 
ongoing continuum of violent and aggressive iranian action i was 
convinced beyond any doubt that the inbound aircraft was in direct 
support of the surface engagement in progress rogers said 
there of course were mistakes made and there always are in 
an intense combat environment rogers said but both my crew 
and the system performed basically as designed 
i as well as my crew will live with the result of the tragic 
loss of civilian lives associated with these actions tempered only 
by the belief i had no other course of action and that any prudent 
commanding officer would do the same 
rogers said the fate of the uss stark on which 37 sailors died 
in an iraqi missile attack in the persian gulf was in the back of 
his mind throughout his ships mission 
no skipper sails in the gulf without the stark at least in 
your subconscious rogers said was it a factor during that 
decision process i dont consciously remember 
responding to a question from an iranian reporter rogers said 
he regretted the loss of civilian life 
the captain said he knew within 90 minutes of ordering two 
missiles fired that the downed airplane was a civilian airliner he 
said he later assembled the crew to tell them the news which they 
took quietly 
at first we were all devastated rogers said it goes 
without saying but i have to look at it and my crew looks at it 
that given the fact that the airliner made no indication that it 
was not a hostile craft we had no other choice

the art institute of chicago has agreed to return 
a 1000yearold stone carving that thailand says disappeared from 
a sacred temple two decades ago in hopes of ending a ninemonth 
international dispute 
but a thai group says it wont be satisfied until its government 
approves the plan 
we cannot say that it is resolved until complete agreement is 
reached between the art institute and the thai government said 
wutisak lapcharoensap spokesman of the thai vishnu lintel 
committee based in suburban evanston 
the institute announced monday it would return the lintel to 
thailand in exchange for a thai artifact of equal artistic 
merit to be donated by the chicagobased elizabeth f cheney 
foundation a philanthropic group that wanted to help resolve the 
dispute 
the lintel a 2by3 foot stone crosspiece designed to fit above 
a door or window depicts the hindu god vishnu reclining on water 
it dates to cambodias khmer dynasty from ad 8051250 
it disappeared from the phnom rung temple a national monument 
in northeastern thailand during the 1960s thai officials say 
the lintel was first displayed at the institute 21 years ago 
but museum officials said they did not learn until february that 
the thai government wanted it returned for the temples restoration 
thai demonstrators protested outside the museum earlier this 
year hoping to have the lintel returned in time for reopening 
ceremonies at the thai temple in may 
museum spokeswoman virginia voedisch said thai officials had 
been told of the decision to return the lintel but she did not 
think an official response had been received by the institute 
mondays announcement came a day before a thai representative 
and others demanding the lintel were scheduled to testify at a city 
council committee meeting lapcharoensap said 
he said the meeting would be held today despite the announcement 
lapcharoensap said the institute had said earlier it wanted to 
return the lintel but nothing was done 
if i have some skepticism its justified he said 
the institute said it got the lintel from the chicagobased 
alsdorf foundation which acquired it in 1967 through a new york 
art dealer the institute said the new york dealer had purchased 
the carving from a dealer in bangkok in 1966 where it was offered 
for sale on the open market 
the museum said it agreed to return the lintel with the help of 
the cheney foundation to resolve the stalemate in negotiations 
and maintain the positive relationship that existed between 
thailand and the united states 
we are pleased to resolve this issue said james n wood 
the institutes director this solution meets our requirement for 
just compensation 
ms voedisch said museum and cheney foundation officials would 
have to agree on the piece to be donated in exchange for the 
lintel and that a decision was expected soon 
upon receipt of this gift the art institute will relinquish 
all rights and title to the lintel and donate it to thailand the 
museum said

union officials at harvard university 
celebrated after a judge dismissed the schools attempt to overturn 
a vote to form a 3400member union for technical and clerical 
workers 
the ivy league school however insisted it has done nothing 
wrong 
in a harshly worded opinion monday a national labor relations 
board administrative law judge rejected the universitys claim that 
labor organizers illegally coerced yes votes through a 
coordinated campaign to assure that union supporters cast ballots 
the judge joel a harmatz certified the harvard union of 
clerical and technical workers as the winner of the may ballot 
we feel great about it union director kristine rondeau 
said we knew we were right but we always were cautious about 
predicting the inevitability of our win 
the union an affiliate of the 1 millionmember american 
federation of state county and municipal employees won the 
election on a 15301486 vote in which more than 90 percent of 
eligible workers cast ballots 
the allegations do not suggest that the election was beclouded 
by threats violence vandalism reprisals or the traditional forms 
of voter intimidation harmatz wrote indeed none of the 
conduct subject to litigation in this proceeding would constitute 
an unfair labor practice 
harvards brief in the case harmatz said is replete with 
misinterpretations of the record of eight days of hearings the 
nlrb held in august on the universitys charges 
because these references either are not supported by or 
grossly overstate the proven facts this decision seeks to at this 
level bring a halt to this approach the judge said 
harvard spokeswoman marjorie heffron said no decision has been 
made on whether to appeal harmatzs ruling to the full fivemember 
board under the law it has two weeks to file an appeal 
the universitys position is sound and the union acted 
improperly harvard vice president for finance robert scott said 
in a statement it is plain that the opinion by harmatz does 
not accurately reflect the record of the hearings in many 
respects 
the union drive which began in 1975 and the universitys 
challenge had been viewed by several labor leaders as a major test 
of their ability to organize educated white and graycollar 
technical workers who are assuming a greater proportion of the 
workforce 
afscme president gerald mcentee said monday that the election 
and the nlrb action upholding the results was crucial for afscme 
and as a test case for the labor movement as a whole 
the issues raised in this campaign were the issues that affect 
the workforce of today and tomorrow job and family issues that 
include affordable quality child care decent pensions and 
benefits and flexibility in hours of work he said 
in the nlrb hearings harvard alleged that union organizers 
harassed employees about voting checked names of employees off a 
master list of supporters paid airline tickets for vacationing 
workers to return to cambridge to vote and systematically 
interrogated workers on their intentions 
harmatz said the allegations concerned a perfectly legitimate 
apparently successful tactical maneuver by the union to win 
maximum support 
the university ran its own aggressive campaign against 
unionization that included appeals from harvard president derek bok

a strict curfew confined most 
residents of this capital to their homes today while elsewhere on 
the island police fired tear gas and charged with batons into 
thousands of antigovernment demonstrators 
authorities imposed the curfew in colombo and surrounding areas 
after a bomb killed eight people monday at governing party meeting 
in the capital 
they said the move was necessary because of reports the peoples 
liberation front an extremist sinhalese group was planning an 
allday strike the government said it feared a strike would 
trigger more violence 
police initially blamed the front for the monday night bombing 
at a colombo home where members of president junius r 
jayewardenes united national party also predominantly sinhalese 
were meeting 
but party officials said today they had not ruled out the 
possibility the bomb was the work of opposition political parties 
violence has escalated with the approach of presidential 
elections scheduled for dec 19 
the peoples liberation front has accused the 
sinhalesedominated government of making too many concessions to 
the tamil ethnic minority seeking a separate homeland in northern 
and eastern sri lanka 
in the town of medawachchiya about 90 miles northeast of 
colombo police today dispersed 3000 protesters including many 
buddhist monks and schoolchildren demanding the governments 
resignation 
in welimada about 70 miles east of the capital about 5000 
people sat down on public highways and refused to move officials 
said police were unable to disperse them officials said 
there were no immediate reports of injuries in the protests 
police at colombo general hospital said the death toll in the 
bombing monday rose to eight after three more people died of their 
wounds today at least 40 others were injured they added 
police said two men on a motorcycle flung two pipes packed with 
explosives into the crowd at kotehena 2 miles north of the city 
center but only one of the bombs exploded 
the victims have not been identified because the curfew 
prevented relatives from going to the hospital morgue to view the 
remains but preliminary reports by police indicated most of the 
dead and the most seriously injured were local members of the 
united national party 
the curfew was imposed at midnight monday and was to remain in 
effect until 6 pm today a senior defense ministry official said 
the national security council would meet in emergency session later 
today to decide whether to extend it 
streets in the capital were virtually deserted during the day 
police passes were required for anyone desiring to leave home 
except for people seeking to buy food at shops near their homes 
according to authorities 
the peoples liberation front has put up posters in colombo and 
other parts of the country demanding jayewardenes resignation 
abrogation of a peace accord aimed at ending the tamil revolt and 
the withdrawal of 47000 indian soldiers deployed in sri lanka to 
enforce the accord 
under the indianbrokered accord tamils were to receive a 
measure of autonomy if tamil rebels surrendered their arms and 
stopped attacking sri lankan troops and sinhalese civilians the 
rebels refused and have been battling the indian peacekeepers for 
more than a year 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
they claim they are discriminated against in employment education 
and through use of the sinhalese language sinhalese who account 
for 75 percent of the population control most top government and 
military posts 
india became involved in the internal affairs of its island 
neighbor because of indias role as a regional power and the 
political clout of its own tamil minority of 60 million

gov roy romer says federal officials have four 
months to find a disposal site for lowlevel nuclear waste from the 
rocky flats nuclear weapons plant or hell try to close the plant 
until another site is found 
i dont want to give anybody any indication whatsoever that 
they can turn a temporary storage situation into a permanent one 
romer said monday the department of energy needs to find a 
solution to this 
the governors remarks came as a boxcar of lowlevel radioactive 
waste was returned to the rocky flats plant about 16 miles 
northwest of denver the boxcar was headed for a temporary storage 
site in idaho but idaho gov cecil andrus sent it back saturday 
and banned further shipments to his state 
under a state permit up to 1600 cubic yards of solid waste can 
be stored at the department of energy plant which make plutonium 
triggers for nuclear warheads it will take the plant about four 
months to reach that storage capacity 
between now and then romer said doe officials must find 
another place to store rocky flats waste if they dont he said 
he will move to shut down the plant 
doe had planned to transfer the waste from the temporary site in 
idaho to a permanent site in new mexico the opening of the new 
mexico site has been delayed until early next year 
well cooperate with the doe to find an alternative site until 
new mexico is open romer said but ive said look no 
expansion of rocky flats 
romer said he would press for a meeting of western governors to 
discuss a longterm solution to the problem and planned to talk to 
doe officials in the meantime 
on sunday romer rejected a doe request to expand storage 
facilities for lowlevel radioactive waste at rocky flats and asked 
that doe not unload the rail car which contains 140 55gallon 
drums of waste

a pharmacist testified that he filled 
prescriptions for several drugs including an antianxiety drug and 
a muscle relaxant for the pilot of delta jetliner that crashed in 
1985 
pharmacist larry thomas testifying in a lawsuit brought by 
delta air lines against the government said he filled 
prescriptions for captain edward m connors from 1983 until shortly 
before delta flight 191 crashed aug 2 1985 at dallasfort worth 
international airport connors was among 137 people who were killed 
thomas said monday that the drugs connors obtained from his 
pharmacy included stelazine an antianxiety drug and robaxin a 
muscle relaxant 
the pharmacist said his pharmacy filled a prescription for 
stelazine on several occasions between sept 21 1982 and june 24 
1985 
delta sued the government contending air traffic controllers and 
weather forecasters failed to warn the flights crew of a severe 
thunderstorm in the landing path 
miami pharmacist gerald warshofsky in a deposition presented to 
us district judge david o belew said that he filled 
prescriptions for connors for drugs including the tranquilizer 
valium and the painkiller percodan 
federal aviation administration attorney mark bury told the 
judge the government will attempt to prove that connors also had 
been taking dalmane a depressant used to treat insomnia and 
several antihistamines for long periods before the crash 
delta attorney john martin objected to raising the drug issue 
which government lawyers say will take about two weeks to present 
to spend two weeks on an issue that could not possibly have 
been the cause of the accident is a waste of the courts time 
martin said 
lawyers for the airline contend that the drug issue is 
irrelevant because the copilot not connors was flying the plane 
at the time it crashed while attempting to land during a 
thunderstorm on a flight from fort lauderdale fla 
bury said the issues raises serious questions about connors 
judgment he noted that connors did not disclose his use of the 
drugs to the faa as required 
delta attorney maureen murry said connors had provided the 
government with enough information and the government could have 
obtained more if it wanted to

a man paralyzed from the waist down 
when his parked car was rammed by another vehicle has lost a 
lawsuit because he was not wearing a seat belt when he was injured 
the ruling was a onetime decision due to the insurance policy 
clause which mandates wearing a seat belt even if the car is parked 
and the motor off it does not apply to the overall seat belt 
law hamm court spokesman karlheinz heugemann said today 
west german law requires all passengers in private cars to wear 
seat belts when the motor is running 
heugemann said the court decision only involved special daily 
insurance payments to the injured man during his stay in the 
hospital which amounted to about 5000 marks 2777 
his hospital and medical care payments were not affected by the 
insurance clause said heugemann 
heugemann said the man was paralyzed in an accident at a service 
station while he was waiting in his parked car with the motor off 
he wasnt wearing a seat belt and another vehicle hit his car 
while he was waiting for the service station to open said 
heugemann 
he declined to provide the name of the man involved in the case 
or say when he was injured

soviet ambassador yuri v dubinin met 
poultry magnate frank perdue and walked away with two oven 
stuffer roasters and some insight into chicken processing 
dubinin on monday took a daylong tour of perdue farms on the 
eastern shore to get a firsthand look at the mechanics of poultry 
processing 
as chairman and chief owner of perdue farms dubinins 
68yearold host oversees a chicken empire thats expected to gross 
more than 1 billion in sales this year perdues face is familiar 
on television where he appears in his own commercials 
its something thats very well developed in the united states 
and with perdue especially dubinin said of american poultry 
production the problem in the soviet union is output quality and 
quantity 
perdue accompanied the ambassador and his entourage of eight 
including dubinins wife liana and two daughters through a 
hatchery in westover and a processing plant in accomac that 
employs 1700 people and slaughters an average 300000 chickens a 
day 
afterward he presented the diplomat with an ice chest bearing 
the perdue logo that contained the two roasting chickens the rest 
of the soviet delegation from washington received similar freebies 
dubinin said the visit was his first contact with chicken 
processing in any country he called his trip a demonstration that 
diplomacy is not just politics its economic relations 
technological relations 
the ambassador said the soviet union would like to increase 
chicken production watching eviscerated poultry moving swiftly 
through the production line is an interesting experience for 
me he told reporters 
as for perdues television commercials dubinin said he has seen 
them and found them amusing but he added that he is less concerned 
with the marketing aspects of poultry production and more concerned 
about output 
dubinin said there is potential for some joint enterprise with 
perdue and the soviet union but we will have a better idea 
about that after perdue makes a planned visit to the soviet union 
perdue spokeswoman chris whaley confirmed that perdue is 
scheduled to make a visit soon but she declined to speculate on 
what business dealings might be under discussion

carla southwell shed tears of joy 
when she saw her 8monthold son for the first time since she was 
jailed almost seven weeks ago for hiding her two daughters from her 
exhusband 
the tears of joy turned to tears of anguish moments later 
he didnt even remember me she said sobbing 
the 26yearold kent city woman alleges her exhusband william 
southwell sexually abused the girls ages 4 and 5 during 
unsupervised visits 
southwell 30 has denied the charges saying the girls were 
manipulated by their mother an ongoing investigation has turned up 
no evidence that he abused the girls 
on sept 7 ms southwell was jailed for contempt of court and 
ordered held until the girls are surrendered 
her fiance kelly erhart and relatives are caring for the ms 
southwells son fathered by erhart who is not part of the court 
order 
in a telephone interview monday from the kent county jail ms 
southwell said she shares a cell with 10 to 20 other women 
including one facing a murder trial she said she has had to fight 
off one attack 
i do a lot of writing letters reading praying ms 
southwell said and thinking 
in a videotape shown at a hearing last month the couples 
daughters indicated they had been abused 
ms southwell said she has not been in contact with her 
daughters but is confident they are safe and healthy 
i think about them constantly she said choking back tears 
this is the worst thing that a loving mother could ever have to 
go through 
before making a decision on custody circuit judge george buth 
said he wants the children to be evaluated by the county department 
of protective services otherwise he said he fears ms southwell 
may run away with the girls 
the children are a battleground in this case buth said 
friday theyre the ones suffering 
buth said he is concerned that ms southwell made the 
allegations against her exhusband during a custody evaluation that 
was in the fathers favor 
i cant say ive made up my mind whether sexual abuse has 
occurred said southwell also of kent city if carlas so sure 
i sexually abused them why doesnt she give them up to protective 
services like the judge ordered so professionals can make a 
decision i think my kids lives need to be straightened out and 
carlas not doing that 
ms southwell who has had temporary custody of the children 
alleges the agency did a poor job in investigating her previous 
allegations and she said they lack concern for the children 
southwell said custody was recommended for him because his 
exwife denied him access to the children 
this is the fifth time ive gone over two months without 
seeing them because carla wouldnt let me he said 
though a physician testified at a custody hearing that one of 
the girls had injuries typical of sexual abuse an investigator 
with the sheriffs department said there was no evidence to prove 
southwell was guilty 
i believe that in her own heart and mind she believes this 
but we cant prove that it happened sgt ken kleinheksel said 
all we got was a very confused statement from a child 
ms southwell said she will stay behind bars until she is 
assured her exhusband will not have contact with their daughters 
its very difficult to accept the fact that i cant see my 
daughters but ill hang on and ill fight to the last day she 
said

maria desillers must pay a 235000 hospital bill 
for her late sons three unsuccessful liver transplants a judge 
has ordered 
dade circuit judge francis christie approved a proposed 
settlement monday over the objections of ms desillers who was 
ejected from the hearing after an outburst 
the settlement which was reached by the childrens hospital of 
pittsburgh and karen gievers the courtappointed curator of ronnie 
desillers estate represented a 10 percent discount on its 
original charge of 261000 
ms desillers was thrown out of the courtroom in the second 
phase of the hearing which dealt with a 31000 bill from the 
state 
the state said it would drop the bill if the balance of the 
estate were turned over to the governors transplant lifeline for 
children set up to help children in ronnies circumstances the 
judge approved the arrangement 
during state testimony about the tlc program ms desillers 
slammed her hand down on a notebook and complained that tlc turned 
her down when she asked for help for ronnie 
no more outbursts christie warned do you understand me 
no sir i dont she said because they did not help me 
with my child 
get her out of here the judge ordered the bailiff 
ms desillers contended that the hospital did not treat the boy 
correctly her attorney frank johnson questioned price 
discrepancies between allegedly similar items on the 1700page 
bill 
the payment will leave ronnies estate with 25000 to 30000 
donations of more than 670000 poured in from around the country 
while the 7yearold endured the futile operations 
ms desillers who paid 162000 on the original bill of 
424000 balked on paying the balance last year and sued the 
hospital 
johnson said ms desillers criminal attorney roy black who 
represents her in a pending investigation by the local state 
attorneys office had advised her not to reveal information to the 
curator because it would compromise ms desillers guarantees 
against selfincrimination 
edwin k zechman jr president of childrens hospital said the 
recommendations of the curator and the judges decision fully 
vindicate our position 
after the hospital is paid 25000 to 30000 will remain in 
the bank account that was set up for contributions on behalf of 
children in need of transplant surgery

the nations first sperm bank for chimpanzees is 
designed to meet the increasing demand for animals by aids 
researchers the banks founder says 
chimpanzees are highly valued in research because they are the 
closest biologically to humans but they are a threatened species 
that can no longer be captured legally in the wild 
dr kenneth g gould chief of reproductive biology at the 
yerkes regional primate center said researchers there and at other 
centers around the world infect the animals with aids to study the 
progress of the disease in an animal with an immune system similar 
to mans 
unlike man the animals do not die of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome but they can spread the virus and therefore are not 
allowed to breed after being infected 
im glad to hear about his success said dr duane c 
kraemer a specialist in primate reproduction and a texas aampm 
university professor its important that we develop techniques 
for sperm storage and artificial insemination for a number of 
species 
the bank will help breeders maintain a genetically diverse 
population of captive chimps and give scientists a model for 
developing sperm banks for other primates such as gorillas 
for more than three decades scientists have frozen human and 
cattle sperm successfully but the same formulas did not prevent 
ice crystals from destroying the chimpanzee sperm until goulds 
success 
gould began freezing the chimpanzee sperm in 1986 and 
eventually found that it had to be frozen more slowly than that of 
other species

the likud and labor parties clashed over a us 
television appearance by king hussein of jordan in which the 
monarch said he was ready to head a jordanianpalestinian 
delegation in peace talks with israel 
in television commercials monday the leftwing labor party 
claimed hussein proved the credibility of its peace platform by 
announcing he was ready to take an active part in talks with israel 
the rightwing likud bloc accused labor of being ready to hand 
all the territories israel captured in the 1967 middle east war to 
yasser arafat head of the palestine liberation organization 
arafat on sunday urged arab israelis to participate in the nov 
1 election and said jewish voters should cast ballots for peace 
by participating in the elections arabs can assure themselves 
of 1415 seats in israels parliament and influence the government 
arafat was quoted as telling egypts middle east news agency 
arafat also said palestinians in the occupied territories would 
not take up arms to continue the 10month uprising against israeli 
rule more than 300 palestinians and six israelis have died in the 
uprising which is a key israeli election issue 
in a hardhitting ad with grim music the likud showed a 
portrait of arafat on labors ballot slip indicating a vote for 
labor was a vote for the plo 
the likud also charged labor with orchestrating husseins 
television appearance and said it was a cheap ploy to win votes 
both parties showed clips of husseins interview which was 
broadcast thursday on abcs nightline 
labor has campaigned on a peace platform based on direct 
negotations with a joint delegation of jordan and palestinians who 
do not belong to the plo which israel considers a terrorist 
organization the talks would be held under the aegis of an 
international peace conference 
the campaign appeared to lose credibility after hussein 
announced last summer he was giving up all claims to the occupied 
territories and acknowledged the plos responsibility for them 
in one segment of the interview hussein praised labor party 
leader and foreign minister shimon peres a party spokeswoman said 
the interview disproved likud claims that labors peace proposal 
was unrealistic 
in one commercial labor screened film clips of sundays 
television debate between peres and likud leader and prime minister 
yitzhak shamir to support its claim the likud is intransigent about 
peace 
labor showed one clip in which shamir distinguished between the 
sinai desert which israel gave back to egypt in return for peace 
and the occupied west bank and gaza strip which he said were an 
integral part of the biblical land of israel 
the likud rejects the proposal for an international peace 
conference and opposes yielding any part of the occupied 
territories

jurors who acquitted a navajo man in the 
burning deaths of two tribal police officers in december said the 
verdict was due to a lack of concrete evidence and witnesses 
changed stories 
after deliberating five hours the 12member jury acquitted ben 
atene jr of all counts monday following his second trial in the 
deaths of officers roy lee stanley and andy begay 
while family members met the verdict with shouts and tears 
atene 24 remained somber 
all i can say is my cousin brother and half brother are 
innocent too he said 
his cousin thomas cly 22 and halfbrother vinton bedoni 31 
were convicted of firstdegree murder in august and sentenced to 
life in prison the same jury after deliberating for more than 46 
hours could not agree on a verdict for atene and us district 
judge j thomas greene declared a mistrial 
charges against atenes brother marques atene 22 were dropped 
when prosecutors acknowledged they did not have enough evidence to 
gain a conviction 
two jurors said the lack of concrete evidence led to their 
verdict 
assistant us attorney david schwendiman said he was relieved 
that the case was over 
it was a messy and ugly thing to have to live with for a 
year he said i just hope this verdict helps to heal the 
wounds people need to get on with their lives 
following a murder and trial that has sharply divided the 
residents of monument valley atene said he was not sure whether he 
would be able to go home again 
i lost all my job i lost all my brand new pickup thats all 
i can say atene said 
atenes father said earlier that the familys truck was 
repossessed when his son was no longer around to help make the 
payments 
in final arguments prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed 
that the verdict hinged on whether jurors believed five prosecution 
witnesses who testified they saw ben atene at the dec 4 1987 
desert bonfire drinking party where the officers were shot 
all five witnesses originally denied being at the party but two 
decided to testify for the prosecution after they were charged with 
perjury 
prosecutors contended that atene was at the drinking party and 
later was seen at the remote copper canyon site where the officers 
and their vehicles were doused with gasoline and set afire 
atene and members of his family said he went to bed early that 
night and arose before dawn to take part in a traditional navajo 
healing ceremony 
several defense witnesses testified that three of the 
prosecution witnesses were elsewhere on the night of the bonfire 
prosecutors argued that atene did not pull the trigger but his 
involvement throughout the incident made him equally guilty

a british television documentary claims us 
organized crime was behind the assassination of president john f 
kennedy and that his shooting was carried out by three french 
gangsters 
the twohour central television program entitled the men who 
killed kennedy says the assassins were from marseilles the 
documentary is to be broadcast tonight details of the program were 
made available today 
the documentary names one of the alleged killers as lucien sarti 
and says he was shot to death in mexico in 1972 it a second 
alleged killer is believed to be working in colombias cocaine 
trade and the third is understood to be living in marseilles after 
his recent release from prison 
central television a company in britains commercial 
independent television network said the program was based on a 
fouryear inquiry by american writer and researcher steve rivele 
and the programs british director nigel turner 
kennedy was killed as he rode in a motorcade through dallas on 
nov 22 1963 american lee harvey oswald was charged with the 
shooting but was shot dead two days later in a police station by 
jack ruby the warren commission found oswald acted alone in 
killing kennedy 
there have been numerous theories over the years alleging oswald 
was not the killer or that he was part of a conspiracy numerous 
organizations countries and personalities have been alleged to 
have been involved in kennedys death 
the program says kennedy and his brother robert then the us 
attorneygeneral were cracking down on organized crime at the time 
of the assassination 
turner said at last we can show that all those americans who 
for 25 years believed in oswalds innocence and in a greater 
conspiracy were correct 
rivele claims in the program that the three frenchmen alleged to 
have killed kennedy were hired through organized crime circles in 
the french mediterranean island of corsica 
a purported drug smuggler who claims he was offered the 
underworld contract to assassinate kennedy but did not accept it 
and a former drug trafficker who reportedly became a government 
informant appear on the program to support riveles allegations 
the documentary claims the us and french governments have 
sufficient evidence to act against the two surviving frenchmen

a delay in the production of flu vaccine 
will keep people from receiving influenza shots until the end of 
the peak time for protecting patients 
but as the season approaches medicare subscribers in 10 areas 
of the country were told the will receive free flu shots for the 
first time as part of a 100 million program aimed at saving the 
lives of thousands of people killed by influenza each year 
the drug companies who make the vaccine say the us centers for 
disease control took longer than normal to identify the strains 
needed in the vaccines in part causing a twomonth delay in 
delivering the drugs to doctors 
but the cdc contends the notification wasnt late both sides 
agree the viruses causing this seasons flu take longer to 
cultivate for vaccines 
shipment of vaccines will not be finished until late november 
the end of the peak period for protection officials said october 
and november are considered the best times for immunization 
suzanne gaventa a cdc epidemiologist denied the federal agency 
was late in notifying the drug companies she said the strains were 
identified in conjunction with the world health organization and 
published in the cdcs morbidity and mortality weekly report april 
22 
she said the decision is routinely made in march or april 
ms gaventa attributed the delay to an especially low production 
yield by two of the three strains covered by the vaccine 
the largest producer of the vaccines wyeth laboratories inc 
of suburban st davids usually has shipped most of its 9 million 
doses by september this year wyeth will send vaccines to 
physicians through early to midnovember said company spokeswoman 
audrey ashby 
as of monday wyeth had sent 90 percent of its shipments 
ms ashby said that although the word from the cdc was later 
than usual the primary cause of the delay for wyeth was a decrease 
in yield by as much as 70 percent for one of the three strains 
marshall molloy spokesman for parkedavis in morris plains 
nj said parkedavis has sent about half its lot of 8 million 
doses and plans on completing shipments in mid to late november 
janet skidmore spokeswoman for er squibb amp sons which 
distributes flu vaccines manufactured by the third vaccine 
producer connaught said their shipments of about 6 million doses 
should be complete by early november 
at a medical meeting in los angeles meanwhile dr walter 
orenstein who directs the cdcs immunization division said the 
medicarefunded flushot demonstration project that started last 
week was ordered by congress and will cost up to 25 million 
annually for four years 
it is meant to determine if the government can save money by 
paying for flu shots rather than the cost of treating disease 
for the elderly and others most at risk of death from the flu he 
said monday 
the highest risk group for the flu and traditionally last on 
the list of those immunized are older people living in close 
quarters in bigcity nursing homes said paul stehrgreen a cdc 
immunologist 
doctors prefer to immunize them last because their systems do 
not hold on to the antibody as long as younger peoples he said 
if they dont get it in time theres a risk of an influenza 
epidemic among older people he said 
the vaccine is suggested annually for people 65 and older and 
for those with heart disease diabetes kidney problems sickle 
cell anemia and those whose spleens have been removed 
three of the locations will be announced in a few weeks when 
negotiations are completed orenstein listed the seven others as 
health agencies for the states of north carolina ohio and 
oklahoma the university of rochester which will operate a program 
in monroe county ny and health departments in san antonio 
texas allegheny county pa including pittsburgh and maricopa 
county ariz including phoenix

residents in this upscale suburb 12 miles 
southwest of boston say three months with the new 508 telephone 
area code is three months too long 
the towns cry to revert back to the greater boston area code of 
617 was being heard today by the legislatures government 
regulations committee which has received more than 100 letters 
from residents upset about the change 
a bill that would force the change back was filed this summer by 
rep ellen canavan of needham when the state department of public 
utilities rejected the towns request 
its one of the daily constant little things that drive you 
crazy said canavan who lives in neighboring needham which 
retained its 617 code 
dover is one of 193 communities given the new 508 area code by 
the new england telephone co in an effort to avoid running out of 
telephone numbers in eastern massachusetts 
the 508 zone includes bostons far western suburbs much of 
central massachusetts cape cod and the islands southeastern 
massachusetts cape ann and the merrimack valley 
dover residents say they are oriented toward boston and not 
central massachusetts but they acknowledge the towns affluence 
makes it liable to charges of seeking special consideration 
telephone company officials say the designations were carefully 
made and they fear if dovers effort is successful other 
municipalities will rebel 
unfortunately its a very emotional issue said jacqueline 
jung a new england telephone spokeswoman 
but for some very real business reasons we had to draw the 
line somewhere it was a long thoughtful process dover is no 
different from any other community it just thinks its different

sales of existing singlefamily homes fell 22 
percent in september after an unexpectedly strong sales spurt 
earlier this year a real estate trade group said today 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
homes declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 363 million 
units last month following a 22 percent increase in august and a 
50 percent decline in july 
sales had increased every month from february through june 
suprising economists who had predicted that gradually rising 
interest rates would dampen home buying however as it turned out 
many buyers apparently bought early in an attempt to beat rising 
rates 
the decline in september is a hangover from the buying 
spree of the summer said john a tuccillo chief economist of 
the real estate group the extraordinary increase of the summer 
was in part borrowed from september 
fixedrate mortgages hit a low of 984 percent in february and 
rose to 1071 percent by early august since then theyve eased 
back to 1028 percent 
tuccillo predicted sales rates will continue to lag in the 
fourth quarter and by yearend would total 347 million units down 
only slightly from 353 million in 1987 
the median price of a home fell from august to september by 
2900 to 88500 meaning half sold for more and half for less 
the decline was a normal seasonal development as the summer 
homeselling season drew to a close tuccillo said 
the northeast remained the costliest region of the country with 
a median sales price of 141400 up 63 percent from a year ago 
in the west the median price was 124300 up 71 percent from a 
year earlier the median in the south was 82400 up 36 percent 
from september 1987 in the midwest the price was 67100 up 15 
percent the national appreciation rate over 12 months was 35 
percent 
the west was the only region of the country showing an increase 
of sales last month they rose 60 percent to 710000 units 
following a 31 percent increase in august 
sales fell 58 percent in the northeast to 650000 units the 
lowest level since january they fell 32 percent in the midwest to 
900000 units and were off 28 percent in the south to 138 million 
units 
tuccillo said the sales market is particularly vigorous in 
california analysts have attributed the increased activity to fear 
that local government will impose development controls on building 
new homes

rep pat swindall today offered to give up his 
right to a jury trial on federal perjury charges in order to obtain 
a verdict by election day but us district judge robert vining 
immediately rejected the idea 
with jury selection entering its third day swindall told 
vining im just real concerned as to whether or not we can get 
this case tried this week and next week 
swindall added i am prepared to waive my right to be tried by 
a jury its not something i want to do 
vining would determine a verdict in a nonjury trial but he 
said he would not do so in swindalls case he pledged to try to 
expedite the trial while safeguarding the congressmans rights 
mr swindall i understand the importance of the events of 
nov 8 to you vining said however i do think there are 
things more important to you than the election of nov 8 
swindall who contends the perjury charges against him are based 
on lapses in his memory cited president reagans claims of faulty 
memory in the irancontra affair as he questioned prospective 
jurors monday 
acting as his own attorney swindall asked four of 18 
prospective jurors about reagans claim that he could not remember 
the extent of his knowledge regarding the sale of arms to iran and 
diversion of some proceeds to nicaraguan rebels 
two of the prospective jurors seemed sympathetic to reagans 
claim two others indicated they were skeptical 
twenty more people were to be questioned today by swindall 
prosecutor craig gillen and judge robert vining selection of the 
12member jury was expected to be completed today 
on monday vining granted swindalls motion to excuse one 
potential juror who said he would lean toward the prosecution 
swindall 38yearold twoterm republican said he remained 
confident the trial can be completed before the nov 8 election in 
which he faces democrat ben jones 
after swindalls oct 17 indictment on 10 counts he demanded a 
quick start for his trial because of the election 
he is accused of lying to a grand jury primarily about a 
meeting he held last year with an undercover internal revenue 
service agent posing as a money broker 
the prosecution which has a tape recording of the meeting says 
swindall knew the agent was suggesting that illegal drug proceeds 
would be used to back an 850000 mortgage for swindalls house 
the loan was never executed although swindall did briefly 
accept a 150000 check from another man involved in the 
negotiations 
swindall has said he was tripped up by a memory contest and 
never intended to deceive the grand jury 
vining ruled that swindall may put himself on the witness stand 
without using another attorney to question him 
gillen objected arguing that swindall would be able to deliver 
a monologue without giving the government a chance to object to 
improper questions but vining said he did not want to interfere 
with swindalls right to represent himself 
although recent polls show jones with a 21 lead swindall said 
he remained confident he can defeat jones as soon as that 
acquittal happens he said the end of the trial would allow him 
to contrast his conservative record with what he described as 
jones liberal stands

republican frontrunner george bush today 
accused democratic rival michael dukakis of trying to divide 
americans along economic lines and exploit the base temptations 
of division fear and envy 
toughening his attack with the election two weeks away bush 
also scorned dukakis economic policies charging that he clings 
despite all the evidence of the last two decades to the 
discredited policies of high taxes and government spending 
bush addressed the ohio association of broadcasters as a gop 
team in washington was assigned to deal with democratic charges of 
lies distortions and racial bigotry in the vice presidents 
campaign advertising 
sen arlen specter rpa new hampshire gov john sununu and 
former sen john tower of texas were detailed to rebut the charges 
at an afternoon news conference 
speaking with reporters on his air force two campaign plane 
bush referred to the racism charge in connection with a 
softoncrime tv ad used against the massachusetts governor 
one of the charges was so vicious and so ugly and so unfounded 
that i think our people feel they had to respond bush said 
in ohio the vice president was campaigning in columbus canton 
and lima hoping to bolster his lead in the polls and deny dukakis 
one of the states on his mustwin list for the nov 8 election 
bush told the broadasters ive been disturbed as ive 
witnessed my opponents campaign over the several past weeks at the 
increasing appeals to class conflict in my view there is no place 
in american public life for philosophies that divide americans one 
from another along class lines and that excite conflict among 
them 
stressing the need for national unity bush said america will 
find her future by keeping with the traditions of her past 
traditions of openness generosity and cooperation we will move 
forward not by succumbing to the base temptations of division fear 
and envy but by following as abraham lincoln said those better 
angels of our nature 
bush said that under president reagan the unemployment rate had 
dropped from 125 percent during the 198182 recession to a current 
59 percent actually the alltime high jobless rate was 108 
percent in november and december of 1982 the current rate is 54 
percent for september 
bush promised that if elected he will elevate the white house 
science adviser to assistant to the president and make him an 
active member of the economic policy council and our national 
security planning processes 
moreover bush said he would create a presidents council of 
science and technology advisers composed of leading scientists 
engineers and corporate executives 
with 23 electoral votes ohio is one of the key battlegrounds in 
the presidential race two recent newspaper polls both gave bush an 
11point edge over dukakis in that state today marked the vice 
presidents sixth visit to ohio since the gop national convention 
he accused dukakis of advocating an industrial policy which 
means having bureaucrats back in washington dc pick the winners 
and the losers and that would simply make us all losers 
bush also chided dukakis for opposing a reduction in the capital 
gains tax saying that everytime it has been cut in the past it has 
brought in more revenue than it has lost 
campaigning monday in new england bush stressed pocketbook 
issues and tried to spark a heavy voter turnout for the republicans 
things look pretty good nationally things look pretty good 
but the race is going strong bush told an audience that waited 
in the rain to see him at a firehouse rally in williston vt by 
the time bush arrived the skies had cleared and crowds lined the 
street with a sprinkling of protesters 
the undecided voters are goingto make a big difference he 
said please dont let up dont take anything for granted get 
that vote out 
bush usually does not respond to charges from dukakis but he 
made an exception to reply to complaints about gop campaign 
commercials 
these guys can dish it out but they cant take it bush 
said he wants to run away from his record and i am not going to 
let him do that 
he cannot take it the vice presdent said of dukakis he 
cannot take it and now hes trying to turn and make the issue what 
we are saying 
he said his campaign has complete documentation for its 
advertisements assailing dukakis over a massachusetts prisoner 
furlough program which now has been curtailed and on defense 
issues dukakis is broadcasting commercials accusing the bush 
campaign of lying 
and he is upset not because its false but because he is 
weak on crime and defense and thats the inescapable truth bush 
said 
bush also denied as absolutely ridiculous democratic charges 
that there is racism in his advertising on the prison furlough 
program with its focus on black prisoner willie horton who raped a 
white woman and attacked her fiance i stand fully behind these 
ads bush said 
bush brushed aside questions about dukakis charge that bush 
would personally reap a 22000ayear tax break from his proposal 
to cut the capital gains tax

republican george bush accused democratic rival michael dukakis 
today of making appeals to class conflict in charging that a 
bush administration would be slanted toward the rich including 
the vice president himself 
dukakis who was campaigning today in california said monday 
that bushs proposal for a cut in the capital gains tax would 
benefit the welltodo and would have meant tax savings to bush 
personally of about 22000 a year if it had been in effect the 
past three years 
bush said today ive been disturbed as ive witnessed my 
opponents campaign of the last several weeks at the increasing 
appeals to class conflict in my view there is no place in 
american public life for philosophies that divide americans one 
from another and that excite conflict among them 
america will find her future by keeping with the traditions of 
her past traditions of openness generosity and cooperation 
bush said we will move forward not by succumbing to the base 
temptations of fear and envy but by following as abraham lincoln 
said those better angels of our nature 
bush said dukakis clings despite all the evidence of the last 
two decaes to the discredited policies of high taxes and 
government spending 
his comments came in a speech prepared for the ohio association 
of broadcasters polls show bush leading in ohio which is 
considered a mustwin state for dukakis 
with two weeks remaining until election day dukakis was seeking 
votes in california where the latest poll showed bush holding an 
11point lead over the democratic nominee in the battle for the 
states 47 electoral votes 
george bush wants to give people like himself a tax break 
thats more in some cases than the average worker in california 
makes in a year dukakis told supporters in los angeles on monday 
the massachusetts governor also accused the gop ticket of 
distorting his record in campaign advertising 
weve seen a campaign of distortions and misrepresentation and 
of outright lies now for many many months dukakis told a san 
diego audience 
the republican nominee stumping for votes in new england said 
monday his campaign has complete documentation for its 
commercials criticizing dukakis on crime and defense 
he cannot take it bush said of dukakis he cannot take it 
and now hes trying to turn and make the issue what we are saying 
the vice president was campaigning today in the ohio cities of 
columbus akron and lima before flying to detroit bushs running 
mate dan quayle was traveling to georgia and florida two states 
expected to end up in the gop column on nov 8 to help republican 
house and senate candidates 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen was 
campaigning in the dakotas and montana 
dukakis was concentrating on california before heading to 
denver colo where he will campaign as well as continue his 
rounds of television interview programs the democratic candidate 
was appearing on abcs nightline tonight and also promoting his 
candidacy in a fiveminute spot on nbc 
on monday night in an appearance on the larry king show on 
cable news network dukakis was asked whether he had a good 
shot of winning the presidency i think weve got a shot he 
replied 
the democratic nominee conceded that he should have responded to 
the gop attacks earlier but said he misunderstood the nature of 
the campaign and his earlier message was overshadowed by the furor 
over the quayle selection 
i was campaigning but a lot of attention was devoted to the 
republican convention and then there was about three weeks of 
deafening noise about the quayle selection which made it very 
difficult to get through he said 
what you find out at the convention is that youre suddenly in 
a very different world who says what for 45 seconds on the 6 
oclock news makes the difference in a particular day and it took 
a while to understand that 
on the campaign trail monday dukakis said a reduction in the 
tax on capital gains profits gained from sales of property such 
as stocks or real estate would benefit the wealthy who count 
bush among their ranks 
consider a taxpayer who reported 515132 in capital gains 
over the last three years dukakis said suppose he reports the 
same amount over the next three if the vice presidents new plan 
is accepted that taxpayer will get an annual tax break of more 
than 22000 
and whats the name of that taxpayer george herbert walker 
bush 
according to aides dukakis reported no capital gains during the 
past three years 
the los angeles times in todays editions showed bush leading 
dukakis 53 percent to 42 percent the poll of 1376 registered 
voters was conducted thursday through sunday and had a margin of 
error of plus or minus four percentage points 
bush meanwhile also stressed economic concerns as he 
campaigned in connecticut vermont and maine 
the vice president said the republicans have built an economic 
revival so strong that it can withstand any emergency with the 
possible exception of a liberal democrat in the white house 
bush also cautioned voters against taking the election for 
granted 
the undecided voters are going to make a big difference 
bush said please dont let up dont take anything for granted 
get that vote out 
quayle campaigning in kentucky echoed his running mate in 
urging voters to cast their ballots on election day and also 
suggested that the democrats are grasping at any straw in 
criticizing the gop ticket 
bentsen addressing a rally at a baptist church in little rock 
ark charged that the republicans are bearing false witness 
against michael dukakis 
and were going to set that record straight he said

a firefighter digging through the rubble of a 
sixstory building found the last survivor when she grabbed his 
hand more than eight hours after the structure collapsed 
im robin get me out shouted robin fischer to rescuers at 
the office building in the manhattans garment district 
fischer 27 was in serious but stable condition at bellevue 
hospital this morning after undergoing leg surgery 
the owner of the building was killed and fischer and 11 others 
were injured khoder alsouleh 25 and his brother sami both of 
brooklyn were reported in serious condition today at bellvue 
everbody who was inside the 60yearold building when it 
collapsed monday including a pregnant woman who survived from the 
top floor was accounted for by late monday authorities said 
it was like riding a monster and the only thing you could do 
was to hang on said wilhelm waight a 32yearold delivery man 
who survived a fall from the fifth floor with only minor injuries 
i covered my face with my arms 
he said he hit a van in a parking lot then freed himself from 
the rubble 
the collapse two blocks south of the empire state building 
crippled transit service just before evening rush hour affecting 
hundreds of thousands of commuters subways to new jersey and the 
west side of manhattan and trains to long island were halted more 
than an hour 
rescuers were worried vibrations from the trains would cause 
more of the building to collapse hampering rescue efforts 
authorities did not know for certain what caused the buildings 
west wall and interior to cave in but fire department spokesman 
efrain parrilla said a trench had been dug along a wall 
buildings commissioner charles m smith said construction work 
had been going on at the building but that no permits had been 
issued it appears they undermined the wall of this building and 
it collapsed he said 
shelly smith 26 who is five months pregnant works for a 
jeweler on the buildings top floor when it collapsed she slid 
down with the debris and emerged with cuts and bruises 
it just collapsed she said i hung onto the floor i 
guess the building fell into the parking lot i crawled out 
it made a sound like a swoosh said jeff burgos who watched 
from his store across the street i watched the top floors 
crumble as they fell men were actually coming out of the side of 
the walls climbing down the debris it looked like they didnt 
have a choice 
fischer who works for a handbag manufacturer on the sixth 
floor was found buried in packaging and cardboard boxes which 
probably cushioned her from the falling rubble said homer bishop 
chief of operations for the fire department 
firefighter joe hodges began digging in the area when he saw 
some boxes move about 20 minutes later fischer was pulled out 
she was crying said bishop and so was i 
earlier rescuers found the body of frank desantis 64 owner of 
the building desantis had been last seen on the roof a few minutes 
before the 3 pm collapse said police chief robert johnson 
rescuers crawling through the rubble used listening and infrared 
heatsensing devices in their search for survivors 
at midnight officials believed that everyone had been accounted 
for said bishop

militant who renounced his us citizenship to run for israels 
parliament said today he wants to be an american citizen again 
kahane said he planned to fly to the united states on wednesday 
for a fundraising tour but us officials said his passport was 
no longer valid and he would not be able to use it to gain entry 
a us embassy spokesman in tel aviv said kahane formally 
renounced his citizenship sept 16 and on oct 7 the state 
department approved the certificate of loss of nationality 
on oct 18 kahane appeared before a consular officer in 
jerusalem and asked to reverse the move said the embassy 
spokesman who requested anonymity we are informing him that the 
renunciation cant be reversed but that there is a procedure for 
appeal said the spokesman 
he said kahane has one year to submit an appeal to the state 
departments board of appellate review he can also appeal in 
federal court 
kahane who founded the militant jewish defense league in the

to give up his us citizenship by a new amendment to israeli law 
that bars dual nationals from running for knesset or parliament 
on oct 5 the election commission issued a decision barring 
kahanes antiarab kach party which polls indicated might win 
three or more seats in the nov 1 election for the 120seat

the us state department and us consulate that he wanted to 
withdraw his renunciation 
it was conditioned clearly in my application on my knesset 
list being approved said kahane 
kahane claimed the us and israeli governments had a common 
interest in barring him from making a speaking tour in which he 
would condemn israels banning of his kach party 
kahane who immigrated to israel in 1971 was elected to the 
knesset in 1984 kahane who has been barred from canada and

bombs and other weapons kahane served one year of a fiveyear term 
in that case

police used tear gas and clubs 
today against activists supporting a boycott of wednesdays 
nationwide elections for segregated municipal councils archbishop 
desmond tutu called for an election day fast and appealed to all 
sides to avoid violence 
a bomb exploded today in potchefstroom southwest of 
johannesburg extensively damaging a shopping center and slightly 
injuring a policeman police headquarters said 
it was the second bombing in as many days and police said the 
attacks are part of a campaign by the african national congress 
black guerrilla movement to disrupt the elections on monday a car 
bombing in witbank east of johannesburg killed two people and 
injured 42 
in zwide near port elizabeth a black candidate was shot and 
killed at his home late monday by an unidentified assailant a 
local newspaper reported 
near cape town more than 30 mixedrace high school students 
were injured today in a clash with clubwielding police after they 
protested the elections a school official said 
at johannesburgs university of the witwatersrand more than 
1000 people staged an antielection rally many of them including 
black activist winnie mandela marched to a campus gate where riot 
police ordered them to disperse then fired tear gas 
police said officers were being deployed throughout the country 
to guard polling stations 
the human rights commission a group opposing apartheid said in 
a report today that the elections are taking place under a 
blanket of silence generated by the repression of antiapartheid 
activists 
the commission said about 300 activists had been detained 
without charge since sept 1 most of them in connection with the 
election campaign the commission also alleged that authorities 
were coercing large numbers of blacks into voting 
tutu said those who wish to vote as well as those who boycott 
should be free to exercise their choice without intimidation 
i want to make an urgent call for a peaceful response to the 
elections the anglican archbiship said in a statement from 
church headquarters in cape town 
i call on the government not to provoke violence during the 
polling and on all those involved in responding to the elections 
whether supporting or opposing them not to allow intimidation 
he said 
tutu along with other black antiapartheid leaders have been 
calling for a national day of protest and a boycott of the 
ballotting for segregated municipal councils 
tutu who won the nobel peace prize in 1984 called for fasting 
and prayer but said the he and other antiapartheid leaders were 
not necessarily calling for a general strike 
since a state of emergency was declared in 1986 it has been 
illegal to call for nationwide strikes 
the elections mark the first time south africans of all races 
vote at the same time the white minority government has spent 
millions of dollars on advertising to encourage a high black 
turnout seeking support for its claims that it is extending 
democracy to blacks even though it denies them a vote in national 
elections 
there are about 5 million whites and 26 million blacks in south 
africa roughly half the blacks live in selfgoverning homelands 
not involved in the local elections 
critics say black turnout figures this year will be virtually 
meaningless because millions of blacks are ineligible to vote and 
because no candidates linked to major antiapartheid groups are 
running many opposition groups are banned and most activists view 
black town councils as subservient extensions of the 
whitecontrolled central government 
in the white elections attention is focused on a showdown 
between president pw bothas national party and the farright 
conservative party which seeks to strengthen segregation laws 
white antiapartheid candidates are active in only a few cities 
their most important battleground is johannesburg where they are 
underdogs against the national party in a fight for control of the 
city council

police said today the photograph of american 
hostage terry anderson that was found in the bag of a lebanese 
woman appears to be a copy and not an original 
they said they were still examining a photograph of american 
hostage alann steen a photograph of an unidentified man and 
several documents including a letter bearing steens name the 
photos and documents were discovered in the womans luggage when 
she arrived in milan 
achille serra head of the antiterrorism unit of milan police 
told reporters police had to check further before determining 
whether the photos and letter were part of an effort to free us 
hostages in lebanon or part of some sort of swindle 
it depends a lot on steens handwriting serra said if 
the handwriting sample shows that this letter wasnt written 
by steen things change a lot we would be talking about a fraud 
he would not say who might have been the object of a possible 
swindle police were awaiting a handwriting sample from the united 
states 
the photo of anderson the longestheld of the foreign hostages 
in lebanon appeared similar in reverse image to one issued by 
the proiranian group islamic jihad in august 
serra said he had not seen the earlier photo but i believe 
at least for the time being you can say that it the photo was 
not taken of the person himself its a photo of a photo 
according to police the lebanese woman was to turn the photos 
and documents over to aldo anghessa an italian arms trader with 
links to swiss and italian intelligence agencies 
the woman identified as aline ibrahim rizkallah 36 said she 
was to receive about 4000 from anghessa but the italian has 
denied it police said she was arrested thursday after arriving in 
milan from beirut 
serra refused to speculate tuesday about who was to ultimately 
receive the photos and letter we have our suspicions about the 
destination but i guarantee you on my word of honor that we dont 
know who was to get it he told a news conference 
he refused comment on a suggestion he made monday that an 
american organization was the intended destination 
serra said police had identified the man who supplied the 
lebanese woman with photographs documents 17 ounces of heroin 
and 1000 in counterfeit us bills 
italian police were considering traveling to lebanon to question 
the man he said 
it was unclear why the woman would endanger herself by carrying 
small amounts of fake money and heroin she was jailed for 
possessing them 
anghessa was not charged because there was no proof the drugs or 
money were destined for him police said 
islamic jihad denied monday that it was connected with the woman 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was seized on march 16 1985 
steen of boston was kidnapped jan 24 1987 at beirut 
university college where he taught 
fourteen foreigners including nine americans are missing and 
presumed kidnapped in lebanon

a lawyer accused of taking fees from more than 
400 aliens seeking legalization and then failing to file their 
federal amnesty applications has been ordered to pay nearly 
400000 in damages 
edward triwush whose law license was suspended by the illinois 
supreme court earlier this year was ordered monday by circuit 
judge anthony scotillo to pay a total of 395568 in damages to 417 
aliens and 11 employers 
manuel sanchez and john daniels the lawyers now representing 
the aliens said triwush took fees ranging from 40 to 850 from 
aliens and employers last year but did not file applications in 
the amnesty program granting legal residency for those who had 
lived continuously in the united states since 1982 
the deadline for applications was may 1 
during the six months that he was accepting fees triwush 
continued to work although the illinois supreme court suspended his 
license for his failure to file a brief in an unrelated case 
officials said 
the supreme court later ordered triwush jailed for 30 days but 
suspended the sentence after he agreed to make restitution of 
90000 to the aliens and employers representing the amount of 
fees accepted during the sixmonth suspension he was ordered to 
appear nov 15 to explain he should not be held in contempt the 
supreme court could reimpose the jail sentence at that time 
none of the 90000 had been repaid daniels said 
scotillo imposed the judgment monday after triwush failed to 
comply with requests for information from sanchez and daniels 
daniels said triwush also pleaded guilty to theft in lake county 
circuit court for accepting fees from aliens but failing to file 
any documents triwush was placed on 30 months probation and 
ordered to make resitution in that case officials said 
he has an unlisted telephone number in chicago and could not be 
reached

tropical storm miriam turned away from the 
pacific coast after heavy rains cut short a cycling race in 
guatemala and sent children home from school early in southern 
mexico 
guatemala el salvador and southern mexico barely affected by 
the storm that left at least 111 dead in five other latin american 
countries called off states of alert that had been in effect 
sunday and monday 
as hurricane joan the storm killed 21 people in costa rica 
four in panama 25 in colombia and 11 in venezuela it also claimed 
50 lives in nicaragua as it tore from the atlantic to the pacific 
before being downgraded to a tropical storm and renamed miriam 
the storm affected all central american countries except tiny 
belize and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless 
forecasters had feared it would regain strength and become a 
hurricane again as it reached the warm waters of the pacific but 
it did not 
at 11 am edt miriams center was near latitude 148 north 
longitude 942 west or about 75 miles off the coast of mexico in 
the gulf of tehuantepec according to the national hurricane center 
in coral gables fla 
the center said the storm had maximum sustained winds of near 50 
mph and was expected today to resume heading west northwest at 
about nine mph a storm becomes a hurricane when maximum sustained 
winds reach 74 mph 
flash flood and mud slide warnings remained in effect today for 
guatemala and el salvador 
about 1500 people living near coastal rivers in el salvador 
were evacuated monday the airport opened monday morning after 
being closed sunday 
in guatemala bicyclists competing in the rain during the fifth 
day of a twoweek cycling tour were excused from 10 miles of the 
race because of the rain despite light flooding in southern 
guatemala officials said evacuations were not necessary 
nicaragua suffered the most from hurricane joan as it lashed the 
caribbean coast and then ripped its way over land to the pacific 
the nicaraguan government said about 300000 people were 
homeless and at least 40 people were missing 
bluefields a nicaraguan port city on the caribbean with a 
population of 38000 was in tatters with at least 6000 homes 
destroyed and few buildings still with roofs officials said at 
least 21 people were killed in bluefields 
in managua the storm toppled electrical towers and tore down 
telephone lines and trees many people living beside riverbeds lost 
their homes 
much of the nicaraguan capital remained without electric power 
or drinking water monday and the government ordered schools to 
remain closed so schoolchildren could help with reconstruction work 
in an interview broadcast on state radio monday agrarian reform 
minister jaime wheelock said floods and strong winds caused the 
heavy damage to three basic foods rice beans and bananas and 
also affected export crops such as coffee cotton and sugar cane 
the storm destroyed almost all 2470 acres of coconut palms and 
80 percent of the african palm plantations in southern nicaragua 
and 40 percent of the banana plantations he said 
the first relief flights arrived in managua and bluefields on 
sunday carrying doctors food and medicine from cuba the mexican 
government flew in relief supplies monday mexican television said 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater claimed 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua was using the storm tragedy as 
propaganda against the reagan administrations support of rebels 
fighting the countrys leftist sandinista government 
fitzwater said no request for us aid had been received from 
the nicaraguan government and none was expected 
nicaragua appealed for international aid but ortega said the 
best humanitarian the united states could give us would be to stop 
its terrorist policies against nicaragua 
the nicaraguan government estimates that the 7yearold war with 
the rightist rebels known as contras has inflicted 12 billion 
worth of damage on the country

lisa steinberg whose death last year became a 
symbol of child abuse in america was viciously beaten by the only 
father she ever knew a prosecutor charged this morning as the 
murder trial of joel steinberg began 
lisa died on nov 5 when she was removed from a respirator but 
she was really killed days earlier assistant district attorney 
peter casolaro told the jury steinberg beat lisa so severely 
that he inflicted those injures which caused her death 
casolaro told the panel that graphic and grotesque evidence 
and testimony will prove steinberg murdered the child sixyearold 
lisa was found unconscious in the steinberg apartment early nov 2 
1987 and died of her injuries three days later 
steinberg a disbarred lawyer who took the child illegally at 
birth from an unwed long island teenager is charged with 
seconddegree murder 
defense attorney ira london said the evidence would not support 
the prosecutions claim 
it will not be proven in this case that lisa steinberg was 
murdered nor will it be prove that lisa was a battered child 
london said in a brief opening in which he also attacked hedda 
nussbaum steinbergs longtime livein companion and an anticipated 
key prosecution witness 
london called ms nussbaum delusional mentioned she had 
spent the last year in a mental hospital and alluded to her 
romance with satanic cults 
following the opening statement a paramedic who arrived at the 
steinberg home to find lisa unconcious and her brother mitchell 
tethered to a playpen took the stand as the trials first witness 
steinberg denies ever hitting lisa he claims she was sickened 
by food and the bruises on her back and chest resulted from his 
trying to revive her after she fell unconscious the night of nov 
1 1987 
justice harold rothwax ruled monday that prosecutors may tell 
jurors that ms nussbaum 46 waited at least 10 hours before she 
called for help for the comatose child because she was terrified of 
steinberg 
no help was called for lisa until after 630 am on nov 2 
court records show when police and medical technicians arrived 
they found the girl unconscious and a 16monthold boy called 
mitchell tethered to his playpen lying in a soiled diaper and 
drinking spoiled milk 
lisa was pronounced brain dead at nearby st vincents hospital 
at 855 am on nov 5 
the six men and six women who will hear the case which is 
expected to last four to eight weeks will likely hear testimony 
about child abuse beatings drug abuse sadomasochism and illegal 
adoptions 
ms nussbaum was charged along with steinberg in lisas death 
but never indicted after her arrest she underwent surgery and 
psychiatric treatment for injuries allegedly inflicted by 
steinberg the prosecution has said all charges against her 
probably will be dropped

first lady nancy reagan today called for a 
home front war on individual drug users and said authorities should 
arrest wall street bankers buying cocaine during lunch 
it is as important to stop drug use in the united states she 
said as it is to top cocoa growing in peru processing in colombia 
and shipping through the caribbean 
it is often easier to make strong speeches about foreign drug 
lords or drug smugglers she said than to arrest a pair of 
wall street investment bankers buying cocaine on their lunch 
break 
mrs reagan who often has campaigned against drug use during 
her husbands presidency called for a new crusade against drug use 
at home during a speech to the un third committee on social and 
humanitarian affairs 
the reagan administration has emphasized interdiction and 
stopping illegal drugs from entering the country especially from 
latin america but mrs reagan said the battle also must be fought 
at home 
the drug user is an accomplice to every criminal act every 
murder every terrotist attack carried out by the narcotics 
syndicates said mrs reagan who wore a mulberrycolored dress 
and heavy golden jewelry 
if we lack the will to fully mobilize the forces of law in our 
own country to arrest and punish drug users if we cannot stem the 
american demand for drugs she said then there will be little 
hope of preventing foreign drug producers from fulfilling that 
demand drugs must remain illegal at every step in the chain 
she was accompanied by secretary of state george p shultz and 
us ambassador vernon a walters she earlier met 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
mrs reagan said the international efforts against drugs are of 
vital importance and must be expanded drug traffickers are 
international criminals who deserve no rest or sanctuary she 
said 
but she emphasized that it is the united states alone which 
bears responsibility for its own drug problem i am not blaming 
other nations for americas drug problem while most of the illegal 
drugs are imported the drug users are homegrown 
to get serious about stopping illegal drugs she said there 
can be no substitute for focusing on the user and that means 
confronting all those citizens who use drugs 
we need to educate a generation to just say no to 
drugs mrs reagan said and in the meantime we must continue 
our fight against the production processing financing 
importation sale and use of illegal drugs

if youve ever been robbed says rep al swift 
you know how some west coast voters felt in the last two 
presidential elections when tv networks declared a winner hours 
before their polls closed 
when people are told the election is over before theyve even 
voted it tends to convey that their vote doesnt count said 
swift a washington state democrat 
its like being robbed a combination of feeling violated and 
helpless he said youre angry but you dont know who to 
hit 
for eight years swift and other western politicians have looked 
for someone to hit as they try to put a little suspense back into 
election night for their constituents 
but their battle against the time zone factor has been 
frustrated by congressional inaction court challenges and lack of 
firm evidence that electionnight projections of winners do any 
real harm 
despite their crusade election coverage on network television 
nov 8 promises to differ little from 1980 or 1984 analysts say 
and it may even bring news of the winner george bush or michael 
dukakis in record time 
projections of presidential winners have been made since the 
1964 goldwaterjohnson race they are based on exit polls in which 
voters leaving a balloting place are asked at random how they voted 
and why personal information such as age and sex also is recorded 
the polls and projections have grown steadily in speed and 
accuracy 
in 1980 when ronald reagan scored his unexpected landslide over 
president carter nbc declared reagan the winner at 515 pm 
pacific time or 815 pm on the east coast 
cbs and abc quickly followed suit prompting carter to concede 
publicly more than an hour before california polling booths closed 
at 8 pm 
in 1984 the three major networks had declared reagans victory 
by 530 pm pacific time or 830 pm eastern time 
the 1980 projections infuriated many western politicans and 
voters election observers reported seeing prospective voters step 
out of line after learning of reagans apparent victory democratic 
leaders in the west complained that carters early concession hurt 
their efforts to get voters to the polls in close local races 
but network executives argued then and now that giving the 
early word to western voters is unavoidable in a country spread 
across four time zones or six if alaska and hawaii are counted 
it may be unpalatable for voters in the west but it would be 
unprofessional to have knowledge that we know to be true and not 
give it said robert siegenthaler abc vice president for news 
operations 
legislators in many states rejected that argument and sought to 
restrict exit polling on the ground that its results intimidate 
voters 
nearly half the states have enacted restrictions limiting how 
close exit pollsters may work near balloting areas said floyd 
abrams a network attorney 
he said the three networks filed lawsuits this year in six 
states with the most stringent curbs on exit polling the networks 
said the restrictions violated their first amendment guarantees of 
freedom of speech 
federal judges agreed striking down statutes in washington 
montana georgia and florida last week a judge ruled that 
wyomings exit poll restrictions were unconstitutional abrams said 
he expects a favorable preelection ruling in minnesota 
its unlikely there will be any problems on election day with 
this issue abrams said 
swift said it is up to congress not the states to correct the 
problem 
in 1985 congress extracted a promise from the three networks 
not to project a presidential winner in any state where any polls 
are still open 
network officials said last week they will stick with that 
policy on nov 8 though nbc hedged a little by saying its 
newscasters may characterize statewide elections before the 
polls close 
we dont project a winner until the polls close but we might 
say that soandso is ahead said helen manasian spokeswoman for 
nbcs election coverage 
with the networks limited promise in hand swift urged congress 
to take the next step by ordering all polling booths closed at 9 
pm eastern time in the west that would be achieved by extending 
daylight savings time by two weeks each election year and closing 
polls at 7 pm local time 
swifts bill has passed the house twice but died in the senate 
he said he doesnt know if hell try again 
critics of swifts proposal say that while electionnight 
projections might spoil the surprise for western voters studies 
have failed to show that they discourage significant numbers of 
people from voting 
swift concedes the lack of such evidence but argues that 
westerners may grow disillusioned even though they vote 
the importance of an individuals vote is the basic building 
block of democracy he said when people lose confidence in 
that i think thats dangerous 
but jeff alderman abc director of polling said the networks 
are hardly to blame for voter disillusionment 
we spend a lot of time focusing on the alleged influence of 
polling and coverage in general alderman said but its not 
network televisions job to give people a stake in the election 
its up to the people running and theyre not doing it

president reagan today signed legislation 
creating the department of veterans affairs telling vets they 
deserve a seat at the table of our national affairs 
in signing into law the bill establishing the 14th cabinetlevel 
agency reagan made an electionyear exception to his oftstated 
opposition to expanding the size of federal government 
at the conclusion of a speech to the national defense university 
at fort mcnair in the district of columbia the president said that 
the nations debt to its military men and women does not end the 
day the uniform comes off 
all of those who have served in americas uniform deserve the 
nations thanks he said 
reagan noted that the legislation has been in the works for 13 
years and said that its something that ive been looking 
forward to for a long long time 
this bill gives those who have borne americas battles who 
defended the borders of freedom who protected our nations 
security in war and peace it gives them what they have deserved 
for so long a seat at the table of our national affairs he 
told a crowd that included defense secretary frank c carlucci 
adm william crowe the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and 
congressional sponsors of the bill 
i like to think that this bill gives cabinet rank not just to 
an agency of government but to every single veteran reagan 
said welcome aboard 
throughout his political career reagan has railed against big 
government in washington he has used numerous speeches during 
the current presidential campaign to warn that democrats would 
return the nation to the era of big brother and big 
government 
but neither reagan nor vice president george bush showed any 
such qualms this year about the bill creating a new department of 
veterans affairs the 14th cabinetlevel agency and one devoted to 
pursuing the interests of a select group of individuals 
the house and senate also paid electionyear homage to the 
nations 27 million veterans with both chambers giving easy 
approval to the bill earlier this fall 
in approving the change the house rejected arguments that 
setting up the new department would lead ultimately to increased 
spending and admonitions that it was engaging in an electionyear 
ploy 
supporters of the legislation argued that the veterans 
administration already has the fifthlargest budget among federal 
agencies and merits being put on par with other cabinet departments 
the va serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or 
survivors with a budget of 30 billion it will dispense 14 
billion in income maintenance and 626 million for education and 
rehabilitation assistance this year 
on monday reagan signed legislation with little fanfare 
authorizing the department of defense to close us military 
installations considered unnecessary the president gave that 
politically sensitive issue a much lower profile with his 
signature of the bill noted only in a white house press release 
that bill has the potential of saving the government up to 5 
billion a year as pentagon officials pare down the list of 3800 
us military installations 
it sets up a complicated baseclosing procedure which 
essentially cuts through a thicket of laws enacted by congress in 
the past decade to thwart pentagon efforts to shut down bases

nicaragua diplomats and other officials will 
be denied visas to enter the united states under a proclamation 
signed by president reagan the white house announced today 
the action is another step in the diplomatic conflict between 
the sandinista government and the reagan administration which 
dates back to july 11 when managua expelled us ambassador 
richard melton and seven other diplomats 
the united states retaliated the next day by expelling 
nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann and seven others 
since then the sandinista government has not acted on us 
attempts to replace the expelled us envoy to the central american 
nation 
reagan in his proclamation says he found the unrestricted 
entry of officers and employees of the nicaraguan government 
and the sandinista national liberation front to be detrimental 
to the interests of the united states 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk pointed out that the 
presidential action comes not only in the wake of the july 
explusions but also in light of further restrictions placed on 
us officials in nicaragua 
weve been trying to get our people replaced and we havent 
gotten anywhere popadiuk said 
he noted that on sept 22 the sandinista government required 
that american diplomats based in nicaragua who leave the country 
for whatever reason must wait three weeks before they are allowed 
to reenter nicaragua 
at the time the administration said it would take some type of 
retaliatory action but did not state what it would be 
diplomats already posted to the nicaraguan embassy in washington 
are unaffected by the proclamation officials assigned now or in 
the future to the nicaraguan un mission in new york or the 
mission to the organization of american states in washington are 
also unaffected

millionaire businessman herbert kohl won 
wisconsins democratic senate primary in the face of charges he was 
buying the election with personal wealth a far cry from the 
pennypinching campaigns of william proxmire the man he hopes to 
succeed 
in the most recent general election polling kohl also has been 
leading the republican nominee state senate minority leader susan 
engeleiter but gop officials say she still can win and an 
appearance by president reagan on her behalf has been promised 
before the election 
engeleiter 36 of brookfield would be the first woman 
wisconsin has sent to congress she also would be the younger than 
any current member of the us senate 
whoever wins the battle has ended a tradition of lowcost 
campaigns that proxmire established in his 31 years in washington 
the retirement of proxmire who will turn 73 three days after the 
election also ends an era of statewide personal campaigning that 
spurned the use of paid advertising 
proxmire chairman of the senate banking committee often 
focused on issues of what he saw as government waste during his 
long political career 
kohl 53 of milwaukee already has set a record for election 
spending in wisconsin contributing 384 million of his own money 
to his first try at public office his campaign had raised 428 
million in all through sept 30 
engeleiter had raised 133 million 
proxmire reported spending just 14510 to win reelection in 
1982 down from 17725 in 1976 
kohls personal wealth and his many personal business dealings 
have become an issue in the campaign 
he had an income of 42 million last year according to his 
accountant engeleiter and her husband gerald reported an income 
of 130000 
kohls democratic primary election opponents tried to persuade 
voters he was buying the election and engeleiter has portrayed 
herself as a middleclass candidate in the states political 
mainstream a wisconsin original 
but engeleiters family income is above average for wisconsin 
and kohl lives relatively simply eating breakfast most mornings at 
a workingclass diner in his milwaukee neighborhood 
he has refused political action committee donations and 
campaigned on the theme nobodys senator but yours 
in one wellpublicized campaign controversy engeleiter said 
kohl owned a controlling interest in a san antonio texas bakery 
that did most of its business with the defense department 
kohl said he began selling sterling bakery inc when he decided 
to run for the senate and completed the sale in september 
the issue backfired on engeleiter when she hinted kohl had 
overcharged the pentagon for coffee cake kohl showed the price per 
pound was lower than the charges for a similar cake at the 
supermarket that bears his family name 
he is the former owner of a chain of supermarkets and department 
stores in 1985 after he sold the stores he spent 185 million 
to acquire the milwaukee bucks professional basketball team 
engeleiter contends kohl should make more complete financial 
disclosure but interviews and polls indicate the issue has had 
little effect on voters 
there are basic issues beneath the surface but the dynamics 
seem to be personal said university of wisconsin history 
professor margaret bogue 
state historian william f thompson suggests that voters seem to 
be turned off this election another departure from the past 
wisconsin traditionally has taken politics seriously as 
opposed to cynically thompson said 
kohl led engeleiter 57 percent to 34 percent among likely voters 
surveyed oct 6 and oct 7 by the milwaukee journal but republican 
strategists still contend engeleiter could prevail 
this is a very winnable race said sen alan simpson 
rwyo who came to wisconsin to campaign for engeleiter last week 
still kohls forces seem comfortable with their lead and other 
democrats are counting on kohls coattails to help retain their 
majorities in the legislature 
engeleiter tends to support the national republican ticket and 
party platform on defense and budget issues but is more liberal on 
social issues she supports a womans right to choose abortion 
while the gop platform opposes abortion

the food and drugs administration on tuesday 
approved a new drug for controlling a type of diarrhea that often 
kills patients with intestinal cancer 
fda commissioner frank e young said the new drug called 
octreotide acetate can dramatically improve the life of 
patients with malignant carcinoid tumors and vasoactive intestinal 
peptidesecreting tumors 
these cancers grow slowly and often are not diagnosed until 
after they have spread and become inoperable the malignancies 
themselves often are not fatal for up to 20 years but they cause a 
severe and frequent diarrhea that can cripple and even kill 
young said the new drug will permit many patients with the 
intestinal cancer to live normal lives rather than be weakened 
and continually hospitalized 
for many it will reduce or eliminate the frequent and 
devastating bouts of diarrhea that often require repeated 
hospitalizations for intravenous fluid replacement therapy he 
said 
about one or two people per million in the united states develop 
the intestinal cancer annually the cancer often goes undiagnosed 
for seven or eight years though patients can live with the cancer 
for years it causes heavy secretions of peptides a type of 
protein which triggers severe and unrelenting diarrhea along with 
wheezing heart problems and loss of energy 
the new drug does not attack the cancer but controls secretion 
of the peptides the drug mimics the action of somatostatine a 
naturally occurring hormone that regulates secretions by the organs 
in the body and prevents excess release of the peptides this in 
turn eliminates the cause of the diarrhea 
officials said the drug is administered by injection it was 
developed in the sandoz ltd laboratories in basel switzerland 
and approved by the fda after major clinical trials in this 
country it will be marketed under the name sandostatin 
the fda said that since some patients on the drug developed 
gallstones ultrasonic monitoring of patients is recommended

a proposed amendment to the city 
charter that would ban discrimination against homosexuals has 
pitted conservative clergymen against a coalition of advocates for 
civil liberties and gay rights 
the proposal on the nov 8 ballot would prohibit discrimination 
in jobs housing or public accommodations because of sexual 
orientation 
we believe discrimination is fundamentally wrong it goes 
against the health and wellbeing of our entire community the 
coalition for civil rights a proponent of the amendment said in a 
statement 
opponents argue that antidiscrimination laws should not apply 
to homosexuality because it is a chosen lifestyle others have 
called homosexuality a perversion and have prominently 
mentioned acquired immune deficiency syndrome for which sexually 
active gay men are at high risk 
one minister who opposes the measure has threatened to go on 
radio and television if the amendment is approved and declare that 
the northern colorado city is the place for homosexuals to be 
the rev pete peters said his congregation the laporte church 
of christ has pledged to spend 4000 to defeat the amendment 
last week he began criticizing the proposal in a series of paid 
twohour radio broadcasts on a local station that prompted a flurry 
of angry calls from listeners he also plans to buy time on a local 
cable television 
im going to go on my program and let the homosexuals around 
the nation know that fort collins is the place to come to if the 
amendment is passed said peters 
other clergymen however have spoken out in favor of the 
proposal 
its supporters are conducting a lowkey doortodoor campaign 
and have focused on collecting endorsements from groups such as the 
colorado psychological association the american public health 
association and the national organization for women

several harrahs reno employees have been 
suspended without pay for just saying no to managements order to 
wear a ribbon at work proclaiming themselves drug free 
ronald jeffrey general manager of the club said five or six 
employees were suspended sunday and monday although some workers 
claim the number is closer to a dozen 
the suspensions came because the red ribbons saying the choice 
for me drug free were made part of the resorts dress and the 
employees were out of uniform by refusing to wear the ribbons 
jeffrey said monday 
but attorney david houston who represents four of the suspended 
workers said harrahs reno violated the employees first amendment 
rights by forcing them to wear what amounts to a statement about 
drugs 
the issue is when does the casino recognize the right of 
expression of its own employees not to adopt the position of the 
employer houston said 
houston said he was attempting to negotiate with the casino but 
might file suit 
dennis gallagher general counsel for harrahs reno said the 
suspended employees will have to go through an internal grievance 
proceeding to be reinstated 
more than 50000 ribbons were distributed to schools government 
agencies and businesses in nevada by the governors alliance for a 
drug free nevada in observance of national drug free america week 
which began sunday 
the suspended employees who did not want to be named for fear of 
recrimination said they did not refuse to wear the ribbons because 
they use illegal drugs instead many said they consume alcoholic 
drinks and coffee and smoke cigarettes so it would have been 
hypocritical to say they were drug free 
harrahs reno made the ribbon wearing voluntary monday afternoon 
after officials said they ran out of ribbons

the suicides of 14 cobb county teenagers in a 
25month period has triggered a study on teen suicide by the centers 
for disease control and the county health department 
dr virginia mork deputy director of the cobb county department 
of health said the goal of the effort is to produce the first 
detailed study of suicide based on interviews with those who survive 
attempts to kill themselves 
weve got this glaring problem of people killing themselves we 
want to know why she said who are they what are they like 
are their parents middleclass how old are they if they are in 
school what school do they go to what method do they choose 
the study now encompassing 441 case studies of all ages 
indicates at least 900 people may attempt suicide in cobb county 
every year the county which borders northwest atlanta has about 
300000 residents 
fourteen adolescents 19 or younger killed themselves in cobb 
county from september 1986 to october 1988 the countys suicide 
rate 147 deaths for every 100000 people is almost three deaths 
higher than the state average and almost two higher than the 
national average 
dr patrick ocarroll of the atlantabased cdc said the cobb 
study may offer insights into the rising number of suicides 
researchers eventually want to study 1000 cases interviews with 
441 patients between october 1987 and october 1988 show 
only 38 of the 441 who attempted suicide took precautions to 
avoid rescue a much smaller proportion than those who succeed in 
committing suicide 
more than 240 of the 441 took drug overdoses while few who 
succeed in committing suicide take drugs most use guns or hang 
themselves 
more than 60 percent were women but women constituted only 
onethird of those who succeed 
about 254 of the 441 expressed an intent to commit suicide 
either in a note or conversation 
according to the national center for health statistics suicide 
rates are climbing for teens and adults the overall national rate 
has risen from 119 suicides for every 100000 people in 1980 to 
128 in 1986 the death toll has risen from 26869 to 30904 during 
the same sixyear period

education secretary lauro cavazos said tuesday 
he sees his brief fourmonth tenure as a platform to speak out on 
the need for getting dropouts back in school and educating the 
illiterate the handicapped and the dyslexic 
the basic question is how do you position america so it can 
deal with the issue and how you bring it about we must educate 
every person to their fullest potential cavazos told the hispanic 
news media association of washington 
cavazos says hes been asked why he would leave his job as a 
university president to take on the complexities and challenges of 
education secretary when its for just a few months sworn in sept 
20 cavazos is the first hispanic member of a presidents cabinet 
and serves until jan 20 unless renominated by the next president 
i see it as an opportunity a platform so to speak as you 
folks in washington call it a window of opportunity to say 
something to give some leadership to the things ive been saying 
all along as a university president said cavazos who is on leave 
from texas tech university 
in his first speech after taking over as president of the lubbock 
university in 1980 cavazos said he used the occasion to talk about 
the dropout rate especially among hispanics in texas he said 45 
percent of hispanic students drop out before finishing high school 
while the rate for blacks is 32 percent and for anglos 30 
i learned long ago that people dont necessarily listen to a 
university president and im not sure they listen to secretaries of 
education but were going to speak up he said 
principal issues he said include helping the highly motivated 
student excel and move ahead getting the dropouts back in school 
and into the mainstream of society teaching the illiterate how to 
read educating the handicapped to their fullest level of 
independence and helping the dyslexic overcome their learning 
disability 
that is the agenda of america that you educate everyone to 
their fullest potential he said 
if one person drops out were all the poorer for that 
reason he said 
he said he hopes to position the department of education to 
start thinking about these issues to start thinking about the 
future where do you want this place to go so regardless of who is 
secretary of education the agenda is pretty well laid out

the air force will roll out its b2 stealth 
bomber on nov 22 at a governmentowned plant in palmdale calif 
the pentagon said tuesday 
defense department spokesman dan howard said he wouldnt be a 
bit surprised if the air force limited the guest list for the 
ceremony as well as the aspects or viewing angles from which 
the new plane was viewed 
some aspects of the technology are still highly classified he 
indicated 
howard said the air force had not set a date for the planes 
first flight but that milestone is expected to occur not long after 
the public unveiling 
the air force and pentagon have previously released an artists 
drawing of the plane showing it resembles a huge flying wing 
without a normal fuselage and cockpit the bomber takes its 
stealth nickname from the fact that its design and materials are 
intended to keep it from being visible to radar 
howard said he did not expect defense secretary frank c carlucci 
to attend the rollout ceremony because the secretary has already 
seen the plane on the assembly line the plane is manufactured by 
northrop corp

soviet icebreakers today neared two whales 
trapped in the high arctic as rescuers prepared operation 
breakthrough a goforbroke attempt to smash through an ice wall 
blocking the animals path to open seas 
the vessels were reported about 20 miles northeast of point 
barrow before first light in barrow about noon edt said coast 
guard spokesman ken freeze in alameda calif a helicopter was being 
prepared to take representatives of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration and the coast guard to the ship along 
with an interpreter freeze said 
the soviet news agency tass in a dispatch from moscow said the 
larger of the two icrebreakers the admiral makarov had been slowed 
by heavy ice and by fog which rduced visibility to less than 200 
yards 
meanwhile ice experts were trying to find a way through the 
pressure ridge and rescuers were trying to coax the whales over a 
shoal between them and ridge the whales retreated from the shoal 
monday 
anticipating the imminent arrival of two soviet icebreakers the 
ice specialists were taking soundings monday of the water depth on 
either side of the ridge a jumbled mass of ice chunks about 200 
yards wide and some 30 feet high 
the skipper of a us coast guard icebreaker assigned to act as 
liaison with the soviets and a national weather service analyst were 
among those looking for a place where the icebreaker could punch 
through the ridge 
the california gray whales must get through the icy tangle if 
they are to reach an open lead or pathway through the ice 
the whales stranded about 100 yards offshore more than two weeks 
ago by shifting ice about 13 miles northeast of barrow were about 
four miles from the ice ridge a third whale disappeared friday and 
is presumed dead 
its discouraging federal biologist david withrow said 
monday as the mammals apparently spooked by a shoal that has 
stymied progress for three days retreated about 800 yards why 
come back here when they know its open up there 
the california gray whales struggled up for air tiring quickly 
as they poked their way through large slabs of beaufort sea ice and 
thick slush left by efforts to carve them a path to freedom 
at one point the 27footlong whale the smaller of the two 
rested the end of its huge snout on the edge of the ice blood oozed 
from a raw spot on its snout smearing the ice and staining the 
water 
biologists called a temporary halt to opening new breathing holes 
so the whales would have a chance to rest and perhaps seek the open 
water on their own 
rescue coordinator ron morris of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration remained optimistic 
they always regress some before they learn morris said of 
the whales theyll move 
meanwhile specialists determined through soundings that there is 
about 40 feet of water beneath the pressure ridge a jumbled mass of 
ice chunks about 30 feet high and as wide as two football fields 
there is a lot of water flowing beneath the ridge which should 
mean it will be easier for the soviet icebreakers to break 
through than had been expected morris said 
the icebreakers admiral makarov and vladimir arseniev were 
expected to arrive this morning the soviet help was requested by 
the us government and the environmental group greenpeace 
the whales must make their way through the ridge if they are to 
reach a lead or pathway through the ice the nearest open water is 
200 miles away in the chukchi sea 
breaching the ridge wont do any good if the whales cant be 
coaxed past the shoal the animals stranded about 100 yards 
offshore more than two weeks ago by shifting ice 13 miles northeast 
of barrow were four miles from the ridge a third whale which 
disappeared friday is presumed dead 
a shift in tactics monday proved disappointing 
eskimos connected a series of breathing holes to form a single 
open channel about 600 yards long instead of pushing the broken ice 
back under the ice sheet they used long poles to guide it toward 
the rear of the slot 
the idea was to keep the whales from heading back initially it 
worked the whales swam back and forth between the shoals edge and 
the rear of the channel 
but when the channel behind them was nearly filled the whales 
turned back 
about 12 feet of water lies over the 125yardwide shoal said 
biologist geoff carroll the whales have been spending most of the 
time in water 17 to 25 feet deep 
as it gets shallower it feels to the whales like theyre 
beaching themselves said jim harvey a biologist from the 
national marine mammal laboratory in seattle 
officials hope at least one of the soviet icebreakers can breach 
the ridge said rear adm sigmund r petersen director of noaas 
marine mammal laboratory in seattle 
charts indicate the water at the ridge is about 30 feet deep and 
the 443footlong admiral makarov needs about 35 feet to operate 
petersen said the smaller vladimir arseniev needs about 22 feet 
it does seem that the makorov would have more trouble doing 
this he said but they may be able to assist each other im 
sure that these vessels which have operated in the arctic for 
years have all kinds of solutions to these things 
biologists have a lastditch option airlifting the whales to 
open water withrow emphasized that would be a last resort because 
the whales could be injured or traumatized 
although rescuers said they were committed to freeing the whales 
the cost of the effort continues to mount 
most of those involved in the attempt seem reluctant to talk 
about the tab but it appears substantial at least 600000 by late 
monday

orders to factories for big ticket durable 
goods dropped 41 percent in september pulled down by sharp 
declines in the volatile defense and transportation sectors the 
government said today 
the commerce department said total orders fell 50 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 1177 billion last month the steep decline 
follows a big 57 percent increase in august and a 74 percent drop 
in july the worst monthly decline in four years 
the durable goods total which includes manufactured goods 
ranging from household appliances to huge airliners has been 
buffeted up and down in recent months by wide swings in orders for 
aircraft ships and tanks affecting both the transportation and 
military sectors 
orders for transportation equipment in september were down 102 
percent to 312 billion following an 186 percent jump in august 
and a 225 percent plummet in july aircraft and shipbuilding pulled 
the category down last month 
orders for defense goods fell 123 percent to 70 billion last 
month following a 147 percent rise in august and a 494 percent 
drop in july 
excluding defense orders fell 35 percent in september rose 51 
percent in august and fell 22 percent in july excluding 
transportation orders were down 17 percent last month following a 
13 percent rise and a 10 percent fall 
however the weakness was widespread in september electrical 
machinery was down 41 percent the second consecutive monthly 
decline while nonelectrical machinery dropped 75 percent 
the key category of nondefense capital goods considered a good 
barometer for business expansion plans fell 119 percent to 341 
billion the steepest retreat since january 1986 but it followed 
increases of 69 percent in august and 21 percent a month before 
that 
the widespread weakness fits in with economists view that the 
momentum of economic growth slowed as the third quarter was ending 
manufacturing driven by strong export sales has been one of the 
strongest sectors of the economy this year analysts disagree over 
whether the slowing in the third quarter represents the beginning of 
a decline or a temporary pause 
the only area of strength in september was in primary metals 
which includes steel it rose 65 percent following declines of 20 
percent in august and 14 percent in july 
shipments of durable goods fell 08 percent last month to 1169 
billion following a 42 percent rise in august

this year the hall of fame also will honor three early 
influences on rock n roll the blues singer bessie smith the 
vocal quartet the ink spots and the gospel group the soul stirrers 
of which the late sam cooke himself an icon of soul music was 
once a member 
phil spector who had a brief career as a performer but is more 
famous as a writer producer and arranger also is being inducted 
in a nonperforming category 
the annoucement of the latest inductees to the rock industrys 
honor roll was made this week by atlantic records ahmet ertegun 
who is chairman of the rock and roll hall of fame foundation 
induction ceremonies are planned in new york for jan 18 
more than 150 performers producers writers record executives 
and broadcasters voted on nominees on the basis of contributions to 
or influence on the course of rock n roll all nominees released 
records on or before 1963 
a permanent archive and museum for the rock and roll hall of fame 
will be built in cleveland 
the rolling stones the bad boys of the british rock 
invasion started out by recording american blues and soul in the 
early 1960s before turning to original compositions by mick jagger 
and keith richards 
the temptations formed in 1961 became a top motown records 
group in the 60s starting its long string of single and album hits 
with such smokey robinson songs as my girl 
songwritersingerproducer stevie wonder born steveland morris 
hardaway was brought to motown at 12 and billed as little stevie 
wonder he had his first hit fingertips a year later he

the government reported monday that orders for 
big ticket durable goods plunged 41 percent in september but 
economists are reluctant to conclude that the redhot manufacturing 
boom is ending 
the commerce department said total orders fell 50 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 1177 billion last month pulled down by 
dramatic declines in the volatile defense and transportation sectors 
other categories including machinery computers and capital 
goods purchased by businesses also fell 
the latest report fits in with other signs of a slowdown last 
month including the second consecutive decline in retail sales and 
a drop in manufacturing employment 
but analysts said it was too soon to declare that manufacturing 
which has driven robust economic growth this year is slowing 
significantly 
a boom in export sales fueled by the lower value of the dollar 
has kept factories humming manufacturers in turn have invested 
heavily to expand the capacity of their plants spurring the fastest 
growth in capital spending since 1984 
there are some cautionary notes in this report but even so the 
economy is still very strong the manufacturing sector isnt 
faltering just because orders went down one month said bruce 
steinberg an economist with merrill lynch in new york 
he noted that unusually wide swings in orders for both 
transportation equipment and military goods have pushed the overall 
orders number up and down over the last four months 
durable goods items expected to last three or more years 
include a wide range of manufactured items from refrigerators and 
other household appliances to large computers and battleships 
orders had jumped 57 percent in august plummeted 74 percent in 
july and soared 87 percent in june 
orders for transportation equipment in september were down 102 
percent following an 186 percent jump in august while orders for 
defense goods fell 123 percent last month following a 147 percent 
rise 
excluding defense orders fell 35 percent in september 
excluding transportation orders were down 17 percent 
the key category of nondefense capital goods considered a good 
barometer for business expansion plans fell 119 percent it was 
the first decline since may and the steepest retreat since january 
1986 
james annable an economist with first national bank of chicago 
said the decline in capital goods orders was disquieting because 
it suggests a weakening in the primary engine of economic growth 
however he said manufacturing profits are high and factories are 
using a high percentage of their capacity suggesting that capital 
goods orders will rebound in the months ahead 
electrical machinery also fell in september by 41 percent the 
second consecutive monthly decline while nonelectrical machinery 
dropped 75 percent 
the only area of strength in september was in primary metals 
which includes steel it rose 65 percent following declines of 20 
percent in august and 14 percent in july 
shipments of durable goods fell 08 percent in september to 
1169 billion following a 42 percent increase in august the 
backlog of unfilled orders expanded by a modest 02 percent to 
4319 billion last month after three strong gains from june through 
august 
in a separate report tuesday the national association of 
realtors said sales of existing singlefamily homes fell 22 percent 
in september it was only the second decline since january

teaching the three rs reading riting and 
rithmetic is still the most important goal for high school 
educators according to a survey released tuesday that also shows 
teachers increasingly are concerned about gangs and crowded 
classrooms 
there has been a tremendous increase in concern about basic 
skills and states are now testing like they never have before 
said leonard o pellicer of the university of south carolina who 
compiled the study for the national association of secondary school 
principals 
in my own view americans in general feel the schools have 
not done a good enough job in basic skills to prepare their 
children to function as literate members of society pellicer 
told a news conference 
the report titled high school leaders and their schools 
summarizes the organizations 1987 survey of 1225 high school 
principals and assistant principals in 1544 schools it is a 
followup to similar surveys in 1965 and 1977 
the study indicated that the top three goals of school officials 
teaching students basic skills helping them develop positive 
selfimages and furthering intellectual inquiry and problem solving 
skills remained the same as in the 1977 survey 
teaching basic skills also was the top priority in 1965 but that 
year the second and third top objectives were respectively 
promoting development of moral and spiritual values and promoting 
an understanding of the american system 
todays high school principals also see a greater need to prepare 
american youth for a changing world a goal that was fourth in 
the latest survey up from eighth in 1977 
the other goals identified in the new survey were in order 
promoting development of moral and spiritual values providing 
career planning and training in special entrylevel job skills 
promoting understanding of the american value system teaching 
skills needed in a technological society teaching skills for family 
life promoting physical fitness and offering exposure to the fine 
arts 
when asked which of 27 conditions would have an impact on their 
schools in the next five years almost half 49 percent said gang 
activity would have a strong influence followed by 39 percent who 
listed increases in enrollment and 37 percent who identified youth 
unemployment 
this finding was a surprise to pellicer and association executive 
director scott thomson who noted that gang activity listed well 
above drug 17 percent and alcohol abuse 20 percent 
the only interpretation i can have on that is they might see 
the drug scene evolving into more of a gang scene thomson said 
noting conversations with principals in urban areas not known for 
gang activity 
thomson said he also was surprised that despite slight salary 
increases in the last decade the overwhelming majority 89 percent 
of those questioned said they received the most job satisfaction 
from their ability to help others 
asked to rate a list of skills and characteristics needed by 
teachers the administrators ranked the top five as competence in 
subject matter adjusting instruction to students interpersonal 
skills with students competence in methods and skill in developing 
positive student selfimages 
results of the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four 
percentage points

president mauno koivisto urged patience 
for those seeking speedy reforms in the baltic states of the soviet 
union newspapers reported tuesday 
koivisto speaking to reporters monday night refrained from 
clearly supporting baltic groups which have demanded economic 
freedom from moscow a revival of local languages and cultures and 
a halt to immigration by ethnic russians 
what qualifications have we who are warm and on dry land to 
advise others what they should do it is best to exercise 
patience koivisto was quoted as saying by the ilta sanomat daily 
koivisto in an earlier television interview was even more 
cautious about developments in the baltic republic of estonia across 
the gulf of finland 
finland has an official foreign policy concerning states not 
popular fronts or civic groups he said 
he denied any need for a finnish consulate in estonia 
neighboring sweden reportedly has been considering opening an 
estonian consulate 
finland traditionally has close but wary ties with the soviet 
union which occupied parts of finland during world war ii 
but the finns also have an affinity for estonia which is 50 
miles across the gulf and has a similar in language finnish

if all else fails and rescuers scrambling 
to free two gray whales trapped by arctic ice are forced to airlift 
the mammals to freedom a california company is ready to fashion a 
custom sling 
were on call said john ortega of ortega sail and canvas in 
carlsbad calif ive already picked up the fabric im ready to 
go as soon as they call us 
dan leblanc spokesman for sea world of san diego said the 
national marine fisheries service contacted the marine life park 
seeking someone who could make a sling for an airlift 
dr marilyn dahlheim an oceanographer with the nmfs national 
marine mammal laboratory in seattle said her office sought advice 
from sea world because the marine life park has used such slings and 
had the appropriate contacts to locate a manufacturer it 
recommended ortega 
the ok has not been given to start cutting the material she 
said we need people who have done this before and they are 
the experts you dont reinvent the wheel when you dont have to 
national oceanic and atmospheric administraiton biologists have 
said hauling the trapped whales to open water would be a last 
alternative because of the danger of harming the whales 
ortega with 22 years experience in custom sewing and 
manufacturing said he already has designed a sling for the alaska 
whales 
its going to be flat more like a rectangle its not going to 
be real exotic because we dont have time to cut holes out for 
fins he said its going to a large flat sling about 30 feet 
long reinforced with metal rods its got to hold 12 tons 
normally i cut in fin holes but this a different kind of mammal 
he said the finished product would look like a large stretcher 
with various holes for the helicopter to pick up the sling 
ive never made one this large before the whales that sea 
world picks up are about 20 feet these whales are longer ortega 
said he has made slings for sea world for about 10 years 
he said he would donate his time and labor if the sling is 
ordered and that it would take him and a crew of six to eight 
workers about 10 hours to fashion the sling out of ballistic nylon 
and webbing sea world is paying for the fabric 
leblanc said rescue workers have talked in general terms with sea 
world about a possible airlift 
at the least well consult from here and at the most well 
go up and do what we can leblanc said

a year after rep floyd spence nearly died 
of breathing problems a rare transplant has given him new lungs and 
a renewed shot for a 10th term in congress 
five months after he underwent the doublelung transplant 
however spences health remains a central issue in his reelection 
campaign 
the 60yearold lexington republican faces a challenge from 
columbia banker jim leventis and has recently begun to step up his 
campaigning 
spences surgeon and colleagues say the congressman has made a 
strong recovery from the sometimesfatal operation 
for six months while he waited for a lung transplant after being 
diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung disease spence moved about 
in a wheelchair aided by portable oxygen others worried about his 
future 
before his operation he was having trouble breathing said 
chuck fant spokesman for rep john spratt dsc who serves with 
spence on the armed services committee it was pretty obvious he 
was having trouble speaking he was wheezing and coughing a lot and 
he looked bad 
in may the wait ended and doctors at the university of 
mississippi medical center successfully transplanted the lungs of an 
18yearold texas motorcycle accident victim into spence 
spence spent the next few months learning to walk and to hold his 
head erect again before being released july 15 
his surgeon dr seshadri raju of the university of mississippi 
said spence has successfully passed the dangerous three months 
immediately after surgery and should now be ok 
right now he is brand new right now i think he has the outlook 
of any 60yearold who is healthy raju said 
the mississippi hospital where spence received his new lungs had 
performed only three doublelung transplants before spence two of 
the three patients have died 
since spence two more have had the operation one of whom died 
and the other remains hospitalized spokeswoman janis quinn said 
spence said he feels fine although he admitted to some tiredness 
and swelling in his ankles that at times inhibits walking the 
swelling is a sideeffect of the antirejection medicine he takes 
but he said he maintains a 12hour work day uses weights for 
strength in his upper body and tries to walk the quartermile from 
his office to the capitol to increase his fitness 
its just amazing that i have accommodated myself my body has 
to these new lungs like it has he said of course ive got 
some tightness in my chest because ive got wire in it and 
everything else he said 
since spence returned to congress sept 14 those familiar with 
him say theyve seen a dramatic change 
i dont think theres any problem about his health at all 
said us rep charles bennett dflorida who chairs a house armed 
services subcommittee on which spence is the ranking republican 
there are lots of people in congress weaker than he 
but indirectly leventis has raised the issue of spences 
ability to perform his duties 
earlier this month leventis released a letter in which spences 
former doctor urged the congressman to answer leventis call for a 
debate 
a spence spokesman accused dr robert k moxon of playing fast 
and loose with the hippocratic oath but moxon denied any 
impropriety 
his health has been a public issue and it sounds like theyre 
hiding behind it he said 
a poll of 515 district voters conducted by the state newspaper of 
columbia recently found only 30 percent thought health should be an 
issue in the campaign the poll was conducted oct 1012 and 
contained a 43 percent margin of error 
that same poll found voters preferring spence 52 percent to 42 
percent over leventis 
leventis has never directly said spence is unable to represent 
the district he said health should never be a standard by which 
public officials are elected 
thats for him to judge leventis said of spence he says 
hes fine and i accept that 
spence though has accused leventis of less than honorable 
intentions in entering the race which leventis denies 
im sure this one thought i was dead or going to die he said 
after the transplant but i was still wiggling out there

wildlife officials combed pelican island 
on tuesday for clues to a mysterious malady that has killed more 
than 100 brown pelicans and left scores of others blinded and 
weakened 
state biologists speculated that a larval parasite that attacks 
the birds eyes and head had spread among the large population on 
this small island in the halifax river south of daytona beach 
among the dead or dying birds in the mangroves on the 
400yardlong island were several snowy egrets 
carcasses of some dead pelicans and several sickened birds 
including a snowy egret were being studied at the veterinary 
hospital at the university of florida in gainesville officials 
there said it could take days or weeks to determine a cause 
veterinarians and animal specialists were stunned by the deaths 
its almost like a leprosy said carol swain a wildlife 
rehabilitator its eating away rotting their skulls the bone 
was almost exposed 
nobodys ever seen it like this said michele yown a marine 
patrol officer 
in efforts to prevent spread of the disease swain and colleagues 
gave lethal injections to 38 blinded birds which were then 
cremated on monday 
the sick birds are lethargic and easy to catch 
you can walk right up to them said swain if you can catch 
it a bird theres something wrong with it 
lt vernon hitt of the florida game and fresh water fish 
commission said the birds become disoriented losing their ability 
to fly or walk well other game officials said the birds did not 
appear to have been poisoned and they did not believe pollution was 
to blame 
no similar problems were found on neighboring small islands most 
of which are made from dredge material like pelican island 
paul minshew assistant director of environmental health for the 
volusia county health department said it was unlikely that the 
birds disease can spread to humans 
ive never heard any reports of diseases that go from pelicans 
or snowy egrets to humans he said it appears to be very 
specific to the two species 
the brown pelican was removed from the endangeredspecies list 
along the atlantic coast in 1985 when the population swelled 
according to the us fish and wildlife service 
donald forrester a university of florida veterinarian said 
pelicans occasionally die in large numbers around the state 
one of three things is usually to blame forrester said blood in 
the intestines starvation or an abnormally high number of stomach 
worms that result when pelicans change their diet from one species 
of fish to another 
he declined to speculate about the deadly malady on pelican 
island

investigators detained 37 people tuesday for 
questioning in the arson attack on a left bank theater showing 
martin scorseses last temptation of christ police sources 
said all but seven later were released 
the fire was the latest event in a campaign of violence aimed at 
scaring spectators and driving the movie out of french cinemas 
interior minister pierre joxe called the violence reminiscent of 
the worst moments of the inquisition 
thirteen people were injured in the saturday night blaze at the 
st michel theater 
police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
arrests came after early morning raids in the homes of people 
connected to an extremeright milieu police released all but 
seven of those arrested thursday night 
they said seven people remained in custody did not elaborate 
they were not immediately charged and their names were not 
disclosed under french law they can be held for questioning for 48 
hours 
several hundred people including government officials religious 
leaders and film directors demonstrated in support of the film 
monday in front of the damaged cinema 
the film opened in 17 paris theaters on sept 28 but remains in 
only one city cinema a spokeswoman at uip the french distributor 
said the film had been running in about 30 cities before the weekend 
attack but only 10 afterward 
moviegoers have encountered fires stink bombs firebombs and 
tear gas 
we must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by such acts 
said culture minister jack lang 
roman catholic bishops have criticized the film but refused to 
participate in public demonstrations saying they did not support 
censorship 
traditionalist roman catholic groups however have staged 
protests and urged the government to ban the movie some of those 
groups are linked to extremeright politicians 
interior minister joxe called those responsible for the fire 
crazy fundamentalists 
several public protests to the film have been led by supporters 
of abbot philippe laguerie head of the st nicolas du chardonnet 
parish a stronghold of traditionalist roman catholic followers of 
rebel archbishop marcel lefebvre 
laguerie condemned the cinema fire but said in a sermon sunday 
that scorseses blasphemous and ignominious film was to blame 
authorities also have been criticized for not doing enough to 
prevent the violence 
in lyon protesters threw tear gas at moviegoers waiting to buy 
tickets and assaulted the cashier and projectionist 
in nice street fighting broke out between spectators and 
protesters theaters were vandalized in grenoble and one in besancon 
was destroyed by a firebomb a paris theater near the opera was also 
badly damaged by fire 
attendance throughout france plummeted and many theaters replaced 
last temptation with other movies 
the violence definitely scared off many people said 
dominique dumont the manager of the quatorze juilletbastille 
theater which ran the film for two weeks 
dumont said he searched spectators and turned away nearly a dozen 
people carrying tear gas canisters 
roman catholic church officials advised against seeing the movie 
which portrays jesus christ as having human passions including a 
dream sequence in which he makes love with prostitute mary magdalene

the soviet union is seeking a deal with the 
philippines to allow repair of soviet military vessels at a shipyard 
adjacent to the strategic us naval base at subic bay government 
officials say 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman said tuesday the 
united states would not look favorably on any such arrangement 
because of the opportunities it might afford the soviets to spy on 
our activities at subic bay 
the philippine government is well aware of our feelings on 
that he said 
at the same time howard said he could not confirm that 
negotiations between the filipinos and the soviets were taking place 
there were conflicting reports tuesday about the status of the 
reported soviet request one official said a deal between the two 
countries had already been signed while another that the 
philippines was tempted by the offer but had made no decision a 
third official said there was considerable confusion about the 
intentions of both the soviets and the philippines all the 
officials asked that their names not be used 
the philippines has rejected previous soviet requests for access 
to the philseco repair yard but economic and political factors 
appear to be prompting it to reassess that position the officials 
said 
the philseco yard a joint venture between philippine and 
japanese interests has been losing money in addition the new 
soviet proposal comes at a time when many filipinos are seeking a 
relationship more independent of the united states 
but the officials said close soviet access to subic bay would not 
only be an intelligencegathering bonus for moscow but would also 
enable soviet vessels to remain longer in the region thus enhancing 
the soviets military capability the officials said 
the desire for ship repair facilities apparently reflects a major 
soviet military buildup in the pacific in recent years according to 
the pentagon the kremlin has increased the number of ships and 
submarines in its pacific fleet by 40 vessels to a total of 860 
since the end of 1984 
approval of the soviet proposal also would be seen as further 
evidence of the philippines desire to dissociate itself from the 
united states a more independent filipino stance was apparent 
during recent base negotiations with the united states which 
frequently were marked by bitter acrimony 
a week ago the two countries signed an agreement to provide the 
philippines with 962 million in military and economic aid over the 
next two years in exchange for continued us access to subic and to 
clark air base they are the largest us military installations 
overseas 
as a reflection of the continuing strain in relations both the 
philippines and the united states have left open the possibility 
that their 1947 base agreement will not be renewed when it expires 
in 1991 
reaction in the philippines to the aid agreement has been 
hostile partly because filipino negotiators backed away from their 
original demand for more than 1 billion annually in assistance 
still the 481 million in annual aid agreed to for 1990 and 1991 
represented a sharp increase from the 180 million the united states 
had been pledging since 1983 
as us officials see it philippine president corazon aquino 
could seek to placate opposition to the aid agreement by approving 
the soviet request for a ship repair deal at philseco

launch of the hubble space telescope a 
powerful instrument that is expected to collect the clearest views 
yet of the universe will be moved up from february 1990 to december 
1989 space agency officials said tuesday 
the change came as a result of a reassessment of the space 
shuttle launch schedule according to a national aeronautics and 
space administration announcement 
however dwayne brown a nasa spokesman said plans call for a 
defense department shuttle flight that had been set for december 
1989 to switch places in the flight schedule with the hubble 
launch enabling the telescope to get into space two months earlier 
than previously planned 
experts believe the telescope will be able to study stars and 
galaxies more than 14 billion light years from earth and to capture 
images of the universe that are much clearer than those seen by 
groundbased telescopes 
nasa originally planned to the launch the hubble in 1985 but the 
date slipped to the fall of 1986 and then was delayed because of the 
january 1986 explosion of the space shuttle challenger 
the original development costs of the hubble were estimated at 
435 million but due to delays and other problems the costs through 
june 1989 are now estimated at 15 billion 
a space shuttle will carry the telescope into an orbit about 360 
miles above the earth this will put it far above the atmosphere 
that often obscures the view of groundbased telescopes 
the space telescope is designed to transmit its observations to 
earth for about three years a shuttle then would visit the 
observatory to replace batteries and to make repairs if needed the 
telescope also would be boosted into a higher orbit as needed to 
keep it from falling to earth with regular maintenance the hubble 
is designed to operate for at least 15 years

archaeologists digging on the south slope of 
mount zion believe they have found the gate through which jesus left 
jerusalem after the last supper a project leader said tuesday 
volunteer researchers and students found what they believe to be 
remnants of the gate last summer while excavating a site along the 
walls of jerusalems old city 
this is more evidence that we are standing on the cradle of 
christianity the rev bargil pixner codirector of the project 
said during a tour of the site it is an incredible find 
ancient coins and pottery scattered near the gate prove the ruins 
date to the time of christ said archaeologist doron chen of hebrew 
university 
members of the team said they found the gates remains a broken 
support column and stone blocks that formed an arch in a maze of 
walls and towers dating as far back as 700 bc 
chen said the gate buried beneath more than 12 feet of dirt and 
rock was built in 37 bc and destroyed about 100 years later when 
the romans conquered jerusalem again 
pixner a priest at the benedictine abbey of dormition said the 
dating and the location on the southern edge of mount zion match 
biblical accounts of the last supper 
it can safely be presumed that jesus used this gate on his way 
to and from the last supper he said pointing to the spot about 
800 feet farther up mount zion where christians believe jesus met 
the apostles 
everything weve found indicates that this is the place 
pixner declared 
the bibles account of the last supper says jesus was staying in 
nearby bethany and told the apostles to go to jerusalem where a man 
carrying a water pitcher would lead them to their meeting place 
pixner said he believes jesus and the apostles gathered at a 
guest house near where the excavators found the remnants of the 
gate which he described as about 10 feet wide and 1520 feet high 
they have named it the gate of essene after a small jewish religious 
community believed to have lived in the area 
two british archaeologists found the wall adjacent to the gate 
while tunneling about 100 years ago but did not find the gate chen 
said 
pixner said the dormition abbey which raised about 80000 in 
private donations for the dig plans to open the site to visitors 
when studies of it are complete

the farmers home administration will begin 
sending out notices shortly after the nov 8 election in an effort 
to collect 88 billion in pastdue loans the agriculture 
department agency said tuesday 
spokesman marlyn aycock said rules implementing new credit 
legislation will take effect nov 14 and that dear farmer jones 
notices will start going out soon thereafter to an estimated 90000 
delinquent fmha borrowers 
aycock said the notices will say this is to inform you that 
youre seriously behind in your loan payments and to inform you of 
your options farmers who are more than 180 days late in making 
payments have several options 
the notices will explain that the fmha borrowers must notify the 
agency within 45 days if they intend to apply to make arrangements 
for settling their debts details regarding the options including 
debt restructuring and writeoffs also will be provided 
congress ordered fmha to revise its lending practices in the 
agricultural credit act of 1987 the agency often is called the farm 
lender of last resort because it makes loans only to those who 
cannot qualify at banks or other commercial sources 
the debt writedown or forgiveness provision is regarded as one 
of the most important parts of the 1987 law it allows fmha to 
reduce a farmers delinquent debt to the recovery value of the 
collateral which is usually land or farm equipment depending on 
cash flow and other factors 
also as the result of lawsuits the fmha is under court order to 
redo many of its loan regulations and to delay foreclosures and 
forced liquidations until those actions are completed 
estimates of the extent of fmha loan delinquencies and numbers of 
farmers potentially threatened by foreclosure under the new rules 
have varied 
last may 23 when the new regulations were proposed fmha losses 
resulting from writeoffs and other settlements were estimated at 
about 87 billion and that about 118000 borrowers were delinquent 
about 64800 of those could be pushed into liquidation or 
foreclosure because they couldnt qualify for help under the new law 
another major step was an interim rule announced on sept 14 
including procedures for making debt restructuring and writedowns 
those were to take effect on oct 14 on an interim basis and called 
for final adoption on nov 14 after a 60day period for public 
comments 
in the september announcement the earlier analysis was used 
again it referred to 118000 delinquent borrowers including about 
65000 who would be rejected for debt writedowns the potential 
losses were said to be as high as 94 billion although about 1 
billion could be salvaged by the agency 
aycock said the current estimate of 90000 delinquent borrowers 
was based on figures last fall when fmha delinquencies usually are 
lower than those in january when the 118000 were reported

opposition leader kim daejung on 
tuesday urged president roh taewoo to accelerate reforms and 
recover fortunes allegedly amassed by a former leader 
kim who addressed the national assembly as head of south koreas 
main opposition party also proposed changes in relations with the 
united states that would give south korea more independence and 
check antius sentiment 
the leader of the party for peace and democracy said the time had 
come to open sincere discussions about the strict enforcement of 
jurisdiction over us troops nuclear weapons and the transfer of 
us commandership over south korean troops 
under treaties signed during the 195053 korean war south korea 
has no jurisdiction over us soldiers stationed in the country 
at the hankook university of foreign studies about 100 students 
armed with firebombs and rocks battled riot police on tuesday 
demanding the withdrawl of about 42000 us troops stationed in 
south korea 
also on tuesday about 40 students staged a peaceful antius 
protest in front of the us embassy 
a majority of south koreans support the presence of us troops 
but dissidents contend the united states has hampered reunification 
of the divided peninsula 
kim attributed the growing antiamericanism to nationalism 
brought by rapid political and economic changes as well as the 
countrys pride as the host of the olympics 
the opposition leader urged roh to take a courageous stand 
against former president chun doohwan whom opponents accuse of 
amassing wealth through corruption 
during a parliamentary investigation of state affairs that began 
oct 5 opposition lawmakers found evidence of widespread 
corruption irregularities and violation of human rights by chun and 
his followers 
kim charged chun and his family with amassing hundreds of 
millions of dollars during his seven years in office and demanded 
the money be returned to help the poor 
kim also called for an end to alleged wiretapping torture and 
political surveillance of students and dissidents by police and 
other security organs 
roh a former general who succeeded chun in february is gaining 
popularity with his proposed reforms and efforts to improve 
relations with east bloc nations some of whom have exchanged trade 
offices with south korea 
dissidents and radical students have vowed to launch a nationwide 
campaign next week to press for the arrest of chun and his family

sen dan quayle on tuesday defended 
gop presidential nominee george bushs campaign against charges of 
distortion and lying and he said the democrats were the ones 
dishing political sludge 
his remarks on a campaign swing through georgia came about a week 
after democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis called gop 
campaign literature political garbage 
quayle said george bush was a 25year public servant who has 
built a career resting on unshakable integrity and fairness 
the personal attacks now being made on him by a desperate 
opponent are outrageous quayle said in a luncheon address to a 
rotary club in stone mountain 
the political sludge that is being dished out by mr dukakis 
surrogates and which i believe the governor is actively encouraging 
is despicable quayle said 
he also accused dukakis of shifts of position that tell us 
something about how steady that candidate would be if elected 
quayle listed issues on which the republicans have attacked 
dukakis tax increases in massachusetts borrowing from that 
states pension fund pollution of boston harbor gun control and 
dukakis defense positions and rejected dukakis complaint that 
his positions have been distorted 
after stone mountain event quayle flew to augusta ga and was 
to campaign wednesday in tampa miami and fort lauderdale in florida 
the foray into florida a state considered safely in bushs hands 
in the general election was geared to help rep connie mack in his 
gop senate race against rep buddy mckay gop advisers said 
one of the advisers brought in to oversee quayles campaign 
mitch daniels said the strategy from now until the election is for 
quayle to keep a low profile nationally while hitting regionally 
significant areas 
quayle who has generally steered clear of major cities will 
continue making campaign appearances in rural or suburban 
communities where the visit of a candidate is a big deal daniels 
said 
hes very effective in midsize and smaller communities 
daniels said adding that if quayle can make an impact on 5000 to 
10000 votes at a given appearance with a few days in a row of 
that you can swing a state like ohio 
marilyn quayle according to her husband phoned to tell him 
you must be making great speeches drawing tremendous crowds 
really getting them on their feet and saying all the right things 
because i havent heard one thing about you this week 
that said quayle is the typical role of the vice presidential 
candidate and were glad to fill that role 
the senator has seemed to settle into a pattern of ease in his 
campaign that contrasts with the restrained style he showed early on 
quayle and his advisers say that his selection by bush eventually 
will be seen as having little impact on the outcome of the election 
there are some voters who have a negative reaction to him and 
feel he is not qualified but other voters may be drawn by his youth 
and conservatism daniels said

nearly 10 years after the three mile island 
nuclear accident in pennsylvania a panel of citizens and scientists 
said tuesday that the contaminated reactor should not be mothballed 
next year as planned because the cleanup is not finished 
but a spokesman for the power plants operator said tmi managers 
hoped to go ahead with the plan to place the cripped unit 2 reactor 
into monitored storage by the end of 1989 
under the plan the reactor building would be locked unneeded 
systems deactivated and the plant would sit for perhaps 30 years 
while radiation decays inside although the damaged nuclear nuclear 
fuel and loose radioactive components would have been removed from 
the plant radiation would remain in piping and other areas of the 
reactor building basement 
the advisory panel for the decontamination of unit 2 told the 
nuclear regulatory commission at a meeting tuesday that nine of its 
11 members had sided against the socalled post defueling monitored 
storage plan known as pdms 
arthur e morris the panels chairman and mayor of lancaster 
pa said many in the group felt the plan was too vague 
with no specific funding in place morris said there were 
concerns that the cleanup of the plant might not be completed even 
after the storage phase ended in addition he said area residents 
were troubled by the uncertainty of not knowing exactly how many 
years the reactor would sit idle until it was decommissioned 
the utility seems to have looked at this pdms as a given and 
sort of expected us to go along with it said joel roth a panel 
member from elizabethville pa 
it just seems its so wide open and the public is concerned is 
it going to be 20 years 40 years it seems like there is such a 
loophole a loophole large enough for a cooling tower to pass 
through roth said 
unit 2 was disabled in the nations worst commercial nuclear 
accident on march 31 1979 the reactor was allowed to lose vital 
cooling water that normally covers it the subsequent 1 billion 
cleanup has focused on water decontamination waste shipment and 
removal of fuel from the damaged core 
doug bedell a spokesman for gpu nuclear the plant operator 
said in an interview after tuesdays meeting that the cleanup would 
likely stop at the end of next year he said it was pointless to 
expose cleanup workers to additional risk after that because 
remaining radiation would be fixed in place presenting no 
threat to the public 
bedell said the utility envisioned letting unit 2 sit idle until 
after its twin unit 1 ended its service life in about the year 
2010 then both units would be dismantled together 
gpu nuclear would need an amendment to its nrc license before it 
could proceed with its storage plan the decision on whether to 
grant the change would be made by the nrc staff although it is 
possible the commissioners themselves would get involved

west german chancellor helmut kohl said tuesday he 
and president mikhail s gorbachev failed to agree on whether to 
reunify berlin but signed accords to help the sick soviet food 
industry and put a west german in space 
the chancellor earlier highlighted his concern for human rights 
by meeting with andrei d sakharov the nobel peace prize laureate 
at the west german ambassadors residence 
kohl speaking to reporters before a second round of talks with 
gorbachev took a philosophical view to the dispute over berlin that 
surfaced in banquet speeches the night before 
the last word of history is neither spoken by me or by mr 
gorbachev kohl said 
in a dinner speech gorbachev had said of the berlin dispute 
the attempts to upset what has been created in the postwar 
process or push through unrealistic policies is an unpredictable and 
even dangerous business 
he appeared to be referring to kohls proposal for a change in 
the status of berlin and closer relations between nato member west 
germany and moscowaligned east germany 
since the end of world war ii west berlin has been under the 
control of the united states france and britain the victorious 
allies the city has been divided since 1961 by a wall that 
symbolizes the eastwest hostility of the cold war kohl said in a 
radio interview in january there can be no real improvement in 
relations between moscow and bonn if berlin is not included 
on tuesday kohl told reporters he was not surprised by 
gorbachevs remarks on berlin 
the world cant be changed in a couple of hours he said 
adding that he was optimistic agreement eventually could be reached 
kohl said mondays talks had been often and in part hard 
the two met again tuesday but a tass news agency dispatch on the 
session did not say whether they discussed the berlin dispute 
tass said aides signed agreements including one on the peaceful 
uses of outer space it said the pact provides for the possibility 
that a west german would fly aboard the soviet unions orbiting 
space station mir west german officials said the pact also could 
have german astronauts join soviets in traveling to mars in 1994 
west germans have traveled to space in 1983 and 1985 aboard the 
us space shuttle 
during recent visits by austrian and italian leaders the soviet 
union invited citizens of those countries to fly aboard the mir 
station next month french president francois mitterrand is to 
observe the launch of a frenchsoviet space crew to the station 
another agreement signed tuesday calls for west german companies 
to help modernize about 200 soviet food and consumer goods 
factories tass reported the kremlin faced with growing 
complaints has placed priority on eliminating food and consumer 
goods shortages 
kohl met earlier tuesday with soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
to discuss economic cooperation which includes a 16 billion 
german credit to the kremlin to finance exports in food leather 
textile and clothing 
sakharov the founding father of the 1970s soviet dissident 
movement told kohl there still are political prisoners in the soviet 
union and they must be released and rehabilitated according to 
german spokesman friedhelm ost 
sakharov was banished to the closed city of gorky in 1980 for 
criticizing the kremlins military push into afghanistan gorbachev 
allowed him to return to moscow in december 1986 
kohl who arrived in moscow on a fourday visit monday paid 
homage tuesday to soviet and german victims of world war ii in 
freezing weather and under an gray sky kohl laid a wreath at the 
soviet tomb of the unknown soldier beside the kremlin wall the 
ceremony a protocol must for foreign dignitaries visiting moscow 
takes on a special poignancy when performed by a german 
the distinguished guest honored by a minute of silence the 
memory of millions of soviet people who died in the great patriotic 
war of 194145 tass said in a brief report 
an unknown soviet soldier killed in 1941 when the werhmacht was 
at the gates of moscow is buried in the tomb which is topped by an 
eternal flame total soviet losses in world war ii are officially 
put at 20 million but some soviet historians suggest that figure is 
far too low 
kohl then was driven to a walled cemetery in the moscow district 
of lyublino where 596 german soldiers who were taken prisoner by 
the red army during world war ii and later died in captivity are 
buried 
on a dark granite obelisk at the cemeterys entrance the words 
for peace and reconcilation are carved in russian prior to 
kohls arrival a solitary flower had been placed on each german 
soldiers grave in the front row 
kohl laid a wreath and walked between the graves whose stone 
border had been freshly painted white

a top state department official said tuesday he 
was encouraged by the outcome of talks in moscow last week in which 
soviet and us officials recommended that immediate measures be 
taken to halt overfishing for pollock in the bering sea 
ed wolfe the departments ambassador for oceans and fisheries 
who led the us delegation also said that both countries are 
increasingly concerned about reports of possible illegal salmon 
fishing by the japanese and the taiwanese in the north pacific and 
agreed to cooperate in enforcement activities 
the soviets are equally as concerned about possible illegal 
salmon fishing as we are wolfe said in an interview all of 
these things are related because they all deal with bering sea 
fishing 
wolfe said he was quite satisfied with the moscow talks and 
he expected a plan for managing pollock stocks in the bering sea to 
emerge from another round of talks either late this year or in early 
1989 
in a joint statement negotiators meeting in moscow said 
scientists from both countries agreed that unregulated fishing was 
clearly detrimental to pollock stocks in us and soviet zones 
that surround the international portion of the bering sea 
in light of the urgent nature of this problem the two 
delegations agreed that immediate measures are necessary to 
conserve fishery resources throughout the bering sea ecosystem 
the statement said 
the statement gave no indication what measures the two countries 
might consider to halt the overfishing but simply said it is 
essential that all countries fishing in the central bering sea meet 
their obligations under international law to conserve these 
threatened fishery resources 
some state department officials have said one possibility is for 
the united states and soviet union to declare a moratorium on

president augusto pinochet on tuesday 
compared his referendum defeat to the spurning of christ and an 
opposition leader said he was abusing the peoples patience by 
refusing calls for democratic reform 
in a speech to about 3000 women volunteers a solemn pinochet 
declared we were defeated in a plebiscite defeated but not 
vanquished 
dont forget that in world history there was a plebiscite in 
which the people chose between christ and barabbas and the people 
chose barabbas the general said 
the people sometimes make mistakes pinochet added according 
to the bible the romans offered to set free either christ or 
barabbas a common criminal just before their crucifixion the 
crowd chose barabbas 
the audience a private womans organization headed by 
pinochets wife lucia applauded loudly 
on oct 5 voters rejected a proposal by the countrys military 
commanders that pinochet who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup 
remain president until 1997 
as a result he was obliged to call an open election planned for 
december 1989 and hand power over to the winner in march 1990 
we are going to keep working until the last day pinochet 
vowed in his speech and then hand over the government to whom you 
yourselves elect 
opposition groups have called for pinochet to step down early 
and to agree to talks on reforming the 8yearold constitution that 
was drafted and pushed through by his administration they maintain 
that changes are needed to give future elected government full 
democratic powers 
pinochet has vowed to keep the constitution intact and patricio 
aylwin president of the centrist christian democratic party on 
tuesday accused the 72yearold authoritarian ruler of trying to 
provoke disorders by his intransigence 
aylwin said pinochet want to push people into taking to the 
streets to create a pretext for unleashing violence and 
repression 
he is abusing the peoples patience aylwin said 
aylwin a 69yearold lawyer is widely expected to be nominated 
for president by a 16party opposition coalition that led the 
campaign for pinochets defeat in the referendum his party is the 
countrys largest 
the coalition has avoided calling street demonstrations or other 
provocative actions fearing they could lead to a harder government 
line and hurt chances for talks on the reforms but aylwin said 
opposition leaders who have been calling for patience among the 
ranks will lose their credibility if things dont advance 
he said a cabinet shakeup by pinochet last week in which a 
ustrained economist carlos caceres was named to head the 
powerful interior ministry did not reveal any readiness to 
respond to the opposition parties calls for a dialog 
aylwin also complained the government had failed to heed appeals 
for goodwill gestures such as the release of two labor leaders 
in internal exile

despite a housing boom in california sales of 
existing homes fell 22 percent in september after a surprisingly 
strong summer a real estate trade group said tuesday 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing homes 
declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 363 million units 
last month following a 22 percent increase in august 
but last months level was still higher than most economists 
would have predicted this spring when mortgage interest rates began 
to creep higher 
fixedrate mortgages on average hit a low of 984 percent in 
february and rose to 1071 percent by early august since then they 
have eased back to 1028 percent but many analysts expect them to 
start rising again by years end 
existinghome sales in the late spring and early summer were 
strong in part because many buyers apparently purchased homes 
sooner than planned in an attempt to beat rising interest rates 
the decline in september is a hangover from the buying 
spree of the summer said john a tuccillo chief economist of the 
realtors the extraordinary increase of the summer was in part 
borrowed from september 
tuccillo predicted sales rates will continue to lag in the fourth 
quarter and by years end would total 347 million units down only 
slightly from 353 million in 1987 
the west was the only region of the nation showing an increase of 
sales last month they rose 60 percent to an annual rate of 710000 
units the highest level since december 1986 following a 31 
percent increase in august 
sales fell 58 percent in the northeast to 650000 units on an 
annual basis the lowest since january they fell 32 percent in the 
midwest to 900000 units and were off 28 percent in the south to 
138 million units 
john savacool an economist with the wefa group a forecasting 
firm in bala cynwyd pa said californias strong economy and 
growing population are supporting the housing market 
people have been moving into california in droves and that 
provides a lot of support for the housing market there even though 
the rest of the nation looks weak savacool said he noted that 
400000 people moved to california last year more than to any other 
state 
the main reason for sluggish sales in the northeast is high 
prices he said 
over the past year existinghome prices have risen most steeply 
in the west the median was 124300 in september up 71 percent 
however the northeast remained the most costly area with a 
median of 141400 up 63 percent from a year earlier 
the median in the south was 82400 up 36 percent from 
september 1987 in the midwest the price was 67100 up 15 
percent the national appreciation rate over 12 months was 35 
percent to a median of 88500 meaning half of the homes sold for 
more and half for less

the pharmaceutical manufacturers association 
said tuesday that 47 of its members companies are working on a total 
of 87 new drugs for cardiovascular diseases including heart 
disease hypertension and stroke 
no other disease is targeted by so many drugs in development or 
so much investment in research said association president gerald 
j mossinghoff 
each of the 87 drugs is either in human clinical trials or 
awaiting final approval by the food and drug administration 
he acknowledged at a news conference that one of the reasons the 
companies are pouring so much investment into cardiovascular 
diseases is that there remains a huge market for such therapies even 
though doctors now realize they are among the most preventable 
illnesses for people who adopt healthy lifestyles in their early and 
middle years 
dr john f beary iii senior vice president for science and 
technology for the trade association noted that heart disease 
remains the nations no 1 killer and stroke no 3 
even though the population is generally healthier as well as 
older than in years past beary said at some point these 
diseases catch up with everyone 
the pma survey of its more than 100 members was designed to 
provide an overview of the scope of new drug development in various 
categories rather than highlight any particularly promising 
breakthrough drugs 
in fact there are already a number of drugs on the market for 
cardiovascular diseases unlike for many other diseases that 
afflict mostly the elderly such as alzheimers 
mossinghoff acknowledged that a subliminal purpose for the 
press conference is to let elder americans know that it is 
important for the fda to have adequate funding to review these new 
drugs 
this puts a little bit of pressure on the system he said 
mossinghoff said it is likely some of the companies developing 
new cardiovascular disease drugs will take advantage of new fda 
guidelines announced last week that holds out the prospect of 
quicker approval of new drugs if companies work closely with the 
agency in early clinical trials and make a larger research 
investment to accumulate more test data earlier than is often the 
current practice 
the trade association plans similar surveys in december for 
cancer drugs under development and in january for arthritis 
alzheimers and other aging diseases 
the cardiovascular disease survey found more medicines being 
developed for hypertension or high blood pressure than any other 
condition with all but three of the 38 drugs in that category in the 
final stages of testing 
the pma said the second largest category is congestive heart 
failure the final and often fatal phase of heart disease with 28 
drugs under development

democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
who attempted to use his power as governor of massachusetts to block 
a national guard training mission in central america lost an appeal 
tuesday challenging federal authority over the guard 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals issued a onesentence order 
affirming a decision by us district judge robert keeton on may 6 
that upheld federal supremacy over the guard 
having examined the briefs of the parties and having had 
the benefit of oral argument we affirm the judgment on the basis 
stated in the district courts wellreasoned opinion the appeals 
court said 
dukakis filed suit in january to block the assignment of 13 
public relations specialists in the massachusetts guard to honduras 
and panama for two weeks in may because of his opposition to reagan 
administration policies in the region 
dukakis has denounced during his presidential campaign the 
administration for its failed and illegal policy of supporting 
the nicaraguan contra rebels he said sending national guard troops 
to the region was an attempt to intimidate nicaragua 
dukakis who was campaigning tuesday in california and colorado 
had no immediate comment on the decision 
after keeton issued his ruling in may dukakis appealed but he 
did not try to stop the massachusetts troops from participating in 
the roadbuilding exercises 
keetons decision upheld the constitutionality of the montgomery 
amendment a 1986 act of congress that says governors may not 
decline such assignments because of any objection to the location 
purpose type or schedule of such activity 
the us justice department described dukakis position as a 
dagger aimed at the heart of national defense 
the massachusetts attorney generals office had claimed that the 
militia clause of the constitution reserved power to the 
governors over training militia 
minnesota gov rudy perpich joined by massachusetts and nine 
other states challenged the law last year in us district court in 
st paul and lost that case is now on appeal

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
on tuesday invited iran and iraq to resume their peace talks and 
members of the security council called on the nations to be more 
cooperative in the new talks 
perez de cuellar said his invitation to resume talks on monday in 
geneva has been sent but it was too early for a reply officials of 
both countries had expressed their willingness to resume talks 
before the end of the month in geneva 
perez de cuellar gave the members of the council a report tuesday 
that brought out the urgency of a rapid troop withdrawal from the 
iraniraq border said the councils president alexander count york 
von wartenburg 
the 15 security council members unanimously adopted a statement 
expressing their concern over the slow pace of the talks in 
september and early october he said 
the members express their expectation that substantive progress 
will be made in geneva in order to achieve a full and rapid 
implementation of resolution 598 as an integral whole said von 
wartenburg referring to the councils peace plan 
observers interpreted the stress on implementing resolution 598 
as an integral whole as pressure on iraq to give up its 
insistence that the shattalarab waterway that form the southern 
border between the two nations must be cleared before the peace 
talks take up other issues 
the waterway is iraqs only navigable outlet to the persian gulf 
but it has been clogged with sunken ships and silt since the war 
broke out in 1980 
perez de cuellar said that he and his special mediator for the 
talks swedish ambassador jan k eliasson will go to geneva but 
the secretarygeneral expects to stay only for four or five days 
i am encouraged by the fact that both sides appear ready to 
show their goodwill by proceeding with some repatraition of 
prisoners of war in the near future he said 
iraq has suggested that all pows could be sent home as a 
humanitarian gesture outside of the peace negotiations 
iran said the pow issue is one of the terms of the resolution and 
cannot be separated from it but iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar 
mahallati said last week his country is ready to reciprocate 
humanitarian gestures 
mahallati suggested that sick and injured prisoners and those 
held the longest might be the first to be repatriated 
iranian and iraqi sources have said both sides have accepted a 
compromise from the secretarygeneral to break the stalemate over 
the shattalarab by postponing discussions of the issue until a 
later stage of the talks 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity also said iran 
has accepted iraqs demand to stop searching ships for war material 
bound for iraq 
the compromises would allow both sides to concentrate on 
negotiating the withdrawal of their troops to an internationally 
recognized border and the repatriation of pows 
iran has not stopped any ships since aug 20 the day the 
unmediated ceasefire began

harvard university cannot foster the ideal of 
racial equality given the underrepresentation of blacks among its 
faculty and administrators says a report issued tuesday by an 
organization of black staffers 
blacks make up 3 percent of the ivy league schools instructors 
and administrators and the association of black faculty and 
administrators called for increasing that figure to 10 percent 
the challenge of overcoming the attachment to the beliefs and 
benefits of white supremacy remains the association said in its 
report 
the authors of the paper titled the final report used an 
unusual storytelling technique hypothesizing what would happen if 
harvard president derek bok and all of the schools black faculty 
and administrators were killed in an explosion 
the outpouring of sympathy they concluded would mean that 
harvard would adopt a much more effective program for recruiting 
blacks to the school than now exists 
lawrence watson assistant dean of the harvard graduate school of 
design and an association cochair said framing the report this way 
was intended to dramatize the groups message 
the use of stories to make a point is a wellknown african 
tradition one that is increasingly used as a medium for scholarly 
discourse watson said it is our hope that the reports unusual 
character will prevent its becoming another forgotten report on 
affirmative action a subject about which much more has been written 
than accomplished 
the association said 17 of harvards present 957 tenured faculty 
or 18 percent are black twentysix of the 2265 tenureline 
faculty or 11 percent are black and 155 of 3205 
administrators or 48 percent are black it said 
in the imaginary scenario an unnamed president would increase 
minority hiring by vigorous effort and when those positions could 
not be filled fund fellowships to help promising black students 
gain the credentials to teach at harvard or other elite schools 
we view this report as an incentive for a more detailed 
discussion and review with the deans of the universitys 1988 
affirmative action plan said association cochair derrick bell a 
harvard law school professor 
in noting that release of the final report comes 100 years 
after black educator and historian web du bois admission to 
harvard college the association said blacks still face prejudice at 
harvard 
the associations report noted that today dr du bois would 
find a substantial number of black students at harvard most are 
spared the overt hostility that barred du bois from every social 
activity except the philosophy club 
even so contemporary black students encounter colorbased 
discrimination in many subtle and debilitating forms and they 
suffer the noless hurtful slights and disparaging assumptions about 
their abilities that du bois endured it said

a new 45page handbook governing bostons bustling 
nightclubs has been adopted by the citys licensing board with 
provisions including bans on discriminatory admission practices and 
display of improper material 
while some of the rules are good ideas the restriction about 
what can be displayed could interfere with owners rights to free 
expression one civil liberties advocate said 
bostons bustling and sometimes rowdy night scene prompted 
officials to draw up the compilation of rules and regulations 
licensing board chairwoman andrea gargiulo said tuesday 
the handbook which clubs will be required to show to patrons on 
request is easier to read than the fine print regulations on 
individual licenses issued to owners and will fit into police 
officers pockets ms gargiulo said 
the new rules prohibit signs such as proper dress required a 
vague stipulation that sometimes led to selective discrimination 
ms gargiulo said 
also banned are vip passes on any basis that invidiously 
discriminates 
we had cases where a white male with no tie was allowed in and 
a black male was told at the door that he couldnt come in without a 
tie ms gargiulo said we dont want to leave it up to the 
doorman 
new signs will have to spell out what constitutes proper dress 
such as jacket and tie required for men she said 
other new rules require that bouncers not strike customers unless 
hit first and makes nightclub owners responsible for the actions of 
valet parking companies they may hire 
waiting lines at popular nightspots will have to be limited and 
supervised 
penalties for violations include a wide variety of license 
restrictions ranging from limits on the hours liquor can be served 
to outright suspension of a clubs license 
the ban on displaying material of an improper or objectionable 
nature in clubs outside the combat zone the adult entertainment 
district came under criticism from the civil liberties union of 
massachusetts 
this is kind of a classic socalled obscenity issue said 
john roberts the organizations executive director we know that 
in this society standards obviously differ between whats 
acceptable and not acceptable somehow female nudity in a lot of 
places is just sort of accepted but now males is not 
john reinstein a lawyer with the clu said the ban on improper 
material could be difficult to enforce if im a restaurant owner 
with a statue of michelangelos david in my place is that covered 
because its nudity he said 
ms gargiulo said the rule is not intended to ban nude prints 
that hang inside some restaurants but is aimed at material that is 
way out of line 
the guideline on objectionable material will be whether it would 
be deemed unsuitable for view by members of the public if it were 
located in areas such as public parks or government and business 
offices 
enforcing the rules may be difficult but not impossible ms 
gargiulo said theyre very subjective and thats why we hold 
hearings

disgusting and distasteful abuse and a grievous assault to her 
human dignity it contained no statements of fact that could be 
the basis of a libel suit said the 9th us circuit court of

the 30 ruling also rejected claims of invasion of privacy and 
intentional infliction of emotional distress it reversed a federal

frivolous suit saying the legal claims were not wholly 
unreasonable 
this case is a good sign for us said david carson a lawyer 
for the magazine he said several similar suits are pending mostly 
filed by lawyer gerry spence of jackson wyo whose law firm 
represented ms ault spence has also sued hustler for libel because 
of the magazines satiric attack on him for his other suits carson 
said 
were hopeful that in light of this ruling some of the other 
lawsuits that mr spence has filed with similar claims might be 
thrown out of court carson said 
he also cited last years supreme court ruling rejecting a suit 
against hustler by television preacher jerry falwell who was the 
subject of a sexual parody in the magazine 
lawyers for ms ault did not return phone calls tuesday 
ms ault founded a group called citizens in action for clackamas 
county to protest a sex video store in milwaukie and has lobbied 
for antipornography legislation through another group 
her suit involved an april 1985 hustler article that was 
illustrated by her photograph superimposed over the rear end of a 
bentover naked man

a major builders association on tuesday said 
it has found no evidence that energyefficient homes increase radon 
concentrations and that it is advising its members to build homes as 
tight as possible 
our practices recommend good air sealing techniques just as 
would be used in trying to save energy said john spears program 
manager for the national research center which is affiliated with 
the national home builders association 
some analysts have suggested that the increasing importance being 
placed on energy efficiency also may be increasing the tendency of 
radon an odorless radioactive gas given off by all soils to 
concentrate indoors 
the environmental protection agency has warned that although 
increased ventilation may help particular radonrich homes as a 
general rule wellventilated homes appear to have no exemption from 
radon buildup 
epa estimates that radon could be causing as many as 20000 
deaths from lung cancer each year in september the public health 
service issued a national health advisory warning of radon dangers 
and the two agencies urged testing of every home where people live 
on the second floor or below 
as for home sealing were finding it has little to do with 
radon spears said at a news conference as a result the 
association is recommending the same practices we have recommended 
for years for energy conservation in fact weve found that energy 
conservation has little to do with radon concentration in the house 
weve measured houses all over the country 
the association recommended many techniques for reducing radon 
buildup such as carefully sealing off the basement often the same 
techniques used for keeping water out 
william h ethier litigation counsel for the association said 
members were being advised that if they make a reasoned judgment 
that there may be high radon levels that they should rough in 
mitigation techniques such as underslab ventilation pipes that may 
be ignored later if appropriate or connected to a fan to divert 
radonladen air around the basement 
in states such as pennsylvania and new jersey with 
wellpublicized instances of radon buildup ethier said he has found 
universal adoption of such precautions by builders 
builders report that the techniques may add as little as 100 to 
the cost of a home if water barriers are already being used but as 
much as 600 if they are not he said

a virginia tech cadet was abducted by a 
group of masked students who shaved his head in an attack that 
apparently was sparked by an icethrowing incident at a football 
game school officials said tuesday 
i think its some overzealous behavior on the part of some 
students who acted with malice said thomas goodale vice 
president for student affairs one of the eight to 10 students 
accused of abducting and injuring steve woodberry 19 of 
nokesville has been arrested more arrests are expected goodale

roanoke memorial hospital 
jennings cole ii 19 of front royal faces charges of abduction 
hazing and malicious wounding school officials said all the 
students involved are believed to be members of the corps of cadets 
highty tighty band but the university does not hold the corps 
responsible goodale said 
goodale said he did not consider the incident to have been 
hazing but rather a personal matter between students 
goodale said the attack occurred in the early morning hours 
thursday when the students wearing ski masks knocked on woodberrys 
door abducted him and took him to a campus duck pond where they 
shaved his head with an electric razor the episode appeared to have 
been thoroughly plotted with some students standing guard goodale 
said 
the attack was broken up when virginia tech police on a routine 
patrol came along he said one of the students ski masks was 
removed leading to coles arrest monday he said 
woodberry was initially treated on campus and released friday he 
participated in a field exercise that day but was taken to 
montgomery regional hospital on sunday when other students became 
concerned about a bad headache he had 
the attack apparently was prompted by an icethrowing incident at 
the virginia techwest virginia football game on oct 1 goodale 
said 
woodberry has since left the band

iran will open its main oil port to 
foreign vessels as it pulls its own tankers out of service from the 
persian gulf route heavily attacked during its war with iraq 
shipping sources said tuesday 
iran will eliminate service by iranianoperated tankers from 
kharg island in the northeastern gulf to the sirri terminal in the 
south by the end of the year according to the londonbased lloyds 
shipping intelligence unit which monitors maritime traffic 
it quoted mohammad souri chairman and managing director of the 
national iranian tanker co as saying he expected foreign tankers 
to take over the transport of half of irans oil exports from kharg 
within a month and all of it within two months 
iraq imposed an air and sea blockade around kharg in 1984 a move 
that triggered the tanker war in which more than 500 ships were 
attacked by both countries 
iran is exporting an estimated 14 million barrels of oil a day 
officials have said they plan to increase their longterm export 
capacity to around 45 million barrels a day 
the lloyds report underlined iranian efforts to restore normal 
oil export operations following the aug 20 ceasefire in the 
8yearold war between iran and iraq 
gulfbased shipping officials reported earlier this month the 
iranians had stopped exercising their legal right to stop vessels 
suspected of carrying warrelated cargoes to iraq 
they also reported that iran has withdrawn all its armed 
speedboats from the southern gulf island of abu musa island which 
was used as a base from which to attack neutral ships in reprisal 
for iraqi air raids on tankers carrying iranian oil the last 
iranian attack was a speedboat raid on a norwegian tanker on aug4 
japans shipowners and maritime union tuesday lifted a ban it 
imposed last year to keep its ships from sailing to kharg 
a shipping source who requested anonymity said there were 
unconfirmed reports that a japanese tanker had already loaded at 
kharg and left the gulf shipments from kharg account for 90 percent 
of irans oil exports which made the port a target of repeated 
iraqi air raids aimed at strangling the oil sales that financed 
tehrans war effort 
lloyds quoted souri as saying negotiations are under way to 
return some of irans 17 chartered oil vessels to international 
service a move expected to depress the tanker market 
at the peak of the war the iranians had a shuttle fleet of more 
than 30 tankers many of them charters because foreign vessels 
would not risk iraqi attacks to reach kharg 
gulfbased shipping executives said the 547841ton burmah 
endeavor which was used as a storage vessel for crude oil shipped 
from kharg was in the southern gulf port of dubai for reconversion 
to sea duty the britishflagged supertanker was damaged in an iraqi 
air raid in may 
lloyds said that disbanding irans tanker service would save 
iran an estimated 300 million a year 
kharg and its tankers were bombed scores of times by iraqs air 
force and the port was heavily fortified with antiaircraft and 
missile batteries 
the iranians tried to circumvent the iraqi blockade by installing 
a makeshift terminal at sirri island about 350 miles south 
foreign tankers loaded there until the iraqis raided sirri in 
1986 loading operations were then moved another 120 miles south to 
larak island in the strait of hormuz the gateway to the gulf 
but iraqi warplanes began hitting larak as well culminating in a 
may 14 strike in which several supertankers were sunk or crippled 
the us navy severely damaged the sirri platform on april 18 in 
retaliatory raids for the mining of a us warship 
since the ceasefire sirris terminal has reopened shipping 
officials said while larak has ceased to function as an oil 
terminal

an iowa state university student who 
served a sevenmonth jail term for contempt of court was freed 
tuesday after the son he sent away to jordan was returned to the 
boys mother 
i think i did the right thing said ahmed amro of the 
decision two years ago to send the child away his son and exwife 
were reunited monday night 
amro was sentenced to an indefinite jail term by district judge 
ml seiser last march when amro did not comply with a divorce 
decree awarding custody of his 4yearold son mujahid to amros 
exwife souad mejdouli 
the boy was greeted by his mother at the des moines international 
airport late monday after the journey from jordan and amro was 
released about 10 hours later 
i didnt believe it im still in shock said ms mejdouli 
who lives in ames north of here i think my son was in shock 
too but im awfully glad to have him back we have a lot of things 
to catch up on a lot of hugging and kissing 
amro at first demanded that the issue of child custody be decided 
by islamic laws rather than iowa courts and he later said he should 
be freed from jail because there was nothing he could do to gain 
return of the child 
amro sent his son to jordan two years ago to live with amros 
sister after amro was convicted of beating his wife ms mejdouli 
later divorced him and won custody of the child 
amro a computer engineering student at iowa state contended 
that his father a devout moslem refused to allow the boy to 
return but his plea to overturn the indefinite jail confinement was 
denied by the iowa supreme court 
its no place for a human being amro said tuesday of his 
jail stay but said he made the right decision about his son 
i wanted him to be away while there was a dispute between 
myself and his mother he probably would have been psychologically 
ruined if he had witnessed the dispute amro said he said he 
intended for the boy to be away only for a month or two 
he said the grandfather changed his mind when he was told of the 
supreme courts decision 
amro said he has been a permanent us resident for five years 
and has applied for citizenship 
amro said he wants to finish the semester of school needed for 
his bachelors degree and will seek visitation rights 
i dont want to be a parttime dad i want to always be there 
for my son when he needs me amro said i want to see him as 
much as i can i want to be involved in his life 
oh yeah retorted ms mejdouli in a separate interview 
thats why he sent him overseas for two years we dont trust him 
thats the same game he played with us two years ago 
a visitation hearing has been set in seisers court for thursday 
morning

the tenants of a public housing development in 
a povertystricken drugladen neighborhood took the first step 
tuesday toward buying the housing project 
this is a dream becoming reality said community activist 
kimi gray chairman of the kenilworthparkside management corp 
which received final approval for its bid to purchase the 464 
apartments from the district of columbia city government for 1 
weve worked six years for this 
after the complex is renovated in several years residents will 
be able to buy their apartments for as little as 10000 each 
the occasion marked the first instance in history in which public 
housing tenants arranged to buy their own apartments 
gray organized the tenant corporation which took over management 
of the project in 1982 reducing administrative costs by 60 percent 
before that when it had been managed by a private firm under 
contract to the city it was ratinfested and run down apartments 
had no heat or hot water the chain link fence was squashed and 
rusted 
we have a vested interest explained gray in an interview at 
the time we live here so we really care were supersensitive 
the sale to the tenants was made possible through a 1987 law 
authorizing the conversion of several public housing projects across 
the country to tenant ownership to demonstrate whether the idea was 
feasible 
the actual sale will not take effect until after the completion 
of a 23 million federally financed renovation of the 33building 
complex the department of housing and urban development also will 
provide 6 million in rental assistance over the next five years 
the tenants corporation plans to help tenants increase their 
incomes so they can afford to buy their apartments said alphonso 
jackson director of the citys department of public and assisted 
housing 
so far 132 residents have been removed from welfare rolls as 
result of the corporations entrepreneurial ventures such as a 
day care center and janitorial service he said

an illegal repair job was blamed tuesday for the 
collapse of a sixstory building that crumbled like a house of 
cards killing one person and injuring about 12 others 
the owner of the building in manhattans garment district died 
when one wall fell away and the interior floors tumbled to the 
ground monday afternoon 
one survivor robin fischer 27 of brooklyn underwent surgery 
tuesday to repair damage to her crushed legs fischer who 
apparently was working on the sixth floor of the building was 
pulled from the rubble more than eight hours later when rescuers 
heard her say im robin get me out 
police and investigators from the manhattan district attorneys 
office examined the wreckage tuesday as emergency crews continued to 
dismantle what remained of the building 
so far theres been no one arrested said gloria montealegre 
a spokeswoman for manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau 
were still in the process of finding out if theres any criminal 
liability 
the building was owned by frank desantis 64 whose body was 
pulled from the rubble late monday night buildings commissioner 
charles smith said desantis had apparently hired a contractor to 
repair the building after he noticed a bulge in its western wall 
as workers began to remove old sections of the wall to repair it 
smith said bricks started popping out then he said the 
workers dug a trench along the wall and tried to shore it up with 
wooden planks 
that didnt do any good and probably did more harm the 
commissioner said shortly after that the wall collapsed 
smith said he didnt know why the contractor john varkaris of 
jrv construction co dug the ditch varkaris did not immediately 
return a message left tuesday on an answering machine at his home 
a man who answered the telephone tuesday at desantis office 
declined to discuss the incident were taking no calls and making 
no comments he said 
smith said the work was similar to that being done at a 
fivestory building in greenwich village that collapsed last 
november trapping five residents and killing a 13monthold boy in 
both cases he said the work was being done without permits

random urine testing for drugs among an elite 
corps of new york city police officers is legal because of the 
dangerous and sensitive nature of their work a divided new york 
state court of appeals ruled tuesday 
the 52 decision by the states top court not only overturns two 
lower court rulings it constitutes an about face for a court 
which only last year ruled that a drugtesting plan for long island 
teachers was an unreasonable invasion of their privacy the 
dissenting judges said 
the court decision upholds new york city police commissioner 
benjamin wards 1986 order that members of the departments 
organized crime control bureau must undergo random urinalysis for 
drugs approximately 1100 of the citys 27000 police officers 
volunteer for duty in the special unit up to 90 percent are 
involved in narcoticsrelated work 
the terrorfilled world they are working in requires the 
sternest precautionary safeguards to weed out drug abusers from 
their own ranks wrote judge joseph bellacosa for the majority 
the court ruled unanimously last year in a case involving 
patchogue teachers that governments couldnt force public employees 
to take drug tests unless there is a reasonable suspicion that 
workers are using drugs 
much of bellacosas 14page ruling was taken up with an 
explanation of why the police officers should be held to stricter 
standards than the teachers the lower courts incorrectly gave an 
absolutist reading to the court of appeals decision in the 
teachers case he said 
the direct correlation between an organized crime officers 
work and drugs should be considered in evaluating the extent of 
their constitutional rights to privacy bellacosa wrote 
the officers agree to undergo microscopic examinations of their 
personal lives their financial affairs and their professional 
judgment calls bellacosa said realistically the proposed 
random drug testing in these narrow circumstances is just another 
layer of an already heightened persistent and employeeexpected 
scrutiny 
judge judith kaye in a dissenting opinion said the government 
hasnt established why the testing is needed or why the officers 
should be held to such special standards 
the public clearly has an interest in the integrity of every 
employee who serves it kaye wrote equally clearly that alone 
does not give the state the power to conduct intrusive searches of 
their person 
according to court papers all city police recruits are tested 
for drugs when they apply to the department again during their 
fivemonth police academy training and at the end of their 18month 
probation tenured officers are subject to testing if theres a 
reasonable suspicion of drug use 
officers applying to the organized crime unit were required by 
ward in 1986 to sign a form acknowledging that periodic drug testing 
was a condition of employment 
the policemens union the patrolmens benevolent association 
sued to overturn the order two days after it was announced 
raymond kerno the unions lawyer said he was surprised at the 
decision 
he called the drug testing an excessive attempt to solve a 
problem that doesnt really exist 
the decision gives new life to municipalities who hope to start 
drug testing programs said michael adler a lawyer in new york 
citys corporation counsels office 
the city in late 1987 tried to institute random drug testing for 
all corrections officers he said but lower courts have struck down 
the program citing the patchogue case he said 
i think certainly those who might favor drug testing are 
probably better equipped to make a legal argument justifying the 
testing than they had before this decision came down adler said 
according to police department records narcoticsrelated 
disciplinary charges have been filed against 10 police officers in 
the crime unit in four years 
kaye said these statistics show theres no indication of a drug 
abuse problem within this unit the important goal of deterrence 
is not without evidence of a pervasive problem among the 
persons to be tested justification for this search she said

former president isabel peron made 
a surprise visit to her homeland tuesday 
i wanted to be in argentina and here i am she told reporters 
at ezeiza international airport 
mrs perons arrival from spain where she has lived since 1981 
comes at the beginning of what promises to be a bitter political 
campaign that will culminate in national elections next may 
mrs person 57 has stayed out of politics since she was 
overthrown in 1976 by the military and held under house arrest for 
five years she succeeded her husband juan peron when he died in 
1974 
but her sympathies appear to lie more with president raul 
alfonsin of the radical civic union than with the opposition 
peronist party 
lesio romero secretary of the meatpackers union said the 
unexpected arrival of mrs peron is very strange we understand she 
was invited by the national government i hope she doesnt intend to 
involve herself with our peronist movement 
the peronist party is divided among supporters of presidential 
candidate carlos menem the frontrunner and governor of the poor 
province of la rioja and buenos aires gov antonio cafiero 
last weekend menem said his party might try to impeach alfonsin 
because of the perverse political economy applied by the national 
government 
alfonsin is barred by the constitution from seeking reelection 
the radical civic union candidate for president is eduardo 
angeloz the governor of prosperous cordoba province 
mrs perons visit is her third since alfonsin was inaugurated 
president in december 1983 the previous two visits were at 
alfonsins invitation 
mrs perons turbulent 20 months in office were marked by 
kidnappings and assassinations conducted by left and rightwing 
political extremists and an economic collapse 
mrs peron was elected vicepresident in the 1973 election her 
husband won by a landslide after returning to argentine politics 
from an eighteenyear exile in madrid 
peron was elected president in 1946 and reelected in 1951 he 
was overthrown by the military in 1955 
he met maria estela martinez known as isabel at a night club in 
panama after the 1955 coup she became his secretary and followed 
him to venezuela and spain where she became his third wife

last june had suffered enough mrs dickelman told the judge 
dickelman had been drinking and was intent on shooting the family

a 22caliber pistol goff said mrs dickelman told the judge at 
tuesdays sentencing that the shooting was an accident 
the pistol was loaded with birdshot and mrs dickelman suffered 
pellet wounds in her mouth she has since recovered according to

help for a drinking problem and that the couple were trying to 
turn this into a positive thing goff said

and then suspended all but the five days he had served and placed

the massachusetts commission against 
discrimination has found that the 1985 firing of the only black 
coach in the pittsfield west little league was racially motivated 
david williams filed a complaint with the state commission after 
he was dismissed as coach of the connor pharmacy team in june 1985 
following a series of disputes with league officials among other 
things williams contended that league umpireinchief ralph 
stannard had called him boy in a racially and personally 
derogatory manner in the course of a game 
at the time the league of six teams had no black players 
according to the commission each team has at least one coach all 
of whom serve for free according to league secretarytreasurer john 
marchesi 
following its finding the state commission attempted to mediate 
the dispute between williams and the league but no conclusion was 
reached in a threehour meeting monday said rosemary nevins 
commission staff council 
she said that if no agreement could be worked out privately 
between the parties the commission could hold public hearings 
after that the issue could be decided by the courts 
the main sticking point according to williams was the wording of 
an apology he sought from league officials he said that he had 
never sought monetary compensation from the league but wanted the 
apology to boost his chances of seeking other coaching jobs 
if there is a statement to be issued he said i just want 
it to clarify that im not the troublemaker some people might make 
me out to be this isnt a situation i created 
williams who works as a wireman at general electric co had 
previously coached junior varsity baseball at lee high school and 
junior varsity girls basketball at taconic high school in 
pittsfield he had initially filed a civil suit against the league 
over his dismissal in 1985 but withdrew the action in favor of 
pursuing a complaint through the commission 
i couldnt afford to co through the courts williams said he 
said the cost of the complaint was about half that of a civil suit

americas cartoonists used their pens to skewer disdain and 
apathy toward the homeless in a concerted campaign on the comic 
pages tuesday nancy and sluggo played homeless couple a 
homeless man offered to share his meal of popcorn with ziggy and 
marmaduke befriended homeless dogs 
the whole purpose of this is to draw attention to the plight of 
the homeless to make people aware that something needs to be 
done said bill day a syndicated detroit free press cartoonist 
who was one of more than 100 comicstrip and editorial cartoonists 
to participate in the project 
the wealthy can afford lobbying groups i feel the purpose of 
the cartoonist is to help those who cant afford a lobby said 
day who drew a prosperous wellfed uncle sam gazing in the mirror 
and seeing a gauntfaced version of himself labeled the homeless 
holding his coat together at the neck there are no official counts 
of the number of homeless but national estimates range from 350000 
to more than 3 million according to the national low income housing 
coalition an organizer of the project 
some of the artists got their messages across through humor 
others used irony or exaggeration some of the cartoons were 
political taking aim at the presidential campaign or washington 
posturing 
garry trudeaus doonesbury simply focused on the humanity of 
a panhandling couple alice and elmont when a tired elmont mistakes 
his wife for a rival on his corner he apologizes by explaining he 
mistook her for some gorgeous hooker and she goes off pleased 
other cartoonists relied on the naivete of outsiders be they 
children or observers from a different time like hagar the viking 
dik browne hagars creator has his hero and his wife in front of a 
fortune teller who predicts one day millions of people will be 
homeless and millions of others who could easily help will just 
turn away 
responds the fierce viking and they call me horrible 
in the middletons by ralph bunagin and dana summers a child 
watches as his mother puts change in a street persons cup after 
she explains the man is homeless and the money is for food the 
youngster says gosh hed get more to eat if i gave him my 
trickortreat bag 
some of the cartoons had a distinctly political cast partisan or 
not 
in cathy guisewaites cathy her mom is shown listening to a 
campaign speech and getting more and more agitated at the 
politicians rhetoric finally when he declares that hell invest 
in a strong defense to keep the country safe for the homeless she 
explodes telling him to go to bed without dinner and announcing 
this country doesnt need a president it needs a mother 
the arizona republics steve bensen contributed an editorial 
cartoon showing a dukakis figure sitting on a heating grate in 
sidewalk in front of the white house with a shopping cart filled 
with dukakis jackson and other campaign signs above the drawing it 
says cartoonist homeless prject hes a painful reminder of 
whats wrong with america abandoned homeless living on the 
streets lets keep him that way below the drawing it says 
vote bush nov 8th 
but some cartoonists were able to find a touch of humor like 
mell lazarus of momma in that strip mommas son raids her 
refrigerator because he doesnt have any food at his apartment 
momma tells him francis do you realize there are people in this 
country who are totally homeless while you have two of them 
if a kid tells his parents hey look all the comics are about 
homeless people today we will at least have raised their 
consciousness lazarus said

saying americas debt to military men and women 
doesnt end the day the uniform comes off president reagan 
signed legislation tuesday giving veterans a cabinetlevel voice for 
the first time 
im saying to all our veterans what i say to new cabinet 
members welcome aboard said reagan the selfproclaimed enemy 
of an expanding federal government who once suggested abolishing 
the departments of education and energy 
sitting under a sparkling autumnal sun in front of a columned 
building of the national war college at fort mcnair the president 
signed into law the bill creating the department of veterans 
affairs effective march 15 
spokesmen for veterans organizations applauded the elevation of 
veterans issues in the councils of government but noted that the 
legislation offers no increases in compensation or improvements in 
health care 
cooper t holt executive director of the washington office of 
the veterans of foreign wars said he recalled the day last nov 
10 that reagan signaled he had accepted cabinetlevel status for 
veterans 
there were several of us over there at the white house and we 
came prepared to make a case holt recalled in a telephone 
interview but when he came in he apparently had decided against 
some of his advisers and he said he wanted to do it 
supporters of the legislation had argued that the veterans 
administration already has the fifthlargest budget among federal 
agencies and merits being put on par with other cabinet departments 
there are some 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or 
survivors although only about 25 to 3 million of them rely on 
veterans administration services on a regular basis the agency has 
a 30 billion budget and it will disburse 14 billion in income 
maintenance and 626 million for education and rehabilitation 
assistance this year 
reagan said the bill gives veterans what they have deserved so 
long a seat at the table of our national affairs 
flanked by leaders of congressional committees on military 
affairs and accompanied by defense secretary frank c carlucci and 
adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff he said 
ive said before that americas debt to those who would fight for 
her defense doesnt end the day the uniform comes off for the 
security of our nation it must not end 
the house and senate paying electionyear homage to veterans 
had both given overwhelming approval to the bill among other 
things it will place a secretary of veterans affairs on the 
cabinet create the position of deputy secretary and as many as a 
halfdozen assistant secretaries 
i dont expect that it is going to produce any miracles said 
hf sparky gierke national commander of the american legion 
its not going to be an overnight change 
gierke said that despite the creation of a larger agency with 
another layer of highranking assistants the measure would not 
consign veterans problems to a mammoth bureaucracy we hope it 
will run more efficiently he said 
the vast majority of veterans do not get compensation from the 
va and the vast majority of veterans do not use its health care 
facilities said mary stout president of the vietnam veterans of 
america but we think there are a lot of problems for the people 
who have to rely on these services and we did support the 
elevation of the agency 
ms stout a vietnam veteran said she hoped any additional clout 
enjoyed by a secretary of veterans affairs would help those seeking 
compensation from the government for illnesses they say are 
connected to the spraying of the chemical defoliant agent orange in 
vietnam 
its not so much giving more voice as it is we hope giving 
more accountability for the administration of veterans programs 
she said 
holt said were delighted this has really been a priority goal 
for a long time 
spokesmen for the veterans organizations said they hoped to use 
the new cabinet seat as a bully pulpit from which they can combat 
continuing pressure for cuts in veterans benefits as well as other 
domestic programs

the communist party admitted tuesday that its 
3yearold antialcoholism campaign has created long lines at liquor 
stores and led to a moonshining business that has left sugar and 
candy in short supply 
tass the official news agency said the partys policymaking 
central committee adopted a resolution reviewing president mikhail 
s gorbachevs drive to sober up this nation of 284 million people 
none of the soviet media said when the resolution was approved 
according to tass the resolution said the campaign has reduced 
drinking on the job and in public places improved family life and 
cut alcoholrelated crime 
but it added that radical changes have not yet been achieved 
sugar and candy shortages developed as moonshiners hoarded sugar 
to make what they call in russian samogon 
the antialcoholism campaign has caused nationwide disgruntlement 
and rationing of sugar in many areas 
radio moscow said the rush to curtail sales of alcohol led to 
profiteering poisonings and drug addiction 
the soviet press has been full of reports of these problems but 
the resolution was one of the frankest official admissions of the 
programs faults 
while saying drunkenness must still be fought vigorously the 
central committee ordered ministries to stamp out alcoholic 
queues according to radio moscow 
lines stretching for blocks are common at liquor stores and other 
shops where alcohol is sold throughout the soviet union 
the reports did not say how the long lines would be eliminated 
but said alcohol sales would not be permitted near schools 
factories recreation areas or on public transport 
the trud labor daily said on oct 6 that the kremlin plans next 
year to produce more beer wine cognac and champagne to meet 
popular demand it said vodka and other strong drinks would continue 
to be manufactured in limited quantities 
in may 1985 gorbachev ordered a cut in production of alcoholic 
beverages an increase in their price an increase in the minimum 
drinking age to 21 and cuts in the hours and number of stores that 
could sell the products

the energy department should value its planned 
sale of a synthetic gas plant in north dakota as worth 200 million 
instead of the 600 million figure it has advertised according to 
congressional auditors 
even so the sale of the great plains coal gasification plant 
near beulah nd will still yield more than the government could 
expect by operating it over the next 21 years said analysts from 
the general accounting office 
in a report dated oct 21 and received tuesday gao analysts said 
the energy department should not count about 300 million in tax 
credits that the prospective buyer basin electric power 
cooperative has agreed to forgo 
bob porter an energy department spokesman said the department 
had not seen the gao report but as a general matter believes it is 
legitimate to count the value of the tax credits that will not be 
used 
thats cash the government would not have had thats quite 
legitimate porter said 
using figures to calculate the loss of future income from the 
sale of the plants gas at prices forecast by the energy department 
gao calculated the sale as yielding the equivalent of 203 million 
to the government 
that is midway between the respective 284 million and 128 
million figures that two consultants wharton econometrics and data 
resources inc calculated using their forecasts of future energy 
prices 
the value to the government of the future revenues under 
government ownership would be 166 million using department 
projections 230 million using data resources estimates and a loss 
of 54 million using whartons estimates gao said 
the plant cost 21 billion to build and was a technical success 
at turning lignite into pipelinequality gas its builders though 
defaulted on 15 billion in government guaranteed loans leaving 
the energy department to pay off the loans and take over the plant

wall street bankers who buy cocaine on 
their lunch break should be punished along with drug dealers 
smugglers and colombian narcotics barons nancy reagan said tuesday 
the us first lady told a un committee on social affairs the 
united states is responsible for its own drug problem and every 
american drug user is an accomplice to every criminal act every 
murder every terrorist attack carried out by the narcotics 
syndicates 
to get serious about stopping illegal drugs that means 
confronting all those citizens who use drugs mrs reagan said 
and if the united states cannot conquer the demand for narcotics 
there is little hope of halting production and smuggling 
her advice to all drug users from poor children to affluent 
adults both here and abroad was just say no the slogan of 
the antidrug program she sponsors 
it is often easier to make strong speeches about foreign drug 
lords or drug smugglers than to arrest a pair of wall street 
investment bankers buying cocaine on their lunch break she said 
in her address to the un third committee on social and 
humanitarian affairs 
during his eight years in office president reagan has advocated 
a war on drug producers in latin america and elsewhere along with 
interdiction of drugs being smuggled into the united states 
his wife said tuesday stopping drug use in the united states is 
as important as halting the production and smuggling of illegal 
narcotics 
while most of the illegal drugs are imported the drug users 
are homegrown she said 
if we lack the will to fully mobilize the forces of law in our 
own country to arrest and punish drug users if we cannot stem the 
american demand for drugs then there will be little hope of 
preventing foreign drug producers from fulfilling that demand 
drugs must remain illegal at every step in the chain

journal as saying it is indisputable that dukakis shifted the 
money 
and michael dukakis says george bush is running a campaign of 
lies a narrator asks michael dukakis is unbelievable 
dukakis and bush each are running a mix of positive and attack

where children come out to play without fear of drugs or drug 
dealers is that too much to expect as president michael dukakis 
will be on your side hell declare a real war on drugs double the 
number of drug agents and slash aid to countries that allow drug 
traffic 
another spot shows a supermarket checkout counter and asks 
viewers to imagine a place where families dont have to stretch 
two paychecks for the life one paycheck used to bring is that too 
much to expect as president michael dukakis will be on your side 
hes committed to giving earning power back to the american worker 
the other two focus on the elderly to those who would cut 
social security hell say never and hell back full costofliving 
adjustments and on jobs hell forge a partnership of 
business labor and government to take on the toughest foreign 
competition and make america number one again

us sen brock adams who was accused by an aide 
of sexually assaulting her was back on the campaign trail for 
fellow democrats tuesday but is limiting appearances so he doesnt 
hurt their chances an assistant said 
we are aware there are people out there who want to exploit the 
situation and we dont want to play into their hands said steve 
elmendorf adams executive assistant 
prosecutors have declined to charge adams dwash with any 
crimes because of a lack of physical evidence and problems with the 
credibility of kari tupper 26 the woman who accused him police 
records have shown 
tupper a former secretary for the house aging committee who now 
lives in seattle claimed that adams drugged her by putting 
something in her drink at his home on march 27 1987 and then took 
her to bed 
adams accused ms tupper whose parents had been close friends of 
his of trying to blackmail him for 400000 in hush money 
adams denied making any sexual advances but said he made a mistake 
letting the woman stay at his home 
elmendorf said no candidates have asked adams to stay away but 
that adams doesnt want to put them in an uncomfortable situation 
brock is realistic and he knows what the situation is said 
elmendorf his overriding interest is to elect democrats from one 
end of the ticket to the other and to allow extraneous side issues 
to become part of the campaign is in no ones interest we wont let 
it happen 
adams has declined to join a sixcity tour planned by democratic 
candidates 
adams who was transportation secretary under president carter 
in 1986 unseated republican slade gorton who is making a comeback

of northwest colombia tuesday killing 13 people and wounding 14 
officials reported 
the casualties brought to 51 the number of people killed in 
guerrilla attacks since sunday night

aimed at averting a oneday general strike set for thursday 
the simon bolivar front an umbrella group for all six leftist 
rebel factions in colombia urged president virgilio barco to start 
peace talks with the guerrillas 
cesar gaviria minister of government issued a statement tuesday 
said the proposal was made in a message sent to the president a day 
earlier 
guerrillas who support the strike call blew up the bus tuesday 
morning near peque a town of 7000 people about 200 miles northwest 
of the capital of bogota 
the guerrillas set off dynamite in the road as the bus was going 
by the armys 4th brigade said in a communique from its 
headquarters in medellin 
an election for mayor was held last sunday in peque the police 
had been guarding the town against guerrilla attack and the election

a recordbreaking year in gifts to 
smith college bears out a study that found alumnae of womens 
schools give more to their alma maters than graduates of 
coeducational schools fundraisers said tuesday 
graduates of the elite school gave 171 million in donations in 
fiscal 1987 together with donations from friends parents 
corporations and foundations smith received 28 million for the 
year 
the gifts are a record for a womens college and the envy of 
other schools 
i applaud them said jeff bradley senior writer in 
development at harvard universitys undergraduate college which 
last year received 278 million from its 20400 pre1976 graduates 
but it was no surprise to another of the prestigious seven 
sisters schools mount holyoke in south hadley which received 18 
million from its 24000 alumnae and other donors in fiscal 1987 
mount holyoke was rated 11th in the nation last year in the 
percentage of graduates 586 who give donations the percentage 
of alumnae who gave to smith in fiscal 1987 was not available 
people have always said women will not give they cannot 
give its a mans decision where the money goes said eileen 
elliott director of annual giving at mount holyoke but women 
realize the value of their education and are giving back to provide 
the same standard of excellence for the future 
a recent study by the womens college coalition of washington 
dc a private nonprofit group representing 70 schools found 
that graduates of womens colleges are nearly twice as likely to 
give to their schools as are men and women graduates of 
coeducational schools 
in 198687 almost 40 percent of women who attended singlesex 
colleges contributed to their alma maters the study said 
it also found that the gifts of alumnae of womens colleges are 
an average 26 percent larger than those to other colleges 
the study looked at fund raising at 51 womens colleges and 354 
private coeducational colleges as reported to the council for aid to 
education which releases an annual report on voluntary support of 
education the fiscal years studied were 197677 198182 and 
198687 
mary huchette associate director of the coalition said 
graduates of womens colleges generally earn more than women who 
attend coeducational institutions which may account in part for the 
higher level of giving another factor may be effective fund raising 
by the womens colleges 
women also have more say over the disposition of individual and 
family wealth than in the past huchette said

george bush strove tuesday to maintain a hefty lead in the polls 
charging that michael dukakis is appealing to division fear and 
envy in his comeback bid said dukakis were just working hard 
and were going to win 
the two rivals clashed in commericals and campaign rhetoric as 
fresh nationwide surveys rated bush the doubledigit leader two 
weeks before election day 
the vice president said in ohio that dukakis was an advocate for 
economic policies far outside the mainstream policies that 
resemble european socialism more than american free enterprise and 
his aides previewed a television commercial accusing the democratic 
presidential candidate of deliberately misleading voters about his 
record as governor 
dukakis renewed his own complaints about republican ads as he 
campaigned on the ground in california and on television through 
commercials and a 90minute appearance on abcs nightline 
now theyve got a tank ad has all kinds of misstatements and 
outright falsehoods dukakis said we democrats are for a strong 
defense 
democratic running mate lloyd bentsen added his voice he said 
that in their ads republicans accuse dukakis of opposing the 
stealth bomber and the pershing ii missile and thats a lie and 
they know it he said 
a survey by cbs and the new york times gave bush a 5441 lead 
among probable voters the gallup organization had the race at 5339 
among likely voters in calls made friday through sunday both 
surveys had margins of potential sampling error of plus or minus 
three percentage points 
the surveys indicated bush has solidified his advantage in the 
two weeks since the last presidential debate 
but even before the surveys were released dukakis aides were 
busy trying to cast doubt on the results these aides speaking on 
condition they not be identified said internal campaign polling 
showed a sixpoint lead for the republican ticket down from 10 
points last week they said dukakis recent populiststyle rhetoric 
and allegations of republican campaign lies were scoring points 
spokesman dayton duncan added our polling shows by an 
overwhelming margin people are blaming bush for this negative 
campaign 
the campaign air war was relentless 
bushs aides previewed a commercial saying dukakis deliberately 
misled debate viewers when he denied that hed taken money from 
the massachusetts pension fund to help balance the state budget 
and michael dukakis says george bush is running a campaign of 
lies a narrator asks michael dukakis is unbelievable 
dukakis countered with a series of four commercials showing 
himself and bentsen and asking viewers to imagine a better america 
as president michael dukakis will be on your side says the 
narrator 
bush dispatched surrogates to rebut democratic charges of unfair 
campaign tactics 
among them was vice presidential candidate dan quayle who said 
desperate democrats were dishing out political sludge with 
dukakis active encouragement he branded the entire operation 
despicable and said bush was a man of unshakable integrity and 
fairness 
bush sought personally to deflect democratic charges that he 
stood for the wealthy at the expense of the less well off 
we will move forward not by succumbing to the base temptations 
of division fear and envy but by following as abraham lincoln 
said those better angels of our nature he told a breakfast in 
columbus 
bush said dukakis had been making increasing appeals to class 
conflict and said that in his view there was no place in 
american life for philosophies that divide americans one from 
another along class lines and that excite conflict among them 
the vice president charged his democratic rival was far outside 
the mainstream of economic thinking and hes broken with the 
american tradition of entrepreneurship and free enterprise 
the gop nominee said dukakis favors an industrial policy of 
control that has been tried and rejected as unsuccessful in europe 
around the world governments are abandoning socialism moving 
away from socialistic high control experience and embracing the 
american model of low taxation entrepreneurship and individual 
intitative 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff asked if the vice president 
was calling dukakis a socialist said that would be going too 
far 
campaign surrogates were making their customary rounds 
senate gop leader bob dole was in pennsylvania predicting a 
republican victory and taunting dukakis that he deserved a rip van 
winkle award he just sort of went to sleep there for about six 
or eight weeks and when he woke up the election was over said 
dole who lost out to bush in the springtime race for the gop 
presidential nomination 
democratic gov bill clinton of arkansas agreed that dukakis made 
a mistake by failing to respond to bushs attacks for weeks at a 
time he disagreed with dole that the race was over praised the 
democrats latest round of television commercials and said i 
would have done it eight weeks ago 
dukakis began airing a series of television commercials last 
weekend that charged the bush campaign with distortions and lies 
his campaign also purchased time for a fiveminute paid 
advertisement on nbc late tuesday night that duplicated a commercial 
aired saturday night on abc in it dukakis accused bush of running 
a campaign of fear and of smear and pledged to fight for main 
street americans

lisa steinberg the 6yearold whose death last 
year elicited an outpouring of grief and rage was a murder victim 
brutally battered by the only father she ever knew a prosecutor 
charged tuesday 
joel steinberg beat lisa so severely that he inflicted those 
injures which caused her death said assistant district attorney 
peter casolaro in a 30minute statement at the start of steinbergs 
murder trial we expect to show by the evidence that he killed 
that child 
casolaro told the panel graphic and grotesque evidence and 
testimony will prove steinberg murdered lisa who was found 
unconscious in the steinberg apartment early nov 2 1987 and died 
of her injuries three days later 
the prosecutor told the jury the firstgrader had bruises on her 
chest legs arms and neck along with head injuries caused by 
bluntforce trauma when she arrived at the hospital that 
morning police officers there noticed steinbergs wounded bleeding 
knuckles he said 
as casolaro detailed the childs injuries lisas biological 
mother michele launders sat crying in the front row of the 
courtroom 
steinberg 47 once a respected millionaire defense lawyer is 
charged with seconddegree murder in the death of the child he 
adopted illegally at birth from ms launders then an unmarried 
teenager he has denied ever hitting lisa 
steinbergs attorney ira london urging the jury to concentrate 
on the facts and not his clients morality maintained in his 
10minute argument that the evidence in the muchanticipated trial 
will not support a murder charge 
he called on the jury to acquit steinberg based on the evidence 
and launched an attack on hedda nussbaum steinbergs longtime 
livein companion who was called the single most important 
witness in this case by trial judge harold rothwax 
it will not be proven in this case that lisa steinberg was 
murdered nor will it be proven that lisa was a battered child 
london told the jury lisa was neither sullen or withdrawn she 
was a vital active and engaging child until her death 
in an effort to undercut ms nussbaums expected testimony 
london called her delusional mentioned she had spent the last 
year in a psychiatric hospital and alluded to her selfdestructive 
romance with satanic cults and sadomasochistic behavior 
casolaro painted ms nussbaum as a victim of steinberg as well 
he exploited her weakness of mind and her emotional problems the 
defendant beat and broke miss nussbaum until she had become nothing 
more than his willing servant 
ms nussbaum 46 has a cooperation agreement with the manhattan 
district attorneys office to testify although she has told 
prosecutors she did not see steinberg strike lisa the day she fell 
unconscious 
she was charged along with steinberg in lisas death but was 
never indicted and the charges will probably be dropped the 
district attorneys office said after her arrest she underwent 
surgery and psychiatric treatment for injuries allegedly inflicted 
by steinberg 
the trial is expected to last four to eight weeks 
following opening arguments police officer james botte the 
first person to arrive at the steinberg apartment and see the 
unconscious girl testified the home was dirty unkempt and dark 
when he arrived 
his testimony was corroborated by the next witness paramedic 
john filangeri who added that when he asked steinberg to bring a 
lamp into the room the defendant replied is that really 
important 
filangeri also testified that ms nussbaum answered the front 
door when he arrived at the apartment and described her battered 
condition 
she appeared to be 70 to 80 years of age she had numerous 
facial injuries some old some new filangeri recalled she had 
gray hair and was stooped 
lisas 16monthold brother mitchell was found in the apartment 
sitting in a dirty diaper and tethered to a playpen authorities 
have said the boy was also illegally adopted and now lives with 
his birth mother 
in steinbergs version of what happened the night of nov 1 
1987 lisa became sick after eating and the bruises on her back and 
chest resulted from his efforts to revive her after she fell 
unconscious in their home 
no help was called for lisa until after 630 am on nov 2 
court records show lisa was pronounced brain dead on nov 5 
the slaying of the girl drew national attention and produced a 
citywide outpouring of grief for the girl and rage against 
steinberg the doorway of her greenwich village home was turned into 
a virtual shrine filled with flowers gifts and poems from people 
who never knew lisa 
her wake and funeral drew tremendous crowds of strangers many of 
them with tears in their eyes groups which support battered 
children seized on lisa as a martyr whose death symbolized the 
plight of abused children across the country

the chief witness against bess myerson admitted 
tuesday that there were numerous differences between her previous 
sworn statements and what she has told the jury at the former miss 
americas divorcefixing trial 
miss myersons attorney got sukhreet gabel to concede that 10 
things she told the jury last week about a conversation she had with 
miss myerson in 1986 were not in a detailed memo she wrote shortly 
after the meeting 
ms gabel is the daughter of former state supreme court justice 
hortense gabel 75 who is on trial with miss myerson 64 and miss 
myersons boyfriend carl andy capasso 43 
they are charged with conspiracy mail fraud and briberelated 
charges 
in later testimony ms gabel said her mother once described miss 
myerson as a delightful cuckoo 
miss myerson once the citys cultural affairs commissioner is 
accused of giving ms gabel 39 a 19000ayear city job to 
influence her mothers decisions in capassos divorce 
under questioning by the prosecution last week ms gabel 
testified that while a grand jury was investigating the 
circumstances of how she got her job miss myerson appeared at her 
apartment invited her for a walk and told her keep your mouth 
shut 
prosecutors charge that miss myerson obstructed justice in 
allegedly trying to keep ms gabel from testifying truthfully to the 
grand jury 
but myerson attorney frederick hafetz underscored numerous 
inconsistencies in ms gabels most damaging testimony against miss 
myerson 
in a sworn statement she gave last year ms gabel who left the 
department of cultural affairs in 1984 said miss myersons 
appearance at her apartment on june 18 1986 was out of the 
blue and added i didnt want to have anything to do with her 
but hafetz noted that a week before the night ms gabel said she 
talked with her old boss she had written miss myerson seeking a 
recommendation to law school 
when hafetz asked if that was a change from her testimony that 
she didnt want to have anything to do with miss myerson the 
witness said no and then blurted out i would characterize 
it as politics makes strange bedfellows 
us district judge john keenan warned ms gabel against 
volunteering information under oath 
stop volunteering answers he lectured if you do it one 
more time im going to get a little angry now stop it 
hafetz also got ms gabel to admit that she wrote a detailed memo 
to her lawyer shortly after the alleged walk and talk with miss 
myerson but 10 of the statements she attributed to miss myerson in 
her trial testimony such as you can make a lot of trouble 
weve got to get our stories straight and youve got to keep 
your mouth shut were not included in the memo 
at the time she submitted the memo ms gabel conceded she told 
her lawyer that she had not left out anything substantive 
and ms gabel admitted that in an interview with defense lawyers 
before the trial she said there was no attempt by miss myerson to 
subvert governmental processes and agreed that miss myerson did 
not ask her to change her memory

a us navy band played god bless 
america and sailors from the frigate uss simpson marched in review 
tuesday as grenadians celebrated the fifth anniversary of a us 
invasion that ousted a marxist junta 
navy secretary william ball iii and other us officials joined a 
crowd of about 1500 for a military parade in the queens park 
sports stadium to mark the invasion oct 25 is now known as 
thanksgiving day on the island and is a national holiday 
the american marchers were joined by grenadas police force and 
coast guard a police unit marched in a formation that made the 
number 5 for the anniversary 
a message from presdident reagan read by ball said grenada had 
made major progress since 1983 paid tribute to the 19 american 
servicemen killed in the invasion of the nation twice the size of 
washington dc and declared the grenada that we know today a 
free peaceful country is the best confirmation that those lives 
were not lost in vain 
the united states joined by seven eastern caribbean nations that 
provided token forces sent 6000 marines and paratroopers to 
grenada to expel a marxist military junta that had seized power in a 
coup 
six days earlier soldiers had executed prime minister maurice 
bishop and 10 other officials of his leftist government killed 
scores of bystanders with mortars and automatic weapons and placed 
the country under 24hour curfew 
bishop was overthrown as a result of factional feuding within his 
government 
it was the first us military intervention in the caribbean in 
two decades and was widely criticized abroad as a violation of 
grenadas sovereignty 
the reagan administration said the invasion was mounted at the 
request of the organization of eastern caribbean states which 
feared cuba would use grenada as a staging area communist aggression 
in the region cuba denied any aggressive aims in grenada 
grenadas 94100 residents generally regard the invasion which 
the reagan administration called a rescue mission as a 
liberation from repression and nearanarchy 
in a speech tuesday prime minister herbert blaize chided 
grenadians who were on their knees in 1983 but had forgotten 
the deliverance that god had worked for them 
it was god who sent the americans and caribbean forces to 
deliver them blaize said 
prime minister eugenia charles of dominica one of the caribbean 
leaders supporting the invasion said it was undertaken to restore 
democracy and order and to safeguard us citizens on the island 
but above all was necessary to save our own skins 
a memorial service was held at the st georges university school 
of medicine on grand anse beach where 480 american students were 
evacuated by helicopter 
a bronze monument on the campus bears the names of the 19 us 
servicemen who died in the operation fortyfour grenadians and 24 
cubans also were killed 
since the invasion the united states has poured 110 million 
into grenada to finish an international airport started by cuba 
pave hundreds of miles of potholed roads and improve electricity 
telephone and water systems 
parliamentary democracy is wellestablished and tourism has 
improved but not to the extent expected just after the invasion 
a hopedfor flood of us investment has not materialized and the 
islands economy based on agriculture continues to struggle 
other americans at the ceremony included vice adm joseph 
metcalf commander of the invasion maj gen robert milligan chief 
of us armed forces in the caribbean richard h melton deputy 
assistant secretary of state for the caribbean and ford cooper 
charge daffaires at the us embassy

federal investigators on tuesday blamed a quick 
turn during takeoff for the crash of an avair commuter plane last 
february at raleighdurham nc airport 
the national transportation safety board said the pilot of the 
aircraft maneuvered too sharply at low altitude resulting in the 
loss of control and crash that killed 12 people on board 
the avair commuter plane flying as american eagle flight 378 
crashed shortly after it departed the airport in dense fog on feb 
19 l988 landing in a wooded area about a mile from the runway 
the fairchild metro iii commuter was bound for richmond va 
with 10 passengers a pilot and a copilot 
the national transportation safety board said the probable cause 
for the accident was the failure of the flight crew to maintain a 
proper flight path due to the first officers inappropriate 
instrument scan the captains inadequate monitoring of the flight 
and the flight crews response to a fault in the airplanes stall 
avoidance system 
the investigation revealed that the copilot kathleen digan 28 
who had been hired by avair in may 1987 had a spotty training 
record and on a number of occasions had been the subject of poor 
evaluations by various avair captains 
in september 1987 another avair captain reported in an 
evaluation that ms digan had problems in climb cruise descent and 
landing maneuvers two months before that another captain wrote 
avairs operations director on hotel stationery that he considered 
ms digans performance in landing his airplane unacceptable and 
that on their trip she had trouble with eight of 10 landings 
the ntsb criticized avair which no longer operates commuter 
flights for not acting sooner to deal with ms digans flying 
problems it also said the faas failure to monitor adequately 
avairs financial and operational problems was a contributing factor 
to the feb 19 accident 
avair which since l985 had a marketing agreement with american 
airlines underwent rapid growth in l987 after american expanded its 
hub operation at raleighdurham it hired 123 pilots in the second 
quarter of l987 alone and by l988 about 60 percent of its pilots 
had less than a year with the company 
but avair began having financial problems in late l987 filed for 
protection under the bankruptcy laws on jan 15 l988 and ceased 
operation only to resume flights on feb 3 about two weeks before 
the crash last may avair sold its commuter operations to american 
airlines which continues to fly those operations under the name 
american eagle 
investigators determined that ms digan was at the controls when 
the metro iii commuter plane departed raleighdurham on feb 19 
although there was evidence that the captain walter cole 38 
attempted to help keep the aircraft aloft in the final seconds 
flight 378 had been told by air traffic control to bank to the 
right as soon as possible after takeoff because of the heavy traffic 
loads at the time of the departure investigators said 
but ms digan the investigation concluded banked the aircraft 
too sharply and at too low an altitude about a 40 degree bank only 
200 feet off the ground or nearly twice as sharp as would have been 
advised 
the plane was relying on instruments because of the heavy fog and 
the ntsb concluded that if the pilots had scanned their instruments 
adequately they would have known their bank was too sharp and at too 
low an altitude 
the ntsb report said the pilots also might have been distracted 
by a light indicating that the aircrafts stall warning system had 
activated the system automatically forces the nose down if the 
aircraft is approaching a stall situation 
but according to the investigation the aircrafts performance 
indicated that the stall warning system actually had not deployed 
but that the problem stemmed from a false warning light

government leaders will meet in 
emergency session this week on yugoslavias economic crisis tanjug 
news agency announced tuesday 
it said the cabinet and ninemember collective presidency will 
meet in joint session friday 
only two such meetings have been held since the communists came 
to power after world war ii in april 1981 and november 1985 
the mere fact that the presidency has decided to convene the 
joint session indicates the gravity of the situation facing our 
countrys economy tanjug said

government will introduce a completely new marketoriented 
economic system 
the plan which could be adopted by parliament by the end of the 
year envisages closing down all moneylosing firms the wide

worst economic crisis since world war ii 
the nations inflation rate is running at more than 217 percent 
the highest in europe yugoslavia has a 21 billion foreign debt and 
a 15 percent unemployment rate 
labor dissatisfaction has grown worse since may when government 
austerity measures chopped wagwes and allowed substantial price 
increases 
about half of the nations companies employing about 2 million 
workers are losing money and layoffs could trigger more social 
restivity

more than 30000 slavs and montenegrins have left kosovo since 
1981 when at least nine people were killed in ethnic violence 
yugoslavia has six republics with two autonomous provinces 
kosovo and vojvodina that are part of serbia

confidence to the presidency and 15 of the 20 members of the 
government after a 12hour debate on charges the government 
overstepped its authority by ordering police to break up a 
demonstration in titograd the capital of the republic 
it said lazar djodic the republics interior secretary was 
among the five not given a vote of confidence but did not say if 
that meant he and the others would have to resign

that it would be something that you would remember the rest of your 
life 
the idea of a father abusing a daughter is a horrendous 
situation one you wish that would never occur but unfortunatley it 
does occur its a tragic situation 
so you would want me to have the baby even though my whole life 
would be ruined and i could be mentally affected she asked later 
i would hope that the baby would live he said i would 
just like to see the baby have an opportunity 
quayle was answering abortion questions again on tuesday in his 
plane to tampa fla

pregnant he hoped she would elect to have the baby and not have the 
abortion

choice i told her what i would like but its her choice i cant 
tell my wife what to do in that situation 
she would have that choice under the law as it is now

lloyd bentsen visiting the farm community 
where his grandfather first settled in america renewed his 
counterattack tuesday against what he called republican lies and 
distortions about democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
they say governor dukakis opposes the stealth bomber and im 
here to tell you thats a lie and they know it bentsen said 
they say governor dukakis opposed deployment of the pershing ii 
missile and thats a lie and they know it he said 
the democrats and republicans plan to spend the same amount on 
defense but the democrats would spend those dollars smarter 
he said for planes that fly guns that work ammunition and spare 
parts 
i think the american people want better than lies and 
distortions in this campaign he said challenging bush to drop 
his ads attacking dukakis defense positions 
the texas senator who usually campaigns in states with the most 
electoral votes was in a state with the fewest three he spoke in 
a school auditorium to a crowd that was about double the white 
sd population of 474 and was greeted like a team at a 
homecoming with a band pompon girls and loud cheering 
shops around town had greetings in the windows and one street 
was renamed bentsen blvd for the day 
the senator dropped by the palace cafe and hotel to visit with 
some elderly women from the town who went to school with bentsens 
94yearold father lloyd sr they told of still receiving gifts of 
fruit from the elder bentsen who now lives near mcallen texas 
getting his father on the phone after a while the senator 
assured him they even told some good things about you the phone 
got handed around the table and they talked of the oneteacher 
school where lloyd sr made it through the fifth grade 
the luncheonettes special of the day the bentsen burger which 
at three bucks included potatoes vegetable dessert and coffee 
bentsen helped dedicate the historical museum for the town which 
was surrounded by sheep cattle and the fields where bentsen said 
his grandfather peter first homesteaded after arriving from denmark 
in 1887 the family survived the first winter in a sod hut by 
burning straw for heat 
back on the subject of the election he said the republicans 
campaign robs the heart of democracy it deprives you of the 
opportunity to judge the issues and the candidates 
as the democrats spent critical weeks developing solutions to 
problems such as health care education and housing all the 
while our opponents campaigned with a total disregard for the 
truth he said it was the first time bentsen has offered a reason 
why the democrats failed to quickly counter the republican attacks 
bentsen delivered the same message later in the day after 
arriving at a west fargo nd rally on a stagecoach 
wearing blue jeans a leather jacket and a western hat bentsen 
and a local farmer named jim haugland drove a team of four 
clydesdales into a livestock show area while more than 700 
supporters hollered their approval 
bentsens visit tuesday to the dakotas and montana was the second 
trip to the region by the democratic ticket since he and michael 
dukakis stopped in minot nd immediately after the democratic 
convention in july dukakis had a rally in fargo earlier this month 
bentsen told reporters on his campaign jet that while there were 
only 10 electoral votes between the three states it might make 
the difference 
nobody has paid any attention to these states he said

north dakota gov george sinner and sen max baucus dmont 
joined bentsen on stage at the school which had an enormous 
american flag as a backdrop

smashed into a desert hillside killing the five lawmen and three 
guardsmen aboard officials said tuesday

southern california sheriffs departments and the federal 
government said national guard maj steve mensik

dale a musegades the chief patrol agent for the el centro 
border patrol sector said a border patrol vehicle that was not 
involved in operation border ranger was a few hundred yards from 
the crash scene it is common practice for border patrol agents to 
dim their lights and park while on patrol he added

out the vehicle musegades said 
imperial county sheriffs lt kenneth j koon said the helicopter 
smashed into the rocky foothills of the laguna mountains at 930

very little left of the aircraft and its going to be difficult to 
put it the accident together koon said 
in washington chief pentagon spokesman dan howard said the crash 
was observed by a spotter helicopter an oh58 that was flying at a 
higher altitude 
five deputies from four southern california counties and a 
threeman california army national guard crew were aboard the 
helicopter 
asked if the joint operation was the first of its kind koon 
said to our knowledge yes certainly anything to this magnitude 
involving working relationships between that number of agencies for 
a single operation 
questioned about the status of the program he replied thats 
a decision that will have to made by the sheriffs who put it 
together but i think its a job thats going to have to be done 
one way or another 
all of the victims died instantly when the fire broke out 
according to a sheriffs department statement 
the bodies have been recovered and deputies are guarding the 
crash scene pending arrival of a team of safety investigators from 
the army safety center in fort rucker ala and the national guard

as it has done for three consecutive years 
the general assembly on tuesday voted to support a world court 
ruling against us aid to nicaraguan rebels and urged washington to 
obey the court 
the vote was 892 with 48 abstentions on the resolution calling 
on the united states to comply with the 1986 world court ruling 
against us funding of antigovernment insurgents 
the united states and israel voted against the resolution as 
they have in the past in the 159nation general assembly other 
nations were absent 
last year the vote was 942 with 48 abstentions 
the netherlands supported nicaragua tuesday changing its vote 
from last years abstention other nations which voted for nicaragua 
last year were absent or abstaining this year and observers said it 
was not a clearcut gain for either side 
us ambassador herbert s okun the deputy permanent us 
representative told the assembly that repeated consideration of the 
item makes no contribution to peace in central america and said 
the item should be stricken from the agenda 
the us vote against this resolution is not a vote against the 
international court of justice okun said it is a vote against 
a wornout issue that is translated by the government of nicaragua 
into support for a repressive sandinista government 
okun called the resolution counterproductive and said 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government has increased its 
repression of democracy during the past year 
the united states argues that the international court of justice 
the world courts formal name lacks jurisdiction in the case 
because all parties to a dispute must accept jurisdiction and the 
us government has rejected it 
the world court statute does not require any state to accept 
jurisdiction and the court operates on the basis of concensus and 
acceptance of its authority 
in 1986 the world court ruled that continued us financing of 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras constituted interference in 
nicaraguas internal affairs the world court is the primary un 
legal body and each un member agrees to abide by its rulings 
the resolution identical to that submitted last year says that 
all states are obliged under international law not to intervene in 
the internal affairs of other states 
the nicaraguan resolution urgently calls for full and immediate 
compliance by the united states with the court ruling and says that 
the general assembly will consider the issue again next year

would arrive at the gym with a 6foot9 330pound weight lifter he 
introduced as big steve 
when him and steve were together it was like night and day 
said minkow they would tease me about being puny and not able to 
lift weights they would throw me in the pool with my clothes on it 
wasnt the same 
later he said krowpman gave him 1600 to set up his carpet 
cleaning business but began demanding payments of 200 a month plus 
50 per cent of the profits 
he also blurted out that krowpman once tried to molest him and 
said he began paying him after the attempted rape 
minkows lawyer has said minkow who launched his zzzz best 
carpet cleaning company at 16 in his parents garage was beaten and 
threatened by mobsters who used him to perpetuate a 25 million 
stock fraud 
but prosecutors have portrayed minkow as a shrewd con man who 
bilked investors for his own benefit selling them on the future of 
a business that for the most part did not exist 
minkow is charged with 57 counts of securities fraud credit card 
fraud and mail fraud ten of his 12 codefendants including 
krowpman have pleaded guilty to various charges related to the zzzz 
best operation accountant norman rothberg is on trial with minkow 
accused of taking a bribe to cover up zzzz bests frauds 
the husky darkhaired minkow appeared nervous in his initial 
moments on the stand as his lawyer david kenner asked him to 
admit he had done the acts charged in the indictment there were 
long pauses and he bowed his head as if ashamed before he answered 
asked if he had made false claims for his business minkow 
replied softly its true i made those claims and they were all 
lies 
the case is being heard by us district judge dickran tavrizian

fortynine civil rights activists who were pelted 
with rocks and bottles when they marched into virtually allwhite 
forsyth county were awarded nearly 1 million by a jury that found 
the ku klux klan responsible 
a verdict unsealed in us district court on tuesday also found 
11 individuals responsible for attacking the activists who marched 
into the county north of atlanta on jan 17 1987 and were met by 
the counterdemonstrators many of them kkk members or sympathizers 
the jury reached its verdict oct 5 but judge charles a moye 
jr ordered it sealed to give those who brought the lawsuit time to 
decide whether to join atlanta city councilman hosea williams who 
wanted to drop it 
williams who helped organize the march and was among those who 
filed the lawsuit urged toward the end of the trial that it be 
dropped because it would impoverish the families of kkk members 
he said tuesday he would not take any money from the settlement 
irregardless of the courts decision my decision not to accept 
one single penny of my white brothers and sisters possessions is a 
matter of conscience williams said it is also stooping lower 
than the kkk and other white supremacists to take away from them 
their hardearned material possessions simply because they 
brutalized us in responding to the sicknesses of our capitalistic 
society 
in a letter williams sent his fellow marchers during the trial 
he said he had talked to slain civil rights leader martin luther 
king jr and king had told him jesus wanted him not to sue the 
klan 
state rep je billy mckinney who had opposed williams 
effort to drop the lawsuit said williams religion and 
communication with the dead should not interfere with our 
constitutional rights and justice 
named as defendants in the lawsuit were the southern white 
knights of the ku klux klan the invisible empire knights of the ku 
klux klan and 12 individuals 
there had been 57 plaintiffs williams and three others dropped 
out during the trial and four others dropped out tuesday 
the jury awarded 50 to each of the remaining plaintiffs in 
compensatory damages the rest was in punitive damages the lawsuit 
had sought 15 million 
defense attorney jeffrey sliz called the verdict grossly 
unreasonable and said it would be appealed 
i think there is a reasonable chance that the verdict will be 
set aside said sliz attorney for david holland grand dragon of 
the white knights and the southern white knights i was surprised 
at the amount 
the two klan organizations were assessed 400000 each holland 
was ordered to pay 50000 awards from 10 other individuals ranged 
from 30000 to 1000 and the 12th defendant harold palmour was 
judged not liable 
palmour who was shown on film with a rock in his hand during the 
counterdemonstration testified that he had been caught up in 
the emotional confrontation he said he did not mean to do it and 
apologized 
it was the second major award against the kkk in less than two 
years 
in february 1987 a federal jury in alabama awarded beulah mae 
donald 7 million from the united klans of america and six members 
or former members of the group after her son michael donald was 
beaten strangled and hanged in a tree in 1981 at age 19 
the atlanta march was a forerunner to a larger demonstration a 
week later in which an estimated 24000 people turned out state 
local county and federal troops were called out to protect the 
marchers and prevent violence 
a march into the county a year ago commemorating the anniversary 
of the 1987 marches was peaceful

dan quayle told a persistent young reporter 
from a childrens news program he would rather she had a baby than 
abort the fetus if she became pregnant through her father 
thats a difficult question and one that does not have an easy 
answer but my answer would be yes the republican vice 
presidential candidate told an 11yearold reporter for chidrens 
express during a bus tour of illinois last week 
the questionandanswer session was broadcast tuesday on the cbs 
evening news the childrens show is broadcast on public television 
but dont you think it would ruin my whole life its not 
even my fault and my whole life would be ruined the reporter 
asked 
well i dont think that would be the case at all quayle 
said i think that if somebody had an unfortunate experience like 
that it would be something that you would remember the rest of your 
life 
the idea of a father abusing a daughter is a horrendous 
situation one you wish that would never occur but unfortunatley it 
does occur its a tragic situation 
so you would want me to have the baby even though my whole life 
would be ruined and i could be mentally affected she asked later 
i would hope that the baby would live he said i would 
just like to see the baby have an opportunity 
democrat lloyd bentsen the democratic vice presidential 
candidate told another interviewer for the program i would say 
at first that i would try very much to discourage this abortion i 
believe that adoption is the alternative and im an adoptive 
parent i strongly lean towards that but finally i think it 
should be a womans choice 
i would hope very much that she would confer with her clergyman 
that she would confer at length with her physician before making 
that kind of a choice but finally she makes it 
quayle was answering abortion questions again on tuesday in his 
plane to tampa fla 
the indiana senator was asked about a comment the previous day in 
which he said that he hoped if his wife were raped and became 
pregnant he hoped she would elect to have the baby and not have the 
abortion 
asked if that wasnt a prochoice stance he said its her 
choice i told her what i would like but its her choice i cant 
tell my wife what to do in that situation 
she would have that choice under the law as it is now 
written he said

the drought of 1988 was not the economic 
disaster some expected and might turn out to be a bonanza for some 
farmers an agricultural economist said tuesday 
the drought likely will have minimal impact on overall farm 
financial conditions said warren lee of ohio state university 
some people and i would cite those who came into 1988 with crops 
from previous years and the large number of farmers who had normal 
or nearnormal yields theyre having one of their best years in 
10 
lee said theres no question that some farms were hurt or that 
most farmers saw decreases in yields livestock producers in 
particular will suffer because feed prices are increasing in a 
period when selling prices are down 
but about 60 percent of ohios agricultural operations are 
croprelated and while yields are down they are for the most part 
more than offset by crop price increases he said 
your yields may be down 25 percent but prices are up 30 
percent or more he said from that perspective while there may 
be a few isolated cases of the drought pushing an already stressed 
operation over the edge for the most part itll have a neutral 
effect on farm financial issues 
well even see another small rise in farm land prices he 
said 
doug durliat communications director for the ohio farmers 
union said the situation was improving but he disagreed that some 
farmers are having banner years 
droughtrelated losses are not going to be as widespread as 
originally feared durliat said but youll still hear about a 
lot of farmers who were put behind the eightball by this drought 
rep michael oxley rohio said lees assessment was generally 
correct oxley said 7 inches of rain in his district in august 
brought the corn crop back when they had given it up for dead 
the federal government in july declared ohio and several other 
states disaster areas making lowinterest loans available to 
farmers and freeing government stores of feed and federal setaside 
acreage for livestock producers

the treasury department has imposed a sixmonth 
moratorium on allowing companies to capture excess assets through 
termination of their overfunded pension plans 
the department said it directed the internal revenue service on 
monday to delay until may 1 next year approval of pension plan 
terminations in which excess assets would be recovered by employer 
sponsors of the plans 
according to the pension benefit guaranty corp corporate 
sponsors of defined benefit pension plans have recovered a total of 
188 billion since 1980 by terminating 1752 overfunded plans and 
funding their liabilities through annuities or newly established 
plans 
in the first half of 1988 30 companies terminated overfunded 
pension plans recapturing 199 million in excess assets said the 
pbgc a government agency that insures defined benefit pension plan 
participants against losses much like the federal deposit insurance 
crop insures bank depositors 
this moratorium will give congress time to come up with 
legislation that will make certain that workers and retirees get a 
fair share of those funds said sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
metzenbaum sponsored legislation in the last congress to heavily 
tax any surplus pension plan assets that revert to companies through 
terminations as a way to discourage the practice 
the measure was stricken from the tax bill that was passed by 
congress last week in exchange for an agreement by the 
administration to impose the moratorium 
under the current law such reversions are allowed as long as 
vested participants in the plans are assured the pensions accrued to 
them at the time of termination 
unions and advocacy groups for the elderly and pensioners have 
maintained that companies should be prevented from capturing excess 
assets from the plans in order to insure against possible future 
investment losses and provide costofliving increases to pensioners 
business groups whose members have used surplus pension plan 
assets in the past several years as a source of capital have 
opposed major changes in the law 
there is a longstanding precedent that these assets belong to 
the employer edwin gilroy a national association of 
manufacturers lobbyist said tuesday the whole issue boils down 
to the one question of whose assets are these 
since employers have to make up the difference when a pension 
plan runs short they ought to be able to tap the surplus when a 
pension plans investments produce higherthanexpected dividends 
he said 
however karen friedman a lobbyist for the washingtonbased 
pension rights center said the surpluses enable companies to say 
yes when retirees ask for costofliving increases 
theyre funded to be ongoing she said the companies get 
tax breaks because theyre ongoing

margots age the wagner sisters wrote back but never heard from 
the frank girls again 
after the war they wrote again and annes father replied

two photographs of us hostages found in the 
luggage of a lebanese woman at milans airport are reproductions 
police said tuesday 
us officials said they doubted that photos and documents 
carried by the woman were part of an effort to free americans held 
in lebanon 
it might be prudent to view this with a certain degree of 
skepticism said one american official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
police released a third photo the woman was carrying saying it 
also was a reproduction they could not identify the subject a 
thinfaced man with a dark curly beard the other two photos were 
of hostages terry anderson and alann steen 
authorities said the woman was to give the pictures and several 
documents including a letter bearing steens name to aldo 
anghessa an italian arms trader with links to swiss and italian 
intelligence agencies 
he was to deliver them to a third party but authorities would 
not say who that might be 
the woman identified as aline ibrahim rizkallah 36 was 
arrested at milans linate airport last thursday after arriving from 
beirut police reported also finding 1000 in counterfeit us 
bills and 17 ounces of heroin on her 
us officials including an fbi representative were en route to 
milan to investigate 
the us official who saw a photocopy of the letter said it was 
not in normal english that a native englishspeaker would use 
but said that did not necessarily mean it was a fake 
achille serra head of the antiterrorism unit of milans police 
told reporters that if the handwriting turns out not to be steens 
things change a lot we would be talking about a fraud 
it was not clear who would have been the target of a possible 
swindle 
the photo of anderson chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press appeared to be a copy of one issued in august by 
the proiranian islamic jihad the picture of steen who is believed 
held by islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine was the same 
as one released last february 
the woman carried letters for anghessa and an italian prisoner in 
massa italy serra said both were in coded italian which police 
were trying to decipher he said 
the woman apparently a courier said she was to receive about 
4000 from anghessa police said he denied it 
serra said police had identified the man who supplied the woman 
with the pictures and documents and were considering going to 
lebanon to question him 
islamic jihad denied monday it was connected with the woman 
anderson and steen are among nine americans held by proiranian 
extremist factions linked to hezbollah or party of god 
anderson was seized in beirut on march 16 1985 
steen of boston was kidnapped jan 24 1987 at beirut 
university college where he taught 
three britons and irishman and an italian also are missing and 
believed held hostage in lebanon

five men including one believed to be a leader 
in a multibilliondollar colombian drug cartel were indicted 
tuesday on charges they conspired to import more than a ton of 
cocaine a week 
a federal grand jury in brooklyn issued the indictment despite 
reported death threats officials said 
gonzalo rodriguez gacha and four alleged underlings in the 
medellin cartel were charged with conspiring with undercover agents 
who posed as brokers to import 2200 pounds of cocaine every eight 
days into the new york area authorities said 
since gacha 47 lives in colombia federal authorities said his 
prosecution is unlikely because there is no extradition treaty 
between the united states and colombia 
only by taking off the leadership of these cartels can we hope 
to put a crimp into these organizations said us attorney andrew 
maloney 
maloney said he was optimistic that an extradition treaty between 
the two countries would be negotiated in the future so gacha could 
be brought to new york to face the charges 
three of the defendants who were identified as employees of the 
cartels new york distribution operation were arrested in july when 
federal agents seized 1350 pounds of cocaine near la guardia 
airport the first shipment in the sting operation 
the fifth defendant oscar vegas who was identified as a 
lieutenant in the medellin cartel also lives in colombia and 
remains unapprehended 
the men were charged with operating a continuing criminal 
enterprise conspiracy to import cocaine and conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine 
the criminal enterprise and the possession charges carry a 
maximum penalty of up to life in prison upon conviction the 
defendants could be fined up to 6 million 
gacha also was named tuesday in a separate indictment filed in 
miamis federal court that charged him and six others with one count 
of conspiracy to import cocaine 
he was identified as one of three leaders of the cartel which is 
named for the colombian city in which it is based 
robert stutman the head of the federal drug enforcement 
administrations new york office described gacha as the most 
active member of the medellin cartel which he said dominates the 
cocaine market in miami los angeles and several european cities 
stutman said his agency had received intelligence reports from 
colombia that gacha had issued death threats against stutman mayor 
edward i koch and other law enforcement officials for actions taken 
against the medellin organization 
the more they threaten the more well go after them stutman 
said

the soviet union is seeking agreement to use a 
philippines ship repair yard raising us concerns about potential 
eavesdropping on the strategic american naval base at subic bay 
according to government officials 
the officials said the administration opposes any such 
arrangement on grounds that it would give the soviets close access 
to subic which is perhaps the most important american military 
installation outside the united states 
the philippines has rejected previous soviet requests for ship 
repair at the philseco yard but moscow recently renewed the 
request the officials who insisted on anonymity said there are 
inconclusive indications the philippines may approve the new 
request 
one reason filipino authorities may change their mind the 
officials said is that the repair yard is losing money the 
enterprise is a joint venture of philippine and japanese interests

two trapped whales reversed course and 
headed back toward shore frustrating efforts to coax them toward 
open water as scientists probed an ice ridge for a weak spot that 
soviet icebreakers could attack 
its discouraging federal biologist david withrow said 
monday as the mammals apparently spooked by a shoal that has 
stymied progress for three days retreated about 800 yards why 
come back here when they know its open up there 
the california gray whales struggled up for air tiring quickly 
as they poked their way through large slabs of beaufort sea ice and 
thick slush left by efforts to carve them a path to freedom 
at one point the 27footlong whale the smaller of the two 
rested the end of its huge snout on the edge of the ice blood 
oozed from a raw spot on its snout smearing the ice and staining 
the water

frozen corpses of two seamen who died during 
a doomed arctic expedition in 1848 contain bacteria that show 
unexpected resistance to antibiotics developed more than 120 years 
later scientists say 
because there is evidence that lead poisoning killed the men 
the researchers speculate that heavy metal pollutants not just 
overuse of antibiotics may play a role in creating disease germs 
that survive drugs 
the proliferation of antibioticresistant bacteria has become a 
major problem especially in third world nations where the drugs 
are used indiscriminately killing vulnerable bacteria and allowing 
resistant bacteria to reproduce 
but medical microbiologist dr kinga kowalewskagrochowska said 
the study she conducted with colleagues at the university of 
alberta in edmonton has prompted her to speculate environmental 
pollution may spur development of some antibioticresistant germs

after canning the original pilot for the van 
dyke show premiering on cbs tonight the producers seem to have 
slapped together a replacement from one of those kits at the sitcom 
store 
this is like doityourself comedy the actors ought to have 
blank dialogue balloons over their heads the audience could do 
just as well filling in the predictable lines as the writers 
meanwhile the producers of mary tyler moores new series 
annie mcguire which premieres tonight after van dyke also 
had to reshoot their pilot the new version wasnt available for 
review usually a dead giveaway a show has serious troubles 
especially since the network willingly showed critics the van 
dyke show granted this is the network that canceled franks 
place perhaps theyre in no position to judge 
van dyke and moore were costars in the 1960s hit the dick van 
dyke show moore had her own hugely successful the mary tyler 
moore show a decade later 
cbs hopes these comedy veterans can help shore up lagging 
ratings and ease a dearth of halfhour comedies but cbs apparently 
took no hint from life with lucy its painful not reassuring 
to see beloved stars come back in bad shows 
the original pilot for annie mcguire then known only as 
the untitled mary tyler moore project was shown to critics 
last summer but was recast apparently because the husband played 
by edward j moore no relation was so darned dull he is now 
played by denis arndt 
moore plays a sophisticated manhattanite who works for city hall 
and has recently married nick a bluecollar jersey guy the 
original pilot followed their courtship in the new version they 
have been married for a few weeks her mom is a liberal his is a 
conservative tonights plot centers more on annies job in which 
she meets a disabled vietnam veteran does it sound like someones 
throwing in the kitchen sink here or what 
we have seen van dykes show he plays dick burgess a bigname 
songanddance man who moves to the small pennsylvania town where 
his son matt played by van dykes reallife son barry runs a 
local theater barry van dyke is a talented and likeable guy but 
he doesnt look very comfortable here but then who would 
matt has a typical sitcom wife chris kari lizer and a 
typical sitcom son noah billy osullivan at home the elder van 
dyke engages in the slapstick that was his trademark on the old 
dick van dyke show only this time instead of falling over an 
ottoman he tries to climb into his grandsons bunkbed for a 
long long time 
down at matts theater there are typical sitcom extras 
smartaleck office assistant jillian maura tierney aspiring 
actorcleaning boy erick paul scherrer and a wise old stage 
manager doc played by whitman mayo who played grady on sanford 
and son 
the show was directed by talented veteran jay sandrich the 
cosby show and the studio is run by grant tinker formerly 
known as mr quality but the writing is weak credited to 
executive producers sam bobrick and ron clark go out and hire 
someone guys 
heres one of the funnier lines when van dyke the elder comes 
down for breakfast he notes he not only has destroyed the childs 
bunkbed but also the rug by spilling an aquarium onto it is 
my fish ok queries noah hes fine says dick er just 
dont flush 
the producers may be saying the same thing to cbs in a few weeks

religious feminists fume at that old passage in 
genesis 316 about women your desire shall be for your husband 
and he shall rule over you 
however no less a religious authority than pope john paul ii 
says the passage refers to a flawed condition in humanity and it is 
not supposed to be that way 
this domination indicates the disturbance and the loss of 
the stability of that fundamental equality which the man and woman 
possess in the unity of the two he says 
it results from original sin he says from the human attempt to 
be supreme and outrival god 
the overcoming of this evil inheritance is generation after 
generation the task of every human being whether man or women 
the pope says 
although his recent letter on women plainly kept them barred 
from his churchs priesthood it still hacked away at some of the 
old religious biases against them 
in fact he describes woman as the biblical exemplar from 
the beginning of history to its close 
he notes that at the end of time she is portrayed in revelation 
121 as a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her 
feet and on her head a crown of stars 
one can say she is a woman of cosmic scale on a scale with 
the whole of creation the pope says of the symbolism marveling 
at womans high role god entrusts the human being to her in a 
special way 
the pope says the exceptional womanly prerogative also shows up 
in a woman being the means by which divinity joined humanity in 
christ born to a woman mary of nazareth 
thus there begins the central event the key event in the 
history of salvation the pope says a woman is to be found at 
the center of this salvific event 
although the popes sept 30 teaching letter mulieris 
dignitatem the dignity of women drew scant attention and only 
mixed reactions it offers some rare papal rebukes to common 
religious slights against women 
he even tackles the pervasive masculine images of god a 
regular and controversial target of christian feminists declaring 
that gods creativity is neither masculine nor feminine 
but totally divine 
while humanity is created in likeness to god there also is 
a nonlikeness to him the different one or totally 
other the pope says 
he adds that the bibles characteristic anthropomorphic way of 
speaking about god refers to his fatherhood but that doesnt 
mean maleness as in human fatherhood 
he points out that various scripture passages attribute to god 
both masculine and feminine qualities sometimes picturing him as a 
caring comforting mother 
thus every element of human generation which is proper to man 
and every element which is proper to woman namely human 
fatherhood and motherhood bear within itself a likeness to or 
analogy with the divine generating which is in god the pope 
says 
he says that women possess essential equality with men that 
both are human beings to an equal degree both are created in 
gods image 
while the biblical narrative says that sin was initiated by the 
woman eve followed by man adam the pope rejects that twist 
putting the prior blame on women declaring 
there is no doubt that independent of this distinction of 
roles that first sin is the sin of man created by god as male 
and female it is also the sin of the first parents 
as the author of the evil of sin the human being man and 
woman is affected by it 
besides emphasizing the role of a woman mary as the channel by 
which god entered humanity in jesus the pope pictures women as key 
figures in his ministry and him as a sort of the original womens 
liberator 
christ became a promoter of womens true dignity and of the 
vocation corresponding to this dignity the pope says at times 
this caused wonder and surprise often to the point of scandal 
furthermore the pope notes women played major roles in his 
ministry women supported it with their means the samaritan woman 
became his first mass evangelist women stood by him at the cross 
while male apostles hid in fear 
in this most arduous test of faith and fidelity the women 
proved stronger than the apostles the pope observes 
women also were the first to report the empty tomb after the 
resurrection and the first to meet the risen christ and proclaim it 
to others 
women take an unusual precedence as the pope describes it but 
he still sees the priesthood as limited to males

capitalism is an ingenious creator a constant 
revolution in which new destroys old a riotous unruly process that 
proceeds with no respect for central planning 
those observations come from an open letter to soviet citizens 
now beginning to experiment with capitalism from an american 
corporate economist it concludes with the assurance that you have 
our sympathy in full measure 
james griffen vice president and corporate economist for aetna 
life amp casualty wrote the letter to a mythical tovarich or 
comrade as a means of making some points about capitalism that 
escape even americans 
soviet leaders are misinformed says griffen if they believe the 
party can control capitalism to meet party needs 
if soviet leaders are able to graft private enterprise onto 
russian rootstock they will have no hope of controlling its 
growth to conform to a previously established acceptable norm 
says griffen 
if you import real capitalism tovarich be prepared for 
riotous unruly growth that pays little heed and no respect to plot 
plans he writes in a company publication aeconomics 
reminding russians that capitalism builds but also destroys 
he cites joseph schumpeter one of the greatest of western 
economists who expressed respect for capitalisms power to build 
but observed also that it has an enormous power to tear down what it 
had previously built 
count on it tovarich capitalism can tear down what you have 
built too and surely will do so if given half a chance our 
bombers and our missiles cannot so thoroughly change your landscape 
as capitalism can 
he explains 
who can say what capitalism will create in your country to take 
the place of what it destroys 
the enterprise system within which we live provides incentives 
to people to follow their dreams to create the life they wish to 
live and to learn how to support it 
when millions of people are free to behave in this manner 
ingeniouus solutions to problems appear as if by magic amazing 
efficiencies are discovered human needs and wants are fulfilled 
better faster and less expensively capitalism has survived 
because it serves people better than any other social arrangement 
but again it has little respect for tradition 
as capitalism reinvents itself it tramples on old products 
businesses jobs ways of doing business ways of living he says 
it is a process of creative destruction it precedes a long wave or 
surge of progress 
it happened in america during the great depression of the 1930s 
says griffen the people of japan who enjoy one of the worlds 
highest standards of living even now complain about the loss of the 
old ways 
in latin america he says you may find many examples of 
misguided capitalism and little of its creativity birthing pangs 
are felt in yugoslavia burma algeria china in whatever nations 
rotate through the headlines 
they are felt in the united states and always will be so long as 
the process of revolutionary renewal continues 
the automotive industry for instance had been in a depression 
as a result of new ways of making cars with new materials by 
different people in distant countries 
jobs have been lost in automobile companies and in the unions 
and suppliers that deal with them local communities have been 
affected old factories have become new shopping malls or 
condominiums 
the same is true in agriculture and finance says griffen 
observing that recently it has reached an intensity as to have 
touched nearly everyones life 
he observes that the power of the market has thrown hundreds of 
thousands out of work but it has also created millions of jobs 
statistically he says this is an enormous net gain but for 
those whose old way of life was disrupted there has been a real cost 
not measured in gross national product 
will it work in the soviet union griffen writes tovarich 
your leaders hope the communist party can maintain control of 
this revolution but that seems unlikely russian capitalism will 
create power centers interest groups and spheres of influence too 
numerous to count let alone control 
the capitalist way of life he reminds his mythical comrade is a 
diametric opposite to totalitarian or authoritarian central control 
ask anyone in the west capitalism produces the constantly 
revolutionary society 
only temporarily he says are central control and capitalism 
reconcilable your leaders are now yielding to the realization of 
which is the greater force

hard financial times have hit the national 
council of churches and officers say its going to have to change 
its ways to keep going 
i dont think its going to fold said joyce sohl who chairs 
the finance committee of the countrys largest ecumenical 
organization but it cant keep doing the same as its doing now 
it has to change what its doing to bring it in line with what it 
can afford 
measures to deal with the financial crisis were to be considered 
at meetings of a special coordinating group this weekend and of the 
councils governing board nov 14 in tarrytown ny 
the 260 board members represent the 32 denominations making up 
the council including most major protestant and eastern orthodox 
bodies they total about 40 million members 
while the budgetary squeeze is described as severe and 
threatening an oftrepeated view is that the national council even 
if dismantled would have to be immediately recreated 
there is too much work that the churches need to do together 
said ms sohl a united methodist from new york 
several factors brought on the crunch notably either stagnant or 
reduced denominational allocations to the council which 
historically have lagged behind inflation and rising costs 
also because monies received are needed at once instead of going 
temporarily into an investment fund interest dropped sharply 
beyond that controversy over increased levies on church world 
service the councils big relief agency to support council general 
services has caused some denominations to quit channeling relief 
funds through cws 
the council is shooting itself in the foot said patricia 
rumer of the united church of christ which has halted routing of 
relief money through cws for the time being 
cws with relief operations around the world is by far the 
councils largest operation taking up about 70 percent of a 529 
million net budget 
the rev arie r brouwer the councils general secretary and 
chief administrator says part of the trouble seems to be 
disenchantment within some mainline denominations that are mainstays 
of the council 
several of them such as the presbyterian church usa the 
episcopal church the united methodist church and the united church 
of christ have all suffered membership losses in recent years 
since its founding in 1950 the council has been a regular target 
of conservative groups which have criticized it for stands on 
social issues but such attacks have waned and were not considered 
crucial to the financial difficulties 
however with denominational concerns turning inward taking 
precedence over ecumenical activities the council has been been 
forced steadily to cut staff and program most sharply in recent 
years 
the current professional staff of 83 is expected to be cut to 61 
for 1989 
previously that staff total had dropped from 187 in 1968 to 105 
in 1975 
the councils associated mission medical office a new york unit 
that provides medical evaluations of missionaries before and after 
overseas service is to cease operations dec 31 
but plans were under way to create a new medical office in 
baltimore in conjunction with johns hopkins hospital which would 
assume the medical reviews of missionaries 
other new cutbacks include eliminating cws family life and 
population program closing the council development office and 
merging its national and international disasterresponse offices

the city of light sits on a subterranean city of 
darkness a vast network of stone quarries that has given refuge to 
scoundrels saints and the bones of 6 million souls it is where the 
phantom of the opera set up house here is a report by an ap 
correspondent who visited the catacombs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the phantom was laid to rest long ago in the cellars 
of the opera but figures nearly as macabre still haunt the 
catacombs that wind through the belly of paris like entrails and 
conceal millions of human bones 
each weekend dozens of people slip out of their city skins and 
into the maze on which the city rests they descend as far as 90 
feet into a world where night is eternal the unexpected waits at 
each turn and the game is to the fearless 
some are history buffs seeking the dank breath of ancient paris 
others are adventurers and still others inhabit a marginal world 
whether above ground or below 
they are called cataphiles and are drawn as if by 
enchantment to the darkness beneath the city of light they tread 
in the footsteps of sorcerers bandits smugglers the quick and the 
sly who haunted the tunnels centuries ago 
many who spend time below use nicknames destroy 
calamity or professor sato and dress in exaggerated punk 
or skinhead style 
the eternal eerie silence and stillness enclose a voyager who 
weaves through the sandcolored maze of galleries rooms nooks and 
niches as if pulled along by the flashlight beam 
fossils of ancient creatures are imbedded in walls nicked by the 
pickaxes of workers long dead minuscule stalactites have formed on 
the dripping ceilings of what once were quarries for the limestone 
that built paris most of them worked in the middle ages 
during world war ii the catacombs were bunkers for the german 
occupiers and hideouts for the french resistance they have been a 
blessing to mushroom growers who harvested tons of champignons de 
paris each day from the murky gardens 
its a milieu that is such an anachronism compared with the 
rest of the capital said inspector jeanclaude saratte director 
of police operations in the catacombs 
it has been against the law to go underground since 1955 because 
of risks both to travelers and the citys foundations but saratte 
said its an adventure so everyone goes down from sons of 
cabinet ministers to little punks 
quarries of lutecian limestone running under southern paris just 
a corner of the 188 miles of accessible catacombs are assigned to 
the dead the galleries are lined with the skulls and other bones of 
6 million people some guillotined in the french revolution but most 
merely overflow from the crowded cemeteries of paris 
annemarie leparmentier a geologist with the general inspection 
of the quarries the city agency in charge since the 18th century 
said a reserve of bones is kept in other sections of the 
quarries but sometimes a skull disappears now that the 
cataphiles have come 
people have had regular access since the last century to the bone 
caverns at the place denfertrochereau in southern paris and regular 
tours are conducted the rest of the catacombs are reached by 
manhole under cover of darkness down a steel ladder to another 
world 
going underground became a fad more than a decade ago when 
students of the ecole nationale des mines nearly made it a ritual 
we ended up spending days finding people lost inside saratte 
said so all but eight of about 300 accesses to the catacombs have 
been soldered shut 
the quarries are the lowest level of subterranean paris which 
also is honeycombed with subway lines and 1313 miles of navigable 
sewers the vast underworld inspired victor hugo and later gaston 
leroux whose phantom of the opera hid out in that infernal 
underground maze 
around one corner is a bath carved into the rock by quarry 
workers centuries ago around the next an open well that may descend 
to the center of earth around still another lost in the catas 
help is scrawled on the wall 
some writings reek of threat or foreboding this is the domain 
of the klan avenue of the black mass im dead 
a shuffling sound comes from a corridor nearby the path forks 
and the swamp route beckons travelers slosh through the ancient mud 
of lutecia as paris was called in roman times 
eras collide in the catacombs 
punks skinheads and weekend revelers hold allnight seances in 
room z a large confusing amorphous cavity reached by slithering 
on the stomach through a narrow tunnel the walls are scrolls of 
obscenities swastikas and death wails 
subterranean paris is a very particular little world a little 
planet all its own where groups of regulars establish zones of 
influence said saratte the police inspector 
philip who uses only his first name said this world is 
divided into two races the tourists and the cataphiles the 
tourists are a hated race you have to do everything to chase 
them out 
actually it is a rather hostile milieu where criminals 
dont think of hiding out said michel laroche another geologist 
for the city quarries agency 
since the beginning the quarries of paris have attracted those 
either in hiding or in search of the celestial or the damned 
st denis patron saint of france said mass in the quarries 
during the christian persecution according to simon lacordaires 
book the secret history of subterranean paris 
some 13th century bandits hid under the chateau de vauvert 
replaced long ago by the luxembourg gardens lacordaire said 
sorcerers used the quarries for black masses especially during the 
1348 plague that filled the paris cemeteries and caused the living 
to search for solace in the occult 
in the last century merchants used the catacombs to smuggle 
untaxed blackmarket goods to clients 
official concern now centers on preserving the natural beauty of 
the quarries and fears that unauthorized travelers will harm the 
city foundations 
there have always been cataphiles but perhaps in the past they 
were more respectful laroche said it is not a sacred place 
but it is our patrimony 
overambitious excavations weakened the subterranean 
infrastructure there were reports a century ago of the earth 
swallowing homes on the boulevard st michel and neighboring 
streets laroche said the last fatal accident was a 1961 cavein at 
clamart a southern suburb that killed 20 people 
authorities began mapping and reinforcing the quarries in the 
mid18th century and do so today when the need arises quarrying has 
been prohibited since 1788

no job is perfect not even being a member of 
congress but once youre there its a difficult job to give up 
no member of the freshman class of 1986 plans to leave 
voluntarily 
freshmen congressmen cite the slowmoving seniority system the 
unpredictable floor schedule and canceled airplane reservations and 
speaking engagements as some of the headaches that go with the job 
but along with that is the satisfaction of being a party to major 
pieces of legislation 
here are some impressions from five freshmen

guys who control the place have been here 25 30 35 40 years 
and for a young guy coming in boy thats a long time said rep 
j dennis hastert rill 
hastert 46 served in the state legislature where he became 
minority spokesman on the house appropriations committee the husky 
affable former teacher and restaurateur likes congress but at times 
recalls a bit wistfully the statehouse clout he surrendered to get 
here 
i could pick up a phone and have the director of children and 
family services public health or public aid in my office in five 
minutes if i needed help or to work with a problem he reminisced 
these days i pick up the phone and go through the hierarchy 
hastert says its just a bigger place you cant be in 
everybodys office in five minutes i realize that 
still he finds himself troubled by the time people bide here 
before they have a big impact on their committees 
to hastert the highlight of his first two years in congress was 
the budget summit at which lawmakers agreed on a formula to curb 
spending but he says cutting the deficit remains a major challenge 
otherwise i think were headed for a fiscal train wreck

its true that rep tom mcmillan dmd has an easier time 
getting home than midwestern lawmakers who must scramble to keep 
airplane reservations when floor sessions meander unexpectedly into 
the night 
but mcmillan a former professional basketball player said 
representing a district just 30 minutes from the capitol doesnt 
ease the hectic pace 
the proximity of my district to washington doubles it he 
said as he is often expected to be in two places at once 
you plan lots of things in your district assuming that youll 
be out of session at reasonable hours or that you wont be in 
session on a certain day and then all of a sudden that changes and 
there are very difficult things to cancel 
sending an aide to apologize to impatient constituents is a risky 
move for a lawmaker who won his seat by just 428 votes 
to make the strain even worse mcmillan had vowed to compile a 
100 percent attendance record on votes a rarity even among the 
most conscientious congressmen the house sometimes takes 
meaningless procedural votes such as approving the previous days 
journal and lawmakers secure about reelection sometimes pass up 
such timeconsuming formalities 
mcmillan achieved that 100 percent record this term but says it 
cant last forever 
the onetime rhodes scholar began his term by being elected 
president of the democratic freshman class there arent many jobs 
in the world where you can work on issues of such great diversity 
mcmillan said 
but he finds himself chafing at times by the slowness with which 
capitol hill changes its longstanding traditions 
i think they could move this institution more toward the 20th 
century he said

rep fred grandy riowa was best known as the love boats 
gopher smith when he asked iowa voters to send him to the house he 
assured them though that theres a longpants version of fred 
grandy 
two years later the harvardeducated former actor said he has 
been pleasantly surprised because theres an old rubric that says 
a freshmans main goal is to get reelected and you should be seen 
and not heard and theres very little you can accomplish 
not true the 40yearold former capitol hill aide said after two 
years on the house agriculture committee 
ive worked on every major piece of legislation that has come 
out of the ag committee including working on three major 
conferences drought credit and trade bill he says 
not that any freshman was a prime mover in fashioning those 
bills but seniorityheavy lawmakers once known as the old bulls 
of capitol hill are more willing to let newcomers participate said 
grandy 
i just hope that im always a young turk and never become an 
old bull he added 
and the hours 
for anybody who lives west of i think ohio this is a killer

rep nancy pelosi dcalif came to capitol hill early in 1987 
to fill a vacancy the daughter of a onetime maryland congressman 
and long on the fringes of national politics the newest freshman 
found no surprises 
surprise is a word that for politicians and people in public 
life is a very rare occurrence said pelosi whose district 
encompasses all but a sliver of san francisco you hope for the 
best you prepare for the worst and you are very rarely surprised 
what would she change a long pause 
actually she said i have a lot of respect for this 
institution 
its true it would be easier if we had more certainty about 
the schedule but its in the nature of the place and i like the 
fast pace and i can cope with it she said there are all kinds 
of ways to get a job done 
high on her agenda was federal assistance for aids victims she 
applauds congressional approval of such a bill 
i feel very pleased about that because of what it will mean for 
people infected with the aids virus she said and there is 
plenty more to do

rep jim bunning rky won 224 games as a major league pitcher 
including a pair of no hitters he came to washington from the 
kentucky senate 
any surprises 
its only the numbers bunning said you have to add three 
zeros to everything 
he did find himself a bit disappointed in the lack of input 
i think the committee chairman and the ranking member seem to 
have more control than they ought to bunning said that is not 
much legislation is altered at the full committee level and 
particularly in banking 
in the banking committee he said there wasnt much you could 
do even if you tried your darndest and i tried in certain 
instances 
would he change anything 
bunning cited proxy voting in committees a practice under which 
senior lawmakers collect the proxies of absent members and vote 
them on bills and amendments 
without proxy voting he said you would have to show up and 
vote and the committee chairman could not vote 15 proxies who 
were absent and just work his will on everything 
he said it was hard to put his finger on any single high point 
over the last two years im a welltrained professional who 
doesnt get too high or too low he said that comes from my 
athletic background i believe where some you win some you lose 
and some get rained out

isadore sharp founder and chairman of the four 
seasons luxury hotel chain isnt troubled by the growing 
competition at the top end of the market 
weve evolved over 25 years he said in an interview at 
corporate headquarters here they look at us and copy a lot of 
what weve done 
indeed the move by several major hotel chains into the luxury 
market has actually helped four seasons by putting huge advertising 
budgets to work promoting quality and whetting the publics appetite 
for the kind of services that have made a name for sharp 
we decided a long time ago what we thought was going to be our 
strength the trim and fit executive said the other companies 
still dont do it and thats the service its the consistency and 
quality of the people you hire 
four seasons with 21 properties in canada the united states 
and england has helped set the standards by which the luxury hotel 
business is judged these days among the amenities it introduced are 
concierge service twicedaily maid service formal afternoon tea 
and full secretarial and translation services 
the company also has emphasized fitness for its guests both in 
health centers and in its menus that feature an alternative 
cuisine lower in calories cholesterol and sodium 
in testament to its efforts four seasons hotels claimed more 
five diamond ratings from the american automobile association 
this year than any of its competitors 
sharp recalled fondly the origins of his business at the outset 
of the 1960s with a small toronto motel 
although he studied architecture he was working in construction 
and built a 14room motel for a client 
it sparked an interest i guess in the idea said sharp in 
shirt sleeves the idea comes quickly yet something finally 
concrete took six seven years 
you never anticipate that its going to take you that long 
his first hotel opened in 1961 in what was then a somewhat 
marginal downtown neighborhood so he designed it to look inward and 
create a comfortable interior environment 
my idea was that it had to be something distinctive he said 
the idea of it married the motel feel with hotel services 
sharp said the basic principles remain the same today 
each step along the way carried with it that same idea of 
giving the customer something that was special he said 
sharps office flooded with natural light is a stunning example 
of his ability to combine comfort and style although the office is 
sparsely furnished each piece makes an impact from the large red 
and blue oriental rug to his imposing desk he took obvious pride in 
showing off the entire headquarters building located in a renovated 
printing shop down the street from the chains modern inn on the 
park 
as four seasons grew sharp said he realized that it was 
acquiring a motley collection everything from his first motel to a 
giant convention property since divested 
it wasnt until 1972 that i decided to concentrate on one end 
of the market totally and to make sure that all the hotels would be 
consistent he said 
decisions since then have been made carefully sharp said for 
example that four seasons spent 10 years looking at new york before 
entering the market there with the pierre on fifth avenue 
you make a list of all the cities that you consider primary 
destinations of the business traveler he said i guess what i 
was able to do was not just grab and take everything 
he said expansion also has been cautious so that retreat is 
possible if problems crop up 
well take it slowly he said were not going to do more 
if it jeopardizes the existing operation 
his goal for the next five years is to open at least two hotels 
annually 
where well go over time is the world literally he said 
four seasons is moving slowly into resorts its maui resort is 
scheduled to open late next year and sharp said he believes about a 
half dozen are possible in north america 
the company also is entering the far east in partnership with a 
japanese company and the first four seasons hotel should open in 
tokyo in 1991 
theres nothing driving four seasons other than to do the right 
thing for the company sharp said 
industry analysts say four seasons is wellpositioned generally 
enjoying the highest occupancy rates in its cities and often 
charging the highest rates as well 
sharp said the chains yield factor or occupancy rate multiplied 
by room rate is substantially more than the competition 
as a company we are the largest operator of luxury hotels in 
the world he said there isnt another company that is as 
obsessed with customer satisfaction and consistency we sell 
what we can guarantee we can do all the time 
the corporation announced earnings of 53 million for the first 
six months of this year up 146 percent from 46 million in the 
first half of 1987

worries about a continuing oversupply of oil 
following another failed opec meeting could further erode prices 
this week analysts say 
the december contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude tumbled 120 a barrel on monday finishing the day at 
1317 per barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
on friday the nearterm contract had finished at 1437 per 
barrel off 7 cents for the week 
the sharp drop in crude oil dragged down the prices of refined 
products as well the november contract for unleaded gasoline 
dropped 126 cents to finish at 4996 cents a gallon with other 
contract months down as much as 2 cents a gallon the heating oil 
contract for november closed down 281 cents to a settlement price 
of 3990 cents a gallon with other contract months also down 
sharply 
analysts said the crude price erosion reflected investor worries 
that opec would continue flooding world markets with oil pushing 
prices down even further 
since april prices have fallen more than 25 percent due to the 
growing oversupply of oil 
prices for the december crude contract opened almost 90 cents 
lower than fridays close after ministers from eight organization 
of petroleum exporting countries adjourned a weekend meeting 
without reaching common ground on production quotas 
oil brokers said investors had hoped this weekends opec meeting 
in madrid would produce a new production accord that would reduce 
daily output by as much as 3 million barrels prices had firmed 
slightly last week in anticipation of a positive outcome 
expectations were so high that in fact an agreement would take 
place that when it didnt take place the market sold off said 
nauman barakat vice president for energy investments with 
prudential bache securities inc 
the 13nation cartel produces an estimated 22 million barrels of 
oil a day exceeding its selfimposed ceiling by more than 3 
million barrels observers said before the meeting that the 
ministers planned to set a daily ceiling of 174 million barrels 
iraq is said to be the principal problem refusing to abide by 
its 16 million barreladay quota since 1986 iraq is producing 
approximately 27 million barrels a day arguing that it needs the 
oil revenue to rebuild its shattered economy after its eightyear 
war with iran the two countries began a ceasefire in august 
analysts say other quota violators fear that if they roll back 
their own production iraq will take over their market share 
recently saudi arabia the largest opec producer and the 
worlds largest exporter began exceeding its 43 millionbarrel 
quota reportedly to punish the other quota violators 
but analysts say opecs failure to reach any kind of a 
resolution this weekend suggested the cartel is far from 
reinstituting discipline among its members 
the fact that the meeting ended without a firm resolution 
confirmed the existing fundamentals that there is too much oil on 
world markets and prices have to go lower said james steel an 
analyst with refco inc 
opec ministers plan two more meetings in november including a 
full ministerial gathering on nov 21 in vienna

the fevered pitch of wall streets bidding for 
giant food companies could go even higher following kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp cos record 2028 billion offer for rjr nabisco inc 
kohlberg kravis announcement monday of a 90ashare leveraged 
buyout offer for rjr nabisco came four days after nabiscos 
management said it might offer 17 billion or 75 a share to buy 
the company from stockholders 
our offer is a better one stated henry kravis a partner in 
the new yorkbased investment firm 
securities analysts said the kohlberg kravis offer was more in 
line with nabiscos worth than the proposal presented by 
management and say higher offers still may emerge 
theres a possibility this will be the final bid but it could 
go as high as 100 said jay nelson an analyst with brown 
brothers harriman inc its feasible but not at all certain 
new yorkbased kohlberg kravis said it would offer 90 a share 
in cash for about 87 percent of rjr nabiscos 2253 million 
outstanding shares and would exchange securities valued at the 
same amount for the rest of the companys stock 
the offer was was conditioned on support from nabiscos board 
the investment firm known for its big successful leveraged 
buyout bids said it would begin the tender offer formally later 
this week at more than 20 billion the offer would surpass the 
biggest corporate acquisition of any type the 134 billion 
purchase of gulf corp by chevron corp in 1984 
there was no comment from rjr nabisco or the managers who on 
thursday announced they were considering a 75ashare cash bid for 
the food and tobacco company 
on wall street investors reacted enthusastically to kohlberg 
kraviss offer nabisco stock shot up 725 a share to 84 in new 
york stock exchange composite trading 
ronald b morrow who tracks nabisco for the investment firm 
smith barney harris upham amp co said he doubted the management 
group led by nabisco president f ross johnson would be disturbed 
by the kohlberg kravis bid 
they were definitely inviting offers he said 
clinton mayer an analyst with bear stearns amp co inc said of 
the johnson group theyre in a nolose situation 
i think if they could buy at 75 they would have been 
happy mayer said but also said they would be very happy if 
someone else bid a higher price 
kohlberg kravis had been expected to enter the whirlwind of bids 
for food companies that began oct 4 with a 523 billion bid for 
pillsbury co by grand metropolitan plc a british company 
but many thought the investment firm was considering a bid for 
kraft inc which late sunday rejected a more than 11 billion bid 
from philip morris cos inc and announced its own 1359 billion 
recapitalization plan 
a successful buyout of nabisco would be the biggest leveraged 
buyout of an american corporation by far the largest lbo was 
kohlberg kravis 61 billion buyout of beatrice cos in 1986 
in a leveraged buyout a company is acquired mainly with 
borrowed funds that are repaid either with company revenue or money 
raised by selling parts of the operation 
henry kravis a partner in the investment firm said in a 
statement his company had raised an equity pool of 56 billion for 
buyouts experts say that amount could be used to leverage as 
much as 40 billion in loans for acquisitions 
kohlberg kravis also is leading a group attempting to acquire 
the publishing giant macmillan inc for 25 billion british 
publisher robert maxwell who also seeks to buy macmillan is 
fighting that bid in a delaware court 
the investment firm recently withdrew a 503 billion bid for 
supermarket operator kroger co after krogers board rejected the 
offer in favor of a financial restructuring 
past kohlberg leveraged buyouts also include the 1986 purchase

industry analysts see shearson lehman hutton 
incs move to lay off about 1000 people while aggressively 
pursuing multibilliondollar takeover deals as reflecting profound 
changes on postcrash wall street and signaling a new wave of 
cutbacks because of the depressed outlook for stocks 
this is the beginning of the second round said perrin long 
who follows the business for lipper analytical securities in new 
york 
he estimated the number of securities industry layoffs 
nationwide which reached more than 15000 in the months following 
the october 1987 crash could hit 25000 by the end of this year 
or about 96 percent of the total 260000 
worried about a continued slump in stock trading shearson laid 
off about 200 people earlier this month and expects the total to 
reach 1000 by years end officials of the brokerage said monday 
shearson already has accounted for about onethird of 
crashrelated layoffs largely because of its acquisition of the 
distressed ef hutton group inc late last year for nearly 1 
billion 
but the company last week hinted at further reductions in its 
staff of 42000 employees when it reported an 85 percent tumble in 
its thirdquarter profit 
shearson officials said the latest round of layoffs would affect 
all operations but it was clear that retail brokerage would be 
affected most analysts said that side of the business requires a 
lot more support staff such as computer operators and billing 
clerks than other areas 
on the other hand financing takeover deals the most frenzied 
part of the investment business requires relatively few people and 
is the most profitable 
what youve got here is a onelegged man said james p 
hanbury who follows the industry for wertheim schroder amp co a 
new york investment firm mampa is red hot while most other lines 
of business are the opposite 
shearson the second biggest us brokerage behind merrill lynch 
amp co has become an aggressive financier of corporate takeovers 
and restructurings 
it is adviser to management of rjr nabisco inc which surprised 
wall street last week by announcing it might try to buy the 
foodtobacco conglomerate for 17 billion in a leveraged buyout 
shearson would reap staggering profits if the management buyout 
succeeded although the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co entered the fray monday with a 2028 billion bid 
shearson also has played key roles in other huge takeover deals 
over the past year it represented eastman kodak co in a 51 
billion takeover of sterling drug co it advised federated 
department stores target of an intense bidding war won by canadian 
developer robert campeau who paid 658 billion and it helped 
takeover strategest paul bilzerian buy singer co for 1 billion 
figures compiled by idd information services an investment 
industry research and publishing concern in new york show shearson 
ranked first during the first half of this year in number of 
takeover deals at 105 
idd said shearson ranked fourth in terms of the dollar value of 
these deals at 4195 billion behind goldman sachs amp co at 
4494 billion morgan stanley group inc at 4542 billion and 
first boston inc at 5492 billion 
shearsons like any of us we take advantage of our 
opportunities said long the lbo game and mampa business have 
been going at a furious pace and as a consequence the firms 
attention is being diverted to areas where it can make money 
some wall street professionals noted the irony that shearson 
which used a major postcrash advertising blitz to urge a longterm 
investment strategy was diverting its own resources to speculative 
dealmaking 
others called shearsons strategy a necessary adjustment for 
longterm survival 
its like general motors cutting back on caddies during a 
downturn and hiring people in the chevrolet division said long

maytag corps proposed 1 billion 
buyout of chicago pacific corp the maker of hoover appliances is 
a positive but expensive move for maytag according to some 
industry watchers 
while the price the newtonbased company plans to pay for 
chicago pacific is seen by some as a bit high the takeover will 
give it entry into european markets while helping insulate it from 
any unwanted takeover 
the fit is excellent although the price is a bit high said 
mark hassenberg of donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities inc 
in new york 
maytag said monday it would launch a cash tender offer of 60 a 
share for up to 64 million shares or about 49 percent of the 
outstanding shares of chicago pacific the remaining chicago 
pacific shares will be converted into an equivalent amount of 
maytag stock 
the companies said the tender offer and the merger together are 
valued at about 1 billion the combined sales of both companies 
would exceed 3 billion 
hassenberg predicted that the buyout would erode maytags 
earnings by as much as 25 cents a share next year but said the 
company would regain that ground in 1990 
he said hoover has an outstanding position in europe and 
maytag should be able to use that reputation to introduce its own 
line of major appliances 
through chicago pacifics hoover division we will become a 
leader in the international major appliance market said maytag 
chairman daniel j krumm in a prepared statement 
he said the acquisition was a milestone for maytag because it 
provides increased opportunities for our shareowners and helps us 
achieve our longterm strategy of becoming a global leader in the 
major appliance field 
maytag shares finished down 275 at 2375 a share monday on 
the new york stock exchange chicago pacific shares zoomed up 
1325 to 5662 a share 
the board of directors of chicago pacific including chicago 
businessman lester crown whose family is the companys largest 
shareholder with 15 percent has approved the transaction a news 
release from the companies said crown intends to exchange his 
familys stock and convertible bond holdings to maytag stock the 
release said 
while investors drove maytags value down at the news of the 
deal several analysts praised the combination as a longterm plus 
for the company other analysts said the deal signals that maytag 
intends to fight off any takeover bids 
for investors looking for a maytag takeover it wasnt very 
positive news said tim dunn an analyst for the provident 
national bank of philadelphia but thats ok with me hoover is a 
quality asset with the most interesting thing coming from their 
position internationally 
this wont put them maytag in the league with whirlpool or 
general electric but it was the most they could do its a very 
positive move said dunn 
another analyst james ballessa of the da davidson amp co of 
great falls mont said maytag was hoping to make itself less 
attractive as a takeover prospect 
i know the company has antitakeover provisions in its bylaws 
but they may have wanted to add a wart to make themselves less 
attractive to a suitor its possible this is a wart i dont 
understand the logic he said 
maytags prime appliance brands are admiral hardwick jennair 
magic chef norge and maytag it also makes vending machines 
in addition to hoover chicago pacific has several lines of 
furniture including kittinger pennsylvania house mcguire brown 
jordan and gunlocke 
hoover has 13 production facilities in eight countries to 
manufacture and distribute washers dryers refrigerators 
dishwashers and microwave ovens in addition to the floor care line 
it does not market the major appliances in the united statesm and 
gets about 65 percent of its revenue overseas 
chicago pacific is the successor of the rock island railroad 
which emerged from bankruptcy proceedings in 1984

the head of farley inc says his companys 141 
billion takeover bid for textile giant west pointpepperell inc is 
generous but industry analysts says a buyout probably will be more 
expensive than that 
farley the chicagobased parent of fruit of the loom inc and 
one of the nations largest privately owned conglomerates said it 
would pay 48 a share in cash for each of pepperells 294 million 
outstanding shares 
its pepperell worth more said grace taferner an analyst 
with first manhattan co in new york i think it should be about 
55 per share 
patricia ryan an analyst at raymond james amp associates in st 
petersburg fla also termed 55 a share as a good number but 
added i dont think you make your best bid first 
in trading monday on the new york stock exchange pepperell rose 
475 a share to 50 indicating speculators expected a higher 
offer to be made 
pepperell advised its stockholders not to take any action on the 
bid until the board of directors reviewed farleys bid and made a 
recommendation said donald downs a company spokesman he said the 
board would meet by nov 4 
we think its an attractive offer to the shareholders for 
sure said william farley who heads farley inc in an interview 
monday after announcing the offer 
farley said in a letter to pepperell chairman and chief 
executive officer joseph l lanier jr that he hoped to move 
forward on a constructive friendly basis 
the offer was not entirely unexpected in may farley sought 
government permission to acquire up to 25 percent of pepperells 
stock so far farley has spent 88 million for a 98 percent stake 
in the west point gabased company 
farley said lanier had telephoned him months ago and indicated 
he preferred to remain independent 
pepperell which manufactures arrow shirts and martex towels 
acquired textile rival jp stevens amp co earlier this year for 
12 billion and then split up stevens assets with a rival suitor 
pepperell was left with most of stevens linen and towel 
operations giving the company about 25 percent of the nations 
home fashion textile market 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission in 
washington farley has said that if successful in its bid it 
plans to sell pepperells apparel fabrics and industrial fabrics 
businesses and keep the household fabrics business 
the breakup value is worth more than keeping the company 
together ms taferner said hes farley said he wants the 
bed and bath business which is the jewel of the company there are 
a lot of buyers for the businesses that he doesnt want he should 
be able to sell them off fairly easily 
farley already has taken legal action to challenge georgias 
antitakeover statutes as well as pepperells poison pill takever 
defense which was strengthened last june in an effort to make 
unwanted takeovers prohibitively expensive 
the lawsuits would be dropped if pepperell agrees to work with 
farley on a friendly basis farley said 
farley has 300 million earmarked for acquisitions accumulated 
from a bond issue earlier this year but has indicated he wants to 
keep twothirds of it in reserve for other investments 
in addition to fruit of the loom the nations largest underwear 
company farley operates acme boot and doehlerjarvis

itt corp faces a maximum 500000 fine for 
pleading guilty to wining and dining air force officials in order 
to obtain secret government information used to bid on 180 million 
in military contracts 
the new yorkbased conglomerate pleaded guilty monday in federal 
court to a charge of conspiring to defraud the government 
the company admitted that an employee of its defense technology 
division in 1984 and early 1985 spent about 15000 and was 
reimbursed for illegal gifts including liquor sports and theater 
tickets meals and golf games to air force officials at hanscom 
air force base in bedford 
in exchange itt received copies of internal government 
documents with confidential procurement information on two air 
force programs itt was interested in pursuing 
itt was indicted in june 1987 several months before a separate 
federal investigation into the use of consultants by corporations 
to get information for use in bidding for contracts itt officials 
said the case was not tied to that investigation 
this office will continue to ferret out and prosecute 
vigorously fraud and corruption in the defense industry us 
attorney frank l mcnamara said in a statement 
edward m vicenzi a senior marketing representative of itts 
van nuys califbased gilfillan subsidiary which specializes in 
radar technology pleaded guilty in july to the same charge he 
faces up to 35 years in prison and a 500000 fine on the charges 
we pleaded guilty to the fact that the person involved was our 
employee when he acted improperly itt chairman rand v araskog 
said in a statement we had no choice because that employee 
pleaded guilty 
according to the indictment in the case vicenzi was hired in 
august 1983 to pursue two air force contracts an antiradiation 
missile decoy system valued at more than 80 million and a mobile 
air traffic control radar system worth between 100 million and 
150 million 
vicenzis 60000ayear job was to get inside government 
information on the programs including air force plans 
specifications procurement strategy and projected costs the 
indictment said 
he reportedly had close ties with procurement officials at the 
air forces electronics systems division at hanscom which is 
responsible for buying all of the air forces electronics systems 
four government employees who received gratuities from vincenzi 
gave him copies of documents with information on the contracts as 
well as general planning and funding documents including the 
entire minutes of an air force meeting for the missile decoy 
system the indictment said 
he then sent the documents to other itt gilfillan employees 
including senior business development officials engineers and 
program managers writing this is extremely sensitive or do 
not acknowledge our possession of this document 
itt gilfillan won a preliminary 64 million development 
contract for the 80 million missile decoy system which would have 
protected us radar sites by luring homing missiles away from a 
radar installation the indictment said neither that system nor 
the radar control system known as mpnxx was ever built 
federal prosecutors told the us district judge david s nelson 
that several itt employees tried to hide vicenzis activities by 
destroying or concealing the documents after word was out of an 
investigation itt said vicenzi was fired in 1986 in an unrelated 
matter 
vicenzi allegedly had repeated contact with maurice raciti a 
deputy program manager in logistics at hanscom who resigned from 
the air force in late 1986 after air force oficials suspended him 
pending the outcome of the federal investigation raciti has not 
been charged 
the indictment said vicenzi on numerous occasions met with 
raciti and bought him lunches paid for him to play golf 
provided him with tickets to sporting and theater events and gave 
him gifts of liquor 
the defense department suspended its business with itt gillifan 
from july to november 1987 because of the justice department 
investigation

a surge in trading of rjr nabisco inc stock 
options during the two days before the announcement of a 17 
billion management buyout plan has prompted an investigation by the 
chicago board options exchange 
the probe was launched last week after cboe officials noticed a 
sharp rise in the number of rjr nabisco stock options traded last 
tuesday and wednesday cboe spokesman warren moulds said monday 
moulds said exchange officials monitor trading through 
computerized systems and when it breaks usual trading patterns 
that usually sets in motion an inquiry into the reasons why 
a stock option contract is a right to buy or sell 100 shares of 
a certain stock at a specified price within a given time period 
the value of rjr nabisco stock options increased during the two 
days prior to the companys announcement 
in september only 1039 contracts of rjr nabisco options were 
traded daily moulds said last tuesday 4079 contracts were 
traded on wednesday the day preceding the announcement 7050 
contracts were traded 
after the buyout proposal was made public on thursday 25850 
rjr nabisco options traded on the cboe moulds said 
after such an announcement a large increase in trading volume 
is normal because the buyout plans often include a large payout to 
shareholders that can boost the value of the companys stock 
but increased trading volume prior to the announcement can 
indicate that someone with advance knowledge of the companys plans 
was attempting to profit illegally 
in a new development monday the investment firm kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co said it would begin a 2028 billion tender offer for 
rjr nabisco 
the latest cboe inquiry follows a securities and exchange 
commission investigation into options trading shortly before grand 
metropolitan plc announced a 52 billion dollar bid for pillsbury 
co earlier this month

soviet ambassador yuri v dubinin met 
poultry magnate frank perdue and walked away with two oven 
stuffer roasters and some insight into chicken processing 
dubinin on monday took a daylong tour of perdue farms on the 
eastern shore to get a firsthand look at the mechanics of poultry 
processing 
as chairman and chief owner of perdue farms dubinins 
68yearold host oversees a chicken empire thats expected to gross 
more than 1 billion in sales this year perdues face is familiar 
on television where he appears in his own commercials 
its something thats very well developed in the united states 
and with perdue especially dubinin said of american poultry 
production the problem in the soviet union is output quality and 
quantity 
perdue accompanied the ambassador and his entourage of eight 
including dubinins wife liana and two daughters through a 
hatchery in westover and a processing plant in accomac that 
employs 1700 people and slaughters an average 300000 chickens a 
day 
afterward he presented the diplomat with an ice chest bearing 
the perdue logo that contained the two roasting chickens the rest 
of the soviet delegation from washington received similar freebies 
dubinin said the visit was his first contact with chicken 
processing in any country he called his trip a demonstration that 
diplomacy is not just politics its economic relations 
technological relations 
the ambassador said the soviet union would like to increase 
chicken production watching eviscerated poultry moving swiftly 
through the production line is an interesting experience for 
me he told reporters 
as for perdues television commercials dubinin said he has seen 
them and found them amusing but he added that he is less concerned 
with the marketing aspects of poultry production and more concerned 
about output 
dubinin said there is potential for some joint enterprise with 
perdue and the soviet union but we will have a better idea 
about that after perdue makes a planned visit to the soviet union 
perdue spokeswoman chris whaley confirmed that perdue is 
scheduled to make a visit soon but she declined to speculate on 
what business dealings might be under discussion

restructuring its slumping trailer operations a move that will 
necessitate an unspecified number of layoffs and early retirements 
at its headquarters here the company announced 
the trucktrailer and autoparts maker began layoffs last week 
in its engineering department fruehauf spokesman david hladik said 
monday 
about 40 percent of the departments 78 engineers received pink 
slips and others will be transferred he added 
there will be some layoffs in personnel and an early 
retirement program has been implemented hladik said 
low profit margins and hot competition have depressed fruehaufs 
trailer division which lost 29 million in 1986 and broke even 
last year 
the company has been struggling since a managementled leveraged 
buyout in 1986 left it saddled with debt fruehauf has sold a 
number of operations and trimmed its longterm debt to 705 
million down from 16 billion in 1986 
last week the company in part blamed that debt for 
thirdquarter losses of 191 million that compares to a loss of 
143 million or 177 per share in the third quarter of 1987

breaking their 1yearold labor dispute with international paper 
co 
the offer covers a sixyear period retroactive to feb 1 1987 
the previous contract expired in january 1987 and union workers 
were locked out of the plant on march 21 1987 
don langham regional vice president of the united paperworkers 
international union said the proposed contract provides 
tremendous shift differential improvement and it provides that all 
union members would be returned to work immediately 
one of the major issues in the labor dispute has been ips 
policy of paying production employees extra when they work sundays 
and holidays the company wanted to eliminate the bonuses to cut 
costs 
frank bragg president of upiu local 265 and a member of the 
committee that has represented the 1200 lockedout workers at the 
bargaining table said the company would not address the bonus 
issue 
bragg said the union membership appears to be split at this 
point as to who wants to fight and who wants to quit 
we commend our people for fighting the battle as long as they 
have he said but at some point in time we had to go back to 
the members for direction on which way they want us to go 
company officials have said the lockedout workers cannot return 
to their jobs until they accept a new labor agreement the mobile 
mill has been operated by temporary workers since the start of the 
lockout which spread to strikes at ip mills in three other states 
those strikes have all been called off

scarlett oharas hometown is for sale and 
cashrich japanese investors are the principal targets of 
businessmen marketing atlantas highest profile office buildings 
it is a poorly kept secret that a japanese insurance company is 
about to buy the ibm tower paying 300 million for atlantas 
yearold showpiece skyscraper 
and market professionals say other buildings principally the 
headquarters tower of georgiapacific corp and cnn center hub 
for ted turners broadcasting conglomerate are on the block and 
may soon be sold to syndicates made up largely of foreign investors 
the asian invasion of the american real estate market has raised 
hackles elsewhere in the united states as major landmarks like the 
exxon corp building in new york city have been snapped up by the 
japanese but here in atlanta the phenomenon follows years of 
active campaigning for foreign investment 
georgia has been mining japan for business since the mid70s and 
the state now ranks second to california in japanese manufacturing 
investment atlanta ranks third among american cities behind dallas 
and houston in the number of asianowned businesses per 1000 asian 
residents 
jobs jobs is the purpose of our efforts said randy 
cardoza deputy commissioner of the georgia department of industry 
and trade 
a decade of selfpromotion and airport improvements by the city 
and state have helped fuel the drive for foreign investment said 
allen judd a business consultant who was one of the founders eight 
years ago of the japanamerica society of georgia inc 
a survey on atlanta real estate by the braemar group ltd says 
1206 percent of the citys office space is foreignowned and 
braemar group owner and managing partner tarby bryant predicts 50 
percent of the best office space will be foreignowned by the year 
2000 with the japanese accounting for half 
with all of the major japanese banks currently in atlanta and 
two airlines jal japan airlines and delta air lines now 
flying direct links to japans narita airport i am confident that 
we will see more japanese investors looking at our office 
buildings hotels and regional malls for acquisition he said 
atlanta is at the top of the second tier of cities drawing 
japanese interest bryant said because its socalled trophy 
properties are available at cheaper rates than in the 
firsttier cities of new york los angeles chicago boston and 
washington dc 
there also is less competition in cities such as atlanta to 
purchase trophy properties defined loosely by bryant as quality 
real estate architecturally significant with a major tenant 
the pending purchase of the ibm tower by sumitomo life insurance 
co is the big foot in our pond bryant said and more such 
deals should follow fairly soon 
such deals have been aided by the recent strength of the 
japanese yen over the dollar and by atlantas expected strong 
growth in the next several years the combination makes real estate 
investments particularly attractive 
among foreign investors the japanese have the most money and 
are the most aggressive bryant said in addition he said the 
japanese feel pressure from their peers to invest in america 
the consulate general of japan in atlanta says there were 236 
japaneseowned facilities in the state as of july 1 employing 
12100 people and representing an investment of 810 million 
a report last year by the georgia department of industry and 
trade said there were six taiwaneseowned facilities and four owned 
by koreans two investors were from singapore and one from hong 
kong 
of those asianowned businesses 38 are headquarters for us 
subsidiaries including hitachi america ltd which makes 
telecommunications equipment asahi inc athletic shoe 
manufacturer mizuno golf co a division of japans largest 
sporting goods company and tdk manufacturing us ltd co 
manufacturer of video cassette tapes 
there are numerous regional headquarters and manufacturing 
plants for some of the bestknown japanese products including 
maxell tapes sony records mitsubishi televisions and kubota 
tractors 
there are also nine japanese banks and judd said a 10th is 
expected to open soon 
in all there were 1057 foreignowned facilities in the state 
last year the industry and trade report said the department said 
japanese capital investment ranked second in the state behind 
canada 
just last week the yamaha motor co opened its yamaha usa golf 
car factory at newnan ga its first north american manufacturing 
facility 
some of that investment may have been driven by fears the 
congress would enact severely protectionist trade legislation 
despite passage of a watereddown trade bill bryant said he 
doesnt expect the flood of foreign investment to slow anytime soon

when joon h song moved to atlanta 26 years ago 
there were three korean families in town 
then my brother came and my sister my father song said 
other families followed and now song estimates there are between 
15000 and 20000 koreans living in the metropolitan area of 25 
million people 
there are also an estimated 30000 to 40000 chinese and about 
5000 japanese according to allen judd an independent business 
consultant who has spent much of the past two decades promoting 
asian business connections in atlanta 
a recent study disclosed that many of those asianamericans own 
their own businesses so many that atlanta ranked third in the 
country behind dallas and houston in the number of asianowned 
businesses per 1000 asian residents 
the study said there are 805 asianowned businesses per 1000 
asianamericans in atlanta dallas was first with 903 followed by 
houston at 849 places with large asian populations such as 
honolulu and san francisco were far down the list 
the finding surprised song a past president of the korean 
association an umbrella organization of 72 korean support groups 
in the atlanta metropolitan area 
just like the irish went to boston and the polish went to 
chicago koreans and chinese came to atlanta said judd a 
founder of the japanamerica society of georgia inc 
song estimates that about 70 percent of atlantas asians are 
direct immigrants with the rest coming from other major american 
cities 
they are drawn he said by the same factors that have made 
atlanta and the rest of the sunbelt some of the fastest growing 
areas in the country 
weathers good transportations good lots of things are 
good said song who works for citizens amp southern national bank 
in oriental business development 
the new arrivals also find a strong sense of community 42 
korean churches a koreanamerican school and a korean chamber of 
commerce 
most of the korean business is family business thats why the 
business is growing very fast song said 
the exact asian population of the atlanta is hard to judge with 
the latest figures coming from the 1980 us census and most 
experts agreeing the numbers have changed substantially since then

goodyear tire amp rubber co on tuesday said its 
thirdquarter profits fell 65 percent from a year ago partly because 
of difficult business conditions in its domestic tire operations 
for the quarter ended sept 30 goodyear earned 635 million or 
111 a share a year earlier the company reported net income of 
1787 million or 313 a share in the yearago period goodyear 
benefited from a 50 million gain on the sale of properties in 
arizona 
sales however rose 8 percent to 27 billion from 25 billion 
a year ago 
goodyear attributed the recent decline in profits partly to 
higher natural rubber costs in its domestic tire operations plant 
efficiencies also were reduced due to an unusually hot summer when 
the company was forced to cut back on electricity at some plants 
goodyear began a major costcutting effort and shed most of its 
nonrubber operations beginning in late 1986 to raise cash and fend 
off a hostile takeover attempt by financier sir james goldsmith 
chairman robert e mercer said the company experienced a lag in 
recovering costs through price increases tire unit sales in the 
us replacement market were down in the three months although the 
decline was partially offset by better unit sales of lower priced 
tires to original equipment manufacturers 
the company indicated its businesses in 27 foreign countries 
showed improved earnings but they were partially offset by greater 
foreign currency lossses 
through the nine months goodyear earned fell 51 percent to 
2937 million or 513 a share on sales of 81 billion in the 
yearago period earnings were 6039 million or 978 a share on 
sales of 74 billion

trading today as prices steadied in the face of profittaking and 
takeover speculation 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was up 178 at 217212

the intensifying pace of multibilliondollar 
takeovers and restructurings that rely mainly on borrowed money 
could severely reshape the us job market and leave thousands of 
people unemployed labor economists and consultants said tuesday 
they argue that the staggering amounts of debt acquired by many 
companies as a result of these transactions called leveraged 
buyouts or lbos will have to be repaid somehow even if it means 
selling profitable assets cutting payrolls and reducing benefits 
such as healthcare insurance 
some lbo critics argue that the impact would multiply if the 
nation plunges into a recession forcing these highly indebted 
companies to cut more deeply into the core of their businesses in 
order to meet debt payments 
these warnings come at a time that many us companies are 
aggressively cutting costs to survive in an increasingly competitive 
world economy and may not be able to afford added debt burdens 
there is a casino society atmosphere in this country because 
shareholders want to make a killing said henry schechter an 
aflcio economist in washington the end result is billions of 
debt weve already had cases in which thousands of jobs are lost 
as examples he said the 42 billion lbo of safeway stores inc 
left thousands of workers unemployed in texas because property there 
was sold to pay off debt a goodyear tire amp rubber co restructuring 
to thwart a hostile takeover which saddled the company with 36 
billion in debt led the company to close factories and lay off 
hundreds of employees 
the frenzy of company restructurings that have altered the us 
economic landscape this decade already had raised some of these 
issues many that have restructured into privatelyheld companies 
emerge as stronger because management is more focused on their core 
businesses and faces fewer pressures for shortterm profit 
retailer rh macy amp co for example which went private in a 
36 billion lbo in 1985 is regarded as one of the bestmanaged 
chains in the industry sevenup co which languished under 
conglomerate owner philip morris cos increased productivity and 
trimmed waste after it was sold in an lbo two years ago 
but the speed and size of deals announced just in the past few 
weeks notably a proposed 20 billion lbo of rjr nabisco inc have 
raised fears of upheavals in the workforce that had not been widely 
envisioned before 
i dont think this is good frankly said edith weiner a 
partner in weiner edrich brown inc a new yorkbased business 
consulting firm that focuses on longrange trends 
if one company does this to restructure and solve problems of 
nonproductivity thats one thing but the evidence is thats not 
the case anymore she said its gotten to the point where were 
not talking about the longterm interests of the economy at all 
rising concern about the impact of lbos also coincides with a 
labor force increasingly comprised of working couples who want more 
jobrelated benefits for themselves and their children 
some economists say these are colliding trends that already have 
caused managementlabor conflicts and signal a declining standard of 
living for a broad spectrum of american wageearners 
the shift from equity to debt financing is having a major 
impact on workforces said richard belous a senior economist at 
the national planning association a washingtonbased research 
concern 
you have to pay debt if you have a balance sheet which is 
highly leveraged youve lost financial flexibility he said 
how do you regain it you march into head of human resources and 
regain flexibility that way 
for example he said many companies are relying increasingly on 
parttime temporary workers who receive less pay and little or no 
benefits the relatively slow growth of wages in the past few years 
is a partial reflection of this trend he said 
richard miners partner and chief operating officer at goodrich amp 
sherwood a human resources consulting firm in new york said many 
lbo companies cannot afford to give generous benefitswage packages 
they may offer insurance but employees must contribute he 
said when it comes time to give raises theyll give less than 
the norm theyll eliminate a lot of jobs to fine tune the machine 
they have 
although some companies will benefit with increased productivity 
he said longerterm consequences are unclear many employees could 
grow bitter and disloyal resulting in declining productivity 
some of these companies all they care about is the service of 
the debt miners said the pride factor workers may have had in 
the past could disappear

a new contract with the united 
steelworkers union is one of the major obstacles as 
wheelingpittsburgh steel corp prepares to present its 
reorganization plan to federal bankruptcy court company president 
and chief executive officer william scharffenberger said tuesday 
negotiating an equitable labor agreement is the single most 
important task still before us scharffenberger said during the 
companys annual shareholders meeting the next contract we sign 
with the united steelworkers will to a very large degree determine 
whether wheelingpittsburgh can compete in the global steel economy 
after we leave the shelter of bankruptcy 
he said contract negotiations with the usw must start soon but 
probably not until november the unions current contract expires 10 
days after the companys reorganization plan is approved by the 
court scharffenberger said 
but usw district 23 director jim bowen said following the meeting 
it would be foolish to start contract talks before the 
reorganization plan is complete 
bowen said theres no sense wasting our time negotiating a 
contract when all claims against the company havent been settled 
he said it would be better to wait until the plan is filed and union 
knows just how much money the company has available to pay its 
workers 
scharffenberger speaking at a news conference before the 
shareholders meeting said talks about the companys pension 
obligations are continuing with the usw and the pension benefit 
guaranty corp the federal agency that insures pensions 
when wheelingpitt filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
april 1985 it terminated its pension plan and the federal pension 
agency assumed responsibility for the benefits 
scharffenberger said the company also is negotiating with the 
internal revenue service which has a 400 million claim against the 
company stemming from the pension problems he said the irs has 
offered to accept 18 million to settle the dispute while the 
company is offering 18 million 
scharffenberger said the usw shouldnt expect too much in its 
contract talks 
our negotiations must be conducted in the light of what could 
be called optimistic realism he said 
wheelingpitt will try to negotiate a 15 percent work force 
reduction over the next two years mainly through attrition 
scharffenberger said the company has 6400 employees 5200 of who 
are covered by the usw contract 
he said wheelingpitt has about 414 million in cash on hand but 
most will go to creditors immediately after the reorganization plan 
is confirmed 
as terrible as bankruptcy is and as expensive as it is it 
gave us a marvelous opportunity to clean up the company 
scharffenberger said at the news conference but i dont recommend 
it

digital equipment corp on tuesday 
announced plans to buy back shares with a current market value of 
more than 900 million boosting its stock price as sketchy takeover 
rumors swirled 
analysts said a takeover bid for the computer company seemed 
quite unlikely and described the buyback as a step to take advantage 
of the stocks bargain price while doing something to benefit its 
shareholders 
i dont think its a defensive move by any means said 
michael pompian an analyst in boston for needham amp co of new york 
digitals stock rose 2 a share to 92 a share in consolidated 
new york stock exchange trading following a rise of 3 a share on 
monday 
digital the worlds second biggest computer company after 
international business machines corp said its board of directors 
had authorized management to buy back up to 10 million of its own 
shares from time to time on the open market 
that number of shares represents about 8 percent of the common 
stock outstanding they would be bought at whatever the prevailing 
market price is at the time 
the recent spate of takeover activity involving companies such as 
kraft inc and rjr nabisco inc helped revive old rumors that 
american telephone amp telegraph co was interested in buying digital 
both companies have disparaged the rumors 
whoever would be buying dec would need an awfully big 
checkbook said barry bosak an analyst for eberstadt fleming inc 
in new york 
digitals stock hit a peak of 19950 in 1987 but has slumped 
badly since then the company has no dividend to support the stock 
so buybacks are one of the few ways to reward shareholders 
we believe buying our stock is an attractive investment and a 
sound way to build a shareholder value james m osterhoff 
digitals vice president for finance said in a news release 
digital purchased 3 million shares of its stock for 363 million 
in january and 5 million shares for 782 million in a program 
completed in may 1987 those shares were used for employee stock 
plans

speculation have basked in the spotlight the broader market has 
missed much of the enthusiasm 
the broader market seems to have settled back into its 
malaise said hugh johnson senior vice president at first albany 
corp 
people seem to have retreated to the sidelines until another

whether some skepticism is settling in among investors who are 
concerned about the sheer size of the latest crop of deals the 
largest proposal to date is kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos 203

people are starting to question whether we can get the 
financing done to get all these large mergers completed johnson 
said a substantial amount of financing has to be completed in a 
very short time and theres a healthy skepticism creeping in

bond prices were mixed in lackluster trading 
tuesday amid continued investor concern about an oversupply of 
longterm government securities 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond declined 316 point 
or about 180 for every 1000 in face value its yield which 
moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest 
rate trends rose to 893 percent from 891 percent late monday 
bond prices had weakened slightly last week as investors 
anticipated a vote in congress to remove the cap on 30year treasury 
issues on monday longterm bond prices declined further after 
congress voted to allow the us treasury to sell more longterm 
bonds 
the treasury is expected to announce on nov 2 plans to issue 
between 85 billion and 9 billion of 30year bonds in its 
quarterly financing 
analysts said tuesdays continuing weakness was due to ongoing 
investor concern in the absence of more significant economic data 
bondholders fear that a big increase in the supply of the treasury 
bonds would depress their price 
people are waiting to get more fundamental data of a more 
significant nature like tomorrows gnp report said elizabeth 
ginste reiners vice president of dean witter reynolds inc the 
commerce department is scheduled to release gross national product 
figures for the third quarter on wednesday 
the market virtually ignored two economic reports on tuesday 
suggesting lower inflation and a further weakening of the economy 
analysts said 
one report by the commerce department said factory orders for 
durable goods fell 41 percent in september a second report by the 
national association of realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes fell 22 percent last month 
there was nothing surprising in either report said marshall 
front an economist with the chicago investment firm of stein roe amp 
farnham people dont pay much attention to durable goods because 
they are so volatile from month to month and higher interest rates 
have dampened home sales as expected 
in the secondary market for treasury issues prices of shortterm 
governments were unchanged intermediate maturities ranged from 132 
point lower to 332 point higher and the 20year issue slipped 132 
point according to figures provided by telerate inc a financial 
information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer slipped 015 to 114887 
in corporate trading industrials were up slightly moodys 
investment grade corporate bond index which measures price 
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or 
longer rose 021 at 29447 
yields on threemonth treasury bills meanwhile rose to 770 
percent as the discount rose to 746 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills was unchanged at 795 percent with the discount flat at 755 
percent yields on oneyear bills declined to 816 percent with the 
discount down 1 basis point at 759 percent 
the yield is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury 
bill the discount is the percentage that bills are selling below 
the face value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted late in the day at 8 percent down from 8516

the owner of popeyes famous fried chicken and 
biscuits said tuesday it was launching a cash tender offer for 
churchs fried chicken inc that values its fastfood chicken 
restaurant rival at about 290 million 
the deal would combine the second and third largest fastfood 
chicken chains in the nation the biggest is kentucky fried chicken 
a unit of pepsico inc of purchase ny 
a copeland enterprises inc based in new orleans said it was 
offering 8 a share for each of churchs 36 million shares 
churchs management based in san antonio texas urged its 
shareholders to defer tendering their shares until its board could 
review the offer and make a recommendation 
analysts said the bidding could go higher on the new york stock 
exchange churchs stock rose 87 cents a share to 812 
joseph doyle who follows the fastfood business for the 
investment firm smith barney harris upham amp co in new york said 
the offer is reasonable and fair in one sense 
however in this day and age of takeovers the first offer is 
generally not the last from the original offeree doyle said 
generally the company under siege will try to come up with a 
higher alternative offer 
the offer which is to expire at midnight nov 22 is conditioned 
upon tender of enough shares to give copeland twothirds of churchs 
shares on a fullydiluted basis and upon obtaining sufficient 
financing 
copeland enterprises said it already owns nearly 12 million 
shares or 32 percent of churchs shares 
we intend to pursue it on an amicable basis said james 
flynn copelands president 
alvin c copeland popeyes chairman and chief executive said in 
a statement the combination of popeyes proven industry expertise 
in generating high per store sales on the basis of a superior 
quality menu and churchs loyal customer base in its core markets 
will create a dynamic fastfood restaurant operation 
churchs board of directors said it will make a recommendation to 
its stockholders by nov 7 whether they should accept the offer and 
why

four of the nations oil companies reported huge gains in their 
thirdquarter profits tuesday as hefty demand in refining and 
marketing segments offset declining crude oil prices 
mobil corp and chevron corp each reported doubledigit gains 
while profits at texaco inc and phillips petroleum co more than 
doubled in the latest period 
meanwhile shell oil co sun co and amerada hess corp each 
reported sharp declines in their net earnings due partly to 
declining crude oil prices 
the larger oil companies said earnings were both hurt and helped 
by falling crude prices lower costs for the raw product contributed 
to higher profit margins in refining and marketing operations but 
eroded gains in exploration and production 
mobil chairman allen e murray said his companys refining and 
marketing segments turned in strong performances thanks to improved 
margins stemming from tight refinery capacity and product 
inventories 
in addition strong consumer demand boosted sales of gasoline and 
lubricants mobils chemical unit also reported a record quarter 
murray said 
however those improvements were partially offset by a 26 percent 
drop in crude prices and higher exploration costs which lowered the 
companies profits from exploration and production 
analysts attribute most of this years drop in crude prices to 
the excess supply of oil on world markets arising from the failure 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to restrain its 
production 
for the latest quarter new yorkbased mobil had an aftertax 
profit of 557 million or 136 a share up 69 percent from 330 
million or 80 cents a share in the yearago period revenue 
totaled 1312 billion down a fraction from 1314 billion in the 
yearago period 
for the first nine months profits at the nations secondlargest 
oil company rose 86 percent to 162 billion or 395 a share 
compared with 874 million or 213 a share in the same period 
last year revenue totaled 4099 billion up 10 percent from 3712 
billion in the yearearlier period 
texaco the nations thirdlargest oil company based in white 
plains ny reported a 121 percent rise in its thirdquarter 
profits to 239 million or 98 cents a share from 108 million or 
44 cents a share in the 1987 quarter sales totaled 869 billion 
down 3 percent from 896 billion last year 
for the first nine months texacos profits jumped 183 percent to 
101 billion or 414 a share compared with 355 million or 
146 a share for the same period in 1987 revenue totaled 268 
billion up 3 percent from 26 billion in the 1987 period 
texaco chairman james w kinnear said the company is beginning to 
see benefits from its recent restructuring 
san franciscobased chevron the fourthlargest us oil concern 
said its profits rose 41 percent to 420 million or 123 a share 
in the third quarter compared with 297 million or 87 cents a 
share in the 1987 period chevrons revenue meanwhile dropped 64 
percent in the latest quarter to 72 billion from 77 billion 
last year 
for the year chevrons earnings jumped 57 percent to 16 
billion or 466 a share from 101 billion or 297 a share its 
revenue rose to 22 billion up 13 percent from 217 billion 
phillips based in bartlesville okla reported the strongest 
quarterly profit gains nearly sixfold to 215 million or 89 
cents a share from 31 million or 11 cents a share the companys 
sales totaled 285 billion up a fraction from 280 billion 
since january phillips net surged to 515 million or 217 a 
share from 2 million in the comparable 1987 period it had revenue 
of 85 billion up 76 percent from 79 billion 
phillips spokesman jere smith said a major streamlining which 
included the layoff of more than 1500 workers contributed to the 
latest figures 
meanwhile shell the sixthlargest us oil company said 
sagging crude prices pulled its quarterly earnings down 162 
percent the companys net was 352 million on revenue of 54 
billion compared with 420 million in the 1987 quarter on sales of 
56 billion the company does not report pershare figures 
but for the first nine months houstonbased shells net improved 
134 percent to 19 billion on revenue of 159 billion compared 
with a profit in the same period last year of 795 million on 
revenue of 153 billion 
lower crude prices also contributed to a 47 percent drop in suns 
latest earnings which declined 47 percent to 72 million or 67 a 
share from 137 million or 127 a share its revenue totaled 
246 billion down 23 percent from 252 billion 
sun headquartered in radnor pa reported a 69 million loss 
for the first nine months on revenue of 73 billion compared with 
a profit of 265 million in 1987 or 244 a share on revenue of

quarterly net to 158 million or 20 cents a share from 386 
million or 45 cents a share the companys revenue fell 175 
percent to 925 million from 11 billion

delchamps inc said tuesday its board had 
rejected a 224 million merger proposal from the great atlantic amp 
pacific tea co inc saying the offer was inadequate and that 
combining the supermarket companies may raise antitrust questions 
delchamps spokesman joel swanson said the supermarket companys 
ninemember board met monday night and rejected the merger proposal 
of 32 a share for delchamps 7 million shares saying it was not in 
the best interests of its shareholders 
in overthecounter trading delchamps fell 150 a share to 
2375 
aampp spokesman michael rourke of montvale nj was not 
immediately available for comment tuesday on the rejection 
delchamps attorney james h mcdonald jr said the boards 
decision was based on a number of factors including delchamps 
recent store expansion efforts and other programs which will enhance 
the value of the company 
he said the boards decision was also based upon the advice of 
counsel that significant antitrust issues exist with respect to the 
aampp merger proposal and the opinion of its financial advisor 
goldman sachs amp co that the 32 per share proposal is inadequate 
both companies operate grocery stores 
aampp began trying to buy delchamps two years ago 
aampps chairman and chief executive james wood had said in his 
oct 20 letter proposing the merger that if the delchamps board 
rejected his final offer aampp would have no alternative than to 
withdraw its 32 a share merger proposal and its 30 per share 
tender offer valued at 210 million 
af delchamps jr chairman of the delchamps board and 
president stated we would hope that mr wood can be taken at his 
word since we agree with him that the dissension brought on by this 
takeover fight is not in the best interest of our company or our 
shareholders we wish no ill will to mr wood and aampp and look 
forward to competing in the retail marketplace with aampp 
delchamps has a federal court suit pending against aampp on the 
antitrust allegations aampp filed a countersuit 
the board also reiterated its stand that the longterm best 
interests of delchamps stockholders would be better served by the 
company remaining independent and pursuing its business plan than 
merging 
the board further noted that it had received significant 
sentiment expressing support for the boards decision to remain 
independent and not accept the aampp offer 
aampp based in montvale nj is 52 percent owned by the 
tengelmann group of west germany aampp had sales of 96 billion in 
1987 from its 1170 stores in this country and canada 
delchamps had sales of about 700 million last year and has 103 
stores in alabama mississippi florida and louisiana and six 
liquor stores

compared with a profit of 244 million or 39 cents a share on 
sales of 4259 million in the same period of 1987 
polaroid said the loss includes a 97 million charge to cover 
costs associated with the restructuring which included elimination 
of 1300 workers under a voluntary severance plan planned global 
distribution of 35mm color film and a 300 million employee stock 
ownership plan 
polaroid which faces a hostile buyout bid from disney 
familyowned shamrock holdings inc of burbank calif also 
attributed the decline for the quarter ending oct 2 to startup 
costs for its new impulse camera line 
polaroid spokesman sam yanes said the company spent more than 5 
million on legal fees in the shamrock battle and the bulk of the 
losses were due to the severance payments 
our third quarter net results reflect a variety of temporary 
factors that we expect to be behind us after the fourth quarter

million in the fourth quarter to cover remaining costs of the 
restructuring announced in july

loss of 151 million on sales of 133 billion compared with 
earnings of 763 million or 123 a share on sales of 125 
billion in the yearearlier period 
booth predicted total savings from the restructuring of more than 
100 million next year he also said strong introductory sales of 
impulse in europe boosted international sales by 11 percent 
the underlying soundness of our business together with the 
progress we have been making in implementing our comprehensive 
strategic plan give us confidence in our ability to dramatically 
improve the companys profitability in 1989 he said 
shamrock last month made a hostile 42ashare offer after 
polaroid rebuffed two unsolicited bids the two companies are 
battling in a delaware court over the legality of the 10 million 
share employee stock plan which shamrock claims was enacted to 
block a takeover 
two polaroid officials took the stand in the trial in delaware 
chancery court on tuesday before vice chancellor carolyn berger

americas international debt is far 
smaller than the governments figures indicate according to a new 
study whose authors say misleading figures have led to exaggerated 
fears of economic decline 
the united states said by the commerce department to have become 
a net debtor nation in 1985 actually remained in the black until 
last year according to the study by the rand corp 
the big point about this isthat the public debate has been 
misinformed and illserved by frequent reiteration of flawed 
numbers charles wolf jr director of rands international 
economic policy research said tuesday 
the figure in question called the us international investment 
position is a cumulative total of all american spending and 
investment overseas compared to foreign spending and investment in 
this country 
the study by the governmentfunded think tank indicates that in 
1985 when commerce department figures showed the united states was 
a net debtor to the tune of 112 billion the country actually was a 
178 billion net creditor in 1986 when the government figure was a 
minus 263 billion the rand recalculation had the country a 
creditor nation by 50 billion 
in 1988 government figures indicated the country was 368 
billion in debt rand researchers havent calculated their version 
of the 1988 number but know it would be negative wolf said 
the rand study conducted under wolfs direction by university of 
michigan graduate student sarah a hooker adjusts the governments 
measures in several ways 
it converts direct investment the departments measure of 
private holdings of foreign capital including real estate to 
current dollar value because much american investment overseas was 
made years ago when the dollar was worth less than today this 
increases the vaue of americans foreign holdings relative to 
foreigners more recent investments in this country 
it boosts the value of us gold reserves another component of 
the commerce department figure by using a market price of 380 per 
ounce rather than the departments official price of 4222 an 
ounce 
on the negative side the researchers cut the value of loans 
owed to us banks by developing nations based on the theory that 
many of these shaky loans will never be repaid the study fixed 
their value at what they would bring on the secondary market where 
banks trade debts of various kinds 
these adjustments reflect previously voiced criticism of the 
commerce department figures but the researchers believe they are 
the first to actually recalculate the department numbers based on 
the criticism wolf said 
even after the changes the numbers show a steady slide in the 
us position that isnt necessarily bad wolf said to the extent 
that it represents foreigners confidence in the united states 
economy as a safe stable haven for their money 
the point is you dont contribute to what we like to think of 
as an informed and educated debate by using figures that are 300 
million off the mark wolf said theres a perception problem 
in how you view the situation is it grave or serious or just a 
matter of concern i think its a matter of concern
