chicago attorney richard j phelan named tuesday 
to investigate the ethical conduct of house speaker jim wright has 
raised money for democratic sen paul simon and was elected a 
delegate to the democratic national convention 
but some of phelans associates took issue with republican 
claims that the chicago lawyer is a democratic activist who 
couldnt impartially investigate wright also a democrat 
although he was a delegate to the democratic convention last 
week phelan decided not to go 
phelan 51 was elected as a delegate pledged to the failed 
presidential bid of simon dill but resigned before the 
convention said simon spokeswoman terry stephan 
ms stephan did not indicate why phelan who had served as a 
simon fundraiser had resigned 
phelans selection tuesday drew criticism from citizens for 
reagan which sent a mailgram message to the house ethics committee 
saying the appointment of liberal democrat activist richard 
phelan as outside counsel in the wright case certainly calls into 
question the independence of the ethics committee inquiry 
but amy zisook of chicago simons national finance director 
took issue with characterizing phelan as an activist 
i assume hes been active locally but ive been involved in 
democratic politics at the statewide level for six years and this 
year was the first time i ever met mr phelan ms zisook said 
phelan is a 1958 graduate of the university of notre dame and 
received his law degree from georgetown university in 1961 the 
same year he was admitted to the illinois bar 
he is the author of numerous articles on litigation and was 
president of the chicago bar association in 198586 
last year phelan successfully defended jewel companies inc in 
a lawsuit in which attorneys sought 100 million in punitive 
damages for hundreds of people sickened in the nations largest 
outbreak of salmonella 
the outbreak in 1985 had been traced to milk from a jewel dairy 
in suburban chicago the company ended up compensating those who 
fell ill for their actual losses but not paying extra punitive 
damages 
attorneys at phelans firm said the case was the largest 
personal injury product liability class action yet settled 
phelan also defended the city of chicago in a case brought by a 
black patrolmens association which contended the police force had 
discriminated against black officers 
phelan and his wife carol an architect have three children 
they live in a northern chicago suburb 
house ethics committee chairman julian c dixon dcalif said 
democratic and republican members of the evenly divided 12member 
panel had agreed on phelans selection 
members of both parties were satisified that he could do an 
impartial job dixon said 
the contract with phelans chicago firm phelan pope amp john 
ltd will be for no more than 300000 he said dixon said he 
could not estimate how long the investigation would take

partial train service was restored 
wednesday as striking locomotive drivers began returning to work 
after police arrested hundreds of strikers and supporters 
hundreds of locomotive drivers and assistants demanding higher 
pay and shorter hours walked off the job tuesday after refusing to 
accept a compromise deal on allowances and working hours 
the korean national railroad said services were operating at 
about 30 percent of normal levels after being virtually crippled 
tuesday railroad officials said they hoped to restore almost full 
service by thursday as strikers returned to work 
surburban train service around seoul which was affected by the 
strike was back to normal early wednesday railroad officials said 
police officials who declined to be named said 420 people were 
still being held wednesday after about 1460 striking drivers and 
members of their families were arrested the day before for blocking 
stations and other railroad facilities the others had been 
released with reprimands police said 
of the ramaining 420 still in custody officials said about 20 
were strike leaders facing charges of conducting an illegal strike 
the others would probably be handed over to summary courts to face 
minor charges they said 
the government moved to crush the strike and thousands of riot 
police were sent to stations and railway yards to stop peaceful 
protests by the strikers and their families the cabinet held an 
emergency session tuesday to oversee handling of the affair 
those arrested defied police orders to disperse but there were 
no reports of violent clashes police said 
railroad officials said strikers were returning to work but 
they had no overall figures on how many of the some 4400 drivers 
and assistants had joined the strike they said they expect most 
strikers to resume work wednesday 
but reports in seoul newspapers wednesday said some strikers 
said they would not return to work until all strikers arrested by 
police had been freed 
the officials said the strike cost the knr an estimated 25 
million tuesday alone and that there was no estimate yet as to 
losses suffered by other industries 
choi kiduk head of the railroad authority said the strike was 
illegal because it had not been approved by the railroad union 
strikers said a compromise deal worked out by the union failed 
to satisfy demands for shorter work hours and a 100 percent raise 
in allowances paid on top of normal salaries 
under the rejected deal the railroad would raise allowances 
from about 100 to 138 a month and cut workloads from 245 hours to 
224 hours a month the strikers wanted work hours cut to 144 hours 
south koreas train drivers with about 10 yearss expereince 
earn about 1200 a month in regular salary and various allowances 
which include overtime holiday allowance locomotive drivers 
allowance according to the railroad

the democratic national convention would have 
been a big ratings hit last week if only one network had showed up 
with three sharing the coverage however the convention drove 
millions of viewers to other channels 
the threenetwork share of the viewing audience fell to 49 
percent in the ac nielsen co ratings last week meaning that 
fewer than half the sets in use during prime time were tuned to a 
network that compares to a 68 percent share for the three networks 
this season 
during convention week in 1984 the threenetwork share was 54 
percent according to gerald jaffe nbcs vice president for 
research who said last weeks share was the worst ever for the 
networks 
during the four days of the convention in atlanta the networks 
primetime share this year was 40 percent jaffe estimated that 
perhaps another 1 percent of the audience was watching the 
convention on cable news network 
the best finish for campaign coverage was 26th for nbc on 
tuesday night with a rating of 87 while abc had the low on 
monday night with a 57 for 52nd place 
however the threenetwork total for tuesday nights coverage 
was a rating of 232 compared with 156 for golden girls the 
weeks toprated show cumulative totals for the other nights were 
201 for monday 201 for wednesday and 211 on thursday 
the rating is a percentage of the nations estimated 886 
million households with televisions the share is a percentage of 
sets in use 
because of the lack of suspense at this years democratic 
convention and the expectation that the republican national 
convention also will be largely a scripted media event abc news 
president roone arledge has said his network might pare its 
coverage of the gop gathering 
the two other networks have said they will give the gop as much 
time as the democrats got 
nbc had the biggest convention audience with a 74 average 
rating for the four nights jaffe said nbc was the only network to 
have better convention ratings than in 1984 abc was second with 
69 and cbs was third with 65 
nbc won the week with an average rating of 94 more than a 
third less than its season average cbs was second at 79 and abc 
had 78 
for the 44 weeks of the season nbc leads with an average 
primetime rating of 150 followed by cbs at 126 and abc at 125 
news ratings also were down last week cbs was the winner with 
an 86 rating half a point lower than its winning number a week 
earlier abc was second at 86 down 06 and nbc was in third at

airplane was killed after his craft apparently struck a west german 
tornado jet fighter in flight and crashed police said

plane nicked the fighter before tuesdays crash but officials did 
not rule out the possibility that turbulence from the jets engine 
sent the ultralight down 
the dead pilot was not identified 
the crash occurred near eggenfelden about 60 miles east of 
munich 
the jet was not damaged and returned to its base near munich 
officials said

weeks has resulted in a growing demand that lowlevel military 
training flights be banned or sharply reduced

mikhail s gorbachevs drive to modernize industry 
and trim fat from management forced nearly 1 million soviet factory 
workers out of work in the first half of the year radio moscow 
reported 
but those laid off are sure to get other jobs since the 
government has undertaken to redistribute the labor force in a 
planned manner the staterun radio said tuesday 
gorbachev named communist party chief in march 1985 has waged 
a campaign to reform the countrys economy increase productivity 
and prune the size of the state bureaucracy 
in january the communist party daily pravda estimated that 16 
million soviets would be laid off in the next 12 years as 
efficiency increases 
radio moscow said the number of workers in soviet industries 
has gone down by almost 1 million in the first half of the year 
compared with the same period last year 
the national statistical service attributes the fact to the 
current economic reform which is introducing more automatic 
systems and streamlining management the radio said 
radio moscow did not provide the size of the labor force in the 
countrys factories last year or today 
in 1986 821 million of the soviet unions 276 million citizens 
were officially classified as workers as distinguished from 
whitecollar service or management personnel and collective farmers

on an evening in 1856 rep philemon t 
herbert of california one of the more obscure members of the 
house was waiting for service in the dining room of the capitals 
preeminent hotel the willard 
growing hungrier and angrier by the minute he was 
resolutely ignored by a haughty waiter 
according to a new history of the house of representatives 
losing his patience and perhaps feeling the snub more acutely 
than he had a right to do herbert pulled his pistol and shot and 
killed the man 
herberts rather extreme reaction to this unacceptable affront 
to his congressional dignity is recounted by house historian james 
t currie who adds the house did not censure rep herbert for 
his act thereby giving a certain justification to it 
this was perhaps not a high moment in the history of the house 
or of its members 
but washington waiters ever since have been closely observant of 
the needs of hungry house and senate members 
the temper tantrum of the ignored congressman and its fatal 
result is but a minor low point in a new volume sketching the 
199year history of the house most of which is devoted to far more 
consequential affairs of state 
curries work and a companion history of the senate by its 
official historian richard baker have been issued to mark next 
years celebration of the bicentennial of the congress 
they set out the milestones of the nations legislative history 
with an occasional side look at some of the more unusual and 
eccentric people and events along the way 
for the most part bakers history of the senate ignores the 
existence of the house curries history of the house mostly 
ignores the history of the senate 
but not entirely 
at the very beginning the house historian notes the senate 
proposed that the nations president be addressed as his 
highness president of the united states and protector of the 
rights of the same 
currie calls this an awful appellation and records that the 
house would have none of it 
the president has been mr president ever since 
baker recalls how alexis detocqueville the french observer of 
american institutions was struck in 1831 by the vulgar 
demeanor of the popularly elected house compared to the senate 
whose members were elected by state legislatures 
the senate said de tocqueville is composed of eloquent 
advocates distinguished generals wise magistrates and statesmen 
of note whose arguments would do honor to the most remarkable 
parliamentary debates in europe 
the house he sniffed was composed of men of far lower 
qualifications and standing in society in a country in which 
education is very general it is said that the representatives of 
the people do not always know how to write correctly 
in fairness baker notes that sen thomas hart benton took 
exception to this branding detocqueville and his opinions as 
elitist 
the missouri senator observed that most senators had 
originally been house members 
currie notes that thomas jefferson is said to have asked george 
washington why the constitutional convention had created a 
twohouse legislature 
why wasnt one house enough 
why did you pour your tea into that saucer asked washington 
to cool it replied jefferson just so responded 
washington we pour house legislation into the senatorial saucer 
to cool it 
currie notes that 200 years after that purported discussion the 
situation is at times reversed 
the house has begun to act as a check on the senate he 
concludes it has now become in many instances the saucer into 
which senate legislation is poured to cool it 
the two volumes lay out the benchmarks of congressional history 
high and low triumph and scandal the burning of the capitol by 
the british in 1814 the expansion of the nation the march toward 
civil war in the 1860s the end of slavery the era of 
reconstruction the impeachment trial of president andrew johnson 
investigations the rivalry with the presidency the depression 
world wars the ethics of congressmen watergate 
says historian baker of his volume its a hop skip and a 
jump over the mountain tops

americans are eating their way to early 
graves bite by bite and meal by meal consuming too much fat 
seasoning it with too much salt and washing it down with too much 
alcohol according to a report issued today by the us surgeon 
general 
overconsumption of certain dietary components is now a major 
concern for americans the report said noting that diseases of 
dietary excess and imbalance are among the leading causes of 
death in the united states 
many americans are overweight dont eat enough fruit 
vegetables and whole grains and often fail to get required 
nutrients such as calcium and iron 
of the 21 million americans who died last year the surgeon 
generals study said that nearly 15 million succumbed to diseases 
associated with diet 
what we eat may affect our risk for several of the leading 
causes of death for americans notably coronary heart disease 
stroke atherosclerosis diabetes and some types of cancer the 
report said these disorders together now account for more than 
twothirds of all deaths in the united states 
though malnutrition is a problem in several parts of the world 
and for certain americans the report said for most of us the 
more likely problem has become one of overeating too many 
calories for our activity levels and an imbalance in the nutrients 
consumed along with them 
in a forward to the report surgeon general c everett koop said 
that although many foods are involved the chief factor affecting 
health is the disproportionate consumption of foods high in fats 
often at the expense of foods high in complex carbohydrates and 
fiber such as vegetables fruits and whole grain products 
he said he is convinced that through a concerted effort by 
policy makers and the public our daily diets can bring a 
substantial measure of better health to all americans 
the 712page report cites more than 2000 scientific studies 
from around the world and was compiled with the advice of more than 
200 doctors nutritionists and biochemists 
the report makes recommendations ranging from the amount of fat 
that should be included in the diet to the advisability of taking 
vitamin supplements 
among the major findings 
most people should reduce the consumption of fat especially 
saturated fats such as from eggs butter or untrimmed red meat it 
suggests more vegetables and fruits fish poultry lean meats and 
lowfat dairy products 
more whole grain foods cereal products vegetables and fruits 
should be in the diet the report recommends that dried beans and 
peas be used as a source of protein to replace some animal products 
sodium consumption should be reduced by limiting the use of 
salt in food preparation and at the table 
alcohol intake should be reduced to two drinks a day if at 
all pregnant women should avoid any alcohol it said the report 
estimates that about 9 percent of the american population has two 
or more drinks a day 
fluoride should be added to community water systems to prevent 
tooth decay and that the consumption of sugar be limited to avoid 
dental cavities 
adolescent girls and women should increase consumption of foods 
high in calcium such as lowfat dairy products 
children adolescents and women of childbearing age should 
consume more ironrich foods such as red meat fish cereals 
beans and wholegrain cereals this issue is of special concern 
for lowincome families the report said 
dietary fat the report said increases risks for obesity some 
types of cancer gallbladder and heart disease 
dietary fat accounts for about 37 percent of the total energy 
intake of americans well above the upper limit of 30 percent 
recommended by the american heart association and the american 
cancer society the report said 
it said excess cholesterol levels strongly associated with 
heart attacks should be reduced by limiting consumption of foods 
of animal origin such as eggs dairy products meat poultry and 
fish 
the report warned against fad diets or magical foods that 
often are promoted with unsubstantiated claims it said americans 
spend about 27 billion a year for nutritional supplements that 
are of unproven benefit 
overthecounter vitamins and minerals alone represent a huge 
business of questionable value the report said 
an estimated 40 percent of americans consume supplemental 
vitamins minerals or other dietary components at an annual cost 
of more than 15 billion even though such supplements are not 
needed by most customers the report said 
americans also spend extra money for products labeled as 
natural or organic even though the study said special 
benefits of these products are not generally demonstrated 
natural vitamins for example often sell at twice the price 
of synthetic products even though they are chemically identical 
the report said in some such products labeled as natural only 
a minor fraction of the vitamin is actually derived from natural 
sources

critics of a 145 million milk price support 
increase tacked onto the house droughtrelief bill say it could 
invite a presidential veto but the amendments chief sponsor says 
its needed because cows dont drop from the sky 
rep james jeffords rvt says that without the 50cent price 
support increase dairy farmers in his state and elsewhere will 
reduce the size of their herds eventually leading to milk 
shortages 
critics produced two studies saying the chances of such 
shortages are slight but the house agriculture committee approved 
the milk pricesupport increase anyway on a 1512 vote and then 
sent the droughtrelief bill to the full house 
this amendment makes the whole bill more vulnerable said 
rep dan glickman dkan he said the amendment makes the measure 
subject to criticism that it treats one segment of agriculture 
more favorably than other segments of agriculture 
the committee action also came despite a warning from president 
reagan against special benefits for favored segments of agriculture 
creating windfalls for some will mean less for the truly 
deserving reagan said in a letter sent monday to house 
agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza dtexas 
to put it very simply we must not bust the budget reagan 
said 
as the bill was written two weeks ago it would have canceled an 
expected pricesupport cut of 50 cents for each hundred pounds of 
milk the new plan adopted at jeffords urging would not only 
cancel the reduction but would increase the pricesupport level by 
50 cents per hundredweight to 1110 
it is the duty of this committee to assure that there is an 
adequate supply of milk said jeffords whose home state is a 
major source of the east coasts milk 
he said that without additional help dairy farmers will reduce 
their herds and the lost production capability could not be 
restored overnight 
cows dont drop from the sky jeffords said he said that if 
milk shortages set in youre going to hear screams from 
consumers that you wont believe 
rep jim olin dva presented one study by the agriculture 
department and another by private agricultural economists that saw 
no milk shortage in the offing if the system remains as it is 
proponents of the measure however shrugged off such studies 
rep charles stenholm dtexas said that because of the drought a 
50cent increase in the pricesupport level actually is in keeping 
philosophically with the 1985 farm program even though it calls 
for successive 50cent cuts in supports 
steinholm said higher feed prices caused by a hay shortage 
have been tantamount to a drastic cut in price supports and that 
fairness would actually call for a 1 increase in supports 
at the outset of the committees session deputy agriculture 
secretary peter myers told lawmakers the administration already 
disapproved of provisions of the bill that would expand feed 
programs for dairy and livestock producers 
he also said the administration opposes a provision that would 
require farmers to buy federal crop insurance in the next two years 
as a condition of receiving disaster payments now 
the measure would provide disaster payments for growers of all 
crops equal to 65 percent of losses in excess of 35 percent of 
expected yield 
for farmers who lost their entire crops there would be 
additional payments 
the senate agriculture committee already has approved its own 
version of the bill but is struggling to come up with a similar 
plan to aid farmers whose crops have been all but entirely burned 
away by the blazing sun and shortage of rainfall that has plagued 
the midcontinent 
farm senators had planned to meet late tuesday to work out a 
formula but canceled the session at the last minute they still are 
aiming for floor action this week 
feed benefits for livestock producers would be capped at 50000 
for each individual payments for crop producers would be limited 
to 100000 per person 
as it was putting the finishing touches on the bill the house 
committee demonstrated compassion for cotton growers in the 
district of rep larry combest rtexas whose crops were damaged 
last year by hail the panel approved a 24 million amendment that 
would provide disaster payments to those farmers 
proponents acknowledged that the damage had nothing to do with 
the drought but noted that there was a similar disaster relief bill 
in 1986 but none in 1987 they said combests plan would fill in 
the gaps

this summers heat and drought have hurt 
livestock producers now and for some time in the future an 
agriculture department analysis says 
meat production in the second half of 1988 will be greater than 
it otherwise would have been without the drought and prices 
received by livestock producers will be down reflecting the 
thinning out of herds 
as producers sell off some breeding stock the longterm 
capacity of the industry will be lowered the report said the 
increased slaughter in 1988 will lower production in 1989 and 
prices will rise again 
the report was prepared by john ginzel and richard stillman of 
the departments economic research service it was included in a 
forthcoming issue of agriculture outlook magazine 
beef production will be affected by this years drought in two 
ways the report said 
first cattle feedlot operators who depend on corn and other 
feed grains are seeing higher production costs second cowcalf 
operators who provide calves to feeders will be hit the hardest 
calves are the major cost in the cattle feeding industry 
the report said as the price of feed rises cattle feedlot 
operators will decrease the price they are willing to pay for 
feeder cattle 
meanwhile the cowcalf producers major feed is forage such as 
pasture and hay drought has reduced the forage supply just as it 
has the grain inventory as production of forage is reduced 
cowcalf operators are forced to reduce their herds or supplement 
grazing with hay 
the first cattle to move off droughtstressed pasture usually 
are the yearling cattle that normally go into feedlots the 
report said the next to move are replacement heifers which were 
intended to go into the breeding herd and older lessproductive 
cows 
finally the last to go are the mature most productive cows 
the basic breeding stock for future beef production 
drought affects hog producers mostly through higher feed costs 
the report said many hog farmers produce some or all of their feed 
grains but as corn yields are reduced producers will have to buy 
additional grain or send their hogs to slaughter early 
increased culling of the hog breeding herd boost shortterm 
production and reduces prices received the report said it 
will also reduce production in 1989 feeder pig producers are 
squeezed more than farrowtofinish hog farmers much like the 
cowcalf producers in the beef industry 
drought has hit the poultry industry in similar ways with 
higher grain and soybean meal prices raising production costs 
broiler production may drop in the second half of 1988 and in 1989 
relative to normal output 
because broilers have a short production cycle the broiler 
industry can respond more quickly to the higher feed costs and can 
decrease production more quickly than either the cattle or hog 
industries the report said 
it added as with previous droughts if next years grain and 
forage crops are near normal and if grain prices drop and livestock 
prices soar because production is down meat production will then 
become further depressed as profitability improves and as producers 
hold animals from slaughter to rebuild their breeding herds

the agriculture department has scheduled a 
referendum among hog producers and importers to determine whether a 
national pork promotion and research program will continue 
the vote will be held sept 78 at county extension offices j 
patrick boyle administrator of the departments agricultural 
marketing service announced tuesday 
all pork producers or persons importing hogs pork or pork 
products between nov 1 1986 and sept 6 1988 will be entitled 
to vote in the referendum boyle said a simple majority one 
vote more than half the number cast will determine if the 
program will continue 
the 1985 farm law authorized the pork program which is paid for 
by an assessment of one quarter of 1 percent of the market value of 
all hogs sold in the united states and an equivalent amount on 
imported hogs pork and pork products 
a final regulation setting up the program was issued by usda on 
sept 5 1986 and the assessments began that fall on nov 1 
congress stipulated that for the program to continue in effect a 
referendum must be held between 24 months and 30 months after the 
department issued the final regulation

rains have relieved drought stress in 
parts of the corn belt but crops have shown little improvement 
reports the governments joint agricultural weather facility 
the precipitation gave most crops a boost in the central and 
southern great plains delta and southeast the report said 
tuesday soil moisture improved but was still mostly short in the 
eastern half of the nation 
in the central and eastern corn belt rain during the week of 
july 1824 may have come too late to improve corn harvest 
prospects the report said 
soybeans were reported in mostly fair condition but showed 
little improvement as a result of rain in the central and eastern 
corn belt areas the report said however soybeans continued to 
improve in the great plains where the crop was reported in good 
to fair shape 
livestock was reported in mostly fair condition and recent 
rains have helped pastures although forage was still in short 
supply 
the facility is operated jointly by the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration and the agriculture department

the chairman of the house ethics committee 
says a new outside counsel named to probe allegations against house 
speaker jim wright will be free to investigate in any manner he 
deems appropriate 
but the counsel chicago lawyer richard j phelan will be 
restricted to looking into the six counts in a complaint adopted by 
the panel on june 9 and public release of any findings will be 
controlled by the ethics panel said chairman julian c dixon 
dcalif 
if any other evidence comes to his attention he is directed 
to report that to us dixon said in an interview tuesday the 
committee would then decide whether to broaden the investigation 
he added 
dixon said he expects phelan and his staff will do independent 
investigative work including the taking of large numbers of 
depositions the ethics panel formally known as the committee on 
standards of official conduct will pay phelans law firm up to 
300000 plus expenses he said 
he is free to investigate in any manner he deems appropriate 
whatever he feels is necessary said dixon 
im like any other professional lawyer phelan told 
reporters in a brief introduction outside the closed door of the 
committee room im going to exercise my own judgment within the 
parameters of the inquiry ive been told to investigate the 
allegations fully fairly completely and thoroughly and thats 
what i intend to do 
wrights chief accuser rep newt gingrich rga complained 
about the selection of phelan noting that he has been an active 
democratic fundraiser in chicago and had been a delegate to last 
weeks democratic national convention although he sat out the 
convention and let an alternate take his place 
gingrich said he also would have preferred selection of someone 
with a prosecutorial background phelans 60lawyer firm handles 
mostly corporate law and civil litigation 
it seems to me for this investigation to have any legitimacy 
it has to be able to follow the leads wherever they lead 
gingrich told reporters the independent counsel has to be truly 
independent he cannot be on a short leash held by the democratic 
chairman of the committee 
dixon said the 12member ethics panel made up of six democrats 
and six republicans agreed to seek an outside counsel at the same 
time it opened its wright inquiry on june 9 but chose not to make 
that decision public until someone was found to take the job 
we believed the american public would feel more comfortable 
when the speaker of the house of representatives is being 
investigated with someone that is not an employee of the 
capitol he said 
wright repeated to reporters his contention that he would be 
exonerated by the probe and said he hoped it would be conducted 
quickly i think they will conclude i have not violated any 
commonly accepted ethics rules and the sooner that happens the 
better wright said 
but wright said the matter is being used as a political weapon 
by gingrich who is laying the groundwork to cry foul if the probe 
turns up nothing critical of the speaker 
failing to have any substance on which to rely they are 
trying to lay the impression that the inevitable result of a clear 
bill of health is somehow a whitewash wright said 
at the same time vice president george bush who has used 
wrights ethics problems as grist on the campaign trail was 
speaking across the street from the capitol at the library of 
congress and advocating conflictofinterest laws for congress that 
are as tough as those that now apply to the executive branch 
including provisions for a fully independent counsel to investigate 
ethics cases 
the six counts now pending against wright include charges of 
using his office to lobby federal officials and others on matters 
in which he had a financial interest and alleged improprieties in 
the publication of a book by a campaign contractor for which wright 
received unusually high royalties among other charges

firespitting helicopters 
were dispatched to yellowstone national park on tuesday to help 
protect the old faithful geyser area from a 6000acre blaze part 
of the worst series of fires in the park in nearly a century 
almost 1000 firefighters were summoned to the scene but 
officials had not decided as of early tuesday evening whether to 
actively fight the fire one of a dozen burning in the oldest 
national park 
the fires have charred more than 70000 acres in the 22 
millionacre park the nations oldest national park one fire the 
47000acre blaze dubbed clover mist on the eastern edge of 
yellowstone made two jumps into shoshone national forest 
interior secretary donald hodel made plans to tour yellowstone 
by helicopter wednesday to get a firsthand view of the devastation 
winds were pushing the old faithful fire away from the geyser 
complex which includes an historic inn and several other 
buildings but fire managers decided as a safeguard to call in 
helitorches that can spew a napalmlike substance if 
officials decide to use them the copters will be used to start 
backfires to burn away brush in the main fires path 
the fire which started friday in the adjacent targhee national 
forest in idaho burned roughly 10 miles west of old faithful and 
about 1015 miles south of madison junction said fire information 
officer bruce fox 
later estimated differed on how far the fire was from old 
faithful ranging from about 6 miles to 10 miles but officials 
agreed that it was still burning toward the northeast a direction 
would bypass the geyser spokesmen stressed that their figures on 
total acreage burned also were estimates 
officials said they didnt believe firefighters could ever douse 
the flames these fires are going to burn until the weather puts 
them out said fox 
a fire camp was established 13 miles north of old faithful in an 
open field where resting firefighters relaxed in tents or simply 
stretched out on the ground 
other firefighters were at old faithful picking the area clean 
of downed trees piles of firewood twigs and pine needles that 
could feed embers carried by winds to the area they also cleared 
the ground around a microwave tower that provides old faithfuls 
communications with the rest of the park 
plans were made to burn a fivemilelong meadow possibly on 
wednesday to clear out the dry vegetation and thus slow the fire 
if it turned toward old faithful said fox 
with the worstcase weather scenario strong winds out of the 
west that probably wouldnt hold it but it would definitely slow 
it down he said if all else fails well backfire old 
faithful 
eighty firefighters were sent to an area near frost lake 
located 10 miles north of yellowstones east entrance where flames 
had blackened about 200 acres since the fire moved into the 
national forest during the weekend said forest spokesman dave 
damron 
another 60 were 10 miles farther to the north where the canoe 
lake fire had burned about 50 acres he said 
unusually hot and dry conditions this summer have left 
yellowstone and the rest of northwestern wyoming tinderbox dry 
the last time they had this much fire in the park was in the 
late 1800s said incident commander larry caplinger the fuel 
conditions and the weather conditions lend themselves to extreme 
fire potential 
the outlook is we probably got at least three long months of 
fire season ahead of us in this part of the country he added 
we could be in for the beginning of the siege of 88 
although no closures of services or accommodations at old 
faithful had been ordered park visitors were advised such closures 
may eventually be necessary fires have forced the closure of grant 
village and the road from there south to the south entrance 
at grant village about 500 firefighters were continuing to 
fight flames from the the shoshone and red fires that had spread to 
20200 acres the village includes a small hotel and some trailers 
and apartments for park service personnel 
hot embers shooting ahead of the fires monday night burned 
through power lines at the area of the village and set one building 
on fire officials said the structure wasnt seriously damaged 
flames also had burned around the lewis lake campground 
torching trees along the perimeter of the area according to fire 
officials 
in the teton wilderness that borders yellowstone on the south 
some 690 firefighters worked tuesday along the northern edge of the 
24400acre mink creek fire 
while good progress was made during the day on the southern end 
of the fire thunderstorms packing some erratic winds were creating 
a problem on the northern end which had burned about 1200 acres 
into yellowstones remote backcountry

americans looking for a pristine wilderness 
experience on remote us forest service lands increasingly are 
finding trashy campsites unsafe trails unhealthy water and 
pollution 
and forest service officials recounting these problems also are 
warning that because of tight money and growing land use 
conditions are likely to worsen among the 32 million acres of 
official wilderness under their control 
were falling behind george leonard associate usfs chief 
told the house interior public lands subcommittee on tuesday in 
what chairman bruce vento dminn said was the firstever 
congressional review of the condition of wilderness areas protected 
from development under a landmark 1964 law 
wilderness areas are now literally being loved to death by 
burgeoning numbes of backpackers some of them ignorant of 
backcountry etiquette and hygiene said greg hansen a ranger from 
the superstition wilderness in arizonas tonto national forest 
richard laborde supervisor for two areas in californias inyo 
national forest said that overuse there has been countered by 
setting trailhead quotas and requiring campers to obtain permits 
but he said the areas two rangers are able to contact only 7 
percent of the visitors to brief them on backcountry manners and 
that trail reconstruction is eight years behind schedule causing 
safety and erosion problems 
laborde said all visitors are told to purify water before 
drinking it and to combat improper sanitation practices by 
campers there are now two solar toilets on the popular mt whitney 
trail he said 
anne fege of the forest service explains that such toilets are 
portable enclosures that have solar collectors to generate heat to 
dry out and compost human waste 
laborde said grazing by pack animals owned by commercial 
outfitters is nearing the lands grazing capacity and that 
concentrated use of some campsites has left many barren scars on 
the landscape 
our efforts to regain some sort of natural condition to these 
areas have been weak testified laborde adding that hes had 
very little success in getting forest service support for 
revegetation efforts 
leonard and the six rangers at the hearing said more money is 
needed to manage the wilderness areas vento agreed saying that 
only 32 cents a year is being spent on each wilderness acre 
compared to 639 per acre for general forest service lands 
since 1984 congress has doubled the number of wilderness areas 
to 352 it also has doubled the wilderness budget to about 15 
million leonard said however that this doesnt give us the 
resources to get ahead 
the rangers from the field continually emphasized one point 
beyond one headquarters job in washington there are no fulltime 
jobs as wilderness rangers and no forest service career track in 
wilderness management 
as a result there is little overall management planning 
considerable turnover among skilled field people and little time 
for rangers to do much more than keep a cursory watch on the remote 
acreage under their domain 
the reality of a person only working five months is that there 
is little planning time available said linda merigliano the 
ranger responsible for the 116500acre jedediah smith wilderness 
in wyoming 
she said that because of tight money 63 percent of her trail 
system is substandard and deteriorating she estimated it would 
cost 162295 for labor and materials to repair the trails 
most of the impacts occurring in the jedediah smith wilderness 
result from visitor ignorance of appropriate camping and traveling 
behavior said merigliano adding that she couldnt get 50 to 
put together a slide show about proper camping techniques 
she said that despite the requirements of the targhee national 
forest plan her area lacks an assessment of its campsites 
lee kirsch the ranger for three areas in colorados san isabel 
national forest said such assessments in her areas found 85 
percent of the campsites violating wilderness regulations

the pentagon has ignored congressional orders 
to do a better job of testing weapons before it invests in 
multimilliondollar programs says the watchdog arm of congress 
as a result the pentagons 5yearold weapons testing program 
still cannot adequately assess whether weapons would work in 
combat the general accounting office says 
the gao review deals with the pentagons office of operational 
test and evaluation which was created by congress in 1983 in an 
attempt to do a more realistic job of testing weapons 
the legislation was triggered by the discovery of serious flaws 
in several major weapons systems after they were well into 
development 
the gao report was released tuesday by the congressional 
military reform caucus a group of 140 legislators who banded 
together in 1981 to seek management changes in the federal 
governments largest single agency 
rep charles bennett dfla a caucus member told defense 
secretary frank c carlucci the pentagon had ignored congress 
orders to test weapons realistically 
congress cannot depend on the realism of the weapons tests or 
the independence of the testing reports we receive said bennett 
carlucci appearing at a house armed services committee hearing 
said he hadnt seen the report and couldnt comment on its 
specifics 
but he then went on to criticize what he said is an increasing 
tendency on the part of members of congress to seek gao reviews 
without giving the pentagon a chance to review the reports before 
they are released 
dan howard carluccis spokesman was even more critical the 
difficulty is that those members of congress who do not wish to 
inform themselves who very carefully guard their ignorance 
obviously are not going to learn about the details of our testing 
programs he said 
sen david pryor dark a cosponsor of the 1983 legislation 
said i am disappointed but hardly surprised i have never seen 
evidence of any desire by the pentagon or this administration to 
make this office work as we in congress intended it to work 
the gao reviewed the pentagons test of six major weapons 
including the navys aegis air defense that is the sophisticated 
tracking system involved in the july 3 shootdown by the navy 
cruiser vincennes of an iranian jetliner in the persian gulf the 
pentagon says the ship thought it was firing at an iranian f14 and 
is investigating the incident 
the other weapons in the gao study were the armys aquila drone 
plane the armys helicopter improvement program navy tomahawk 
conventional cruise missile the newest targeting system for the 
air force maverick missile and the air force lantirn system for 
nighttime targeting 
the gao concluded that there were significant problems and 
limitations in the planning execution realism analysis and 
service test agency reporting of the six programs some of these 
problems and limitations were unavoidable due to time resource 
or safety constraints although numerous others were not 
the gao study said the pentagon hadnt followed congressional 
orders to make the tests as realistic and combatlike as possible 
for example the prevailing problem for operational users was 
that they were selected from an operator pool that was atypically 
high in skill or experience level that is socalled golden 
crews the review said 
another example in some instances contractors were permitted to 
help military crews maintain the weapons although that contractor 
support would not be available in the field 
the problem was compounded by the fact that test data was often 
misread the gao said in five of six cases we found problems 
with the various assumptions underlying the analyses of the test 
data in at least two cases such assumptions led to overly 
optimistic estimates of the systems capability one of which was 
contracted by available data 
there were other questionable practices in interpreting data 
and their impact was significant the gao said they 
frequently allowed a system to appear to meet its performance 
requirements 
flaws cited by the report included the fact that crews used for 
both the army helicopter tests and maverick tests were specifically 
trained for the tests rather than being normal crews and tests of 
the tomahawk occurred only over pretested flight routes

former gov evan mecham on tuesday rejected 
a demand by gov rose mofford that he turn over to the state a 
protocol fund that figured in his impeachment trial 
instead mecham said he planned to return the roughly 80000 to 
those who contributed to it in the first place 
the money was raised through ticket sales to mechams january 
1987 inaugural ball and was originally intended to help pay off 
some of his campaign debts 
but corporations had bought some of the tickets and state law 
bars corporate campaign contributions so mecham aides later agreed 
to treat the money as a kind of protocol fund to pay for gifts 
to visitors and similar expenses that state budgets normally dont 
cover 
mrs mofford and attorney general bob corbin contend that the 
agreement turned the fund into state property and they told mecham 
last week that he had until the close of business tuesday to turn 
over the money or face a civil suit 
but mecham said in a speech tuesday that he believed his 
solution was a better one and spokesmen for mrs mofford and 
corbin said the officials were willing to negotiate further before 
suing 
we are not champing at the bit to file this suit said 
corbin spokeswoman maria khan we want to discuss it with people 
in the governors office and mr mechams lawyers 
mrs moffords spokesman vada manager said the governor 
still is following the advice of the attorney general 
mecham was convicted april 4 by the state senate on impeachment 
charges including one that he had misused the state funds when he 
loaned much of the protocol fund to his car dealership 
mecham maintained that the money was a private account even 
though it was being used for state purposes and he said lending 
the money to his dealership allowed the fund to garner higher 
interest than a regular bank account would have earned 
on tuesday mecham said he would fight any suit but would hold 
off on making refunds for a couple of weeks to let corbin file 
suit khan declined to say why corbin didnt accept the idea of 
returning the money to the contributors or what compromise his 
office might approve

sharp increases in trade with the united states 
and hong kong helped push chinas foreign trade up nearly 20 
percent in the first half of 1988 officials said today 
spokesman liu xiangdong of the ministry of foreign economic 
relations and trade told a news conference that trade for the 
period totaled 3585 billion 195 percent above last years 
figure 
he said exports were up 161 percent to 2022 billion and 
imports climbed 243 percent to 1563 billion 
chinas foreign trade is stable and healthy and 
demonstrated good prospects of a smooth transition from the old 
system to the new liu said 
china is decentralizing controls over its foreign trade and 
trying to develop export industries while confining imports to 
machinery and high technology items that will help in the nations 
modernization drive 
the unchecked importation of production lines and high durable 
consumer goods was basically controlled liu said 
he said that through may chinas trade with the united states 
was 289 billion up 263 percent from the first five months of 
1987 trade with the hong kong region totaled 754 billion up 
355 percent 
trade with japan was 549 billion up 8 percent with the 
european economic community 3775 billion up 35 percent and 
with the soviet union 1 billion up 321 percent liu said 
the ministrys figures differed from those released this month 
by the customs office which showed china with a trade deficit of 
slightly more than 1 billion on total trade of 432 billion 
liu said the two offices have different ways of calculating 
goods imported and then processed for export he said his ministry 
does not include imports of equipment by foreignfunded enterprises 
that will be used to produce goods for export 
liu also said 2109 foreignfunded enterprises were approved in 
the first half of the year an increase of 186 percent over 
januaryjune 1987 he said the value of those contracts was 2 
billion up 130 percent 
projects funded by investors in the united states jumped from 34 
last year to 85 this year japan from 39 to 85 singapore from 20 
to 36 canada from three to 13 and west germany from three to 10 
hong kong continued to lead foreign investors with 79 percent of 
projects and 67 percent of money invested

the new york city operas new production of 
rigoletto made a favorable first impression tuesday night at 
the new york state theater helped by a high caliber of singing 
tenor richard leech of binghamtom ny who played the duke

note of his biggest aria his duke was more like a heedless college 
man than a hardened womanizer it was easy to understand how gilda 
could stay in love with him even after two betrayals 
leech made his new york city opera debut in 1984 and this year 
won the richard tucker foundation award and will make his 
metropolitan opera debut 
faith esham whose voice is clear and whose presentation is much 
more lyric than coloratura was an exceedingly pure but human and 
agreeable gilda

most restaurants in this desert resort serve 
water on request only towering hotelcasinos have reduced the flow 
from thousands of showerheads and a showroom elephant waits longer 
for her bath to be changed 
the drought has come home to reno but its slot machine bells 
still jangle and chips still fly across its felt gambling tables 
in fact the drought that has stunned the nations midsection 
with its severity hasnt surprised hotel owners here 
after two consecutive years in which the area has received half 
its scant 75inch annual precipitation reno is in a stage one 
drought alert calling for voluntary cutbacks in water use stage 
two which mandates some unenforced reductions is expected by 
midaugust 
unlike las vegas where the colorado river provides more than 
enough water to the casinos and their shimmering fountains reno 
depends almost solely on runoff from winter snow in the sierra 
nevada for its summer water 
and the snow is gone 
restaurants hotelcasinos and other businesses here typically 
have been watchful of their water use partly because they pay for 
every drop 
our perperson use is half that of residential consumption 
said glenn mccormick chief engineer at the peppermill hotel casino 
mccormick estimates that watersaving conversions at the 
yearold hotel tower have produced a minimum savings of 3 million 
to 4 million gallons of water annually for little more than the 
cost of the time it took to make them 
while some hotels here and at lake tahoe have installed 
restrictedflow shower heads and watersaving toilets mccormick 
opted to modify the existing fixtures 
you dont have to spend a lot of money he said people go 
out and buy a lot of gadgets they dont need 
he cut back the peppermills water use by putting smaller 
washers in shower heads and reducing pressure in the taps lower 
water levels in hotel toilets cut consumption from 6 gallons per 
flush to 4 he said 
outdoor watering was decreased by replacing thirsty plants with 
decorative rocks or vegetation better suited to the desert 
at john ascuagas nugget in nearby sparks all outside plants 
are watered by drip irrigation installed during the past year 
according to spokesman art long 
the nugget like other local hotels recycles water in air 
conditioning cooling towers and loads dishwashers completely before 
starting them 
conservation even has affected bertha the nuggets trained 
elephant who warms up showroom crowds for entertainers like red 
skelton and shirley maclaine 
we used to clean and drain her pool twice a week now its 
down to once a week and the water thats pumped out is used to 
water the lawn and foilage around berthas elephant palace long 
said 
homeowners however successfully fought efforts to require 
water meters they pay a flat monthly fee regardless of how much 
water they use new homes are required to have water meters but 
there still are nearly 50000 with virtually unlimited water use 
hotelcasinos are not the biggest users i think they take a 
bad rap said bob firth water resources manager for westpac 
utilities 
businesses use only 22 percent of the 90 million gallons or so 
his company pumps out daily firth said by comparison he said 47 
percent of the daily summertime use goes for watering lawns and 
hedges 
the reno areas last prolonged dry spell was in 197677 and 
even though those years were a little wetter than the past two 
we got through kind of by the skin of our teeth firth said 
the difference between now and 197677 is that weve had a 33 
percent growth rate firth said measures may have to be a lot 
more drastic than they were at that time

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
was focusing on state crime and prison issues today before heading 
out on a threeday campaign swing that will take him to seven 
states 
the massachusetts governor was touring a prison construction 
site meeting with his anticrime council and signing legislation 
imposing stiff penalties on producers and sellers of child 
pornography before heading home to pack for the campaign trip that 
begins thursday 
dukakis spent most of tuesday tending to state business as well 
but took time at an afternoon news conference to blast president 
reagan and vice president george bush for supporting attorney 
general edwin meese iii even after two justice department officials 
quit because of the attorney generals conduct 
when that happens i dont think there are any further 
questions dukakis told reporters hes got to go and hes got 
to go immediately instead they continued to defend him and 
with their support he continued to serve as attorney general 
dukakis pointing to bushs inaction in the meese case 
appeared unimpressed with bushs call tuesday for new government 
ethics standards 
youve got to act dukakis said you dont need codes you 
dont have to have a book 
dukakis referred to the resignations earlier this year of deputy 
attorney general arnold burns and former assistant attorney general 
william weld who told congress on tuesday that meeses legal 
problems had crippled the justice department weld said he believed 
meese had committed felonies weld and burns said they told reagan 
and bush of their concerns in april 
i hope i never have a briefing like the one mr burns and mr 
weld gave the vice president three months ago dukakis said 
but if i do i wont sit there and do nothing 
dukakis said the american people are embarrassed and ashamed 
by some of the things that they see in the reagan administration 
dukakis also renewed his criticism of bush for not trying to 
block the armsforhostages deal at the center of the irancontra 
affair 
how can anyone possibly just sit there when someone came up 
with a proposal so crazy dukakis said thats the issue its 
a question of judgment you cant make deals for hostages if 
you do you better forget about breaking the back of international 
terrorism 
he also questioned the viability of bushs new daycare proposal 
and scoffed at talk that he was planning to resign to concentrate 
on his presidential campaign 
bush this week proposed a 22 billion program that would give 
tax credits to working mothers especially those with relatively 
low family incomes dukakis said he supported spending that much 
for day care but said that he wanted local governments and private 
business to pick up some of the tab and that initial funding 
probably would not be that high 
he also criticized the bush program as too complicated saying 
a policy that would require every welfare mother in the country 
to hire an accountant just doesnt make sense 
there were renewed rumors in the massachusetts statehouse this 
week that dukakis was preparing to resign but he said he planned 
to stay on as governor and if elected would resign only after 
being inaugurated as president 
he laughed when told that reagan had said democrats got his 
irish up by criticizing the administration during the 
democratic national convention 
its a political season dukakis said weve got 110 days 
to go and i assume the president will be as political as anyone 
else

new hampshire gov john sununu already has 
carved out a role for himself in the 1988 presidential campaign 
as a strong sometimes vindictive attacker of michael dukakis 
governor of neighboring massachusetts and the democratic 
presidential nominee 
but sununu is under consideration for another supporting role 
that of running mate to republican nomineetobe george bush 
sununu himself said tuesday that he had been asked to fill out the 
questionnaire being circulated by the bush campaign to potential 
vice presidential picks 
sununu speaking to reporters here played down his prospects of 
being chosen asked what the odds were he said i dont gamble 
even if his chances of being chosen to fill out the ticket are 
slim sununu is likely to be a visible player in the coming general 
election campaign 
he has been described by democrats as a hit man with a venonmous 
tongue supporters say he just presents the facts 
chuck dolan executive director of the democratic governors 
association calls sununu a rattlesnake out of the rocks in 
new hampshire 
but gop consultant eddie mahe says if you dont have a strong 
swing with a 2by4 you dont get attention 
sununu chairman of the national governors association and one 
of five cochairmen of the bush campaign is in demand as an 
interviewee according to aide david carney he describes his boss 
as an entertaining speaker with a good sense of humor who gets his 
message across 
when the governor gets done speaking youre going to 
understand what hes saying you many not agree but you will 
understand carney said no one falls asleep listening to john 
sununu 
sununu was credited with helping boost bush to victory in the 
new hampshire primary a crucial race especially after bushs 
thirdplace finish in the iowa caucuses 
the new hampshire governor has had a ringside seat for the six 
years of massachusetts economic transformation but he derides 
dukakis description of a massachusetts miracle instead 
calling it the massachusetts mirage 
sununu maintains that massachusetts appears prosperous when 
viewed from outside the region but that business indicators do not 
compare favorably with the rest of new england especially new 
hampshire 
mike dukakis is an expert at the theater of politics sununu 
says he has a superb veneer thats the whole point once you 
cut through that veneer theres not much there 
he also has attacked dukakis on issues including education 
mental health care and pollution in boston harbor 
sununu 49 who lives in salem on the massachusetts border and 
taught at tufts university outside boston before becoming governor 
plays up the state rivalry that heated up in the 1970s 
the best way to kill something in new hampshire is to say this 
is the way massachusetts does it said sununus aide carney 
the dukakis campaign has not been surprised by the fervor of 
sununus attacks spokesman dayton duncan said dukakis himself has 
seldom responded to the attacks 
normally we ignore it but we point out the facts duncan 
said 
the biggest clash between sununu and dukakis is over the 
seabrook nuclear plant located on the new hampshire seacoast about 
35 miles north of boston 
sununu worked with the nuclear industry before his three terms 
as governor and is a strong proponent of nuclear power and 
seabrook dukakis refusal to cooperate on an evacuation plan for 
massachusetts communities within seabrooks emergency zone has been 
a major obstacle to licensing the plant 
mike dukakis prevented sununu from doing what new hampshire 
didnt want done thats ramming seabrook through which is his 
mission in life as governor said duncan 
some dukakis partisans suggest sununu is a bit envious of 
dukakis and his growing stature in national politics 
and dukakis popularity in new hampshire might rankle an 
offbeat poll of 400 voters in new hampshire during the 1986 
gubernatoral race gave dukakis 47 percent sununu 37 percent in a 
hypothetical race for governor of new hampshire boston news media 
sponsored the survey conducted by a cambridge mass polling firm 
former sununu spokeswoman gretta graham however said sununus 
attacks on dukakis could not in any way be characterized as a 
personal vendetta 
its a competition basically between two strong managers 
she said 
the two remain cordial in public and have found common ground on 
issues such as raising the drinking age to 21 and fighting acid 
rain 
mahe the gop consultant acknowledged that sununus practice of 
firing with both barrels could backfire but said it is not yet 
a concern of the bush campaign 
alixe glen deputy press secretary for the vice presidents 
campaign said the bush camp will continue to pay for sununus 
appearances around the country 
hes been an enormously effective surrogate she said not 
only advocating george bushs candidacy and ideas but also a very 
effective spokesman on the record of governor dukakis

more than 500 people were evacuated 
tuesday night when a forest fire swept through rural subdivisions 
west of the city burning four outbuilding and threatening homes 
the fire reported about 3 pm tuesday had grown to about 600 
acres by 10 pm mdt and was expanding rapidly said corbin newman 
fire information officer for the state division of forestry 
fifteen volunteer fire departments brought 25 engines to the 
scene where 175 firefighters struggled to protect the homes some 
260 more firefighters were expected to arrive during the night 
newman said 
as the fire passes one area the engines are moving ahead and 
trying to get ahead of the fire newman said 
the fire forced the evacuation of four subdivisions and homes 
along a threemile stretch of south dakota highway 4 newman 
described the area as mostly forest with some meadows homes were 
scattered among the timber and the clearings he said 
four helicopters were dropping water and a slurry bomber was 
delivering fire retardant to protect the homes he said four 
bulldozers were working to dig a fire line around other buildings 
he said there was no chance the fire would be contained tuesday 
night although the wind was light 
the problem with a fire this size and this severe is that it 
creates its own weather to some degree it creates its own wind by 
sucking in oxygen newman said 
most of those evacuated found lodging with friends and 
relatives said lyle baker manager of the black hills area chapter 
of the american red cross about 60 families responded to a red 
cross appeal for people to open their homes to those who were 
evacuated he said 
were spending more time now coordinating between family 
members to let people know where theyre staying he said 
some families were separated in the confusion of the evacuation 
he said in some cases people returned to get pets and free horses 
from their pens in advance of the fire and became separated when 
authorities wouldnt let them take the same route back out baker 
said 
newman said the cause of the fire was under investigation

senate approval of a 388 million bill to 
combat hunger in america could spark similar action in the house 
the chairman of the senate agriculture committee says 
when they see the senate can do this with such a heavy heavy 
vote it just could push them to action agriculture chairman 
patrick j leahy dvt said tuesday after the bill won 897 
approval 
he said the bill would make a dent in the problem of hunger 
if it became law and that it would help a lot of people who are 
not going to be helped otherwise 
leahy called for senate approval citing estimates that in 1986 
there were 32 million americans living in poverty 85 percent of 
them women children the handicapped and the elderly 
the bill was opposed by the administration on budget grounds it 
would cost 388 million next year and spending would expand to 667 
million in 1991 by administration calculations 
nonetheless only token opposition materialized sen phil 
gramm rtexas was prepared to offer three amendments designed to 
reduce the costs but the first one failed 8114 and he decided to 
drop the other two 
the bill would reauthorize the temporary emergency food 
assistance program tefap for two years at a level of 50 million 
each year for administrative costs it also would require the 
agriculture department to buy 145 million worth of highprotein 
food each year for distribution to the needy 
gramms amendment would have subtracted from the 145 million 
the value of any surplus crops distributed to the poor government 
economists are expecting a substantial surplus of corn in 
government stocks at years end despite the drought plaguing the 
corn belt 
leahy said he lobbied hard against gramms proposals in the 
democratic caucus describing them as killer amendments that 
would scuttle the bill 
sen richard g lugar of indiana the top republican on the 
agriculture committee was a cosponsor of the legislation and 
pushed hard for it 
provisions of the bill would increase foodstamp benefits and 
substantially broaden eligibility 
it would require the department to buy 40 million in additional 
commodities each year for distribution through soup kitchens food 
pantries and emergency feeding centers these outlets for the most 
part provide meals to the homeless 
seven million pounds of cheese would be allocated to a commodity 
supplemental food program the federal reimbursement rate for 
school breakfasts would be increased by 3 cents and federal 
reimbursement for a number of foodaid programs for children would 
be expanded 
for example an additional meal or snack would be served to 
children who stay in day care centers for more than eight hours 
while parents are working 
the measure would provide a childcare deduction of up to 160 a 
month to enable parents to work or receive education and job 
training

federal judge alcee l hastings says hes in a 
fighting mood despite a house panels recommendation for his 
impeachment and predicts the senate will not remove a real 
warrior from office 
hastings swiftly proclaimed his innocence and his optimism 
tuesday after three separate votes of 321 sent 17 articles of 
impeachment to the full house 
that action by the house judiciary committee sets the stage for 
an unprecedented impeachment proceeding 
house concurrence by a simple majority as early as next week 
would lead to the first senate impeachment trial of a federal judge 
who was acquitted of the same charges in a criminal case 
also never before has congress held an impeachment trial for a 
black official several committee members said before voting that 
racism may have played a part in the initial charges but all 
eventually agreed the evidence nonetheless supported the 
allegations 
according to the impeachment articles similar to an indictment 
hastings and washington dc attorney william borders engaged 
in a corrupt conspiracy to obtain 150000 from two brothers who 
were defendants before hastings in miami hastings in return was 
supposed to impose sentences which would not require prison time 
hastings 51 a us district judge also was accused of lying 
at his trial on specific aspects of the conspiracy of leaking 
wiretap information in an apparently unrelated case and of 
bringing disrepute on the federal judiciary 
im in a fighting mood hastings said in miami after the 
vote theres no way to remove a real warrior i still dont 
think ill be removed from office 
he said the judiciary committee acted in blind ignorance 
because the findings of its investigative subcommittee have not 
been printed if the rest of the house follows the committee lead 
hastings said members will vote in even blinder ignorance 
the house only need vote by simple majority to send the case to 
the senate for trial but senators must vote by a twothirds margin 
to convict 
eleven cases have reached an impeachment trial in the senate 
and five officials have been removed all federal judges former 
us district judge harry e claiborne of las vegas nev was 
ousted in october 1986 in the last impeachment case 
the senate vote in the claiborne case was preceded by trial 
testimony before a special impeachment committee rep larry smith 
dfla suggested that the full senate hear testimony in hastings 
case because of the unprecedented prior acquittal 
while hastings was acquitted of the bribery charges borders was 
convicted in verdicts that lawmakers called inconsistent 
in tuesdays committee votes rep george w crockett jr 
dmich opposed all but one of the impeachment articles while 
larry smith dfla opposed one of the articles 
smith who is white and crockett who is black were among 
those describing their inner turmoil because of fears that racism 
was involved in the case 
smith who has known the outspoken hastings for years said he 
cannot shake the feeling that there was a bit of racism 
involved 
smith said however that racism could not be the sole 
motivation for the allegations because there were too many 
unique circumstances that cant be explained away by coincidence 
crockett a former city judge in detroit said anyone denying 
racism in the case closes his eyes to conditions that still 
exist 
but the lawmaker said the issue is whether hastings is 
competent to sit in judgment of his fellow man and brings credit 
to the judiciary he said any judge who allowed himself to become 
involved in such a case is too dumb to sit in judgment of 
anyone 
rep john conyers chairman of the subcommittee that 
investigated hastings gave an extensive account of the evidence 
and admitted he initially wondered if racism could be the 
source of the charges 
but conyers who said he joined the judiciary committee to 
remedy racism in the judiciary said he looked for a scintilla of 
evidence of racism and couldnt find any 
black public officials must be held to the same standard as 
all other public officials he said

an artists definition of beauty has 
some of his neighbors arming themselves with lawnmowers and pruners 
neighbors call ladislav hankas overgrown front yard an eyesore 
he calls it a natural meadow and wildflower preserve 
to a golf course owner theyre weeds said hanka whose art 
specializes in nature scenes i see it as beautiful and i see it 
as something becoming increasingly beautiful 
but many of the neighbors who have complained to city officials 
since hanka moved in in march 1987 say the halfacre weedinfested 
lot is becoming increasingly ugly 
at a city commission meeting monday night hankas nextdoor 
neighbor scott temple said the yard was totally unkempt and 
hurting property values 
city attorney don schmidt told the commissioners the lawns 
weeds and vegetation constitute a violation of the citys weed 
ordinance and are a potential fire hazard 
hanka however said he has spent hundreds of dollars and 
countless hours planting and weeding nonetheless he was notified 
by the city this month that if he didnt mow his lawn the city 
would perform the task and bill him for it 
the commission has since backed down from that stand and 
directed the city attorney to come up with an amendment to the weed 
ordinance that would permit such wildflower meadows in the city 
the commission will then vote on the amendment 
its all comes back to that beauty is in the eye of the 
beholder said garry mccormick chairman of the citys 
environmental concerns committee

polly may want a cracker but probably not 
the ones oklahoma city has held in storage the past 26 years 
the 350 tons of rancid civil defense survival crackers were 
declared surplus tuesday by the city council and now officials are 
trying to figure out what to do with them 
nobody is interested in buying them but some people have 
offered to haul them off said jj steward director of civil 
defense now called emergency management 
since 1962 the crackers manufactured by the keebler co have 
been in storage at sites throughout the city steward said they 
were intended as a hedge against starvation in case of nuclear 
attack 
some have suggested using the crackers to feed hogs or cattle 
although steward said he isnt pushing an effort to get rid of them 
a stale cracker would still taste better than a grub worm or a 
rat he said

sen lloyd bentsen begins today his first solo 
campaign trip since receiving the democratic vice presidential 
nomination ranging from his texas stronghold to stops in new 
mexico california nevada and deep south 
drawing on his record as chairman of the senate finance 
committee bentsen plans to speak today before a businesswomens 
group in albuquerque three days after vice president george bush 
revealed his plan for a childcare tax cut before the same group 
bentsen in an interview on tuesday said he was skeptical of 
bushs approach i dont know what the cost would be he said 
the senator said he would highlight his accomplishments in the 
senate including prenatal and child care legislation 
from that appearance bentsen planned to fly to san francisco 
for a speech before a labor group and to reno to address state 
legislators after another california stop in ontario he planned 
to go to amarillo texas for a homestate rally in senate opponent 
beau boulters hometown 
boulter a republican congressman is running for bentsens 
senate seat bentsen is running for both the senate and the vice 
presidency as he is allowed to do under texas law 
after the texas stop bentsen will continue on to either 
lousiana or mississippi before returning to washington on saturday 
the 67yearold senator ran unsuccessfully for the democratic 
presidential nomination in 1976 and he says this national campaign 
wont be that different from what hes accustomed to 
itll be just as if i was running for the us senate in 
texas he says you know its a pretty goodsize state 254 
counties 
im sure ill be spending more time in the southwest the 
south and texas but not exclusively so he said citing energy 
states outside of that area as places he also plans to visit 
bentsen has long been an advocate for oil and gas interests in 
congress 
bentsen campaigned last weekend with dukakis introducing him in 
most cases the two men differ on many issues with bentsen usually 
taking a more conservative position for example he favors school 
prayer new pentagon weapons and aid to the nicaraguan contras 
as bentsen headed off to stump alone he was not expected to 
point up those disagreements 
im not going to go through this campaign worrying about 
that he said he and dukakis agree on expanding education and 
health care and on many economic issues 
im delighted with his reaction to my discussions on trade 
ill be hitting that issue often said bentsen who is currently 
nursing a trade bill through the senate 
president reagan vetoed an earlier version which also included 
a provision requiring 60 days notice for plant closings i think 
well get it through before the republican convention he said 
he and dukakis have discussed how bentsens experience on trade 
matters could be put to use if they win in november but the 
senator said he didnt want to find his role as vice president 
restricted that way 
bentsen said he doesnt expect to see much more of michael 
dukakis on the campaign trail since the two can cover much more 
territory traveling separately but he insists they got along well 
during their threeday crosscountry tour after last weeks 
convention in atlanta 
hes an easy fellow to get to know id heard all these 
stories about him being distant but i didnt find that the case at 
all he said

the reagan administration and the plastics 
industry are opposing attempts to outlaw plastic sixpack holders 
in favor of yokes made of biodegradable materials a change that 
environmentalists say would protect wildlife 
administration and industry officials told a house merchant 
marine and fisheries subcommittee tuesday that more research is 
necessary to determine what impact the byproducts of a degradable 
holder would have on marine life but the environmentalists say 
legislation is needed quickly to save seabirds and marine mammals 
that are killed by the discarded plastic rings 
albert m manville ii a biologist for defenders of wildlife and 
chairman of the entanglement network coalition said plastic 
sixpack containers can remain in the environment for hundreds 
perhaps thousands of years killing wildlife that become 
entangled and choke to death or mistake the yokes for food and 
strangle or die from starvation 
the sixpack ring epitomizes the plastic pollution problem a 
highly successful product that is functional and durable and yet 
ugly and deadly when improperly discarded said rep gerry e 
studds dmass chairman of the subcommittee on fisheries and 
wildlife conservation 
but sylvia lowrance director of the environmental protection 
agencys solid waste division warned that the proposed law has 
the potential for replacing one problem with another and she 
noted that even degradable yokes can stay in the environment for 
several months before breaking down 
robert smith deputy assistant director at the fish and wildlife 
service said his agency opposes the legislation because we do 
not have information that indicates sixpack yokes are a major 
threat to fish and wildlife resources 
they probably are not a major threat to wildlife population 
smith said 
environmentalists disagreed with that assertion and urged 
immediate action 
enough is enough said manville when is there sufficient 
information 
the majority of what is seen and reported involves animals on 
shore these reports probably represent only a fraction of what is 
entangling fish and wildlife on the open oceans 
the united states produced 10 million tons of plastic waste in 
1986 about 7 percent of the 158 million ton total according to 
lowrance projections show the plastic trash total rising to 16 
million tons by the turn of the century 
the bill by sen john h chafee rri was passed by the 
senate in may and is pending before studds subcommittee and the 
house energy and commerce subcommittee on transportation and

eightysix percent of the nations sewage 
treatment plants met the july 1 deadline for complying with federal 
standards the environmental protection agency said today 
the agency said 309 plants or 2 percent of the 15486 public 
treatment works in the nation have been referred to the justice 
department or state counterparts for court action to force 
compliance another 95 percent are either under court or agency 
orders to comply according to an agreed schedule 
this means 95 percent of the nations sewage flowing through 
treatment plants is treated to remove 90 percent of the 
contaminants epa said 
the july 1 deadline originally was set in 1972 for 1977 but was 
extended twice the last extension by congress empowered epa to 
grant extensions beyond july 1 1983 only if changed construction 
conditions beyond control of the municipality or reductions in 
federal aid made compliance impossible 
of the 423 plants serving more than 10000 people that did not 
meet the deadline 203 have started construction epa said 
after july 1 no more extensions can be granted unless a 
community can prove it was physically or financially impossible to 
meet the deadline 
several court decisions have held that unavailability of federal 
aid is no excuse for not meeting the standards 
since 1984 the federal goverment has filed 125 lawsuits against 
municipalities to force compliance 
the clean water act requires all public treatment plants to 
achieve socalled secondary treatment that is bacterial 
treatment that removes more than 90 percent of the pollutants 
noncomplying plants often use only primary treatment or 
filtration and temporary retention in tanks for solids to settle to 
the bottom 
six hundred fifty plants also are required to use advanced 
treatment to remove nutrients such as phosphorous or toxic 
pollutants such as heavy metals and of these 525 are in 
compliance 
since 1972 epa has distributed 45 billion in federal aid for 
sewage plant construction with state and local governments putting 
up 15 billion 
grants in recent years have been running more than 2 billion 
for the federal governments share of construction costs now 55 
percent but by the early 1990s the program will have been 
converted to a system of revolving loan funds run by the states

farmers equipment suppliers and bankers 
eagerly await 6 billion in prospective drought relief for a 
depressed farm economy that was just beginning to recover when 
nature pulled out the rug 
without the aid john schroeders financial future could be 
grim the farmer estimates that the drought has cut his corn 
production by at least 40 percent and he isnt certain yet how 
much damage it has done to his soybeans 
some bills are due in the fall and next spring well have 
another whole round of them said schroeder who farms 1300 
acres with his father and brother in northeastern illinois 
champaign county 
in parched central illinois banker bob behrens thinks the aid 
would ease loan repayment problems farm equipment dealer norman 
duitsman hopes it would slow a sales slump and grain elevator 
manager chuck kemper believes it could help his fertilizer business 
many farmers will have significantly less income from grain 
sales because of the drought and that can have a domino effect 
said behrens senior vice president at marine bank of 
champaignurbana if he gets benefits from a federal program he 
will have that much more money to pay for other things 
on tuesday the house agriculture committee approved a drought 
relief bill totaling 6 billion including 145 million pushed by 
dairystate lawmakers for milk producers the bill is expected this 
week on the house floor 
robert spitze a university of illinois farm policy specialist 
said the public realizes agriculture has been through a wringer 
and is just beginning to work its way out 
now an act of god pulls out the rug said spitze i think 
if wed just been through six years of prosperity there would be 
less willingness to help 
behrens said federal drought aid could help farmers pay their 
bank loans on time where drought losses otherwise would have left 
many unable to repay the banks at the usual rate 
duitsman manager of shaff implement co in urbana hopes the 
federal disaster money also might encourage some farmers to replace 
aging equipment 
since this drought our sales have dropped off to nothing 
said duitsman who sells tractors combines and tillage equipment 
farmers were just getting back on the road to financial recovery 
and this hit theyll be set back unless they get some help from 
washington 
kemper manager of grain prairie coop said the aid to farmers 
will not help the grain elevator business in 1988 because volume 
is the name of the game 
but he said any extra money farmers receive could help the 
companys fertilizer sales 
scott reifsteck who farms 1300 acres in champaign county said 
drought had severely damaged his corn his problems worsened this 
week with a thunderstorm that dumped hail on his fields damaging 
the soybeans hail insurance will cover only his cost of 
production he said 
any help we get will be greatly appreciated said reifsteck 
but weve tightened our belt in the past and now it will be a 
notch or two tighter 
but reifsteck said no matter how congress and the us 
department of agriculture decide to distribute drought aid some 
farmers will feel slighted 
and schroeder said he worries that congress might go overboard 
its easy in a campaign year to overspend he said there 
is nothing that would hurt the country more than doing that and 
increasing the national debt

workers in the private sector who should be 
honored for reporting activities that endanger public health or 
safety are instead being intimidated into silence says the sponsor 
of a bill designed to increase protection for whistleblowers 
sen howard metzenbaum chairman of the senate labor and human 
resources labor subcommittee said tuesday that workers who help 
avert disaster by reporting dangerous practices should be honored 
as heroes 
instead in too many cases they are treated like pariahs 
said the ohio democrat their reward is to be fired harassed 
demoted or blacklisted for telling the truth 
several workers who lost their jobs after bringing alleged 
safety problems to light told the subcommittee that more protection 
is needed for whistleblowers 
former poultry worker bette simon charged that practices by 
simmons industries inc during her six years of employment at the 
companys southwest city mo plant constituted a serious public 
health threat 
she said chicken parts were left for months on trailers used to 
haul live chickens to the plant 
i observed live haul trailers arriving at the plant loaded 
with live chickens covered with maggots she said 
ms simon also charged that the birds were rinsed with water at 
such high pressure that chicken manure was forced into the meat 
she said the process was changed to a chlorine solution rinse that 
peeled the skin from the workers hands 
ms simon said that after plant officials saw her talking with 
federal inspectors she was placed in more stressful jobs 
developed severe tendinitis in her hands and arms and was 
discharged for accumulating excessive disciplinary points 
in april 1987 the us department of agricultures food safety 
and inspection service issued an order requiring simmons to comply 
with an intensified federal inspection program at the plant 
service spokeswoman jane adams said the company was taken off the 
intensified program last february 
simmons president lynch butler said the company does not deserve 
the accusations we are very proud of our plant butler said 
we have a lot of internal controls to see that good sanitary 
conditions are maintained 
ronald masters told the subcommittee that in 1982 he worked for 
the daniel international construction co as a quality control 
inspector at the wolf creek nuclear generating station in kansas 
masters contended that in late 1983 and early 1984 he discovered 
that pieces of structural steel may not have been installed or 
might have been below specifications in a building designed for the 
handling of nuclear fuel in february 1984 he said he started to 
write the nuclear regulatory commission about the problem 
my superiors saw what i was doing took the steel erection 
prints from me and went into the back room with the prints he 
told the subcommittee they then falsely marked up the prints to 
make it appear the inspections had been done when in fact they had 
not 
masters said he was laid off in august 1984 after a campaign of 
intimidation and harassment by his superiors 
lyle koerper spokesman for kansas gas amp electric which 
operates wolf creek said the nrc extensively explored any 
allegations of construction problems at the plant prior to issuing 
a license in june 1985 koerper said further comment would be 
inappropriate because masters has filed a lawsuit against the 
utility 
metzenbaums bill would create a uniform definition of protected 
whistleblower activity for privatesector employees and give them 
180 days to file a complaint it would also extend federal 
protection to whistleblowers in the aviation maritime 
pharmaceutical food processing or consumer goods industries 
fred alvarez assistant secretary of labor for employment 
standards said the department has some serious questions about the 
bill including its extremely broad reach but the agency is 
still reviewing the measure

president fidel castro told fellow cubans 
to get ready to welcome troops home from angola because a 
settlement is near in the 13year angolan civil war 
we really are on the threshhold of a political solution he 
said tuesday in a threehour speech marking the 35th anniversary of 
the start of the revolution that overthrew rightwing dictator 
fulgencio batista 
castro also said sovietstyle economic and political reforms are 
not in store for cuba which he said is improving its economic 
performance through greater worker discipline 
the revolutionary leader said cuban troops can now leave angola 
because they have been victorious on the battlefield but will 
remain until the last minute when a peace agreement is signed 
it cant be abrupt he said if the agreement is achieved 
if the agreement is signed we will proceed to the total withdrawal 
of the internationalist force from angola 
the governments of angola cuba and south africa reached an 
agreement this month for the removal of foreign troops from angola 
and independence for bordering southwest africa the south 
africaadministered territory also known as namibia 
cuban troops are helping angolas marxist government battle 
rebels of the union for the total independence of angola which is 
backed by south africa and the united states 
the agreement provides no timetable and another round of talks 
is scheduled for august 
castro said he couldnt discuss details of the agreement but he 
said it provides for the security of angola and the independence of 
namibia 
us state department sources said cuba has sent up to 15000 
more soldiers to angola since last fall to bolster the 40000 cuban 
troops already there 
castro said reinforcements were needed because of events beyond 
cuban control he did not say how many reinforcements were sent 
but that they were all the troops necessary to solve that 
situation 
our objective was not a military victory but a political just 
solution to the conflict he said 
the cuban leaders speech on the anniversary of his failed 
attempt to take the moncada garrison in santiago cubas 
secondlargest city generally is considered his most important of 
the year 
castro in his full beard green uniform and cap gesticulated 
often and frequently touched the array of microphones in front of 
him his voice occasionally went hoarse but he held the audiences 
attention throughout 
officials said more than 200000 people gathered in santiagos 
plaza antonio maceo for the speech 
comparing the soviet union and cuba castro said each must 
have the right to do that which is convenient for it to do it 
would be totally incorrect for us to copy mechanically the 
solutions of other countries 
he said that despite havanas unwillingness to embrace 
sovietstyle reforms there is no tension between havana and 
moscow which supplies cuba with military and other aid 
castro rejected suggestions from the west that socialist 
countries must adopt freemarket policies to move their societies 
forward 
cuba will never adopt methods styles nor philosophies nor 
idiosyncracies of capitalism he said calling such methods 
complete trash 
castro said cubas rectification campaign designed to 
eliminate absenteeism and other labor inefficiencies is starting 
to produce results 
two years ago he said lax work habits threatened to make cuba a 
nation of freeloaders cuba has since abandoned economic incentives 
aimed at boosting production and instead emphasized greater worker 
discipline at a time when other socialist governments are 
introducing freemarket reforms 
castro also said cubas oneparty political system would not 
change he said the country has no room for pocket parties or 
opposition groups 
the communist party is the one responsible for our country 
here there is only one party he said 
castro said a tragedy of the third world is that so many dream 
of easy life in capitalist countries 
its a dream its an illusion he said its necessary to 
work and to work hard 
although the attack on the moncada in 1953 failed the brutality 
with which it was suppressed helped muster support for the 
revolution that eventually led to castros triumphant march into 
havana on jan 1 1959 
castro frequently referred in his speech the upcoming 30th 
anniversary celebration of the revolutionary victory

the reagan administration said it will make 
no deals with iran after tehran offered to use its influence to 
free american hostages in lebanon if the united states releases 
iranian assets frozen in this country 
i am not willing to make anything that sounds like a deal 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday the same day 
the proposal was aired by hashemi rafsanjani speaker of the 
iranian parliament in a television interview 
we have heard this kind of thing before but as far as we are 
concerned you just cant link the two fitzwater said no 
deals 
fitzwater said it is interesting that there should be this 
series of statements but the clearest signal they could send 
is to release the hostages 
in new york vernon walters the us ambassador to the united 
nations said we have said that we will not make deals on this 
particular issue we are very interested in getting them the 
hostages out and if they want to talk we will be prepared to 
talk but that is a speculative question 
sen patrick j leahy dvt told reporters tuesday i dont 
think we can ignore anything that comes our way but i think we 
should reject anything that smacks of ransom or blackmail and this 
sounds like both 
state department officials said iranian officials had made 
proposals similar to rafsanjanis previously and the reagan 
administration had rejected them 
the officials said they assume rafsanjani was referring to 
military equipment which had been purchased by the iranian 
government during the reign of the shah of iran but had not been 
delivered 
president carter withheld all such deliveries after the hostage 
crisis began carter also refused to return to iran military 
equipment which iranian authorities had sent back to the united 
states for repair 
the officials said they had no dollar figure on the military 
equipment on which iran has a claim

it may not be chicago 68 but since 
the hampton volunteer fire department ladies auxiliary was 
disbanded by six whippersnappers generation gap tensions have 
been flaring up at bingo 
were not going to leave were going to fight for whats 
ours auxiliary president sherry adams said tuesday a day after 
leading an eightwoman picket line outside the firehouse as 50 
people played bingo inside if my husband ever did this to me 
hed be dead meat she said 
six members of the suburban pittsburgh fire department voted 
july 6 to disband the ladies auxiliary on grounds that the women 
were difficult to get along with did not provide coffee and soda 
to firefighters at fires and did not include firefighters wives or 
girlfriends in their membership 
ive been down here every monday night ive been in the 
kitchen ive baked why after 40 years do we have to be thrown 
out like that asked mrs zimmerman 75 
it makes me sick to think that all these years theres only 
six whippersnappers id call them that can vote us out said 
genevieve johnson 74 an auxiliary member for 22 years 
the allwoman auxiliary had 13 members many elderly 10 of 
them widows and none the wives of active firefighters mrs adams 
at 38 said she is the youngest member 
what woman at 70 years old wants to go out in the middle of 
the winter and the middle of the night to give men coffee and 
soda mrs adams asserted but they did it they did serve the 
men coffee and food but not in the last three four or five 
years 
were going to have a fire auxiliary not a ladies 
auxiliary so anybody can join if anybody wants to come down 
well give them an application said department president james 
cannon who said he did not vote on the matter 
during the last eight years alone the women said they raised 
25000 for the department through bingo games and craft bazaars 
cannon said the money helped pay for a storage room a plot of 
land to be used as a parking lot tables and chairs a water 
fountain and other items 
we dont even have a room of our own mrs adams said 
they let us use the kitchen if were lucky they figure thats 
where we should be were not even allowed through the front door 
on monday night the women carried signs reading six members 
unfair to women and old ladies raised 25000 19801988 
weve been very nice mrs adams said we didnt want to 
stop anyone from going in 
mrs adams said the auxiliary has sought help for a possible 
lawsuit against the firefighters from the national organization for 
women a legal services organization for the elderly and a local 
lawyer but she said the women probably will not sue if it will 
cost them money 
the group wants an apology because she said cannon called them 
older ladies 
we do not want to go back she said but we do want to 
know when this new organization is formed that these women and 
members do have rights and are not to be governed by the men

cuba whose colorful casinos and risque 
nightclubs drew an annual 250000 tourists to the country before 
the 1959 revolution has launched a crash program designed to 
triple tourism income by 1991 
our country really needs foreign exchange rafael sed perez 
director of the national tourism institute told a news conference 
tuesday there is reality the economic situation that our 
country faces is very difficult 
he said cuba hopes to increase the annual number of tourists 
from 220000 193000 of them from noncommunist countries to 
600000 by 1991 
sed perez said tourism could bring in more than 500 million a 
year second only to sugar as a source of foreign exchange from 
its current level of fourth place and 117 million 
before the revolution brought fidel castro to power most of 
cubas annual 250000 tourists were americans castros communist 
government later took pride in announcing the elimination of such 
social vices as prostitution 
sed perez said cuba is not worried that increased tourism could 
encourage a return of vice or bring in bad influences from foreign 
capitalist nations 
there is no worry he said we dont see tourism 
development as something negative he said there are no 
restrictions on movement of foreign visitors in the island 
sed perez said 39000 people now work in the tourist industry 
and training programs will be established to meet the demand for 
new personnel 
the program calls for 12000 hotel rooms available for foreign 
tourists by 1991 up from 7500 now 
the most ambitious expansion plans are in varadero beach on 
cubas northern coast where 8000 rooms will be added to 2800 now 
available sed perez said havana now has 50 percent fewer rooms 
than before the revolution 
he said one phase of the plan calls for reopening 16 hotels 
shuttered or used for other purposses since the revolution many of 
them in old havana to recover 1600 rooms 
a second phase is to refurbish such existing hotels as the 
habana libre once the havana hilton where the elevators are 
notoriously slow and the air conditioning extremely weak 
a third phase will be building new hotels including a second 
tower at the triton the only hotel built in havana since the 
revolution sed perez said 
he said three or four hotels might be built in a joint 
enterprise with a spanish company but he provided no details 
santiago will be among the areas to be included in the tourism 
expansion 
castro visited the brandnew hotel bucanero outside the city 
during activities leading up to tuesdays celebration of the 35th 
anniversary of the start of the revolution 
castro pronounced it magnificent and said it was an example 
of what could be done in the industry but some staffers most 
notably in the restaurant are clearly new and ill at ease in 
handling large tables 
castro said tuesday in his anniversary speech that tourism could 
help make up for low market prices for its leading export products 
notably sugar and petroleum from the soviet union that is resold by 
cuba 
he said the marvels of nature on the island and cubas sunshine 
can be sold 
castro also criticized what he called petite bourgeoisie in 
cuba who complain because the new hotel rooms are destined first 
for foreign visitors bringing badlyneeded foreign exchange 
he noted that cubas lobster catch is exported for revenues used 
to purchase imports of powdered milk 
there are no children starving to death in this country he 
said

king fahd says his country will not 
put ideology in the way of defense needs and will buy weapons from 
any supplier of topnotch arms who is willing to do business 
if matters become snarled with a certain country we find 
other countries whether they are eastern or western and we buy 
arms and we do not buy ideology fahd said in a statement 
distributed tuesday 
we shall not hesitate to acquire the arms we need from any 
country in the world on condition that they be among the best 
available he said 
the kingdom a longtime us customer has been prevented from 
buying some american sophisticated weapons because of the 
proisraeli lobby in washington which has claimed the sales would 
threaten israels security 
sales agreements this year reportedly could make britain the no 
1 arms supplier for saudi arabia replacing the united states 
fahds statement was the most direct indication saudi arabia 
will consider buying arms from the soviet bloc and china despite 
the absence of diplomatic ties between the islamic kingdom and what 
it considers atheistic countries 
saudi arabia in the first step of its kind with a communist 
nation has acquired mediumrange missiles from china in a deal 
negotiated over two years according to reports earlier this year 
by us intelligence agencies 
fahd made the declaration in an address monday night to army 
officers in the holy city of mecca for the annual pilgrimage known 
as the hajj and the fourday moslem feast of eid aladha

here are some comments from the presidential 
campaign trail 
 
george bush calling for congress to be placed under the same 
ethics laws as federal officials to exempt congress from any of 
these rules as does current conflictofinterest law is to 
establish a double standard that breeds suspicion breeds cynicism 
and in my judgment breeds abuse no one no institution no body 
of government should be above the law 
 
michael dukakis unimpressed with bushs pledge of a written 
ethics code in a bush white house youve got to act you dont 
need codes you dont have to have a book 
 
rep lynn martin on word that women are being considered for 
george bushs running mate one of the nicest surprises for me is 
hearing many conservative members of my party talking about a 
woman on the ticket as a good idea

operators of a preschool program say they 
were stunned to learn the woman they hired as an aide five years 
ago was wanted for allegedly hijacking a jetliner to havana in 1969 
if we had any indication that this woman was a hostagetaker 
we wouldnt be sitting here today robert burns head of the 
board of directors of the albany head start program said tuesday 
theres nothing in her fiveyear history that would indicate any 
abuse or violence toward children 
but authorities said the quiet mother her neighbors knew as 
haziine eytina was 39yearold linda joyce grinage who was 
arrested monday on a 19yearold indictment for air piracy 
rifletoting fbi agents surrounded the home of grinage and her 
husband lawyer mylo eytina then took her into custody on charges 
of hijacking a miamibound eastern airlines flight with 146 people 
aboard in 1969 and directing its pilot at gunpoint to fly to cuba 
grinage and her thenhusband tyrone ellington austin allegedly 
took a 2yearold boy hostage on the flight from new yorks kennedy 
international airport authorities said the woman who had her own 
an infant strapped to her back ran screaming up the aisle of the 
plane followed by austin who was shouting black power havana 
to terrified passengers and crew members according to news 
accounts of the hijacking 
the passengers and hostage returned to miami unharmed and 
grinage apparently spent some time in cuba with her husband 
officials said authorities said they do not know how grinage 
returned to the united states from havana but they lost track of 
her during the 1970s 
austin died in 1971 from gunshot wounds suffered in a bank 
robbery attempt in new york city 
patrons of the calumet restaurant next door to the eytinas 
apartment in a workingclass section of albany said they had little 
contact with the family in the three months theyd lived in the 
neighborhood 
robert roby who lives in an apartment house next to the 
eytinas said they just seemed like ordinary people but he 
only knew them well enough to say hello on the street 
i was very surprised roby said not only that they were 
living next door but that the fbi kept the case open for so many 
years its kind of like the mounties they always get their 
man 
an anonymous caller tipped authorities a year ago that grinage 
was living in albany said barbara cottrell an assistant us 
attorney 
authorities said grinaged used 14 aliases fbi investigators 
spent the last year painstakingly putting together pieces of 
information about the case including old photographs and 
handwriting samples 
we were just as shocked as everybody when the fbi was outside 
with guns pointed at everybody said betty bellino director of 
the masterson day care center a few doors from the eytinas 
apartment 
a glumlooking grinage wouldnt talk to reporters as she was led 
away in handcuffs from brief court appearances monday and tuesday 
but her husband labeled the charges absolute poppycock 
he said he and his wife had lived and worked in albany for 10 
years although police had only traced her albany residence to 1983 
i think people should speak highly of me and my wife because 
weve worked diligently to be spoken highly of eytina said 
tuesday after a federal court hearing to establish his wifes 
identity was put off for one day 
the couple had six children but one was killed last year in an 
auto accident said wayne alford a spokesman for the fbis albany 
office he said he didnt know how long they had been married

associates of attorney richard j phelan say hes 
not a democratic activist despite republican criticism of his 
appointment to investigate the ethical conduct of his fellow 
democrat house speaker jim wright 
on tuesday the 51yearold phelan was named to investigate 
wright by the 12member house ethics committee which is evenly 
divided between democrats and republicans 
committee chairman julian c dixon dcalif said members of 
both parties were satisified phelan could do an impartial job 
but some republicans were upset with the choice noting that 
phelan had raised money for democratic us sen paul simons 
failed presidential bid and was elected as a simon delegate from 
illinois to the democratic national convention 
the appointment of liberal democrat activist richard phelan as 
outside counsel in the wright case certainly calls into question 
the independence of the ethics committee inquiry said a 
statement from a group called citizens for reagan 
some of phelans associates however took issue with the gop 
criticism 
although he was elected as a delegate to the democratic 
convention last week phelan decided not to go 
phelan resigned his position as a delegate before the 
convention said simon spokeswoman terry stephan ms stephan did 
not indicate why phelan had resigned 
amy zisook of chicago simons national finance director said 
she would not characterize phelan as an activist 
i assume hes been active locally but ive been involved in 
democratic politics at the statewide level for six years and this 
year was the first time i ever met mr phelan ms zisook said 
a law partner of phelans firm phelan pope amp john ltd said 
phelan may have contributed money to candidates in the past but 
had never run for office himself 
he may have political interests but his main interests seem 
to be his firm and his family said the partner speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
last year phelan successfully defended jewel companies inc in 
a lawsuit in which attorneys sought 100 million in punitive 
damages for hundreds of people sickened in the nations largest 
outbreak of salmonella 
the 1985 outbreak had been traced to milk from a jewel dairy in 
suburban chicago the copany ended up compensating those who fell 
ill for their actual losses but not paying extra punitive damages 
the contract with phelans firm will be for no more than 
300000 dixon said adding that he could not estimate how long 
the investigation would take 
charges against wright include using his office to lobby federal 
officials and others on matters in which he had a financial 
interest and improprieties in the publication of a book by a 
campaign contractor for which wright received unusually high 
royalties 
as i see our job its to conduct an independent full review 
of all the facts that have been presented in the inquiry and report 
back to the committee phelan told reporters outside the closed 
committee room 
the fact that im a democrat doesnt stand in my way of being 
fair and full 
a chicago native phelan graduated in 1958 from the university 
of notre dame and received his law degree from georgetown 
university in 1961 he served as president of the chicago bar 
association from 198586 
the attorney and his wife carol an architect have three 
children they live in a northern chicago suburb

resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk today proposed setting up a cambodian government and army 
that represent equally the four warring parties in the 9yearold 
civil war 
the proposal by sihanouk upstaged peace negotiations in bogor 
between the vietnameseinstalled government and the threeparty 
guerrilla coalition that has been trying to topple it 
he told representatives of all four factions who traveled to 
jakarta to hear him that the proposed fourparty government in 
phnom penh the cambodian capital would be a collegial system 
perfectly equal 
he suggested that we keep intact our four armies but they 
fraternally form the national army of cambodia with a quadripartite 
general staff 
sihanouk also wants an international conference under the 
auspices of un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar convened 
as soon as possible to guarantee the neutrality of cambodia 
supervise the withdrawal of foreign troops and organize free 
elections 
vietnamese troops invaded cambodia in 1978 and overthrew the 
khmer rouge regime which killed at least a million cambodians in 
its attempt to impose agrarian communism after gaining power in 
1975 
the four warring cambodian factions and representatives from 
vietnam laos and the six members of the association of southeast 
asian nations have been holding informal talks in bogor since 
monday 
sihanouk 65 quit as leader of the antivietnamese coalition 
this month and left leadership of his faction to his son prince 
norodom ranariddh but he agreed to visit jakarta as a guest of 
president suharto 
leaders of the four factions made a pilgrimage to jakarta today 
to hear sihanouk who ruled cambodia from 1941 to 1970 
he presented his proposals in english in a speech to premier hun 
sen premier of the vietnaminstalled government in phnom penh 
khieu samphan leader of the khmer rouge son sann of the 
anticommunist khmer peoples national liberation front and 
ranariddh 
there was no immediate comment from the other factions and 
sihanouk said the proposal had no better than a 5050 chance of 
being accepted the plan was broad and lacked specific details 
representatives of the four factions met privately with him 
before returning to bogor 
sihanouk said the threemember coalition manages to stick 
together because they hate vietnam slightly more than each other 
it is certainly handy to make vietnam assume alone the 
responsibility for our miseries and humiliations he said but 
it is not less true that some khmer factions are equally heavily 
responsible for these miseries and humiliations 
sihanouk has rejected the latest peace plan from the 
vietnambacked government 
many cambodians remain deeply suspicious of vietnams motives 
despite hanois promise to withdraw all occupation troops by the 
first quarter of 1990 many also fear a return to power by pol pot 
of the khmer rouge the strongest member of the coalition 
indonesian foreign minister ali alatas said a consensus was 
developing at bogor that the troop withdrawal should be linked with 
steps to ensure that the khmer rouge do not regain power

the disappearance of a married woman has 
led police on a search through the subculture of voodoo practiced 
by her lover who may have killed her then tried to ward off her 
spirit with bizarre talismans authorities said 
the body of caroline m rubia has never been found but an 
occultist contacted by police theorizes the 52yearold woman was 
buried in a grave beneath a crude cross the victim of her jealous 
lovers suicidal obsession with the primitive religion 
rubia a telephone company administrator who disappeared june 2 
was likely killed by her lover of 20 years a 47yearold roofing 
contractor who changed his name in 1979 from charles william turner 
to che francois toussaint police said tuesday 
toussaint was found dead in his bed of cyanide poisoning june 7 
when investigators broke into his barricaded home in a san jose 
suburb expecting to find rubias body 
investigators found a crude altar in his closet along with items 
including three snapshots of rubia covered with salt and three 
onequart jars turned upside down with a strip of tape labeled 
me on one a second labeled carol rubia with stop it 
written underneath and a third reading carol and i 
these other items and desperate letters mailed by toussaint 
before his suicide blaming rubia and her witchcraft for his bad 
health and business failures sent investigators to a voodoo expert 
in berkeley whom investigators did not identify 
the expert a selfdescribed good witch said the items are 
those used in voodoo an africanborn religion based on a belief in 
sorcery toussaint probably buried rubia in a way that would 
prevent her spirit from escaping the grave which would likely be 
covered with salt and pins the expert told police 
salt and pins were to keep her spirit confined even in death 
and thats why the expert was sure she was tied too said 
detective sharon young of the san jose police departments missing 
persons unit 
the jars molasses and spices in the closet were supposed to 
seal in bad spirits and prevent them from attacking toussaint the 
expert told police 
he wanted a barrier between him and her in both worlds 
young said 
other clues indicated rubia had been killed police said her 
bloody prescription glasses were found in toussaints pickup truck 
after he committed suicide he had told friends that he would kill 
rubia if she tried to end their affair and in her diary she 
described how he had beat her once nearly to death 
rubia attended a catholic retreat shortly before her 
disappearance at which she decided to leave her lover and devote 
herself to her husband and family young said 
the evidence indicated toussaint and rubia had a stormy 
relationship during which toussaint had other lovers 
they were very much in love said young you should see 
their love letters they both were very jealous of each other they 
fought all the time because he wanted to be the boss but she was a 
strong and feisty woman

ship and killed nine people used two automatic weapons that had 
been sold to libya police said 
one gun was found aboard the liner city of poros after the july 
11 attack and the other was found in the wreckage of a car that 
blew up a few hours before the attack killing its two occupants 
said a police source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the source said tuesday that the guns were italianmade berettas 
that had been sold to libya which has been linked to international 
terrorism 
government officials also speaking privately said the weapons 
were berettas but that they were initially sold to belgium 
police have linked the car explosion to the cruise ship massacre 
and speculate that the vehicle contained explosives and weapons to 
be used in a hijack attempt 
they theorize that the attack was a bungled attempt to force the 
release of palestinian mohammed rashid sentenced july 13 to seven 
months for entering greece on a forged passport greece is 
considering a us request for his extradition on charges of 
planting a bomb aboard a pan am jetliner in 1982

immediately postponed a new hearing was set for aug 2 after 
rashid 39 said he wasnt briefed on details of his case a 
judicial spokesman said 
rashid says his real name is mohammed hamdan and told reporters 
at the court that the greek police arrested the wrong man 
the hearing before an appeal court prosecutor was a routine 
procedure in cases where mistaken identity is claimed said the 
judicial spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the palestinian was arrested may 29 at athens airport by police 
acting on a tip from the american embassy he was carrying a forged 
syrian passport in the name of mohammed hamdan 
but a fingerprint check showed him to be rashid who was jailed 
in greece from 197376 on narcotics smuggling charges police said 
rashid also is accused of bombing a twa jetliner over greece in 
april 1986 four people including a baby girl died when the 
explosion blasted them out of the plane

irans powerful parliament speaker 
offered to try to have american hostages held in lebanon freed in 
exchange for iranian assets frozen in the united states but the 
white house said no deals 
if president reagan were sincere he would release the 
iranian assets irans official islamic republic news agency 
today quoted speaker hashemi rafsanjani as saying 
i have said that once he does so then we will use our leverage 
in lebanon and help solve the issue of hostages he was quoted as 
saying 
irna monitored in nicosia said rafsanjani who also is 
commanderinchief of irans armed forces spoke in a battlefront 
interview tuesday 
nine americans are believed held in beirut by proiranian shiite 
moslem extremists 
so long as america keeps its hostile attitude toward iran 
there will be no sign of any changes and there will be no 
negotiations rafsanjani said tuesday in a television interview 
monitored in nicosia 
he said that one indication of good will would be releasing 
iranian assets in the united states 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told 
reporters no deals the clearest signal they could send is to 
release the hostages 
we have heard this kind of thing before but as far as we are 
concerned you just cant link the two fitzwater said 
rafsanjani considered the second most powerful figure in the 
iranian government after the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini did not 
refer to any specific iranian assets in the united states 
but he said the iranian government paid the united states for 
goods not delivered before the islamic revolution toppled the 
government of the late shah reza pahlavi in 1979 
state department officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said rafsanjani probably was referring to military equipment but 
they had no dollar figure 
the united states broke relations with tehran and put a hold on 
its us assets after iranians stormed the us embassy and took 52 
americans hostage they were released in january 1981 after 444 
days in captivity 
as part of the release agreement the usiran claims tribunal 
was set up in the hague netherlands and charged with arbitrating 
billions of dollars of us and iranian financial claims arising 
from the iranian revolution 
by 1987 the tribunal had awarded about 1 billion to american 
claimants and about 60 million to iranians plus an undetermined 
amount of interest to claimants on both sides 
in may three french hostages held in lebanon by proiranian 
shiite moslems were released after the french government reportedly

lebanon

prompt the freeing of the hostages it is not the first time i have

east and us is encouraging 
there seems to be a reaching out for communication if terrys 
captivity and the captivity of the other americans is to mean 
anything it would hopefully be a movement toward peace in the 
middle east

a salvage team today raised the wreckage of the 
fishing boat that collided with a navy submarine and found the 
bodies of all but one of the missing passengers and crew coast 
guard officials said 
discovery of the 20 bodies in the ships lounge and cabins 
raised to 29 the confirmed death toll from saturdays collision 
the officials said fortyeight people most members of a company 
fishing club had been on the chartered boat 
workers used a 230foot crane to raise the hull to the surface 
in predawn darkness today near the mouth of tokyo bay a hole was 
visible in its bow just below the waterline 
coast guard ships brought victims relatives to within a few 
yards of where the boat the no 1 fujimaru was raised from a 
depth of about 160 feet 
survivors relatives of victims and newspapers charged that crew 
members aboard the submarine stood by watching on the submarines 
deck while victims drowned the submarine sustained little damage 
and no injuries were reported among the 75 men on board 
one survivor from the fishing boat told reporters the subs 
crewmen stared back as she waved and yelled why wont you help 
of the 19 people rescued from the 154ton fishing boat which 
sank in less than two minutes 16 were picked up by other passing 
vessels and only three by the submarine one man died later in a 
hospital 
news reports said defense agency chief tsutomu kawara offered 
his resignation over the accident but will stay on until an 
investigation is complete defense officials said they could not 
comment on the reports 
the status of japans military officially called the 
selfdefense forces is still a sensitive issue after the military 
excesses of world war ii 
the nations constitution officially bars the maintenance of all 
war potential and sharp public criticism usually follows any 
accident for which the selfdefense forces is responsible 
news reports suggested the captain of the submarine the 
2200ton nadashio may have erred just before the collision 
the accident occurred as the submarine traveling on the 
surface was cutting across a busy shipping lane to enter yokosuka 
naval base shared by the japanese and us navies 
japanese maritime rules say the vessel approaching from the left 
must take evasive action when on a collision course with another 
ship while the second ship must maintain its direction but kyodo 
news service and nhk television reports quoted the fishing boats 
surviving crew as saying the nadashio on the left honked at the 
fishing boat to warn it out of its path 
just before the crash both ships turned in the same direction 
and collided almost headon 
as captain of the ship i did my best until the last minute to 
avoid a collision according to maritime collision prevention 
laws manji kondo the 30yearold captain of the fishing boat 
told a televised news conference late tuesday 
admiral shuichiro higashiyama navy chief of staff told 
reporters today he believes the submarines crew took proper 
measures to avoid the accident 
but he said appropriate actions would be taken against any 
officials found responsible for the accident in the final judgment 
by the marine accidents inquiry agency 
it was the worst collision between japanese navy and civilian 
vessels since world war ii defense officials said

south korean legislators today 
accepted a north korean plan for talks on a nonaggression pact and 
on clearing the way for the north to take part in the 1988 
olympics officials said 
south korean national assembly officials said representatives of 
the top four political parties and assembly speaker kim chaesun 
agreed to accept the north korean offer and planned initial 
contacts in the second week of august 
the south is ready to take up the olympic issue and does not 
want to limit the agenda one aide said on condition of anonymity 
party leaders must approve the plan but officials said this 
would be automatic and that a positive response would be sent to 
north korea on monday 
south korean officials said they want preliminary talks at the 
border truce site of panmunjom to work out terms for the talks 
north korea last week asked south korea for talks between their 
legislatures on drawing up a pact to end the long rivalry between 
the two nations north korea called for the first round to be held 
in its capital pyongyang 
the north said in a second letter tuesday that it also was ready 
to discuss entering the olympics in seoul in september on condition 
that its demand to cohost the olympics be discussed 
the international olympic committee and south korea have refused 
to let the north cohost the olympics because the games are awarded 
to a single city the north has said it will boycott the games if 
it cannot cohost 
south korean olympic officials also speaking privately said 
the refusal to allow a cohost had not changed they said the north 
appeared to be setting cohosting as a condition so that any new 
talks probably would be inconclusive 
three previous rounds of talks between the south and north on 
easing tension and establishing relations ended in failure the 
north broke off the most recent talks in 1986 
a north korean decision to take part in the olympics without 
cohosting would be a drastic turnabout the north sees the souths 
hosting of the olympics as a major political defeat in the struggle 
between the two nations for supremacy 
the two governments refuse to recognize each other and claim to 
be the sole legitimate government on the korean peninsula the 
peninsula was divided in 1945 by us and soviet forces at the end 
of world war ii and remained divided after the 195053 korean war 
south korea and other nations fear the north may resort to 
terrorism to disrupt the olympics if it cannot cohost the games 
the north which has attacked the south repeatedly was blamed 
for the nov 29 bombing of a south korean airliner near burma with 
all 115 people aboard killed north korea denied any involvement in 
the attack 
north korean hopes for a boycott of the olympics by communist 
nations collapsed when the soviet union and china agreed to send 
teams to seoul a record 161 nations are taking part in the games 
only cuba and ethiopia have backed north koreas demand to 
cohost the olympics

iran said it launched an attack on iraqi 
forces in southern iran today and commanderinchief hashemi 
rafsanjani predicted victory 
the able combatants of islam in order to chase and destroy 
the aggressive iraqi forces on a greater scale early this morning 
attacked the core of the enemy forces in the operational axis north 
of khorramshahr said an announcer who broke into regular 
programs on tehran radio 
at the united nations foreign minister ali akbar velayati 
accused iraq of trying to sabotage peace efforts with attacks he 
said involved the large scale use of chemical weapons 
velayati met twice tuesday with un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar the iranian and his iraqi counterpart tariq 
aziz were to meet separately today with the un chief 
on tuesday rafsanjani offered to try to have american hostages 
held in lebanon freed in exchange for iranian assets frozen in the 
united states but the white house said no deals 
eighteen men including nine americans are believed held in 
beirut by proiranian shiite moslem extremists 
iraqibacked iranian guerrillas opposed to ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini said tuesday they pushed deep into iran and tehran 
acknowledged its forces were fighting counterrevolutionary 
mercenaries 
iraq this week announced its forces were withdrawing from the 
area just north of khorramshahr an iranian port city but iran 
continued to claim the iraqis were invading the area 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
said today that at least 300 iraqis were killed or wounded in the 
latest fighting in the area and dozens of tanks or armored 
personnel carriers were destroyed 
a complete brigade of the iraqi army has been encircled by the 
forces of islam said tehran radio monitored in nicosia 
in the course of the victorious battle this morning 
numerous units of the enemy in this region were caught by surprise 
and they are in a state of evident confusion in a strip of land 
close to the border the radio said 
rafsanjani said irans decision last week to accept a un 
ceasefire call was a major political and cultural victory which 
fortunately will be followed by a military victory 
we are witnessing the complete defeat of the iraqi forces on 
the southern front as well as the western fronts he said 
rafsanjanis comments were made tuesday in a battlefront 
headquarters interview and portions were carried on iranian 
television and radio tuesday night irna provided additional 
quotations from the interview today 
thus far we were defending ourselves while branded as the 
warmonger party and the one which does not want peace he said 
iraq accepted the un ceasefire resolution shortly after it was 
passed but iran waited a year 
irna quoted rafsanjani who is also speaker of parliament and 
one of the most powerful men in iran as saying recent incursions 
into iran proved that iraq did not want peace 
the iraqi regime by nature is aggressive and will launch 
aggression any time it finds an appropriate place and feels 
powerful he said 
rafsanjani renewed his earlier calls for ablebodied iranians to 
rush to the war front to confront the iraqi invasion 
irna said iraqi warplanes bombed residental areas in the western 
city of ilam but it said no reports were available on casualties 
or damage 
the official iraqi news agency meanwhile reported that iraqi 
air defenses shot down an iranian f5 warplane over the southern 
front iran did not comment on the claim 
iraqibacked iranian rebels of the national liberation army said 
tuesday they marched deep into western iran taking the towns of 
karand and eslamabad 
tehran radio acknowledged that iraq made use of 
counterrevolutionary mercenaries to infiltrate the population and 
to martyr the heroic men and women there 
the rebels said they were advancing on the provincial capital of 
bakhtaran they said they overran karand 43 miles inside iran and 
eslamabad 18 miles farther destroyed the 27th revolutionary 
guards corps division and captured its garrison 95 miles east of 
iraqs border 
but iran said it recaptured eslamabad and killed 1100 rebels 
the national liberation army is the military wing of the 
mujahedeen khalq organization an antikhomeini force that moved to 
iraq after its leaders were expelled from france in 1986 its troop 
strength is believed to range up to 15000 men and women

wildfires or not roehr 
guenter said he couldnt change his plans to see yellowstone 
national park 
the west german and his family were among the thousands of 
tourists who continued flocking to the worldfamous park this week 
despite fires burning thousands of acres of forest and meadow 
even as smoke from the 6000acre north fork fire billowed 
behind the guenters while they waited for old faithful to erupt 
they expressed enthusiasm about the 22 millionacre park and the 
elk and bison they have seen 
the fires appeared to have little effect on the number of people 
entering the park last weekend 41346 cars entered the park 
comparable to 42327 cars the previous weekend 
like many tourists the guenters changed their plans slightly 
when they found the south entrance to the park closed sunday 
because of fires burning in the grant village area 
they drove their rental car back to jackson wyo then into 
idaho and through the parks west entrance at west yellowstone 
mont 
the closing of the south entrance has been a boon to the tourism 
business in eastern idaho and western montana 
ron gray resort manager at macks inn at island park idaho 
has been turning people away at the door its unfortunate that 
the fire is burning but weve been full up 
weve been renting rooms we usually would not rent but people 
say well take anything gray said 
all accommodations in the park campsites and hotel rooms are 
full and space is scarce in west yellowstone said steve iobst a 
park spokesman the fires have closed campgrounds in the grant 
village and lewis lake areas 
motels and campgrounds in west yellowstone have been having a 
record year and the closure of grant village in the park when fire 
threatened it filled any vacancies there might have been 
weve been solid booked for a week said becky gillory of 
the west yellowstone chamber of commerce 
bob mcpherson of seattle said the fires seemed to add a little 
confusion to the traffic but found the blazes kind of 
dramatic really he said he would not change his plans to spend 
the last three days of his 30day vacation in yellowstone

foreign minister shimon peres accused his 
rightwing adversaries of fanning the flames of the sevenmonth 
palestinian uprising by sabotaging a us middle east peace 
initiative 
shouting broke out tuesday in a closeddoor meeting of the 
defense and foreign affairs committee over differences on the peace 
proposals of us secretary of state george p shultz 
if it werent for the sabotage of the peace process of the 
shultz initiative by half the government then maybe we wouldnt 
be in the middle of the intefadeh peres said using the arabic 
word for uprising 
but likud bloc legislator dan meridor a close associate of 
prime minister yitzhak shamir signaled flexibility about 
negotiations on the future of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the daily jerusalem post today quoted him as saying in a speech 
that even those who supported peres proposals for territorial 
compromise should vote for likud in the november election because 
it would drive a harder bargain 
we must send to the negotiations those who will get the best 
results said meridor 
who do those who are concerned for israels security prefer to 
send to negotiations those who want to get rid of the territories 
or those who will insist on every square inch and get the best 
compromise 
meridor also was quoted as suggesting it may have been a mistake 
to hold on to the gaza strip which was captured from egypt in 1967 
seven opposition parties filed motions of no confidence today in 
shamirs coalition government some citing shamirs failure to put 
down the palestinian rebellion the motions were defeated 
the twohour foreign policy meeting degenerated into a shouting 
match between peres and likud legislator eliahu benelissar a 
former ambassador to egypt 
according to other lawmakers benelissar called peres a 
bolshevik referring to the labor partys socialistleaning 
ideology 
peres retaliated by shouting at benelissar youre always 
slandering you act like a fascist 
visiting conservative rabbis stepped into the fray by urging 
israelis not to vote for religious parties which have held the 
balance of power between the two major blocs in recent years 
the time has come for israel to adopt the separation of 
synagogue and state as practiced in america said rabbi kassel 
abelson of minneapolis president of the 1200member rabbinical 
assembly 
more then 230 palestinians have been killed since the 
antioccupation uprising began dec 8 four israelis also have been 
killed 
labor supports a retreat from the occupied territories in return 
for peace while likud opposes any concessions to the arabs 
the two parties have shared governmental powers after a 1984 
coalition agreement was forged to break an election stalemate 
pollsters predict a tight race between labor and likud with the 
latter holding a slight edge largely due to support for israeli 
hawkishness in response to the palestinian uprising

oxford university scientists today tested 
a fragment from the shroud of turin to determine if it dates from 
the period of the crucifixion of jesus christ 
the tests using carbon14 dating were directed by professor 
edward hall head of oxfords research laboratory for archaeology 
and the history of art 
the 15foot length of linen bearing the image of a bearded 
crucified man is venerated by believers who accept that it covered 
jesus body in his tomb skeptics consider it a brilliant forgery 
from medieval times 
dr michael tite of the british museum said he hoped to get a 
date with a margin of error of 200 years 
if 12th 13th or 14th century the result is perfectly clear 
cut tite said 
if we get a date of 100 to 300 ad or 200 to 400 ad one 
would start being a bit edgy whatever result we come up with one 
still has the question of how the image got there he said 
similar carbon tests have been done at the university of arizona 
and the federal polytechnic in zurich switzerland 
the american and swiss findings are being kept secret until the 
results of all three tests can be announced together expected in 
september from cardinal anastasio ballestrero of turin 
the oxford scientists were sent three thumbnailsize fragments 
of cloth and were not told which of the three was cut from the 
shroud which is kept in turin cathedral 
cosmic rays entering the earths atmosphere create radioactive 
carbon14 atoms that are absorbed by all vegetation and thus become 
part of any material with an organic base like linen and cotton 
the atoms decay at a known rate making it possible to estimate 
how long ago a material absorbed them

mayor edward i koch says irishamericans who 
beat up the british for their role in northern ireland are 
taking the easy way out 
the mayor back at city hall tuesday defended remarks he made 
in dublin earlier in the day at the end of his fiveday pilgrimage 
for peace in ireland with cadinal john oconnor 
in dublin koch had praised the good attitude of the 
british saying i do not believe that they deserve the 
castigation that any of us myself included have heaped upon them 
i do not believe that the british are occupying forces he 
told reporters my impression in northern ireland is that the 
british are trying to play a constructive role 
i think theyre in northern ireland more from the point of 
view of safeguarding the peace by preventing what if these people 
were jewish would be called a pogrom 
the comments brought an immediate negative reaction from 
prominent local irishamericans including peter king the nassau 
county comptroller who has visited northern island 11 times and was 
the 1985 st patricks day parade grand marshal 
he called the mayors remarks senseless and ridiculous and 
said koch was demonstrating an appalling ignorance and disregard 
for the catholic community of northern ireland 
koch said he changed his mind about the british after learning 
more about the recent accords between the governments of britain 
and the republic of ireland for settling problems between the 
catholic and protestant factions in northern ireland 
the easiest thing to do is to beat up the british he said 
they are responsible for the historical reasons for the 
division of ireland and northern ireland he conceded but if 
you put that aside and talk about what they are doing today i 
came to the conclusion that the british today are playing a 
positive role

leaders of two of the west coasts most 
violent gangs met with clergy in a hotel surrounded by police 
seeking to end bloody feuding that has contributed to more than 165 
killings this year 
the talks are going well the rev charles mims said after 
the first closeddoor meeting tuesday between four leaders each of 
the crips and bloods gangs depicted in the sensational crime film 
colors 
gang violence also was the target of a protest tuesday night in 
east los angeles where hundreds of people conducted a candlelight 
march 
we wont live in fear said the rev gregory boyle who 
organized the rally 
crips and bloods leaders met with the ministers at a motel in 
suburban carson 15 miles south of here for about 90 minutes then 
agreed to meet again today and thursday 
as they met los angeles county sheriffs deputies from the 
operation safe streets gang detail cruised nearby streets and 
watched from rooftops with binoculars 
a news blackout on details of the meeting will continue until a 
news conference scheduled for thursday said mims one of the 
ministers in los angeles watts neighborhood who organized the 
talks 
the ministers arranged the negotiations in hopes the gang 
leaders would find enough common ground to at least slow the pace 
of killing 
more than 165 people in the county have died in violence 
attributed to street gangs this year last year 387 people many 
innocent bystanders fell victim to gang violence 
tuesdays rare facetoface encounter among young people who 
usually confront each other at gunpoint was triggered by concern 
the killings had gotten out of control 
theyre tired of the violence and theyre tired of being 
used by drug dealers and other underworld figures the rev james 
sterns of the tabernacle of faith baptist church said monday 
last weekend four people died and 16 were wounded in los 
angeles area gang attacks 
members of the bloods and the crips are mostly black innercity 
youths and young adults police blame the two gangs for much of the 
gangrelated violence plaguing the nations second largest city 
police cmdr william booth said before the meeting that he hoped 
the talks would have a settling influence on gang members who 
control an arsenal of military assault weapons such as uzi 
submachine guns 
some civic leaders however expressed skepticism that a handful 
of people could work out an agreement that would be the key to 
peace for the nearly 300 black gangs citywide 
this is a farce said chilton alphonse executive director 
of the community youth sports and arts foundation which works with 
gang members 
gang members should not expect to be treated like ambassadors 
from warring nations complete with television interviews and 
surrounded by public officials state sen diane watson of los 
angeles said through a spokesman 
the talks came as collective rage and frustration over the 
violence mounted 
in east los angeles where hispanic gangs dominate hundreds of 
parishoners from the dolores mission marched holding candles and 
singing in spanish we will walk these streets in peace 
the crowd many of them children held banners saying 
education and jobs not drugs 
the march was intended to serve notice not only to unwelcome 
gang members but to outsiders seeking drugs boyle said 
the bmws come friday during rush hour men with white coats 
with stethoscopes around their necks buy cocaine that is the 
cheapest in los angeles he complained 
weve had a solid week of shootings he said adding some 
residents believe they are safer sleeping in their kitchens than in 
their bedrooms 
often gang members launch their attacks from passing 
automobiles many times the victims are children and bystanders 
caught in a crossfire 
in recent months los angeles gangs have been trying to develop 
a lucrative drug trade in cities as far away as kansas city mo 
seattle denver and tulsa okla according to police in those 
cities 
police here estimate gang membership in the county at 100000 
law enforcement leaders were cautious in predicting the results 
of the carson talks 
the task that these socalled gang leaders have set before 
them will be difficult but i dont know that its impossible

social bank at the request of the weekly literary gazette newspaper 
the fund drive aims to build a monument in moscow to the 
victims of stalinist repressions tass said in a brief dispatch 
the newspaper has published many articles over the past year 
detailing repressions under stalin the soviet leader from 1924 
until his death in 1953 
western historians have estimated that as many as 20 million 
soviets died as a result of his political purges mass deportations 
and forced collectivization of agriculture 
tass said literary gazette reported that citizens writing in 
support of a memorial to stalins victims had suggested without 
exception that the fundraising project be a public rather than a 
governmental effort 
a public committee elected by a democratic method will be 
set up to manage the fund and to oversee the construction of the 
memorial the agency said 
it gave no details of the account or the memorial likely to be 
built from donations 
stalins repressions have been exposed and criticized in many 
articles in the soviet media that have been published since 
communist party chief mikhail s gorbachev came to power three 
years ago and began his campaign for glasnost or more openness 
about soviet history and social problems 
some of the late dictators political victims like 
revolutionary nikolai i bukharin have been officially 
rehabilitated and reinstated into the party as a result of the 
historical review

love canal a symbol of environmental 
disaster will eventually be restored as a residential area new 
yorks top environmental officer says 
we have a vision that we can restore love canal to a vibrant 
landscape again state environmental conservation commissioner 
thomas jorling said tuesday 
more than 800 families left the 10block area in 1978 when toxic 
wastes from a former chemical dump were discovered seeping into 
their homes although many homes closest to the dump were torn 
down some 175 families are awaiting the results of a state study 
of whether their homes are habitable 
health commissioner dr david axelrod is expected to decide the 
issue this fall however in one of the first indications from 
state officials on the contents of the study jorling said the 
neighborhood would not be left vacant 
our policy of remediation means restoring it to use jorling 
said how could we sustain the policy if were going to keep it 
off limits 
state and federal agencies have spent some 200 million 
containing and monitoring the contamination he said the site has 
been fenced off a leachate collection and treatment facility built 
and the landfill capped with a synthetic liner and clay 
we have the problem abated he said 
jorling did not discuss how the neighborhood could be restored 
he said that would depend on axelrods ruling 
but mayor michael olaughlin who accompanied jorling on a tour 
of the site pointed to boarded homes and said i see these 
places being lived in 
olaughlin said many homes could be reopened because there was 
no evidence of contamination state and federal governments should 
provide money to renovate the homes he said 
the landfill itself would probably remain off limits forever he 
said 
formers residents and some people who have remained in their 
homes near the site were skeptical of the idea 
i not sure theyll ever know whats safe and what isnt 
said former resident patricia brown

a protestant extremist group 
has claimed responsibility for killing a member of the 
predominantly roman catholic irish republican army 
in a statement tuesday to belfast media the outlawed ulster 
volunteer force said it shot brendan davidson 33 on monday as he 
answered a knock at his door by three men dressed as policemen 
sinn fein the legal political wing of the outlawed ira accused 
police of collusion with the killers sinn fein said a patrol of 
the royal ulster constabulary northern irelands police force 
passed outside davidsons home shortly before he was killed 
this prompts us to believe there was collusion not of the 
royal ulster constabulary as a whole but between individual members 
of the ruc and loyalist paramilitaries said sinn fein spokesman 
jackie donnelly 
the ira fighting to oust britain from northern ireland and 
unite the island also said in a statement tuesday night that it 
paid its final tribute to davidson by firing a volley of shots 
on a street in the ardoyne area of belfast 
the ira has abandoned its tradition of firing a gun volley over 
coffins of its members a practice which had led to confrontations 
with security forces 
davidsons killing was believed to be in retaliation for an ira 
bombing saturday near the irish border that killed a protestant 
couple and their 6yearold son 
the ira apologized for the attack saying the bomb had been 
targeted at security forces

consumer groups have argued that a proposed 
settlement for owners of audi 5000 sedans who contend the cars are 
prone to unintended acceleration was not properly reviewed and 
should be thrown out 
attorneys for audi and the plaintiffs countered tuesday that 
they had mailed out 345000 notices of the settlement and only 
1500 people said they would not agree to it 
cook county circuit judge thomas rakowsky set a new hearing on 
the proposed settlement for aug 11 
in june attorneys announced the proposed settlement under 
which audi would offer rebates of 300 to 2000 to 390000 current 
or former owners who buy another audi under the settlement audi 
acknowledged no liability 
the settlement would affect owners of audi 5000 sedans built 
between 1978 and 1986 
the center for auto safety contends that at least 1650 
accidents causing 402 injuries and five deaths have been linked 
to acceleration surges when the audi 5000 was shifted from park 
into gear 
audi contends there was nothing wrong with the cars

one of 12 people indicted tuesday for alleged financial crimes 
he is accused of making 680000 in illegal profits using 
information he obtained while a partner of the law firm schiff 
hardin amp waite in chicago 
this is the first time in history weve used the racketeering 
statute in an insider trading case said us attorney anton 
valukas 
the racketeering statute provides greater penalties and gives 
the government more power to seize illicit gains than other laws 
prohibiting insider trading the prosecutor said 
elliott is charged with wire fraud securities fraud 
racketeering and filing a false income tax return 
if convicted on all counts he could receive up to 363 years in 
prison and 135 million in fines and be forced to make restitution 
of any illegal profits 
in the future we expect to use the racketeering laws as a 
powerful weapon in these cases valukas said 
nine times in 1984 through 1986 elliott learned of large 
pending stock acquisitions by clients then invested heavily in the 
company whose stock was being bought the government said 
the deals involved stock in portec inc pearle health services 
inc and rival manufacturing co prosecutors said 
directory assistance for melbourne beach had no listing for 
elliott his former law firm said it had no knowledge of his 
whereabouts 
eight of the 12 people indicted tuesday are accused in a 
separate 12 million scheme of churning accounts in which brokers 
trade on customers accounts merely to generate commissions 
none of the 120 customers most of whom were solicited by 
telephone ever made a profit said valukas 
the government said the alleged scheme was carried out by 
officers and employees of whitehall investors international inc 
based in chicago with branches in irvine calif and boca raton 
fla 
those indicted include walter s josten an owner and president 
of whitehall who could face 105 years in prison if convicted

for his company and make it appear they had been made for one of 
the three traders

sein lwin a former army general who 
ruthlessly suppressed dissidents over the past quarter century 
today was named president of this troubled southeast asian nation 
sein lwin who replaces 70yearold san yu on tuesday assumed 
the countrys most powerful position chairman of the ruling burma 
socialist program party 
an emergency session of parliament today also elected the former 
deputy prime minister and planning minister tun tin as prime 
minister vice president aye ko remained in his post 
parliament also promoted defense minister kyaw htin to the no 3 
government position as head of the council of state which the 
64yearold sein lwin had vacated 
it also endorsed a package of economic reforms proposed at a 
recent party congress 
the former party chairman ne win retired after leading burma 
for 26 years the presidency is the no 1 government post 
the elevation of sein lwin and other leadership changes appeared 
to dash any hopes that ne wins retirement would lead to reform of 
burmas oneparty militarybacked regime 
but kyaw htin and tun tin both are regarded as relatively 
liberal on issues of economic reform and dealing with dissent in 
the country kyaw htin also moved up to a top party post 
only one civilian was included in the new lineup attorney 
general dr maung maung the rest are retired or active duty 
military officers 
western diplomats contacted in rangoon and bangkok thailand 
without exception expressed dismay over sein lwins selection and 
several predicted a continuation of student demonstrations 
shortly after the announcement of sein lwins selection as 
chairman state radio said prime minister maung maung kha and 
attorney general myint maung had been dismissed from their posts by 
the council of state after being found reponsible in connection 
with bloody riots in march 
sein lwin a close associate of ne win commanded forces that 
brutally put down the march student riots according to reliable 
western diplomatic and burmese sources 
he has since been the target of criticism by students and other 
antigovernment elements more than 100 people were believed killed 
in a brief flareup in rangoon on march 18 
several other officials have been fired or reprimanded but sein 
lwin escaped officially unscathed by the incident 
the government has admitted that 43 people died 41 of them 
suffocating in a packed police van while being transported to 
prison 
sein lwin who had ranked no 4 in the party hierarchy also 
commanded the fourth burma rifles which opened fire on some 2000 
antigovernment demonstrations at rangoon university july 7 1962 
unofficial casualties were put at more than 100 and the following 
day authorities blew up the universitys student union building 
sein lwin who had served as the partys joint general secretary 
since 1985 was also involved in putting down demonstrations in 
1974 students and buddhist monks angry at a shoddy government 
funeral for former united nations secretary general u thant 
snatched his coffin and brought it to the rangoon university 
campus which was later stormed by riflefiring troops 
ne win asked to step down on saturday the congress accepted his 
resignation and that of party vice chairman san yu on monday 
in his resignation speech ne win raised hopes that major changes 
were in store for burma in an unprecedented move he called for a 
referendum to decide whether the country wished to perpetuate 
oneparty rule or opt for a multiparty system 
the congress turned down the referendum proposal and criticized 
recent unrest although ne win assumed indirect responsibility for 
the troubles in march and another outburst of antigovernment 
violence in june he warned that when army is called out it 
shoots to hit it does not fire in the air to scare 
ne wins resignation and the ensuing leadership changes follows 
three periods of studentled rioting since last october in rangoon 
and other burmese cities there is also mounting discontent over 
deteriorating economic conditions 
the congress promised a package of liberal economic reforms but 
there has been an initial skepticism among diplomats about how far 
these will go and whether the current leaders can implement them 
even if they try 
this doesnt look like a strong enough team to carry out 
economic reforms one western diplomat in bangkok said after sein 
lwins election to the party chairmanship 
burmas economy suffered greatly under ne wins isolationist 
policies inflation is soaring and the country has a foreign debt 
of 4 billion 
burmese consumers rely almost solely on black market goods 
smuggled in from neighboring countries 
the governments tight control over agriculture and virtually 
all economic sectors has turned resourcerich burma into one of the 
worlds 10 poorest countries that last year suffered food shortages

londons rainy summer has forced organizers to 
close the elaborate festival of london after only four days it was 
scheduled to run 16 days 
director and spokesman tim walsh said tuesday that heavy rain 
kept crowds away from the festival at alexandra palace an 
exhibition and concert center in north london he said the rain 
left alexandra palace park muddy and made it difficult to stage 
many events 
the night before the festival opened wind almost wrecked a 
specially built arena 
prince edward opened the 3 million festival saturday it was 
hailed as londons most ambitious event of this sort since the 
festival of britain in 1951 which was held to demonstrate british 
economic and technical progress 
the festival of london company has gone into voluntary 
liquidation walsh said the decision was made at a directors 
meeting this evening because attendance figures were so 
disappointing and because of the weather 
he said it was too soon to assess the extent of losses but that 
they would be substantial he said most people who had formal 
contracts with the company had been paid including many 
performers and the company would do its best for the others 
the festival was financed privately by a consortium of about 15 
shareholders involved in the entertainment or allied industries 
its 200 planned events included a marathon race reconstruction 
of an elizabethan village and victorian streets and performances by 
the soviet unions moscow state circus 
all festival events scheduled after tuesday were called off 
except for the circus which will continue in its own tent in 
alexandra palace park 
it is a tragedy for london this was the first year and we 
wanted to create a unique event for london which could have been 
held annually walsh said

warplanes 
the fighting occurred as officials from both countries were to 
meet separately in new york today with un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar to discuss a ceasefire in the 8yearold 
war 
iraq meanwhile said it has captured 12207 iranians in six 
days of fighting baghdad has sought to improve its bargaining 
position in the talks by capturing an equal number of prisoners as 
iran claims to be holding 
if todays claim by iraq is confirmed baghdad now holds 25000 
iranian prisoners of war compared to 50000 iraqi pows held by 
iran according to the latest international red cross estimates 
the iranian commanderinchief hashemi rafsanjani offered 
tuesday to try to have american hostages held in lebanon freed in 
exchange for iranian assets frozen in the united states but the 
white house said no deals eighteen men including nine 
americans are believed held in beirut by proiranian shiite moslem 
extremists 
iran said its forces attacked iraqi troops occupying part of 
southern iran today drove them across the border and killed or 
wounded 1200 iraqis 
iran also said iraqi troops again entered eslamabad in western 
iran and a battle of utmost intensity was under way for 
control of the area 
earlier iraqibacked iranian guerrillas opposed to ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini said they pushed deep into iran and tehran 
acknowledged its forces were fighting counterrevolutionary 
mercenaries 
a tehran radio announcer broke into regular programs to say 
the able combatants of islam in order to chase and destroy 
the aggressive iraqi forces on a greater scale early this morning 
attacked the core of the enemy forces in the operational axis north 
of khorramshahr 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia gave the casualty figure of 
1200 and said a brigade of the iraqi 3rd army corps was encircled

territory was liberated

during the fighting the radio said 
iraq earlier this week announced its forces were withdrawing 
from the area just north of khorramshahr an iranian port city but 
iran continued to claim the iraqis were invading the area 
rafsanjani said irans decision last week to accept a united 
nations ceasefire call was a major political and cultural 
victory which fortunately will be followed by a military victory 
we are witnessing the complete defeat of the iraqi forces on 
the southern front as well as the western fronts and these have 
prepared very favorable conditions for the armed forces of the 
islamic republic of iran to show their power and capabilities he 
said 
his comments were made tuesday in a battlefront headquarters 
interview and portions were carried that night on iranian 
television and radio the islamic republic news agency provided

45 miles inside iran and eslamabad 20 miles farther but iran 
said it recaptured eslamabad killing 1100 rebels 
today however tehran radio said iraqi troops entered 
eslamabad in the morning the battle in the region is continuing 
with utmost intensity and the initiative lies with the combatants

a military court today sentenced 
three prominent slovenian journalists to prison terms ranging from 
five to 18 months for disclosing military secrets a supporter of 
the accused said 
an army sergeantmajor who allegedly leaked a classified 
document to the journalists was given four years in jail by the 
military court in ljubljana capital of yugoslavias most liberal 
republic slovenia said donci kuzmanic 
kuzmanic is a spokesman for the committee in the defense of the 
accused an unofficial group supporting the defendants 
the journalists janez jansa david tasic and franci zavrl 
along with ivan borstner the noncommissioned army officer were 
sentenced for revealing a document dealing with the deployment and 
combat readiness of army units in the republic 
jansa a columnist for the outspoken youth newspaper mladina 
and zavrl chief editor of the same magazine received 18 months 
each kuzmanic told the associated press he said tasic a 
journalist working for mladina was sentenced to five months 
the closeddoor trial which started july 11 sparked an uproar 
in slovenia which has emerged as the vanguard of political reforms 
in this communist country 
more than 10000 people gathered in front of the courthouse to 
hear the verdict and protest the trial witnesses said they 
carried banners and slovenian national flags in support of the 
defendants 
military trials of civilians are highly unusual in yugoslavia 
where the armed forces unlike the police and civilian courts are 
under federal control 
all three journalists have in past written articles sharply 
criticizing the yugoslav army and its leaders and alleging they 
were plotting a coup in slovenia 
thousands of people attended protest meetings and signed 
petitions against the trial widely seen in the republic an army 
move to intimidate the slovenian public 
zavrl the only defendant not held in custody regularly 
commented on the trial publicly saying it was a shameful 
humiliating court proceeding 
the liberal slovenian leadership demanded that the trial be 
conducted openly that the accused be defended by civilian lawyers 
and that they all be released from custody 
the slovenian leadership along with numerous unofficial groups 
and prominent intellectuals also demanded that the court 
proceedings be conducted in the slovenian language instead of 
serbocroatian which is used by the majority of yugoslavs 
the army rejected all of the requests citing what they said was 
the sensitive nature of the classified documents and arguing that 
serbocroatian is the official language of the armed forces

a scientific detective team repudiated research 
results that seemed to defy natural laws saying it was 
dismayed that the salaries of two of the researchers were paid 
by a supplier of controversial medicines 
the investigators who included magician james the amazing 
randi concluded that shoddy science but no deliberate fraud 
was responsible for the inexplicable biochemical results said john 
maddox editor of the british journal nature 
the prestigious science journal published the results last month 
along with an unusual editorial reservation that noted the 
incredulity of experts and said that the lead researcher 
jacques benveniste had agreed to the investigation 
the investigating teams report released tuesday was based on 
a weeklong visit this month to benvenistes suburban paris 
laboratory part of a french medical research institute called 
inserm 
benveniste said this week the investigators made an enormous 
amount of mistakes and in a written statement he called the 
investigation a mockery of scientific inquiry 
the nature report and benvenistes statement will appear in 
thursdays issue of journal 
at issue are results reported by benveniste and a dozen other 
scientists in the june 30 issue of nature the researchers studied 
the reaction of white blood cells called basophils when exposed 
to natural proteins called antibodies mixed into a solution 
they said that when the solution was diluted so much that 
samples of it no longer contained any antibodies those samples 
still triggered the reaction in the white blood cells 
there is no physical basis for such an activity nature said 
in its note accompanying the report 
the investigators were maddox randi a recipient of a macarthur 
foundation genius grant who is known for investigating unusual 
scientific claims and walter stewart of the national institutes of 
health who investigates scientific errors and fraud 
in a telephone interview maddox said randi was picked to look 
for trickery and stewart because of his tenacity in investigating 
scientific inconsistencies 
during the week with benveniste and coworkers they studied 
laboratory notebooks and observed repetitions of the experiment 
the notebooks and observed experiments showed that results were 
inconsistent the report says 
the investigators noting that the june 30 results have been 
interpreted as supporting homeopathic medicine said they were 
dismayed to discover that a french supplier of homeopathic 
medicines paid the salaries of two of benvenistes coauthors under 
a contract with inserm 
homeopathic medicine holds that a diseasecausing agent if used 
in extremely dilute solutions can be used to fight the disease 
its principles are not accepted by many doctors 
in a series of trials in which researchers followed special 
procedures to ensure they could not influence the outcome the 
experiment failed to give positive results investigators said 
in one such procedure investigators secretly devised a code 
that identified the samples in each of a series of test tubes the 
identifications were enclosed in a specially sealed envelope which 
was then taped to the ceiling of the laboratory during the 
experiment 
the day after that was done randi said in a telephone 
interview the envelope showed evidence that someone had tried to 
look at its contents the attempt apparently failed he said 
overall the investigators concluded that the researchers paid 
too little attention to preventing contamination and errors in 
recording the response of the white blood cells 
researchers also failed to explore why the experiment gave 
negative results on many occasions and excluded data from such 
failures in their published analyses investigators said in 
addition some past results appeared to be questionable 
investigators said 
benveniste blamed negative results on the procedures he said 
were improperly imposed by the investigators and on overwork by 
laboratory workers in the ordeal that included awful technical 
and psychological conditions 
maddox replied that the added procedures were perfectly 
sensible and that the performance of lab workers showed no 
evidence of decline 
the june 30 paper also reported positive results from france 
canada israel and italy the investigators said they knew too 
little about the conditions of those experiments to evaluate them

a government advisory commision says 16yearolds 
in england and wales should be allowed to marry without their 
parents consent 
the law commission said tuesday that the law requiring parental 
consent for those under 18 who wish to marry can easily be avoided 
by determined teenagers it said the current law is illogical and 
should be repealed 
it appears that the present consent requirement is of 
doubtful benefit to the very children it is trying to help the 
commission report said 
if the marriage takes place without consent it is quite 
valid if consent is refused the child can apply to the court for 
consent which is likely to be granted the commission said in 
technical terms therefore it is difficult to justify the present 
law 
the law commission comprises five legal experts headed by high 
court judge sir roy beldam it was established by act of parliament 
in 1965 to monitor the law and recommend changes 
its reports carry considerable weight but are not binding on the 
government scotland is unaffected by the recommendation because it 
has its own separate legal system 
the commission report also said the present consent law does 
little good because teenagers are increasingly living together 
without being married 
cohabitation resulting from refusal of consent could be 
severely disadvantageous to the girl it said because courts 
had less power to protect her than if she were married 
parental refusal to consent may simply serve to alienate the 
child and since parental opposition is often withdrawn if the girl 
becomes pregnant unwanted pregnancies may be encouraged it said

a 7yearold was electrocuted when she 
tried to knock a wire from an electrified fence off her mothers 
leg police said 
a detective said a device that reduces normal household current 
to a harmless level had been plugged in backwards giving the fence 
a lethal charge 
tara zyhowski died monday night in a field near her mobile home 
in penn township where she and her mother karen zyhowski were 
collecting grass clippings to feed to horses said township police 
chief edward schmuck 
mrs zyhowski had tried pull a wagon containing the clippings 
underneath a 2foot electric fence surrounding the pasture 
schmuck said a live wire snapped coiled around her ankle and 
knocked her down he said 
when tara took off her thongs to use them to knock the wire off 
her right arm touched the wire knocking her to the ground her 
head then came into contact with the wire said county chief of 
detectives michael brajdich 
with her head and arm both touching the wire a circuit was 
completed and she was electrocuted by the 100volt current he said 
the little girl was obviously trying to help her mother and 
she told her to stay away said diane kmetko a friend of the 
family 
roxanne holmes a family friend who arrived just after the 
accident went to the house and pulled the main plug to the fence 
gerry mattern an electrical engineer who examined the fence 
after the accident in the western pennsylvania community said such 
a fence normally would carry 40 to 45 volts which causes no more 
than a slight shock to a human 
its the kind of thing that shouldnt have done what it did 
said assistant district attorney alfred bell 
county detective michael paden said a device known as a fencer 
normally reduces the 110volt continuous household current to a 
40volt current pulsating in onesecond intervals 
but the plug was in backward giving the line a lethal 105volt 
continuous current he said 
dr cyril wecht the pathologist who performed the autopsy said 
most fatalities require more than 240 volts but there can be 
deaths at lower levels there is a great variation when it comes 
to children he said 
mrs zyhowski suffered burns on her hands and legs she was 
listed in stable condition at forbes regional health center in 
monroeville 
paden said tara was quite a hero as far as im concerned 
she was smart too he said she tried to use the 
rubbersoled sandals the other witnesses told us she also warned 
her 3yearold sister and another child to stay away that was 
quite a feat for a 7yearold

a growing number of countries are enacting 
discriminatory laws and travel restrictions to fight the spread of 
aids according to a harvard study 
were seeing an increase in the use of coercion quarantine 
and criminal prosecution against aids victims said larry gostin 
an associate professor at harvards school of public health its 
becoming a syndrome of blaming the victims 
gostin presented highlights of the study tuesday at the 10th 
national lesbian and gay health conference and aids forum 
many of the laws are based on irrational fears that aids is a 
foreigners disease and not a worldwide problem according to 
the study by the harvard school of public health commissioned by 
the world health organization 
one of the countries with the greatest use of criminal statutes 
and coercive measures to penalize aids victims is the united 
states said gostin also director of the american society of law 
and medicine 
we found at least 50 criminal prosecutions of people with the 
hiv virus and uncovered at least a dozen more statutes for 
quarantine isolation or criminal prosecution of people in the 
united states he said 
cuba and the soviet union have among the toughest laws to combat 
aids according to the study cuba tests all returning citizens for 
aids including soldiers and keeps 150 people in perpetual 
quarantine 
soviet officials recently passed a law calling for compulsory 
screening of all aids highrisk groups such as intravenous drug 
users homosexuals and prostitutes and may test foreign diplomats 
the survey which was sent to health officials in every country 
found that 45 percent of the 77 countries that responded have aids 
legislation the first time health officials around the world have 
developed laws for just one disease gostin said 
the study also found that 21 countries have established national 
aids commissions or task forces gostin said 
most disturbing were the studys findings that 24 countries 
including japan china iraq libya soviet union thailand and 
saudi arabia developed immigration and travel restrictions for 
people with the hiv virus gostin said 
when countries were last surveyed in 1985 none had such 
restrictions he said 
our fear is that were seeing an aids war where countries are 
blaming other countries and putting up border restrictions 
gostin said this could all be part of passport and immigration 
control in many countries 
harvard officials recommended that countries view aids as a 
global problem and not something to retaliate against they also 
urge countries to enact antidiscrimination and confidentiality 
laws to protect aids victims

democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis zeroed in on 
law and order today after attacking the ethics record of the reagan 
administration vice president george bush intensified his search 
for a vice presidential running mate as the republican national 
convention drew closer 
dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas began his 
first solo campaign trip today with stops scheduled over the next 
several days in texas new mexico california nevada and the deep 
south 
the chairman of the senate finance committee planned to address 
a businesswomens group in albuquerque three days after bush went 
before the group and unveiled a plan for a child care tax cut 
bentsen said he would highlight his senate accomplishments 
including prenatal and child care legislation 
kept close to his home base by official duties dukakis planned 
to tour a prison construction site but called off the visit after 
heavy rains turned the site into a muddy quagmire later he was to 
meet with with his anticrime council and sign legislation imposing 
stiff penalties on producers and sellers of child pornography 
the massachusetts governor is highlighting lawandorder themes 
after coming under attack for his prison furlough program after 
some participants committed violent crimes during their release 
the program was revised 
bush on tuesday stepped up his search for a running mate and 
expanded the list of possible candidates with the addition of new 
hampshire gov john sununu sununu is chairman of the national 
governors association one of five cochairmen of the bush 
campaign and a harsh critic of dukakis 
bush asked washington lawyer robert m kimmitt to begin 
background checks on several prospective nominees the washington 
post reported today 
the winnowing process will include selective polling said 
sheila tate bushs campaign spokeswoman 
bush has said he wants to keep his running mate a secret until 
the convention which opens aug 15 in new orleans 
dukakis during an afternoon news conference tuesday in boston 
said the american people are embarrassed and ashamed by some of 
the things that they see in the reagan administration 
he blasted president reagan and bush for supporting attorney 
general edwin meese iii even after two justice department officials 
quit because of the attorney generals conduct 
dukakis also renewed his criticism of bush for not trying to 
block the armsforhostages deal at the center of the irancontra 
affair and he questioned the viability of bushs daycare proposal 
a policy that would require every welfare mother in the 
country to hire an accountant just doesnt make sense he said 
bentsen also criticized the proposal in an interview tuesday 
saying i dont know what the cost would be 
bush this week proposed what he said would be a 22 billion 
program that would give tax credits to working mothers initially 
targeting those with low family incomes 
in a speech tuesday bush broke with the reagan administration 
and endorsed the use of independent counsels to investigate 
wrongdoing by federal officials he also said congress should come 
under the same law 
he said civil penalties as well as criminal sanctions should be 
used to punish violators 
bush said that under the current system an official is charged 
either with a felony or nothing at all this is plainly 
unacceptable the vice president said 
jesse jackson a democratic challenger until last week met with 
aides in chicago to plan for a new phase in this years political 
activity jackson aide frank watkins said the transition of some 
jackson aides to the dukakis campaign was discussed but said no 
specifics about jacksons role had yet been decided 
and a dispute over some dukakis campaign funds turned out to be 
shortlived the federal election commission voted 60 tuesday to 
release 46 million to the dukakis campaign despite objections from 
a republican group the group complained about bentsens dual 
campaigns as dukakis vice presidential running mate and as a 
senator seeking reelection from texas 
positive reaction from the democratic national convention 
boosted dukakis in the polls giving him a 17point lead over bush 
in the latest gallup survey of 1001 registered voters conducted 
friday through saturday 
the survey reported tuesday by radio station weei in boston 
found dukakis with 54 percent support to 37 percent for bush the 
poll reflected the frequent bounce enjoyed by presidential 
candidates after their nominating conventions 
nine percent were undecided in the survey which had a margin of 
error of four points

miles

between 50000 and 55000

as antiapartheid protesters rallied outside 
south africas new ambassador received his accreditation today and 
called on the israeli government to end its sanctions against his 
country 
the sanctions are counterproductive ambassador johan 
viljoen said after the ceremony at the home of president chaim 
herzog they wont help the people theyre supposed to help 
in 1986 israel banned new defense contracts with south africa 
as well as government loans and investments the government also 
said it would not promote tourism to south africa or serve as a 
transit point for countries trying to circumvent international 
trade sanctions against pretoria 
israel adopted the sanctions to comply with the us congress 
which threatened to cut foreign aid to countries which did not 
punish pretoria for its apartheid policy 
we will do our best to persuade the israeli government such 
measures would only be harmful to the poorer sections of our 
population viljoen told israel radio 
dozens of demonstrators protested outside herzogs home calling 
on israel to distance itself from apartheid the 
governmentlegislated system of desegregation that bars south 
africas 256 million blacks from a role in public life 
viljoen said he was not fazed by the protest ive received so 
many messages of welcome and such a warm welcome that completely 
outweighs the small demonstrations that have taken place 
viljoen arrived in israel 10 days ago on the same day the 
jailed leader of south africas blacks nelson mandela celebrated

flirting with a lawsuit 
a state appeals court tuesday ruled that a husband could sue his 
wifes lawyer for assigning a crucial report in their divorce case 
to a psychologist with whom the lawyer allegedly was romantically 
involved 
the husband barry silberg said the report prepared by 
psychologist robert adler during silbergs 1984 divorce from his 
wife janet was biased and led to his being denied reasonable 
visitation rights to his children 
silberg blamed attorney margaret anderson who he said had 
promised a neutral report but didnt tell him about her 
relationship with adler 
the appeals court said andersons conduct was not protected by 
legal privilege if silberg can show that she intentionally deceived 
him for her own benefit or her clients

at the fastest pace in almost six years the government reported 
today 
the commerce department said growth in the gross national 
product the broadest measure of economic health was down only 
slightly from a 34 percent increase in the first three months of 
the year 
inflation however picked up substantially during the spring 
with a price index tied to the gnp climbing at an annual rate of 
47 percent the biggest advance since a 55 percent rise in the 
third quarter of 1982 
this inflation index which measures a fixed selection of goods 
had risen 35 percent in the first quarter 
todays report blamed the pickup in inflation on higher costs 
for a wide range of consumer goods 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the report shows 
the economy continuing to grow at a moderately healthy pace in the 
first half of the year with some slowing more recently investment 
is strong the real trade deficit is narrowing and slower growth 
of domestic demand bodes well for future improvements 
as to concerns about inflation fitzwater said inflation 
remains low and under control there are moderating influences in 
the last several months that indicate steady growth but without a 
return to inflation 
while the us economy is performing substantially better than 
had been expected at the start of the year the more robust growth 
has triggered inflation fears 
recently federal reserve chairman alan greenspan warned that if 
economic activity did not slow in coming months the central bank 
was prepared to dampen demand by pushing interest rates up further 
economists worry however that if credit is tightened too severely 
it could trigger a recession next year 
but michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said 
he was not overly concerned by the rise in inflation he said most 
of the price pressure came in increases for clothing and energy 
early in the spring he said those gains have since been reversed 
i dont think this is a sign that we will have higher 
inflation ahead he said 
todays gnp report was accompanied by benchmark revisions in gnp 
data over the last three years part of an annual review to update 
the data to reflect new information 
the revisions substantially boosted growth last year to an 
annual rate of 34 percent largely because of higher consumer 
spending the earlier estimate had put gnp growth last year at 29 
percent 
the reagan administration recently revised its estimate of 
growth for all of 1988 to 3 percent when measured from the fourth 
quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this 
because the economy grew at a 325 percent annual rate in the 
first half of this year growth could dip as low as 27 percent in 
the second half of the year and still meet the administrations 
target which is in line with the expectations of many private 
analysts 
many economists are expecting growth to slow in the second half 
of the year in part because of the adverse effects of the severe 
drought in the farm belt 
the droughts impact was already being felt in the spring 
quarter reducing total gnp growth by 55 billion todays report 
said 
overall gnp grew at an annual rate of 302 billion in the 
spring quarter pushing total inflationadjusted gnp to 3986 
trillion in the second quarter 
much of the strength came from a 189 billion improvement in 
the countrys trade deficit the biggest narrowing of the deficit 
since a 248 billion shrinkage in the first quarter of 1980 
also contributing to growth in the apriljune quarter was a 
144 billion rise in consumer spending which climbed at an annual 
rate of 23 percent 
business investment shot up at a 14 percent annual rate during 
the spring as us manufacturers continued to spend heavily to 
expand production facilities because of export demands 
exports rose at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second 
quarter while imports fell by 62 percent 
even housing construction showed some strength in the second 
quarter rising by 28 percent partially reversing a 65 percent 
drop in the first quarter 
john wilson chief economist of bank of america said he 
believed gnp growth would slow to a rate of 25 percent to 3 
percent from july through december 
the rise in interest rates that has already occurred will slow 
growth in the second half and i am looking for unemployment to rise 
a little bit as well he said 
christopher caton director of forecasting for data resources 
inc a lexington mass economic forecasting firm said he was 
looking for the economy to slow either on its own or because of 
inflationfighting moves on the part of the federal reserve 
if the fed doesnt see some signs that the economy is slowing 
then it will move to push interest rates up farther out of fear 
that inflation could get out of hand caton said 
john hagens an economist at the wefa group another private 
forecasting service said he believed growth would be reduced by 
about onehalf percentage point in the second half of the year 
because of the adverse impact of the drought he said the higher 
prices consumers will have to pay for food will reduce the amount 
of income they have to spend on other items

convulsions but was expected to be released from a hospital in the

president reagan said today that panamanian 
strongman gen manuel antonio noriega is not good for panama or 
for us relations with the central american country but declined 
to comment on a report that he had authorized covert activity to 
force noriega from power 
however house speaker jim wright said i am told it was the 
subject of cia briefings he declined to elaborate 
i am not going to coment on anything in the nature of covert 
operations reagan told reporters who questioned him as he opened 
a meeting with hungarian communist party leader karoly grosz that 
was unrelated to panama 
asked whether there was any way he saw that noriega could be 
removed from power reagan said i shouldnt be commenting on 
that certainly he is not good for panama good for our 
relations 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater refused to confirm or 
deny the published report that reagan this month authorized covert 
activity aimed at forcing noriegas removal from power 
fitzwater did say that reagan recently reassured deposed 
panamanian president eric arturo delvalle of us efforts to 
restore democracy in his country 
fitzwater said the administration would have been required by 
law to notify congressional intelligence committees within 48 hours 
of a new covert action finding or decision but he refused to say 
whether those panels had in fact been told of an undercover plan 
against noriega as reported in a story published in todays 
editions of the washington post 
the story said that while reagan had given the goahead for the 
covert activity no us military action was imminent and 
paramilitary action such as a kidnaping was unlikely 
the post reported that according to administration and 
congressional sources reagan informed congress and delvalle of his 
action 
the post quoted a wellplaced source who said no military action 
was imminent but declined to discuss any details of the covert 
plan another source said it appears the authorization involves 
activities that fall short of a paramilitary operation to remove 
noriega such as kidnaping him 
according to the newspaper senate and house intelligence 
committees have been briefed on the action 
fitzwater did confirm during todays white house news briefing 
that reagan telephoned delvalle on july 15 in new york where the 
panamanian was receiving a medical examination but he would not 
confirm that reagan had informed delvalle of a new covert action 
effort as the post reported 
the president called him in new york simply to reiterate his 
support for president delvalle and his continued commitment to 
freedom in panama fitzwater said 
when asked if reagan also had discussed covert operations with 
delvalle the spokesman replied we never discuss covert 
activities i would just say the discussion was limited to the 
points i mentioned theres been no changes in policy and no 
new actions taken 
pressed further on this point fitzwater said i cant 
finetune it any more for you without violating my rule about not 
commenting on intelligence matters 
the administration since june 1987 has been making efforts 
including a series of economic sanctions against panama to oust 
noriega whom it previously had considered a central american ally 
fitzwater maintained today that the sanctions are having an 
impact and we anticipate no change 
among the actions the united states has taken against panama are 
the freezing of its assets and the invocation of the emergency 
legislation authorizing the us government to bar the payment of 
taxes to panama by businesses with operations there 
noriega has been indicted in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges the administration this spring sought to 
negotiate a deal under which noriega would agree to leave panama in 
return for dropping the indictment but the deal fell through

the record hackensack nj on the democratic convention 
ann richards keynote address to the democratic convention was 
pungent but there seemed to be a curious vacuum at the heart of 
the speech 
the democrats are having trouble defining exactly what it is 
they believe 
its easy to see the democrats problem many parts of the 
country are still enjoying something close to full employment 
helping the disadvantaged has gone out of style and theres no 
money available anyway serious ecomonic problems are 
abstractions to many voters 
and democrats burned in 1984 by walter mondales honest but 
unpopular talk of raising taxes arent likely to get more specific 
about remedies 
in his dealings with jesse jackson michael dukakis showed a 
streak of arrogance george bush described as warm and sociable

the westerly ri sun on the downing of iran air flight 655 
had iran air flight 655s routine communications with airport 
traffic controllers been monitored by the us warship that shot it 
down the tragedy might not have occurred 
while one must obviously be wary of accepting iranian claims 
the alleged transcript of talk between the airliner pilot and 
controllers is persuasive evidence that this was a regularly 
scheduled civilian flight 
additional evidence compiled tends to justify the cruiser 
captains lastminute decision 
it was a decision made in a combat situation with various data 
suggesting that the plane might be an iranian fighter on a 
descending course directly toward the vincennes 
why didnt flight 655 respond to repeated warnings from the 
vicennes the answer to that one may never be known 
but this troubling thought remains if only the vincennes had 
carefully monitored civilian flights in the area it patrolled 
the plane very likely would not have been shot down

obvious conclusion if america wants to win gold medals its 
athletes will have to be paid 
to help the young unknown athletes the usoc hopes to raise 25 
million this year from the sale of olympic coins 
it would be hard to make a case for supporting them with tax 
dollars

olympic athletes they should be able to do so

worthington minn daily globe on handgun control 
another important vote will be coming to the floor of the us 
house of representatives within the next few days 
the bill is the antidrug abuse act of 1988 which was approved 
by the house judiciary committee june 30 along with an amendment 
that would require a waiting period before anyone can purchase a 
handgun 
the amendment has been officially named the brady amendment for 
white house press secretary james brady 
brady was shot in the head with a handgun that was purchased 
over the counter in texas one of the many states where nearly 
anyone with cash can buy a handgun over the counter 
the brady amendment is a logical first step toward limiting the 
number of handguns available to convicted felons in the united 
states 
we urge congress to support the antidrug abuse act of 1988 with 
the brady amendment attached

los angeles daily news on dukakisbush differences 
it seems likely that democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis may favor the broad use of businessgovernmentlabor 
partnerships while vice president george bush may tie himself 
tighter to the marketoriented policy of the reagan years 
the partnership approach which has involved housing downtown 
rehabilitation mall development and factory retooling has been 
the democrats answer to free enterprise for decades now 
but partnerships track record has been a rather inauspicious 
one often it has been a story of taxpayer money used less to 
leverage valuable projects and more to line the pockets of 
influential developers political cronies and through kickbacks 
corrupt politicians 
it wouldnt surprise us if bush and dukakis found themselves in 
a lively exchange over partnership which could prove to be one of 
the more philosophical and interesting debates of their 
campaign

decades of killing in cambodia 
after months of hesitation the four major factions in the 
cambodian civil war have gathered near jakarta using the pretext 
of a cocktail party to begin peace talks 
the four factions are talking if only because the three

55000 troops in the war realize they cant control their 
neighbors 
the cambodian civil war has been a war without a winner all the

have been losers

independent prosecutor james mckays report bears further 
witness to the proposition long since accepted by much of the 
public that edwin meese was the wrong man for the job of top law 
enforcement officer of the united states 
what mckay said in effect is this meese is a crook but i 
wont prosecute him 
mckay and his dozens of investigators spent 14 months and 17 
million looking into meeses activities his final report to the 
court that appointed him included these highlights 
meese probably committed three felonies one having to do with 
omission of capital gains income from his tax form and two 
involving participation in decisions that could have enhanced 
the value of stock meese held in telephone companies 
meese probably was guilty of a misdemeanor in failing to pay 
on time the taxes due on the omitted capital gain 
meese claims the report vindicates him because of the 
decision against prosecution it does no such thing

so what if dukakis will never slam dunk anything more than a 
soda can in a trash bin nikita khrushchev was no taller than a 
samovar and he was twice as round as he was tall 
as far as presidential decorum try to imagine dukakis taking a 
shoe off in a public place say the united nations 
the dukes bushy eyebrows are manicured putting greens compared 
to the shaggy tundra that leonid breshnev used to pack around 
pravda did credit dukakis with brains and management skills and 
noted he sounded better than the raspy voice of george bush his

lest the voting booth be mistaken for a kissing booth the 
embrace ought to be peeled back to see if intrigue or substance 
lies beneath 
jackson definitely touches a live wire running through the 
electorate dukakis would be wise to tap a few of its populist 
kilowatts but wiser to recognize the jackson base than merely the 
reverend himself 
the jacksondukakis spat began with the choice of texas sen 
lloyd bentsen as the vicepresidential nominee a choice made 
earlier than usual 
in keeping with that trend dukakis could begin to reach the

congress inched forward on the politically 
potent child care issue wednesday when a senate committee approved 
a 25 billion initiative designed to expand and improve day care 
the senate labor and human resources committee approved the act 
for better child care services or abc bill on a voice vote with 
no audible opposition 
but the vote followed a pledge by committee democrats the major 
force behind the bill to try to work out a bipartisan version of 
abc before it reaches the senate floor 
sen orrin hatch rutah sponsor of a less expensive rival 
child care bill called for the bipartisan cooperation after 
declaring that were just playing politics he urged committee 
members to approve the abc bill and then well sit down and work 
this thing out and do whats right for families and children 
abc proponents agreed to talks but made no promises 
hes laid open a very interesting challenge said committee 
chairman edward kennedy dmass whether were going to be able 
to meet it or not is a real question 
he has my commitment for a solid goodfaith effort said 
sen christopher dodd dconn chief sponsor of the abc bill 
im hopeful we can do something maybe we wont be able to 
threequarters of the money under the abc bill would help 
families making less than 100 percent of a states median income 
pay for child care the remainder would go to states for capital 
improvements to day care centers and homes staff training staff 
salaries and administrative costs 
a national advisory committee would develop minimum safety and 
staffing standards which states would have to adopt and only homes 
and centers conforming to the standards would be eligible for the 
federal money 
some democrats would prefer that the abc bill be passed intact 
reasoning that a presidential veto could only help their candidates 
on the campaign trail this fall hatch and other republicans are 
seeking a more modest bipartisan bill that gop candidates can tout 
in an election season colored by family concerns 
hatch complained that the abc bill would cost an enormous amount 
but wouldnt do much to ease the national day care shortage he 
said abc would subsidize only 700000 day care slots while 
california alone needs 1 million 
hatchs own bill one of a dozen proposals pending on capitol 
hill would provide 250 million to states to expand or improve 
care including aid to poor families 100 million for liability 
pools and 25 million for capital improvements states would have 
to develop and adopt their own standards businesses would receive 
tax breaks for starting day care centers 
if the abc bill reaches the senate floor in its present form 
hatch said he would offer three to four weeks worth of amendments 
because there are that many criticisms that can be lodged 
against it 
sen dan quayle rind said the most efficient way to get 
child care money to people who need it would be through tax 
credits as in several pending bills and the plan proposed this 
week by vice president george bush 
but kennedy dodd and others said a tax credit wouldnt help 
improve day care quality nor would it be of sufficient help to the 
neediest they said day care costs an average of 3000 a year per 
child far more than the credits being proposed and the credits 
would only arrive once a year during tax refund season after 
families had already laid out money for child care 
the house education and labor committee canceled a work session 
wednesday on its similar version of the abc bill the house measure 
is mired in controversy over whether federal money should be 
available to the substantial number of day care programs affiliated 
with churches or synagogues 
the committee tentatively rescheduled the work session for next 
wednesday 
both the senate and house abc bills have been rephrased to make 
sure that such programs are eligible for federal money as long as 
it is not used for religious instruction 
the american civil liberties union and other groups contend the 
provision violates the constitutional wall between church and state

a drought ravaging large tracts of 
central and eastern china is killing farm animals and shriveling 
crops and officials fear that mountain villagers could be starving 
by autumn 
my fields are bare my cotton and lotus roots are dead this 
year we wont even have a fen penny its time to live on wheat 
and sweet potatoes said chen xuelian a 39yearold farmer and 
father of two from xiangfan a town in northeastern hubei province 
a trip this week through four counties in hubei and the province 
of henan revealed bonedry reservoirs parched rice paddies 
stunted cotton and sesame fields and corn that had died on the 
stalk 
wells for drinking water contained nothing but mud many rivers 
had run dry 
in a hubei village all the vegetable fields had been abandoned 
baked by the sun into an earthen jigsaw puzzle peasants said they 
would eat only grain this year 
in another a water buffalo went through its death throes 
villagers said the beast died from thirst 
a mile away from chens fields wang hua was selling her paltry 
harvest of watermelons on a country road the melons were the size 
of baseballs and tasteless 
some of my relatives have already gone to the city for work 
she said if theres no work theyll just ave to beg 
officials in xiangfan and wuhan provincial capital of hubei 
said the drought was the worst in 50 years in the town of fang 
xian historians reported that not since 1578 in the ming dynasty 
had their town seen such a blight 
peasants have dubbed the droughtstricken area han baozi or 
the dried bun the chinese equivalent to the dust bowl in the 
united states 
official chinese reports say the drought began in may and has 
hit eight out of chinas 30 provinces 
in some areas such as hubei henan anhui and jiangsu 
provinces however the disaster began in february soon after the 
chinese new year or the spring festival 
since the spring festival we havent had one good rain 
said tao weile secretary of the communist party in the hubei 
village of shiqiaozhen since may 28 all together its rained 
for 10 minutes 
officials in wuhan said 3 million out of the provinces 55 
million people were having problems getting drinking water 
newspapers say millions in anhui henan and jiangsu provinces are 
without potable water 
hubei officials reported damage to rice vegetable and cash 
crops in all about half of the provinces 9 million acres of 
agricultural land has been hurt by the drought they said 
about 70 percent of the peanut and sesame seed crop has been 
destroyed they said and out of the 23 million acres of rice 
planted the drought has affected half they said at least 25 
percent of the crop was expected to be demolished 
other provinces have reported difficulties on a similar scale 
according to the official press 
the problem here is that the drought has lasted for such a 
long time the peasants in some areas have planted their fields 
three times but once they get a bud it dies said zeng fanrong 
spokesman for hubeis water conservancy bureau 
both zeng and fu qiuzhen a spokeswoman for hubeis agriculture 
and husbandry bureau said they were worried that starvation would 
hit areas of northern hubei province other officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity expressed similar fears about henan and 
anhui provinces 
right now the key goal of the province is to ensure that 
everybody has enough to eat ms fu said we are struggling to 
provide the basic necessities 
to fight the drought officials in wuhan and xiangfan said work 
teams had been sent to affected areas to dig wells and carry water 
in buckets to the parched fields and trucks carrying drinking 
water have been sent to hardhit areas 
pumps and electrical generators have been sent to the 
countryside to help transport water from the few reservoirs that 
arent dried up 
officials in xiangfan said peasants who are unable to produce 
sufficient grain to meet contracts set with the state will be 
relieved of the burden so they can concentrate on growing enough 
food to eat 
under the agricultural reforms that have occurred in the last 
decade peasants contract with the state each year to produce a 
certain amount of grain anything they produce above the quota 
they can keep or sell on the free market vegetables and cash 
crops such as tobacco can all be sold on the market 
xiangfan officials also reported that factories and other work 
units had sent old clothes and cans of food to the droughtstricken 
areas

taxpayers would provide an estimated 150 
million in disaster payments to tobacco growers under pending 
droughtrelief legislation a policy departure already drawing fire 
from antismoking forces 
this is a step out of line with the ordinary nonetcost 
program of price supports for tobacco but its because of the 
special situation of the drought said rep charles rose dnc 
chairman of the house tobacco and peanuts subcommittee 
i certainly think its a bad idea said john f banzhaf iii 
director of action on smoking and health one of the nations major 
antismoking organizations 
to be providing 150 million because a crop that kills people 
is damaged and spending less than 1 percent of that on educating 
people about the hazards about tobacco is really an example of 
having priorities upside down banzhaf said 
rose said the provision was in no way an effort to bypass the 
normal economic operation of the tobacco program in which no tax 
money outside of administrative costs is supposed to be used for 
price supports 
under 1983 farm legislation tobacco lawmakers agreed to a 
provision requiring growers to finance their pricesupport system 
themselves in contrast to other farmers who receive government 
subsidies the law which remains in effect forbids the use of 
taxpayers money for tobacco price supports except for 15 million 
in administrative costs 
this nonetcost compromise with antismoking forces has 
been the focus of a series of controversies since then 
antismoking forces contend that a complex 1986 law enabled the 
agriculture department to arrange a 1 billion taxpayerfinanced 
bailout of the tobacco pricesupport system without violating the 
letter of the law 
rose an outspoken house champion of tobacco growers was able 
to incorporate language into the drought relief bill that seeks to 
make clear that the envisioned disaster payments for growers are 
not a violation of the nonetcost agreement because they are not 
actually price supports 
in the last major drought that hit american farmers in 1983 
there were no disaster payments for tobacco growers even though 
the crop of burley tobacco produced primarily in kentucky and 
tennessee was badly damaged by sun and a shortage of rainfall 
but the disaster that befell the 1983 crop was followed by the 
1986 bailout legislation that antismoking forces say violated the 
spirit if not the letter of the nonetcost agreement 
an effort last year by sen jesse helms rnc to allow 
tobacco exporters to benefit from a 15 billion export enhancement 
subsidy program by attaching a special provision to the omnibus 
trade bill was defeated after antismoking forces complained they 
also oppose the current provision 
there is no way to know precisely how much of the 6 billion 
drought bill would be devoted to tobacco payments because the 
extent of damage to the crop is not yet known but house 
agriculture committee staff economist howard conley told lawmakers 
in a note of 16 billion in payments for nonprogram crops 
some 150 million can be imputed to tobacco 
the drought bill has been moving through congress at high speed 
the house version of the measure cleared its committee hurdle on 
wednesday and is floor passage is expected by the end of the week 
the senate is also planning to act on the legislation before the 
weekend 
farm lawmakers from both houses said they are aiming to meet in 
a conference committee next week to fashion the finished product 
and send it to president reagans desk before they go on their 
summer recess aug 11 
a number of lawmakers who usually are critics of farm programs 
said that they were not familiar enough with the legislation to 
make a judgment on its provisions they indicated they had not 
heard of the tobacco provision 
rep edward r madigan rill the ranking republican on the 
agriculture committee said that when you are doing something 
like this you cannot discriminate against any crop 
asked if he considered it a violation of an agreement he said 
no 
but he also noted that under a 1985 law farmers must have 
purchased federal crop insurance to be eligible for disaster 
payments but that provision has been waived under the drought bill 
so thats a violation he said there are a lot of 
violations of agreements and previous understandings that are 
brought about by the circumstances its an agreement until the 
circumstances change 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt 
said he did not want to address the tobacco subsidies issue in the 
midst of the drought but vowed to speak out on the question in 
1990 when the next farm program is drawn up by congress 
asked if he considered the topic of tobacco subsidies a 
particularly touchy one on the senate agriculture committee leahy 
said i certainly dont think it should be off limits any more 
than any other subject should be off limits

a woman who tried to kill a cocktail 
waitress in 1980 to divert suspicion from the hillside strangler 
escaped from prison by cutting through four fences with pruning 
shears an investigator said today 
veronica lynn compton 31 broke out of the washington 
corrections center for women about sundown tuesday along with a 
woman serving time for drug offenses candice l burk 28 said 
pierce county sheriffs sgt tom miner 
their trail led through dense brush to a highway where a 
tracking dog lost the scent miner said there were no immediate 
clues to whether the pair had outside help he added 
ms compton was convicted in 1981 of trying to strangle kim 
breed 26 in a bellingham motel so authorities would think the 
hillside strangler who killed 10 women in los angeles and two in 
bellingham was still at large 
ms compton had said she was in love with kenneth bianchi who 
pleaded guilty to the slayings of two college students in 
bellingham and to five of the los angeles killings authorities 
said she became enamored of him after his arrest 
bianchi is serving seven consecutive life sentences at the 
washington state penitentiary near walla walla 
prosecutors said ms compton planned to kill ms breed in a 
fashion similar to the hillside strangler slayings but that ms 
breed escaped 
ms compton was serving a life sentence for attempted murder 
ms burk was serving time for drug manufacture and possession 
officials said 
veltry johnson a state corrections department spokesman said 
both were in medium security before being reported missing at a 
head count ms burk was due for release next tuesday but the 
state of oregon was seeking her in a previous escape on which 
johnson had no details 
miner said the pair cut through four cyclone fences each 10 
feet to 12 feet high and topped with barbed wire 
investigators believe pruning shears were used in the escape 
tools assigned to ms burks and ms comptons unit were missing 
miner said 
where they cut them theres no way anybody would see them 
unless they were making a special patrol he said theres no 
surveillance in that area

foreign minister tariq aziz of iraq today 
met with the secretarygeneral but said his country will not 
declare a ceasefire in the persian gulf war until direct talks are 
held with iranian officials 
iraq shall not be stampeded into making a hasty step under the 
present circumstances aziz said as he entered un headquarters 
for a meeting with secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
we believe the first step and starter of constructive talks is 
facetoface negotiations between the two parties under the 
auspices of the secretarygeneral he said 
if iran does not accept that formula it means they are not 
sincere about peace aziz said he said iraq wants to be sure 
that we are making real durable and comprehensive peace to end 
the 8yearold war 
as he spoke heavy fighting between iran and iraq was reported 
iran said its forces drove iraqi troops out of southern iran and 
fought iraq for control of a town in western iran tehran claimed 
1200 iraqis were killed or wounded 
iraq claimed its forces shot down an iranian f5 warplane over 
the southern front iran said its military shot down two iraqi 
warplanes 
the tough stand by aziz who requested the current round of 
ceasefire talks could signal difficult going in the negotiations 
iran has opposed direct talks but has left the door open to 
possible direct contacts if requested by the secretarygeneral the 
un chief said the talks initially would be separate and he would 
mediate between the two sides 
but he said he preferred direct talks and may request them later 
perez de cuellar said today he hoped to be able to announce the 
date for a ceasefire next week along with other dates for 
implementation of a un peace plan to end the war 
he also said he would raise the issue of foreign hostages held 
by a proiranian faction in lebanon i think they may assert 
their possible influence in order to have this problem out of the 
way for both humanitarian and political reason perez de cuellar 
said nine americans are among the hostages 
aziz held a first round of talks this morning for one hour at 
the secretarygenerals residence near the united nations the 
secretarygenerals spokesman francois giuliani said the 
unannounced meeting was held at perez de cuellars residence for 
convenience 
aziz and perez de cuellar then held a second meeting at un 
headquarters 
on tuesday irans foreign minister accused iraq of trying to 
sabotage peace efforts with attacks he said involved the use of 
chemical weapons 
we said to perez de cuellar that if the iraqis continue 
their attack we will give them a lesson that they wont forget 
the iranian minister ali akbar velayati said after twice meeting 
with the un chief 
velayati also was to meet today with perez de cuellar 
velayati said he discussed with perez de cueller a timetable for 
implementing the yearold un ceasefire plan iran agreed to 
accept last week 
we also talked about the recent escalation of the war on our 
border with the iraqis he said 
perez de cuellar said he dispensed with formalities and began 
peace talks tuesday one day ahead of schedule because velayati 
had already arrived 
velayati and perez de cuellar discussed implementation of 
security council resolution 598 which was passed unanimously on 
july 20 1987 and demands an immediate ceasefire in the iraniraq 
war 
the plan also calls for withdrawal to internationally recognized 
borders prisoner exchanges peace negotiations and an 
investigation to determine which side started the war 
iraq quickly accepted the resolution last year irans 
announcement of acceptance came after a string of battlefield 
defeats that began in the spring 
before meeting the secretarygeneral velayati told reporters 
that iraq was trying to sabotage the peace process by in the past 
week invading iran and using chemical weapons in a large scale 
the war is still going on very seriously he said despite 
iraqs claim it was withdrawing from all iranian territory after a 
weekend offensive 
velayati said his talks with perez de cuellar were 
constructive and covered the steps to carry out a truce and 
peace plan 
meanwhile two un teams were at work in tehran one laboring 
over truce details the other inquiring into the prisonerofwar 
situation the ceasefire would be monitored and supervised by 
about 250 un peacekeeping troops

hundreds of firefighters battled a fastmoving wildfire today 
that forced 500 south dakotans from their homes while crews at 
yellowstone national park fought the worst forest fire outbreak 
there since the late 1800s 
as the fire passes one area the engines are moving ahead and 
trying to get ahead fire spokesman corbin newman said of the 
blaze that destroyed four homes and damaged four others in rural 
subdivisions west of rapid city sd 
the fires fueled by drought were among blazes burning in eight 
western and midwestern states where tens of thousands of acres of 
forest brush and meadow have gone up in smoke the other states 
with major fires are alaska arizona oregon utah washington and 
idaho where a 1500acre blaze forced two dozen people from their 
homes 
interior secretary donald hodel planned a helicopter tour of 
yellowstone for this afternoon to survey the devastation in 
americas oldest national park 
hodel was to visit yellowstones grant village section scene of 
some of this weeks heaviest firefighting 
firefighters also kept watch on a 6000acre blaze burning six 
to 10 miles west of old faithful the blaze posed no immediate 
threat to the famed geyser but officials planned to use 
helicopters today to start backfires with a napalmlike substance 
to slow its advance 
the fire in rapid city was reported tuesday afternoon and 
rapidly consumed 1800 acres of forest and meadow in the 
southwestern south dakota area thats home to 90000 people 
there were areas where you might have a hundred acres go up at 
once said rich homann another fire spokesman 
one firefighter was treated for burns to the neck a firefighter 
and a resident suffered smoke inhalation and another resident was 
hurt in a smokecaused traffic accident but none of the injuries 
was serious newman said the fire also burned four vehicles and 
destroyed a bridge 
crews made progress overnight and more than 500 firefighters 
were on the scene this morning fire officials said 
four helicopters and an airplane dropped water and fire 
retardant to protect homes 
by early today the fire was 50 percent contained despite light 
wind newman said 
the problem with a fire this size and this severe is that it 
creates its own weather to some degree it creates its own wind by 
sucking in oxygen he said 
to make matters worse winds were expected to pick up today 
temperatures were expected to reach almost 90 degrees and no rain 
was forecast 
most of the evacuees in rapid city found lodging with friends 
and relatives said lyle baker of the american red cross about 60 
families responded to a red cross appeal for people to open their 
homes to evacuees baker said 
were spending more time now coordinating between family 
members to let people know where theyre staying he said some 
family members were separated in the confusion of the evacuation 
at yellowstone about 500 firefighters remained on the lines 
near grant village a camping and store complex about 15 miles 
southeast of old faithful that was evacuated last weekend fire 
also closed the road from the village to the parks southern 
entrance and closed the lewis lake campground 
it was expected to take a couple more days to finish off the 
10000acre grant village blaze said joan anzelmo a park 
spokeswoman 
the fire is the only one of 13 fires being actively fought 
within park boundaries two fires straddling the park and adjacent 
national forests are being suppressed from the forest side only 
officials said 
park policy is to fight natural forest fires only if they 
threaten people or structures 
in all about 83000 of yellowstones 22 million acres have 
been blackened unusually hot dry conditions this summer have left 
yellowstone and the rest of northwestern wyoming tinderbox dry 
the last time they had this much fire in the park was in the 
late 1800s said larry caplinger a forest service official 
coordinating firefighting

a man who telephoned his exgirlfriend as many as 
100 times an hour and rammed her car from behind was given 
probation and ordered to stop bothering her after he pleaded guilty 
to a felony retaliation charge 
undeterred by her repeated rejections david eric herd 23 
called the 25yearold receptionist at home and work continuously 
between july and september 1987 
i tried to do it to break up gently but he wouldnt let 
me the woman said tuesday 
after prosecutors dropped two misdemeanor harassment charges 
herd pleaded guilty to retaliation in an aug 20 1987 incident in 
which he followed the woman and began bumping the back of her car 
when she got out he threw her to the ground prosecutor jim 
west said a passerby ended the fracas by spraying herd with the 
womans can of chemical deterrent 
state district judge bob burdette ordered herd to undergo 
psychiatric treatment and have no further contact with the woman or 
her family herd also received two years of probation called 
deferred adjudication meaning that if he completes his sentence he 
could emerge with no final conviction 
prosecutors likened the case to the movie fatal attraction 
in which an obsessive woman refuses to let a man end a brief affair 
but herds lawyer robert hirschhorn of galveston said this 
isnt fatal attraction this is modern romances 
he said the victim helped herd post bond on the first harassment 
case and even spent time with him just before the aug 20 incident

an excongressman has lost a 18 million 
defamation lawsuit against a portland newspaper that published a 
story about the way he handled campaign funds 
former rep jim weaver dore sued the oregonian publishing 
co and a national republican congressional committee lawyer 
following a 1986 article in the oregonian questioning weavers 
handling of more than 81900 of campaign funds 
us district judge malcolm f marsh on friday granted a 
pretrial judgment in favor of the publishing company which said 
weaver could not seek damages because the first amendment protects 
neutral and accurate republication of serious charges against a 
public figure 
weaver contended in the lawsuit that publication of the 
allegations about the campaign money had contributed to his 
withdrawal from a us senate race against incumbent bob packwood 
in 1986 
the oregonian article was based on a report prepared by benjamin 
ginsberg an attorney for the republican committee weaver 
contended that four statements about alleged mingling of funds and 
alleged violations of reporting sections of federal election law 
had damaged his reputation 
in a written opinion marsh said one of the alleged defamatory 
statements was an accurate paraphrase of ginsbergs report and 
the remaining three were direct quotations from the report 
weaver voluntarily dismissed ginsberg as a defendant 
david c force a eugene lawyer representing weaver said he 
could not comment on the ruling because weaver had not seen it

a judge who got into an argument with an 
attorney over use of her maiden name in court has been sued by the 
attorneys client who believes he lost his racial discrimination 
case because of the controversy 
charles gavin said in a complaint filed monday in federal court 
that senior us district judge hubert teitelbaum politicized a 
sixmember jury when he initiated the argument with attorney 
barbara wolvovitz 
the suit said teitelbaum shouted at wolvovitz when the 
controversy erupted july 8 and threatened her with jail if she 
refused to use her husbands surname and the courtesy title 
mrs in his courtroom 
gavin 43 said teitelbaum tampered with the jury by polling 
them on the issue and prejudiced them against his case after the 
outburst gavin said the jury belonged to the judge 
the jury eventually decided ppg industries inc had not 
discriminated against gavin and another complainant william 
sutton 33 gavin and sutton have appealed saying their case got 
lost in the shuffle of the ms vs mrs controversy 
teitelbaum eventually said he would refer to wolvowitz as 
counselor and apologized for his remarks after the case went to the 
jury 
a secretary in teitelbaums office said wednesday the judge 
would not comment on the latest suit 
gavin who said he is serving as his own attorney because he can 
no longer afford legal help asked for a finding that his civil 
rights were violated and for more than 10000 in damages he said 
he is aware that suits against judges are rarely successful 
robert cindrich a former us attorney noted that in 
general federal judges enjoy immunity from civil suit 
particularly from suits arising out of their judicial function

george bush in an unusual step plans to go 
to new orleans one week before the republican national convention 
to address the partys platform committee and put his stamp of 
approval on the platform a campaign official said today 
bush facing a deadline in three weeks is also stepping up his 
search for a running mate asking candidates if theyre interested 
in being considered and planning to use polling to determine the 
popularity of different people 
the convention opens in new orleans on aug 15 and bush isnt 
scheduled to arrive that week until aug 17 the nexttolast day 
of the gathering however deputy press secretary alixe glen said 
today he will make a oneday trip to the convention city on aug 8 
for the platform meeting 
bushs list of possible running mates was expanded tuesday when 
gov john sununu of new hampshire said he had received 
questionnaire forms that bush is using in his search bush already 
had said that senate minority leader bob dole of kansas would be 
among those considered 
a bush campaign official said the staff was contacting various 
people to see if they wanted to be considered 
preliminary interest is being ascertained i think youre safe 
to assume its more than john sununu the official said 
insisting on anonymity and refusing to identify who else was being 
contacted 
within republican circles other people considered as likely 
candidates include rep jack kemp of new york and california gov 
george deukmejian even though he has said he is not interested in 
the job 
washington lawyer robert m kimmitt has been asked to begin 
background checks on several potential vice presidential picks the 
washington post reported in todays editions 
bush told the newspaper that kimmitt will report directly to him 
rather than the campaign staff to better maintain confidentiality 
in the information provided by the prospective running mates 
rep lynn martin rill cochairwoman of bushs campaign 
committee said its clear that some women are being considered 
one of the nicest surprises for me is hearing many 
conservative members of my party talking about a woman on the 
ticket as a good idea said the congresswoman whose name has 
appeared on some public lists of possible running mates 
she said other strong candidates include former transportation 
secretary elizabeth dole sen nancy kassebaum of kansas former 
un ambassador jeane kirkpatrick and nebraska gov kay orr 
however rep martin said the selection of a woman was 
possible not probable 
bush certain to be the republican presidential nominee has 
said he wants to keep his running mate a secret until the 
republican national convention which opens aug 15 in new orleans 
sheila tate bushs campaign spokeswoman said the vice 
president has expressed an interest in selective polling being 
done as one aspect of the process for winnowing names 
the polling has not started she added 
despite the public speculation about his running mate bush 
trained his public focus on another subject tuesday delivering a 
speech at the library of congress before congressional interns 
about the ethical standards he would set if elected president 
he said congress should be covered by the same 
conflictofinterest laws that govern federal officials and that 
civil penalities as well as criminal sanctions should be used to 
punish violators 
bush said that under the current system an official is charged 
either with a felony or nothing at all this is plainly 
unacceptable the vice president said 
breaking with the reagan administration bush also endorsed the 
use of independent counsels to investigate wrongdoing by federal 
officials and said congress should come under the same law 
to exempt congress from any of these rules as does current 
conflictofinterest law is to establish a double standard that 
breeds suspicion breeds cynicism and in my judgment breeds 
abuse he said no one no institution no body of government 
should be above the law 
in boston democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
criticized bush for taking a donothing approach to attorney 
general edwin meeses legal difficulties in his speech bush said 
he wasnt going to comment on matters surrounding meese as well as 
house speaker jim wright dtexas the subject of an ethics 
investigation 
bush said the current system of federal ethics law is a 
confused quiltwork of executive policy statements administrative 
regulations criminal law in my administration the code of 
conduct will be clear and uniform 
it will reflect common sense the vice president said 
nothing will be overly technical what is intuitively right 
what your conscience tells you will invariably be the written 
rule 
bush said that the threshold for judging ethic conduct in 
government is not and should not and will not be whether an 
appointee has committed a criminal offense but whether that 
individual has exercised honest unbiased judgment and scrupulously 
avoided any appearance of impropriety of conflict of interest 
bush said he would create a white house ethics office headed by 
a senior counselor to the president whose first responsibility 
would be ethics he said the office would complement the work 
already done by the office of government ethics an executive 
branch agency

ousted philippines president ferdinand marcos 
and his wife imelda spent the night in hiding after their 
security guards reported armed men cruised past the marcos estate 
a spokesman said 
in the philippines government spokesman teodoro benigno said 
today he didnt know anything about the report of gunmen and didnt 
want to comment because one of the worlds master illusionists is 
at work 
three cars drove slowly past the house at about 530 am 
tuesday and security guards stationed at the gate of the sprawling 
hillside home said they saw guns sticking out the car windows said 
marcos spokesman gemmo trinidad 
the unarmed guards who were on foot chased the cars but could 
not get a good description because it was still dark he said no 
shots were fired 
the marcoses were awakened shortly after the incident and driven 
to a site on oahu said trinidad 
they went to a friends house he said theyre still on 
oahu and theyll come back as soon as its safe 
a honolulu police dispatcher said the incident was not reported 
but top marcos aide arturo aruiza said police were asked tuesday to 
patrol the marcos address regularly 
trinidad said marcos entourage had received a threatening call 
and letter last month warning us that something untoward will 
happen to us 
aruiza said the marcos household had been warned tuesday of a 
plot to kill marcos 
security around the house was increased and the marcoses were 
expected to return home today aruiza said 
the couple have lived in exile in honolulu since 1986 when 
marcos was ousted as president of the philippines by corazon aquino 
marcos has been negotiating his return to his homeland but in a 
statement issued by a spokesman tuesday he denied a published 
report that he had offered to pay the philippine government 5 
billion to ensure his return free from criminal prosecution on 
fraud allegations 
marcos family members and associates are alleged to have looted 
the philippine treasury of up to 10 billion during his 20 years in 
office sinking the money into businesses real estate bank 
accounts art and other holdings 
the village voice in new york city reported earlier this month 
that us attorney rudolph giuliani recommended marcos and his wife 
be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with real 
estate holdings in new york 
the white house said it could not confirm the report

hours after sri lanka and india signed 
an accord aimed at ending this nations tamil ethnic war indian 
air force planes began ferrying troops to the tamildominated north 
a year later 50000 soldiers of the indian army still are 
deployed in sri lanka 
the tamil war goes on into its sixth year with the death toll 
at more than 8000 
resentment against indian troops grows among tamils civilians 
who first saw the foreign soldiers as protectors but who now say 
they have not done their job 
anger at the peace accord among the majority sinhalese has 
spawned yet another revolt and more violence and both sinhalese 
and tamils are questioning the accord 
sinhalese ire was apparent even before president junius r 
jayewardene and indian prime minister rajiv gandhi signed the 
accord on july 29 1987 
rioting erupted a day earlier in the capital and more than 70 
people were killed when police opened fire to control sinhalese 
mobs many sinhalese complained that the accord went too far in 
giving the minority tamils what they wanted a separate homeland 
in the islands north and east 
the idea of the peace accord was that sri lanka would grant 
limited autonomy to the tamils in those areas in return for the 
tamil fighters putting down their weapons 
india sir lankas northern neighbor with a large tamil 
population of its own agreed to guarantee the pact by disarming 
tamil rebels and protecting tamil civilians from revenge by the 
sinhalese 
it didnt work out that way velupillai prabhakaran leader of 
the largest tamil militia said the accord was forced on him by 
powerful india which sits just 30 miles from sri lanka and he 
rejected it 
by october prabhakarans liberation tigers of tamil eelam were 
fighting the indian army about 2500 tiger guerrillas and at least 
500 indian soldiers have been killed 
a leading sinhalese government minister gamini dissanayake 
surprised many in sri lanka last week when he accused india of not 
fulfilling its role dissanayake is viewed as the prime mover 
behind the treaty 
it is the responsibility of india to see that the liberation 
tigers are totally disarmed the lands minister told a panel 
discussion the indian army has not performed its job 
gandhi and indian foreign minister pv narasimha rao told their 
parliament on wednesday that the troops will not leave until the 
tamils are disarmed 
in the islands sinhalesepopulated south meanwhile a 
sinhalese nationalist group the peoples liberation front has 
killed more than 400 people since the accord was signed 
most victims were minor figures in jayewardenes united national 
party the front has vowed to kill any supporters of the government 
and its peace accord 
security was strengthened at the indian high commission and 
diplomatic residence on wednesday after threats from the group 
according to a commission official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
indian forces have been put on alert for possible violence to 
mark the first anniversary of the accord residents in 
tamildominated regions said indian troops imposed a curfew 
starting at 6 pm wednesday 
sirimavo bandaranaike leader of the opposition sri lankan 
freedom party says the accord has fostered southern terrorism 
others say mrs bandaranaikes party the largest opposition 
group has fueled sinhalese anger by opposing the peace accord as a 
tactic to win parliamentary elections expected later this year 
a leading freedom party member anil moonesinghe said last week 
that the treaty should be abrogated 
the 1yearold indolanka accord has not brought peace it has 
brought misery bloodshed tears and destruction to this country 
moonesinghe said 
a tamil member of jayewardenes government also told the 
associated press it may be time to reconsider the accord 
now that one year has elapsed and since the accord has not 
done as anticipated it is time for both governments to take 
realities into account said savumiamoorthy thonadman the rural 
development minister the accord does not satisfy tamils

a federal export program is boosting sales of 
chicken to japan where retailers traditionally have bought 
lowquality us product in large quantities for the low end of the 
market an agriculture department official said wednesday 
branded promotion of frozen chicken from the united states 
under our targeted export assistance program is turning this 
situation around said thomas o kay administrator of the 
foreign agricultural service 
the product is clean packaging is attractive and our exports 
of chicken to japan have risen 10 percent in the past year 
kay was arguing in testimony prepared for a congressional 
hearing against the contention of the general accounting office 
that us government promotion of branded products such as chicken 
and wine gives some companies a potentially unfair advantage the 
gao watches over government spending for congress 
the program it criticized will spend 325 million a year 
beginning in october up from 110 million this year 
you wouldnt dream of buying a bottle of generic wine kay 
said 
effective promotion of us wine in a foreign market means 
getting a wide range of individual labels and classes of wine 
established in the local trade 
allen i mendelowitz an official of the general accounting 
office said the program has been credited with boosting exports of 
wine to japan by 56 percent in the first half of this year but he 
said other causes for the increased sales including the drop in 
the price of the dollar have to be taken into account 
kay said the 12country european economic community dominates 
world trade in processed foods 
the ec has won its dominance of the market through a 
comprehensive barriers and processing and export subsidies he 
said 
the targeted export assistance program has given us a way to 
begin to challenge that dominance 
both men testified before the house agriculture subcommittee on 
foreign agriculture

a new test reveals that most miscarriages happen 
during the first month of pregnancy long before women even realize 
that conception has occurred 
we can say that the majority of early pregnancy loss appears 
to be unrecognized said dr allen j wilcox who directed the 
study 
his work suggests that 22 percent of all pregnancies end 
spontaneously in the first month before women know they are 
pregnant another 9 percent result in miscarriages after the 
pregnancy becomes apparent 
the study confirmed what many scientists have long suspected 
the female body discards a large portion of its fetuses in the 
first month or so after conception 
wilcox said the body probably rejects fetuses because they are 
defective when researchers study later miscarriages in which fetal 
tissue is recovered they find that half show gross genetic 
abnormalities 
its reasonable to speculate that the same would be true in 
these very early losses wilcox said 
the study found that 31 percent of all pregnancies ended before 
birth but the true rate of miscarriage is probably even higher 
since the test missed miscarriages during the first week after 
conception 
an editorial published with the study in the thursday issue of 
the new england journal of medicine speculates that half of all 
pregnancies may end in miscarriage 
wilcox a researcher at the national institute of environmental 
health sciences in research triangle park nc based his findings 
on a newly available test that spots a pregnancy hormone 
the study was conducted on 221 healthy young women who had 
decided to stop using birth control and get pregnant the 
researchers collected urine and checked it for traces of human 
chorionic gonadotropin a hormone produced by the fetus 
this substance shows up in a womans urine when the fetus 
attaches itself to the wall of her uterus usually about a week 
after conception 
wilcox noted that many physicians tell women to resume birth 
control and let their uteruses rest for a few months after a 
miscarriage but he said this may not be necessary at least after 
very early pregnancy losses 
wilcox said the miscarriages did not mean that a woman could not 
have children and almost all of those who had unrecognized 
miscarriages were able to get pregnant again within two years 
dr a brian little of royal victoria hospital in montreal who 
wrote the editorial said in an interview that there are many 
exciting things about the study 
he said the test which is not yet commercially available may 
allow doctors to pinpoint more accurately the causes of 
infertility for instance if the test shows that infertile women 
are having early miscarriages it will help rule out several 
possible reasons for their problems 
little said the test should also help doctors check on the 
progress of test tube or in vitro fertilizations

offers to return to his post for another term party officials said 
one of prems closest supporters chatichai choonhavan agreed 
to take the job the leaders of the five parties agreed that they 
would nominate me as prime minister and i accept he told 
reporters 
chatichai 66 who serves as acting deputy prime minister heads 
the thai nation party which won the most votes in sundays general 
election 
earlier today chatichai a retired army major general and a 
wealthy businessman said he supported prem for prime minister 
although the five coalition parties hold 215 of the 357 seats in 
the lower house of parliament more lobbying may take place before 
chatichais name is submitted to constitutional monarch bhumibol 
adulyadej for approval 
in the past thailands powerful military and senior bureaucrats 
were also said to have been involved in the final choice of the 
countrys leader 
the other four parties in the coalition are the democrat party

democracy party 
the announcement that prem turned down another term as prime 
minister was made earlier today by col sanan kachornprasat 
secretary general of the democrat party prem said he wont 
accept it citing personal reasons sanan said he has upheld 
democracy for eight years and five months 
the announcement came after leaders and senior officials of five 
political parties met at prems house to offer him the post the 
five parties had agreed to form a coalition government to be headed 
by prem following the elections 
prem a 67yearold former army commander called the elections 
24 months early after dissolving parliament disbanding his 
factionridden coalition government and nullifying a noconfidence 
motion from the opposition

ministerial candidate who does not have to be a member of 
parliament prem for instance does not hold an elective office

with prem today 3000 students marched to his house protesting the 
naming of a prime minister who had not been elected by the people

president reagan and hungarian communist party 
leader karoly grosz agreed today that overhauling of hungarys 
economy must be accompanied by political reforms 
we have been impressed with your openness to new ideas 
reagan told grosz in a formal departure statement after the two 
leaders held a brief private meeting and then had lunch 
we are encouraged by your recognition that economic reforms 
cannot succeed unless acompanied by political reforms as well 
the president said 
he added that decisions to be made by grosz government in the 
coming months will set the direction of hungarys development 
over the next decade 
grosz replying to the presidents remarks said hungary will 
reorganize its economy and added this can only be done we are 
aware if the citizens will enjoy more rights more freedoms 
therefore we are modernizing our political system and our 
political practices he said 
grosz spoke through an interpreter 
a senior administration official speaking on condition he not 
be identified said the two leaders did not discuss the question of 
possible withdrawal of the 65000 soviet troops based in hungary 
several weeks ago state department officials had received 
increasing indications that a soviet military retreat from its 
warsaw pact ally was likely 
grosz told a national press club gathering on tuesday that any 
soviet troop pullback from hungary would have to be part of general 
scaling down of nato and warsaw pact forces in central europe 
as grosz began his official talks here the troop issue was 
expected to occupy only a small part of his visit as both sides 
were hoping to stress his efforts to make hungary more open 
economically and politically 
the visit is the first ever by a hungarian party leader since 
the country came under communist rule 40 years ago grosz became 
premier a year ago and was named party chief in may 
the united states has better relations with hungary than any 
other east european country and us officials expect groszs visit 
will reinforce those ties 
grosz is likely to emphasize his plans for revitalizing 
hungarys economy through an ambitious reform program that includes 
closer trade and investment ties with western countries 
we will open hungary to both foreign and hungarian capital 
grosz said tuesday adding that he wishes to modernize the 
countrys political structure as well 
grosz is expected to seek improved hungarian access to us 
markets during his visit 
on tuesday he said that economic and political reform must be 
carried out jointly because the two are dependent on one another 
the two processes must be fitted together he said 
but he indicated political reform has to be carried out within 
the framework of hungarys one party state 
grosz indicated that it would be a mistake to focus excessively 
on the soviet invasion of hungary in 1956 an event that greatly 
aggravated the cold war and did much to shape western attitudes 
toward hungary for years afterward 
the events of 1956 mut not be treated as a matter of everyday 
politics but as a matter of history grosz said tuesday speaking 
through a translator 
the soviet invasion was touched off by a widespread antimoscow 
uprising in hungary among the legacies of that era is the 
continued presence of the 65000 soviet soldiers in hungary 
administration officials have said they would welcome a 
unilateral soviet withdrawal but maintain that any such move would 
do little to alter the eastwest power balance because hungary does 
not border on any nato country 
the officials said there had been credible hints recently that 
the soviets might announce a total troop withdrawal from hungary 
the administration was concerned that the soviets might try to use 
such a move as a bid to pressure nato countries into making 
withdrawals of their own from the european theater 
the administration prefers that force withdrawals be negotiated 
to ensure that concessions are parallel

the air forces b1b bomber already behind 
schedule in meeting its warfare goals now will accomplish about 
half of the job for which it was designed a pentagon testing 
official said wednesday 
asked to give the airplane an overall rating for how well it 
could perform its jobs of pentrating enemy airspace and surviving 
counterattacks john e krings director of testing for the defense 
department said it will accomplish about 50 percent in terms of 
the gross assessment of what it was supposed to do 
while the plane generally flies and handles well electronic 
equipment that enables it to follow a groundhugging flight path 
and avoid or confuse enemy radar remains a problem krings told a 
joint meeting of two house armed services subcommittees 
but even with the problems the b1b still exceeds the 
capabilities of some other planes in the us arsenal he added 
chief among the problem areas is the planes electronic 
countermeasures system which is designed to help the aircraft slip 
through enemy radar the system has been unable to handle the job 
of detecting and processing the range of possible threats from air 
defense systems krings said 
the problem is exacerbated by the inability of the electronic 
system to adapt to the changing nature of radars used for 
surveillance tracking and weapons guidance he said 
the air force has given up on trying to meet all the original 
hopes for the countermeasures system and is instead focusing on a 
narrower range of threats hoping to develop reliable performance 
against enemy antiaircraft weapons he said 
its better to have success in a limited area than no success 
in a large area he said there is no question that it doesnt 
accomplish everything it was supposed to 
the united states is buying 100 of the aircraft at a total cost 
of more than 20 billion the b1 program was killed by president 
carter who decided that it would be more costeffective for the 
air force to wait for development of the radareluding stealth 
bomber due for deployment in the early 1990s but the plane was 
revived by the reagan administration as part of its defense buildup 
jimmy carters decision looks better as we keep going through 
these hearings said rep patricia schroeder dcolo

the reagan administration renewed its offer 
wednesday to meet with responsible palestinians in an effort to 
spur mideast peace talks but said it would not retreat from its 
policy barring direct contacts with the palestine liberation 
organization 
assistant secretary of state richard w murphy told reporters 
that i hope to have meetings with palestinians when he tours 
the middle east next month and makes stops in israel jordan syria 
and egypt but there is no dramatic new initiative under way 
he said during an informal interview on capitol hill 
murphy and other officials were responding to questions 
triggered by remarks of president hosni mubarak of egypt who said 
in a stateowned newspaper interview that the united states was 
ready to talk with plo members so long as they are not prominent in 
the organization 
state department spokesman charles e redman said theres no 
change in our policy toward the plo in us government contacts 
with the plo 
the policy prohibits dealing with yasser arafats organization 
until it accepts israels right to exist and disavows terrorism 
against american and israeli citizens 
murphys trip to the region could be a forerunner of a fifth 
visit this year by secretary of state george p shultz before 
going murphy will meet in geneva next monday and tuesday with 
vladimir polyakov the senior soviet foreign ministry expert on the 
middle east 
shultz invited palestinians to meet with him in jerusalem but 
was snubbed at the instruction of the plo the plo also refused to 
approve a proposal that palestinian representatives negotiate with 
israel as part of a jordanian delegation 
on all his trips however rumors apparently inspired by the plo 
circulated that shultz was about to have a meeting in this arab 
capital or that with prominent members of the group 
redman said murphy as usual will be prepared to meet with 
responsible palestinians on the same basis that secretary of state 
shultz has offered to do on his trips to the middle east 
and yet the spokesman said the us policy on the plo was 
very categorical 
mubarak meanwhile said the meetings would be held either in 
cairo or amman mubarak told the weekly almussawar that murphy 
wanted to meet both with palestinians from the west bank and gaza 
and from other countries 
while the egyptian leader supports us peace efforts he 
differs sharply with shultz in insisting on a direct role for the 
plo in the process 
shultz met earlier this year in washington with two members of 
the palestine national council the wouldbe legislative arm of a 
palestinian state one of the palestinians edward said a columbia 
university english professor said he had a green light from 
arafat for the session 
apart from us restraints on contacts with the plo which were 
imposed 13 years ago shultz has barred participation by the 
palestinian group in negotiations with israel 
his attempt to spur peace talks has stalled over israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs refusal to pledge to withdraw from the 
west bank and gaza and demands by king hussein of jordan for a 
guaranteed israeli pullout 
shultzs return to the region was predicted earlier this month 
by prime minister sheik saad alabdullah alsabah after talks here 
with senior state department officials 
redman said murphys trip was not necessarily a precursor of 
one by shultz the spokesman added there are not any plans for a 
trip by the secretary at this stage but if there is something 
to do in the middle east or anywhere else in the world the 
secretary will do it 
one of the main issues shultz wants israel and the arabs to take 
up is the future of the 14 million palestinians who live on the 
israeliheld west bank and in gaza violent demonstrations against 
israeli control have taken the lives of more than 200 in the last 
seven months

an armenian activist said he was forced to fly to 
ethiopia under kgb guard after his expulsion from the soviet union 
but he won a promise after a hunger strike that his family could 
join him in exile in the west 
paruyr ayrikyan told the associated press by telephone from 
addis ababa that he was being cared for by the local armenian 
community and had been assured refuge in the united states for 
himself and nine family members 
the 39yearold activist who played a prominent role in a 
recent struggle between armenians and azerbaijanis for control of 
the nagornokarabakh region said he had not seen or spoken to his 
wife since his march 25 arrest 
ayrikyan said he would never abandon efforts to return to his 
native armenia but that he wanted his family with him in exile 
he said he had been told by us and ethiopian authorities that 
he would be able to leave addis ababa in a few days and will stay 
with relatives in france untili his family can join him they plan 
to settle in los angeles where they have other relatives that they 
have never met he said 
the us embassy in addis ababa said ayrikyan was in good health 
and met with us officials wednesday to start preparing for his 
settlement in los angeles an embassy source told the ap that the 
case was being given priority 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
ayrikyans wife and family in moscow also requested resettlement in 
the united states and the us embassy in moscow is processing 
them as refugees 
ayrikyan who had served 17 years in soviet prisons and labor 
camps before his release last year following a government review of 
political sentencings was expelled from the soviet union last 
week his expulsion followed the kremlins rejection of an appeal 
by armenians for annexation of the disputed nagornokarabakh region 
in the caucasus mountains 
he is believed to be the first soviet dissident expelled to the 
kremlins african ally the unusual action may indicate soviet 
concern about how their traditional allies in eastern europe would 
respond if asked to take part in a punitive measure against a 
dissident 
western nations including the united states had refused to 
accept the nationalist because he was being expelled by soviet 
authorities against his will 
he had been jailed in the armenian capital of yerevan since 
march 25 on charges of slandering the soviet state the accusations 
stemmed from his reports to western journalists on the armenian 
campaign for control of nagornokarabakh 
his family was allowed no contact with him since his arrest and 
did not know his whereabouts until late tuesday when he telephoned 
his motherinlaw nina sidorenko from ethiopia 
ayrikyan said he had gone on a hunger strike when authorities 
informed him he was being expelled and he abandoned it tuesday 
when soviet diplomats in addis ababa told us envoys that his 
family would be allowed to join him 
theresa masras an armenian emigre married to an ethiopian 
businessman said the head of the ethiopian capitals armenian 
community brought ayrikyan to her home for help in arranging refuge 
in the united states 
everyone is helping him theres no need to worry said mrs 
masras 
ayrikyan speaking from his room at the hotel ethiopia said the 
local armenians had been taking good care of him 
calls to the home of ayrikyans wife in armenia did not go 
through on wednesday but mrs sidorenko said her daughter managed 
to call her early in the day and was informed about ayrikyans 
location and plans 
in what may be a related development ethiopian leader mengistu 
haile mariam arrived in moscow on monday for what the tass news 
agency described as a brief working visit soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev and other officials met with him tuesday but 
a tass account of that and other meetings made no mention of 
ayrikyans case 
ayrikyan gained notoriety and official ire earlier this year 
when he provided information to western reporters in moscow about 
the armenian drive for annexation of nagornokarabakh 
armenians make up more than three quarters of the disputed 
regions 162000 population and athey had complained of 
discrimination at the hands of their azerbaijani leaders 
following a harsh speech by gorbachev warning about the dangers 
of nationalism in this multiethnic nation the kremlin leadership 
decreed on july 18 that nagornokarabakh will stay in the 
azerbaijan republic 
tass reported on july 20 that ayrikyan had been expelled after 
he created a crisis in armenia and nagornokarabakh

ronald mcdonald beware a robot that pops 
out cups of sizzling french fries in 30 seconds is after you 
for 80 cents the spud factory a hightech canadian vending 
machine drops a single order of sliced tubers into hot vegetable 
oil fries them and dumps the resulting morsels into a cardboard 
cup 
one day youre going to drive up to mcdonalds and get a 
hamburger french fries and a drink out of a vending machine 
said brian haskins a founder of robotic vending services inc of 
san jose which holds the us distribution rights 
more and more people are going to be eating highquality food 
in vending format said haskins 
for 60 years inventors have struggled to develop a vending 
machine that can deliver fresh french fries to be successful the 
machine must be able to refrigerate the potato strips while keeping 
the oil hot it also must be fireproof 
company president lee c benjamin finally found a machine that 
met the criteria operated by a microprocessor it costs 6500 and 
is made by canadian manoir industries of toronto 
for now the sole user of the spud factory is the navy last 
month the company installed seven machines at moffett field naval 
air station in mountain view just west of san jose it plans to 
install additional machines at three san francisco bay naval air 
stations and a hospital 
the first time i tried it the potatoes were all broken but 
since then its been great they taste real good said dinah 
ruiz a food service clerk who visits the machines several times a 
week my kids love them 
marketing director tony rivera said he and his partners are 
attempting to profit by combining a craze for potatoes with a craze 
for vending machines the average american consumes more than 40 
pounds of potatoes a year and vending machines make up a 20 
billion industry 
robotic vending plans to place 4000 machines throughout 
california before spreading to the rest of the country with an 
expected average of 50 sales a day per machine the company hopes 
to bring in 56 million in annual revenues no small potatoes 
the company plans to first zero in on larger clients such as 
hospitals and stadiums said rivera 
right now we are the only company in the us that has a 
vending machine that is certified everyone else is using machines 
that they are basically testing rivera said 
one of those others is oreida foods a subsidiary of hj heinz 
co in pittsburgh which is developing a similar machine

at the guandong market in east beijing shop 
attendant xing hua spent all day wednesday turning away customers 
seeking to buy the potent maotai liquor stacked in the back of the 
store 
were not selling the good stuff until tomorrow she said 
when the prices go up thats when were allowed to sell 
at the chongwen market near maxims yu zhiping has been refusing 
requests to buy famed zhonghua cigarettes despite the pile of a 
dozen boxes near her counter 
come back tomorrow she said with the curt officiousness of 
a beijing shopkeeper even if you clearly see them that doesnt 
mean theyre for sale 
on thursday brandname cigarettes such as zhonghua and spirits 
such as maotai and fenjiu will jump in price by as much as 290 
percent across beijing stores have been stocking up on the goods 
in anticipation of the price rise 
shopkeepers said government regulations forbade them from 
selling the goods before thursday 
the price increase was announced monday by the state council or 
cabinet and comes as a time of record inflation in china 
consumer prices in june were 19 percent higher than in the same 
month last year the state statistics bureau announced last week 
that jump represented the highest inflation rate in china since the 
communist victory in 1949 the previous high was last year when 
inflation hit 72 percent 
shopkeepers in three large stores in beijing said there had been 
no panic buying of the brandname goods for the simple reason that 
none of the stores was selling them 
only some of the bgrade products also set to increase in 
price were available and were selling briskly 
at chongwen one shop attendant said that in two days he had 
sold 200 cases of erguotou wine a turpentinelike liquor set to 
rise from about 50 cents to 65 cents 
weve got to sell this liquor now said the attendant who 
declined to give his name otherwise when it goes up no one 
will buy it 
the cigarette and liquor price rises are the second major 
increase ordered this year on may 10 the government raised the 
prices of vegetables pork sugar and eggs as part of farreaching 
price reforms aimed at ending state controls over prices and 
allowing the value of goods to be determined by the market 
the beijing daily on tuesday reported that the main reason for 
the newest price increase was to counteract a flourishing black 
market in brandname liquor and cigarettes 
private dealers bribe managers of staterun stores for a chance 
to buy a large portion of their brandname cigarette and liquor 
inventory the products then turn up on the street at inflated 
prices 
for example a bottle of maotai with an official price set at 
540 would sell for 4050 on the black market 
but on wednesday the official maotai price will rise to the 
black market level 
the money that really should have come to the country is 
flowing into the pockets of profiteers the paper said because 
of this after serious thought the state council has decided to 
decontrol the prices of famous cigarettes and liquor 
the state council said it would not carry out any other price 
increases this year so as to curb the high inflation rate 
on the eve of another price rise however there was some 
skepticism 
theyre just waiting until everyone forgets that said 
chongwen customer zhang da carrying two bottles of wine and two 
cartons of cigarettes they say they wont raise prices but they 
will

millions of americans are waddling their way 
to early graves by consuming too much fat too much salt and 
washing it all down with too much booze the us surgeon general 
reported on wednesday 
diseases of dietary excess and imbalance are among the 
leading causes of death in the united states said the report 
issued by c everett koop overconsumption is now a major 
concern for americans 
the study said that of 21 million americans who died last year 
nearly 15 million succumbed to diseases associated with diet 
what we eat may affect our risk for several of the leading 
causes of death for americans notably coronary heart disease 
stroke atherosclerosis diabetes and some types of cancer the 
report said these disorders together now account for more than 
twothirds of all deaths in the united states 
the study said that many americans are too fat while others 
fail to get required nutrients such as calcium and iron and the 
report repeatedly emphasized the need to cut down on consumption of 
animal products and replace them with a greater variety of foods 
particularly fruits vegetables and whole grains 
nutrition experts praised the report predicting that may have 
an important impact on how americans regard their diet and on 
products sold by the food industry 
this is really the first report by the surgeon general 
relating nutrition to health with his prestige it could have an 
influence said paul lachance a professor of food science at 
rutgers university 
its a very good report said dr john larosa a physician 
at the george washington university and chairman of the nutrition 
committee at the american heart association it endorses ideas 
that the heart association has been pushing for some time 
charles j carey president of the national food processors 
association said the report will encourage companies to develop 
products that follow the guidelines endorsed in the report 
though the report acknowledges that malnutrition remains a 
problem in some parts of the world and for certain americans it 
says that for most of us the more likely problem has become one 
of overeating too many calories for our activity levels and an 
imbalance in the nutrients consumed along with them 
koop said in a forward to the report that while many foods 
affect health the major factor in the american diet is the 
disproportionate consumption of foods high in fats often at the 
expense of foods high in complex carbohydrates and fiber such as 
vegetables fruits and whole grain products 
changes in the diet he said can bring a substantial measure 
of better health to all americans 
the report which totals 712 pages and cites more than 2000 
scientific studies from around the world makes recommendations 
ranging from the amount of fat that should be in the diet to advice 
about vitamin supplements 
among the major findings 
most people should reduce the consumption of fat especially 
saturated fats such as from butter or untrimmed red meat it 
suggests more vegetables and fruits fish poultry lean meats and 
lowfat dairy products 
more whole grain foods cereal products vegetables and fruits 
should be in the diet the report recommends that dried beans and 
peas be used as a source of protein to replace some animal products 
sodium consumption should be reduced by limiting the use of 
salt in food preparation and at the table 
alcohol intake should be reduced to two drinks a day if at 
all pregnant women should avoid any alcohol it said 
fluoride should be added to community water systems to prevent 
tooth decay and that the consumption of sugar should be limited to 
avoid dental cavities 
adolescent girls and women should increase consumption of foods 
high in calcium such as lowfat dairy products 
ironrich foods such as red meat fish cereals beans and 
wholegrain cereals are particularly important for children 
adolescents and women of childbearing age this issue is of 
special concern for lowincome families the report said 
heavy emphasis was placed in the report on dietary fat which it 
said increases risks for obesity some types of cancer gallbladder 
and heart disease 
dietary fat accounts for about 37 percent of the total energy 
intake of americans well above the upper limit of 30 percent 
recommended by the american heart association and the american 
cancer society the report said 
it said excess cholesterol levels strongly associated with 
heart attacks can be reduced by limiting consumption of foods of 
animal origin such as eggs dairy products meat poultry and 
fish and increasing consumption of plantbased foods such as 
vegetables and fruits 
the report said americans spend about 27 billion a year for 
nutritional supplements of unproven benefit and warned against 
fad diets or magical foods promoted with unsubstantiated claims 
overthecounter vitamins and minerals alone represent a huge 
business of questionable value the report said 
an estimated 40 percent of americans consume supplemental 
vitamins minerals or other dietary components at an annual cost 
of more than 15 billion even though such supplements are not 
needed by most customers the report said 
americans also spend extra money for products labeled as 
natural or organic even though the study said special 
benefits of these products are not generally demonstrated 
natural vitamins for example often sell at twice the price 
of synthetic products even though they are chemically identical 
the report said in some such products labeled as natural only 
a minor fraction of the vitamin is actually derived from natural 
sources

police detained george tyson 48 on drug charges saturday night 
less than three months after he began his prison sentence at his 
home 
i guess he duped me like everyone else prosecutor mark 
hanson who had agreed to the sentence said tuesday ill tell 
you one thing this time im going to flush him down the toilet 
when police brought tyson to the stationhouse he was still 
wearing the house arrest programs electronic anklet a hightech 
leash that broadcasts a signal to corrections officers to make 
sure a prisoner does not stray from home 
tyson was wearing the device because he had been convicted in 
may on two counts of dealing drugs from his home 
police said they found cocaine in neatly wrapped plastic 
packages lying on tysons bedroom dresser during arrests in may and 
august of 1987 tyson was supposed to serve a year 
every time he was arrested he was arrested at home delray 
beach police lt richard senff said thats what struck me as 
absolutely unbelievable about the house arrest sentence 
senff said he was particularly upset about tysons house arrest 
because of the homes proximity to carver middle school which is 
about a block away 
tysons latest arrest came after a confidential informant bought 
crack cocaine from him at his home with a marked 20 bill police

filipino negotiators wednesday blamed 
washingtons inflexible position for the breakdown of talks on us 
military bases in the philippines 
we felt we were being cheated by the latest us offer said 
negotiator juanita amatong 
the filipino team decided tuesday to suspend the talks 
indefinitely because of what spokesman leonides caday called 
substantial disagreement over payments for use of the six bases 
the philippine panel is insisting on a 12 billion annual 
payment according to an official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity he said the americans were offering roughly half that 
the united states pays about 180 million a year for the use of 
clark air base subic bay naval base and four smaller military 
installations clark and subic are the largest us military 
installations outside the united states 
amatong said members of her team also objected to a us demand 
that purchases of locally made products and salaries paid to the 
nearly 70000 filipinos employed on the bases be included in the 
total compensation figure 
foreign secretary raul manglapus wednesday blamed the collapse 
on what appeared to be an inflexible american position 
im prepared to entertain any suggestions on the future of the 
talks manglapus told reporters after meeting for about 40 
minutes with president corazon aquino but we have to be assured 
that the position given to us by the americans as inflexible is 
indeed not inflexible 
well we tried mrs aquino told reporters we hoped that 
we would finish but after yesterday i dont know 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
tuesday the us government expects to resume negotiations and to 
reach agreement 
the talks have been temporarily broken off said redman 
we do expect them to resume again i dont know exactly when 
there have been any number of breaks in these talks 
about 40000 american military personnel dependents and defense 
department civilians are stationed in the philippines 
the united states is also the philippine militarys main arms 
supplier in its 19year old battle with communist rebels 
talks are held every five years to review the military bases 
agreement signed in 1947 the year after the philippines became 
independent of the united states and is valid until 1991 
mrs aquino has agreed to honor the current agreement but 
refuses to say whether she will support an extension beyond 1991 
one year before her term expires 
any extension of the agreement after 1991 must be in the form of 
a treaty ratified by twothirds of the 23member philippine senate 
where opposition to the bases is strong 
us officials say the bases are essential to protecting east 
asia from soviet military expansion

an associate professor of communications at 
the university of nebraskaomaha said he has been denied an 
opportunity to deliver speeches about american indians because he 
stutters 
the nebraska committee for the humanities said i have 
something to say but that i couldnt say it bruce johansen said 
in a telephone interview with the omaha worldherald from seattle 
where he is spending the summer 
johansen said he had hoped to deliver speeches on american 
indian contributions to democracy 
the presentation would have been based on his book forgotten 
founders and other speeches he has given around the country on 
american indians johansen said in the interview published in 
wednesdays editions of the newspaper 
johansen released a copy of a letter he received from jennifer 
bauman humanities resource center coordinator 
the letter said johansens bid was rejected although his topic 
was interesting and unique because most people agreed that 
your delivery would detract too much from groups understanding of 
your material 
the executive director of the nebraska committee for the 
humanities jane renner hood said she could not discuss the 
details of any speaker the organization turns down for funding 
our policy and that of the national endowment for the 
humanities is not to discuss applications that are turned down 
she said if he johansen is going to give details fine but i 
cant 
potential speakers must present their material to various groups 
that might invite a speaker ms hood said the audience generally 
consists of such people as high school teachers and librarians she 
said 
we try to certify as much as possible that we will have 
excellent speakers she said we pull together an audience and 
evaluation forms are used 
about 45 people had expressed an interest in auditioning and 30 
went through the audition process ms hood said johansen and 
three others were not included in the final list she said 
johansen released copies of seven evaluations of his speech at 
the audition five of the seven indicated that they believed his 
speech problem would detract from the speech 
the nebraska committee for the humanities pays speakers an 
honorarium of about 100 and expenses ms hood said private 
foundations and the national endowment for the humanities fund the 
committee 
johansen said he hasnt decided whether he will take action 
against the committee he said he never considered his stuttering 
to be a problem he teaches classes at uno and delivers lectures 
throughout the country 
if for example everyone had their the committee members 
attitude i wouldnt be able to do anything he said 
ms hood said she believes johansen has the advantage in a 
public discussion over his exclusion from the speakers bureau 
he can talk about it she said i cant no matter how 
tempting it is to explain our side i simply cant do it 
ms hood said however that the humanities committee does not 
discriminate on the basis of handicaps race gender or religion

not require panelists to see all the shows nominated in the

we felt all nominations should be viewed by the judges which 
the academy does not do but the academy has been very flexible and 
we hope to work out our differences next year said boyle 
the cable industry will continue to hold its own ace awards 
since the emmys represent only certain prime time programming the 
next ace awards are scheduled for jan 15 1989 
the governors award this year will go to william hanna and 
joseph barbera of hannabarbera for their many animated shows 
their cartoon series range from the jetsons to the 
flintstones to the smurfs

a federal judge said wednesday some of the 
charges against former white house aide oliver l north likely will 
be dismissed if prosecutors cannot make arrangements for release of 
key secret documents in the irancontra affair 
us district judge gerhard gesell said at a hearing on a motion 
to postpone norths sept 20 trial that he cant make any decision 
until we know what it is were going to try 
gesell indicated however he would not agree to a suggestion by 
independent counsel lawrence walsh that some of the 16 charges be 
set aside until the release of classified documents can be worked 
out and that the trial go ahead on the other charges 
its now apparent that the government will not provide the 
documents ive ordered be disclosed to the defense gesell said 
unless that isue can be reconciled by various stipulations or 
agreements its clear to me that the conspiracy counts will 
have to be dismissed 
ive sent every signal i could that i have great doubts as to 
whether these counts can be tried gesell said 
the judge said he wanted documents that show what covert 
operations were involved in the diversion of profits from the sale 
of arms to iran who in high places knew about them and how north 
was involved 
walsh said that in the next two days he would go back to 
government intelligence officials and try to get documented answers 
to the questions gesell posed 
the judge has already ordered that classified documents related 
to the case be made available to the defense but intelligence 
agencies have refused to turn over some key papers citing national 
security interests 
walsh said he was ready to go ahead and try most of the counts 
against north and request that charges of conspiracy theft of 
government property and wire raud be tried later 
that would leave charges against north involving obstruction of 
justice personal enrichment and tax fraud 
former national security adviser john poindexter and arms 
dealers richard secord and albert hakim are due to have separate 
trials on irancontra charges no dates have been set 
norths lawyers want his trial postponed until next march they 
say sept 20 is too close to the presidential election and would 
not allow them enough time to prepare a defense 
barry simon lawyer for north told wednesdays hearing the 
trial would be affected by the presidential campaign he noted 
statements by speakers at last weeks democratic convention in 
atlanta including presidential candidate michael dukakiss pledge 
not to issue pardons in the irancontra affair if he is elected 
the judge noted that north had been giving speeches around the 
country and said he certainly doesnt want to keep it out of 
politics

the crowd gave yves saint laurent a standing 
ovation for his colorful couture show on wednesday which featured 
his flawless tailoring and technique and his daring use of color 
its hard to imagine anybody else sustaining such interest 
through a series of 25 tuxedo suits each one was perfection 
whether with short skirts long skirts long pants spencers or 
long jackets with white satin wing lapels or black kimono lapels 
the sparkly vineyard embroideries with bunches of grapes 
plastered onto bolero jackets and necklines of satin cocktail suits 
and evening gowns nearly brought the house down 
the show in the intercontinental hotel ballroom attracted 
celebrity clients including first lady danielle mitterrand paloma 
picasso film star catherine deneuve and american socialite lynn 
wyatt 
it was terrific like watching an artist at work said liza 
minnelli his clothes are works of art its like going to a 
museum 
the suits were classics wearable anywhere shoulders were amply 
padded but not offensively so besides his favorite short and 
straight skirt saint laurent has adopted another shape and length 
a longer length to just below the knee flared or pleated below the 
hip 
daytime trousers looked straightforward and sporty although 
they could be dressed up by one of the mink or ruddy fox coats or 
a taffeta coat another great saint laurent item for winter with 
raglan or puffed sleeves these superb taffeta numbers sometimes 
had bright contrasting linings 
saint laurents use of zingy color was a far cry from his sober 
looks of past seasons cerise and pink teamed often for day or 
evening and brightly piped suede suits came on in turquoise and 
rust red and green rust and navy 
it was a huge show 134 outfits and just about everything was 
totally elegant and wearable from the beautiful chanelstyle 
dresses with touches of white and gold buttons to the marvelously 
draped chiffons with a feminine highwaisted look to emphasize the 
bust 
guy laroche went colorful as well the doublebreasted cafe au 
lait smooth wool suit was excellently tailored and shown with a 
bright orange satin blouse a violet leather fitted jacket with 
brown mink shawl collar and cuffs over a lean tobacco short skirt 
made a perfect dressy daytime outfit 
laroche used an original touch in some of the day and evening 
wear chineselantern puffs on the sleeves some of the evening 
wear was appealing especially the beaded and embroidered black 
dresses but short evening gowns with puffy skirts and plenty of 
fancy touches looked young and fussy 
lecoanethemant a youthful pair of designers celebrating their 
10th haute couture season showed they have all the technique it 
takes to make couture but it seems a shame to waste so much 
fabulous fabric and detail on what sometimes ends up looking more 
like abstract sculpture than clothes 
topped by spiraling hats the dresses and suits with tiny 
skirts enormous standout basque bottoms on jackets huge 
coneshaped tops sometimes looked overladen with details and too 
zany for comfort 
nevertheless the miniskirts draped and laced through 
rhinestone loops the exotic cutout patterns and the superb satins 
and rich indian fabrics were well worth looking at if hard to wear 
paco rabanne also seems to concentrate more on showy art objects 
than clothes and aptly showed at the decorative arts wing of the 
louvre he is famous for his chainmail effects and obliged an 
audience eager to be entertained 
rabannes sequined dresses too were larger than life often 
dazzling in all colors of the rainbow reflected prismlike from 
the sequins 
not everything was impractical rabanne also showed some very 
attractive rubber raincoats and a goodlooking reversible rubber 
bolero lined with sequins worn with a black corduroy jumpsuit

nicaraguas military has been able to take 
irreversible advantage of the fourmonthold ceasefire with 
the contra rebels strengthening its overall position at a time of 
a us aid cutoff to the insurgents a contra leader said wednesday 
enrique bermudez former contra military commander and newly 
elected member of the rebel political directorate called for a 
renewal of us military aid as a signal of us determination to 
establish democracy in nicaragua 
adolfo calero who joined bermudez and three other members of 
the directorate at a news conference said the rebels have no 
intention of violating the truce despite bermudezs contention that 
it has helped the sandinistas 
the rebel leaders spoke as rep jack kemp rny introduced 
legislation to provide the rebels with 30 million in military aid 
and 271 million in humanitarian assistance through march 1989 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan also has introduced a 
bill to aid the rebels calling for a 47 million package that 
includes 20 million in lethal assistance 
in pleading for a resumption of aid bermudez asked how can i 
send the combatants to the field for a prolonged period of time 
without any rounds of ammunition surrounded by sandinistas 
since the ceasefire went into effect he said the sandinistas 
have been reinforcing their military positions they have been 
rebuilding their military garrison they have been relocating their 
forces in key positions they have been receiving 40 million 
monthly from the communist bloc 
bermudez described these advantages as irreversible 
the rebels meanwhile have received no military aid from the 
united states since late february three weeks after the cutoff 
the sandinistas and the contras reached agreement on an interim 
ceasefire but talks since then on arranging a final settlement 
have broken down and no new negotiations are scheduled 
aid to the rebels since last april has been limited to 
humanitarian items including cash deliveries for food purchases 
calero said the rebels want to return to the bargaining table 
but that the sandinistas must first make goodfaith gestures 
signaling a willingness to establish democracy 
the last round of talks was held in june and ended in failure 
with each side holding the other responsible for the outcome 
last week bermudez resigned as commander of rebel forces along 
the northern front after his election as a member of the 
directorate his new role calls for coordinating decisions of the 
directorate related to military activities 
he will be responsible for strategic planning and supervising 
the carrying out of military operations but will no longer be 
involved in daytoday activities and will not have troops under 
his command 
his election to the directorate has caused controversy because 
he is the first military man to be chosen for that role one reason 
he had been denied a political voice until now was his prior career 
as an officer in the national guard under the somoza family dynasty

the federal aviation administration is 
scrambling vainly to catch up with a rapidly changing airline 
industry whose decisions at times are driven by dollars and not 
safety a congressional study said wednesday 
the 183page report by the office of technology assessment 
suggests that congress provide the faa with additional funds and 
press for more inspectors and air traffic controllers as well as 
organizational streamlining that places more emphasis on safety 
unannounced inspections and periodic indepth inspections of 
both large and small airlines by the faa are indispensable tools 
for ensuring public safety but currently the faa doesnt have 
enough inspectors said the report 
the ota is a nonpartisan agency that helps congress deal with 
complex and often highly technical issues the report on air safety 
was requested by the house aviation subcommittee 
rep norman mineta dcalif the subcommittee chairman said 
the reports call for stable and adequate funding for the faa 
is among its most important findings 
for the balance of this century the faas funding needs will 
continue to increase if we expect to maintain the high level of 
safety which the public demands of aviation said mineta at a 
news conference but he acknowledged those funds may be hard to 
find under the enormous deficits that have piled up in recent 
years 
the study notes that the safety record of us airlines ranks 
among the best in the world but it added that the intense changes 
in the industry and bitter competition among airlines poses safety 
concerns 
while airline officials are concerned about safety financial 
considerations drive many industry decisions and will continue to 
do so as long as strong competition exists among the airlines 
the study concludes 
at the same time it said the faa has been hit hard by budget 
cuts and personnel reductions and has fallen behind in both 
numbers of staff and levels of technical expertise 
it said that while human errors account for a large majority of 
airline accidents faa programs to understand human error and 
enhance controller mechanic and cockpit crew performance are 
inadequate 
at the same time the growth in air traffic resulting in 
increasingly crowded skies at major airports could outstrip the 
capabilities of the faa traffic system if it is not modernized 
the faa is in the midst of updating its air traffic control 
equipment but that is not expected to be completed until the late 
1990s 
the faas shortcomings are particularly worrisome at a time when 
closer monitoring of the aviation industry is required the report 
suggested 
competitive pressures have placed increased emphasis on keeping 
down costs at all airlines resulting in the elimination of some 
of the layers of the old safety system the report said 
some airlines have pared back their safety departments many 
have lowered hiring standards increased pilot and mechanical duty 
time reorganized or cut wages the study said 
while the cumulative impacts on safety of these decisions are 
difficult to quantify there is evidence that airline executives 
are under intense pressure to focus on meeting only the minimum 
safety standards required by the faa and not go beyond those 
requirements the report suggested 
while safety comes first is the instant response of airline 
executives when asked the basis for management decisions this 
universal answer masks wide variances in airline corporate cultures 
and operating procedures the report continued 
safety first means one set of corporate guidelines to an 
economically strong air carrier it means something else 
entirely to a financially strapped airline that must choose between 
discretionary maintenance of its aircraft and purchase of 
additional airport landing slots because it cannot afford both

an offer by a senior iranian official to help 
free american hostages in lebanon was dismissed wednesday by the 
reagan administration as dated and not an indication tehran wants 
to open talks with the united states 
the state department spokesman charles e redman said freeing 
the nine hostages was a humanitarian issue and not subject to 
bartering with iran concerning iranian assets frozen in the united 
states 
iran has petitioned a tribunal in the hague netherlands to 
recover the assets which have an estimated worth of 1 billion 
redman said the iranian offer has resurfaced many times over 
the past two years and each time we have noted that there can be 
no connection between the hostages and irans claim in the hague 
hojatolislam hashemi rafsanjani the speaker of irans 
parliament and acting commander in chief of its armed forces said 
tuesday he would help obtain the release of the american captives 
if the united states returned frozen assets 
no deals marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman 
promptly retorted 
iranian assets including military equipment and some funds in 
american bank accounts were seized by president carter in 1979 
after iranians sacked the us embassy in tehran and held its 
american occupants hostage 
many of the assets were released in january 1981 as iran freed 
the americans after a 444day ordeal a special tribunal in the 
hague which arbitrated claims by the two governments has 
jurisdiction over the assets that remain forzen redman said 
in the last few weeks as part of an effort to persuade iran to 
end the war in the persian gulf with iraq the reagan 
administration has sent indirect messages to tehran proposing talks 
after an eightyear break in relations 
president reagan publicly has suggested a dialogue with tehran 
apart from the 7year war us officials said other issues 
they wanted to discuss were the hostages and terrorism 
mindful however of the irancontra arms and money fiasco the 
officials have insisted they would deal only with authorized 
iranians after secretly shipping missiles to iran in 1985 and 1986 
in an effort to promote moderation and to free the hostages 
the administration discovered it was dealing with iranians who 
could not or did not want to alter iranian policy 
redman suggested there would be no formal reply to rafsanjanis 
proposal apart from the public dismissal of the offer 
i dont know that theres any reason to reply any more 
directly than we have already this time publicly he said 
weve replied to similar remarks by rafsanjani by prime minister 
hosein musavi khamenei in the past 
the us official added our position concerning hostages is 
as always that that is not something that one can negotiate about 
that you cant make deals 
assistant secretary of state richard murphy told a house 
subcommittee on wednesday we will not accept any linkage between 
the fate of our hostages and outstanding claims iran has the 
prime responsibility to get them released 
redman said the latest proposal did not seem connected to 
current efforts at the united nations to impose a ceasefire in the 
gulf war nor he said was rafsanjanis proposal taken here as an 
official response to us overtures for talks 
i dont see any indication that its that kind of a 
response the us official said

newspaper editor michael g gartner will 
replace lawrence k grossman as president of nbcs news division 
network sources said today grossman said he is leaving because of 
differences in style personality and priorities 
grossman confirming a report in todays new york times said 
his departure after four years during which he helped lift the 
network in the ratings was a mutual decision by myself and nbc 
president bob wright 
grossman was in los angeles with other nbc executives for a 
network meeting 
the appointment of gartner former editor of the courierjournal 
of louisville ky and the the des moines iowa register was to 
be announced later today said the nbc sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
gartner is a parttime general news executive with gannett co 
and editor of the ames iowa daily tribune 
grossman said in an interview that its time for them to get 
their own guy in there referring to general electric co which 
acquired nbc two years ago 
its been in the works for a while grossman said things 
have changed it hasnt been all that fun lately ive been there 
four years its a difference in style personality and priorities 
im very proud of what weve accomplished onward and 
upward 
grossman former president of the public broadcasting service 
was hired by thennbc chairman grant tinker in 1984 under 
grossmans tenure nbc news improved its standing in news 
broadcasts with the today show moving into first place and 
nbc nightly news gaining status 
but several attempts to start a primetime news program failed 
and the nightly news slipped from the top ratings at a time 
when the networks primetime programming was particularly 
successful 
grossman said the change was effective immediately though he 
would stay to help aid the transition

anchorman tom brokaw and steve friedman former executive producer 
of the today show who left nbc more than a year ago and is now 
producing usa today the television show for gtg entertainment 
according to the times brokaws criticism centered on 
grossmans lack of a journalism background

members of the house telecommunications 
subcommittee said wednesday they remain unconvinced that consumers 
will benefit from a federal communications commission proposal to 
change the way telephone companies are regulated 
panel members said they were openminded about the fccs 
proposal to lift limits on the profits of american telephone amp 
telegraph co and the local bell telephone companies and instead 
set a ceiling on prices but they said they have yet to see 
evidence that the change would benefit ratepayers 
the only thing that we know for certain is that this plan has 
raised more questions than it answers said rep edward j 
markey dmass subcommittee chairman 
atampt and the bell companies have been lobbying hard for a change 
from profit regulation to price caps but others in the 
telecommunications industry fear the proposal would give these 
large companies too much advantage over competitors 
the fcc could vote on the plan this fall and put it into effect 
next year unless congress acts to block the plan or pressurs the 
fcc to drop it 
at the panels hearing lawrence garfinkel atampt vice president 
of marketing services supported the plan as it applied to his 
company 
limits on prices rather than profits would in all probability 
result in greater price decreases or smaller price increases by 
creating incentives for costsavings by allowing the company to be 
more competitive and innovative garfinkel said 
but as applied to the bell companies the proposal fails to 
assure that charges for connection to the local phone networks will 
drop with declining costs he said 
atampt is the nations largest longdistance company serving 
about 70 percent of the market the rates for atampt the only 
longdistance company whose interstate business is federally 
regulated set the pace for the rest of the industry 
mci communications corp the no 2 longdistance company also 
opposes price caps for the bell companies because of the local 
companies control of access to the local phone network 
local access charges already are excessive and higher charges 
would simply raise longdistance rates for consumers said gerald 
j kovach mci senior vice president 
philip campbell chief financial officer of bell atlantic said 
the bell companies and thus consumers would benefit from the same 
encouragement for costsavings efficiencies and innovation under 
the price caps proposal 
at a minimum local phone rates would go up 3 percent less than 
inflation he said 
but dennis dundon chairman of the competitive 
telecommunications association which represents more than 100 
longdistance companies said lifting profit regulation on atampt and 
the bell companies would be a mistake 
deregulating monopolies is just not good policy dundon said 
without adequate controls atampt would be able to undercut 
competition by charging below cost for some services and making up 
the difference with higher prices on essential services he said 
the bell companies given more flexibility could tailor service 
arrangements for the large longdistance companies at the expense 
of the smaller companies 
the price cap plan is appropriate only in a fully competitive 
environment where market forces would exercise a check on 
excessive or predatory prices he said

a military court wednesday 
convicted three slovenian journalists of disclosing military 
secrets and sentenced them to prison terms ranging from five to 18 
months a supporter of the accused said 
more than 10000 yugoslavs awaiting the verdict outside the 
courthouse roared with disapproval when they heard the news and 
some chanted antigovernment slogans 
an army sergeantmajor who allegedly leaked a classified 
document to the journalists was given four years in jail by the 
military court in ljubljana capital of yugoslavias most liberal 
republic slovenia said donci kuzmanic a spokesman for the 
committee in the defense of the accused an unofficial group 
supporting the defendants 
journalists janez jansa david tasic and franci zavrl along 
with ivan borstner the noncommissioned army officer were 
sentenced for revealing a document dealing with the deployment and 
combat readiness of army units in this northern republic 
jansa a columnist for the outspoken youth magazine mladina and 
zavrl its chief editor received 18 months each kuzmanic told the 
associated press he said tasic a journalist working for mladina 
was sentenced to five months 
the official tanjug news agency also reported the sentences 
according to the verdict read to reporters by chief judge col 
djuro vlaisavljevic borstner had removed the top secret stamp 
from the military document before giving a copy of it to the 
journalists 
jansa planned to use the information for his articles 
vlaisavljevic said the closeddoor trial which started july 11 
caused an uproar in slovenia which has emerged as the vanguard of 
political reforms in communist yugoslavia 
the court released borstner tasic and jansa from custody 
pending an appeal to the supreme military tribunal in belgrade 
tanjug reported 
the verdict is completly unfounded and represents a travesty 
of justice zavrl told his supporters zavrl the only defendant 
not held in custody regularly commented on the trial saying it 
was a shameful humiliating court proceeding 
the defendants alleged the trial was rigged and that the 
verdicts were decided before the proceedings began 
as the journalists emerged from the courthouse the crowd 
cheered and carried them away on their shoulders a witness said 
we will struggle till the end to defend our freedom jansa 
said i will not speak much because in this country every word 
could be used against you 
the journalists have written articles sharply criticizing the 
yugoslav army and its leaders and alleging they were plotting a 
crackdown in slovenia 
tanjug quoted a court statement saying that bortners motive in 
leaking the document was that he saw the document as a danger to 
his slovenian people 
by giving the document to mladina he hoped that its contents 
would be disclosed to the slovenian leadership tanjug reported 
military trials of civilians are highly unusual in yugoslavia 
where the armed forces unlike the police and civilian courts are 
under federal control 
thousands of people attended protest meetings and signed 
petitions against the trial widely seen in the republic an army 
move to intimidate dissidents some of whom have demanded that the 
government resign for mismanaging the economy 
the liberal slovenian leadership demanded that the trial be 
conducted openly that the accused be defended by civilian lawyers 
and that they all be released from custody 
the army rejected all of the requests citing what they said was 
the sensitive nature of the classified documents and arguing that 
serbocroatian is the official language of the armed forces

the economy expanded at a healthy 31 percent 
annual pace from april through june but rising food energy and 
clothing costs pushed the inflation rate to 47 percent its 
highest level in almost six years the government reported 
wednesday 
some private economists worried that the big jump in inflation 
was signaling the concluding stages of the current long economic 
recovery and could well result in a recession some time next year 
the white house dismissed the inflation figure as a temporary 
deviation 
the commerce department reported that the growth rate in the 
gross national product the economys total output of goods and 
services was down only slightly from a revised 34 percent 
increase in the first three months of the year 
but inflation as measured by a price index tied to the gnp 
registered the biggest advance since the third quarter of 1982 the 
gnp price index had risen at 35 percent rate in the first quarter 
the reagan administration which is counting on a strong economy 
this year to keep the white house in republican hands hailed the 
strong growth numbers and dismissed the higher inflation rate as an 
aberration 
prices have temporarily picked up but they are not a harbinger 
of more general inflation said beryl sprinkel the presidents 
chief economist the price increases are reflecting the drought 
and higher import prices because of the fall in the dollar 
others were more concerned 
we have had a definite upturn in the inflation rate which is a 
byproduct of our long expansion said allen sinai chief 
economist of the boston co the demand side of our economy is now 
exceeding our ability to produce which is causing price 
pressures 
the federal reserve has already pushed interest rates higher as 
a way of dampening demand and federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan said the central bank stood ready to tighten further if 
inflationary pressures did not abate 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he 
agreed with the administrations assessment that the spike in 
inflation in the second quarter was likely to moderate in coming 
quarters he said it was produced primarily by higher clothing and 
energy costs which have already declined since spring he 
predicted that food costs would moderate as well especially if 
more rain falls in the parched midwest 
all economists agreed that overall growth during the second 
quarter showed the hopedfor movement away from a consumerled 
expansion to exportled growth in fact 62 percent of the increase 
in gnp in the spring came from an 189 billion narrowing of the 
countrys trade deficit the biggest improvement since early 1980 
we are very lucky to get a growth picture that is this 
wellbalanced at this stage of the business cycle said jerry 
jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers 
in addition to the strength in exports the economy was 
propelled in the spring by a 14 percent increase in business 
investment as us manufacturers rushed to expand production 
facilities to keep up with growing export demands 
growth would have been even stronger in the second quarter but 
the drought reduced farm production by an estimated 55 billion at 
an annual rate which shaved onehalf percentage point from the gnp 
increase according to commerce undersecretary robert ortner 
this was more than offset by an increase in auto production 
which added 13 percentage points to gnp growth in the second 
quarter ortner said 
the gnp report wednesday was accompanied by benchmark revisions 
to gnp data going back the past three years those revisions 
generally showed stronger growth than originally believed in part 
because of higher consumer spending 
the revisions showed the economy grew 34 percent in 1987 up 
from a previous estimate of 29 percent gnp growth last year 
the reagan administration has revised its estimate for growth 
this year to 3 percent when measured from the fourth quarter of 
1987 up from an administration forecast of 24 percent at the 
beginning of the year 
in the first six months the economy grew at a 325 percent rate 
and many forecasters said they expected growth to be around 3 
percent for the remainder of the year this growth performance 
would be a far cry from the recession many analysts were once 
predicting in the wake of the record october stockmarket plunge 
instead the economy has performed strongly this year helping 
to push the unemployment rate down to a 14yearlow of 53 percent 
in june 
overall gnp grew at an annual rate of 302 billion in the 
spring quarter pushing total inflationadjusted gnp to 3986 
trillion in the second quarter 
exports rose at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second 
quarter while imports fell by 62 percent 
even housing construction showed some strength in the second 
quarter rising by 28 percent partially reversing a 65 percent 
drop in the first quarter but analysts said rising mortgage rates 
would depress housing further in coming months

mother natures birds are interfering 
with the us navys birds and now the war is on 
flocks of mourning doves feeding along jacksonville naval air 
stations new runway are threatening the navys p3 orion 
antisubmarine aircraft some have been sucked into the engines and 
officials fear it might cause a crash 
one of the aircraft had to abort a takeoff last week when two of 
its engines were damaged by birds the doves also have caused a 
reduction in the number of flights from the base alongside the st 
johns river 
for the rest of this week a team of volunteers including 
dentists firefighters and security officers will take up 
positions along the runway armed with a variety of noisemaking 
explosives 
they hope to scare off most of the birds theyll kill those 
they dont 
you just cant use pyrotechnics alone said navy spokesman 
nick young the birds get wise and figure out its just a bunch 
of noise thats not hurting anybody 
the navy has received permission from state and federal 
officials to kill the mourning doves known for their plaintive 
cries if they cant be driven away 
cindy mosling founder of the bird emergency and kare sanctuary 
or beaks who is known as jacksonvilles bird lady said there 
are other ways of scaring off the doves without killing them 
in new zealand and other places they put hawks on tether 
lines she said offering to take some of the predators to 
jacksonville nas 
but young said the navy would need a lot of tethered hawks to 
clear the runway quickly the alternative he said would be to 
suspend air operations until the doves are scared away 
the volunteers will be along the runway during daylight hours 
through friday in hopes of solving the problem said mj meyer 
airfield manager 
the best times to scare away the doves are early in the morning 
and at dusk when they feed he said 
the bird problem began friday when the new runway opened young 
said that day the tall grass alongside the runway was mowed and 
grass seeds dropped to the ground 
the doves move from field to field when theres food 
available the word gets out among birds like people that theres 
a free meal said young 
navy officials are hopeful that adding grass catchers to mowers 
will prevent the problem in the future the grass catchers would 
pick up the grass seeds that attracted them to the runway in the 
beginning young said

the united states has suspended military and 
economic talks with qatar to protest the persian gulf sheikdoms 
unauthorized acquisition of stinger antiaircraft missiles us 
diplomats said wednesday 
assistant secretary of state richard murphy said the suspension 
would remain in place until qatar returns the missiles to the 
united states 
what we have done is to place on hold a number of agreements 
that were under consideration murphy told the house subcommittee 
on europe and the middle east 
we consider it very much in the interests of developing the 
solid relationship with qatar that those missiles be returned 
soonest and weve made that very clear he added 
murphy himself made an official protest when he visited the 
qatari capital of doha last month 
another official speaking on condition he not be named said 
qatar had been seeking several military and economic agreements 
with the united states including the purchase of weapons we 
told them everything is frozen he added relations are now 
correct but cool 
the united states does not have any defense cooperation with 
qatar but considers the country important as a member of the 
prowestern gulf cooperation council which includes saudi arabia 
and kuwait 
us officials wants to get the stingers back in order to see 
their serial numbers and determine where qatar got them the united 
states first learned of the stingers presence in qatar last march 
when an embassy official saw one of the rockets in television 
footage of a military parade 
us officials say they do not know how many of the 
shoulderfired rockets qatar has they have speculated that qatar 
was given the stingers by iran which in turn captured them from 
the ussupplied afghan rebels fighting against the soviet 
occupation of their country 
other officials say qatar may have bought the missiles on the 
black market although that possibility is less likely 
strict controls apply to the sale of the stingers which are 
considered of great value to terrorists because they are portable 
and highly accurate 
in response to questioning murphy said the united states was 
not considering recalling its ambassador to qatar who heads a tiny 
mission of five americans 
such a move would not be in the interests of maintaining 
relations with the prowestern oil state murphy said the 
ambassador is the only one with access to decision makers 
there he added 
qatar contends it needs the missiles for selfdefense and has 
rejected any attempts by us officials to even see them

president fidel castro is asking cubans 
for more hard work and fewer illusions as he looks ahead to the 
30th anniversary of the day he took power 
castro approaches the jan 1 anniversary with about 60 percent 
of the islands 11 million people too young to remember the fervor 
of his fight but he praised the new generation for its 
revolutionary enthusiasm 
in his threehour nationally televised speech tuesday night 
castro predicted hard times ahead and urged cubans to work hard and 
stop dreaming of such luxuries as an eighthour work day 
the good news in the speech marking the july 26 start of his 
fiveyear battle was that cuban troops may come home from their 
13year involvement in angola 
we will happily receive our combatants castro said and 
welcome them back to the battle for development of our country 
castro said troops would stay there until the minute that an 
agreement is signed in the usmediated talks between south africa 
and cuba he gave no time frame but said the pullout will not be 
sudden 
castro has never spoken so explicitly about bring cuban troops 
home 
he frequently mentioned the jan 1 celebration of the day he 
marched into havana 30 years ago to take power from dictator 
fulgencio batista 
he spoke at length about his communist governments progress 
citing economic gains public works and the revolutions vaunted 
public health system 
before 1959 he said there were 180 doctors in santiago the 
nations largest city after havana now he said there are 2470 
even more important he said is the fact that these new 
generations of santiagans are even more enthusiastic and more 
revolutionary than the generations that preceded them 
the degree of that enthusiasm could be crucial in the coming 
years of hardship castro predicts because of bleak prospects for 
improvement in the foreign exchange situation 
just two years ago at the third communist party congress 
castro said laziness absenteeism and inefficiency had become such 
a problem that cuba might become a nation of freeloaders 
on tuesday he said things have improved and the first 
fruits of his rectification campaign are being seen 
but he also called for more hard work and fewer illusions and 
told those yearning for an industrialized nation where the work 
day is eight hours or less that they are dreaming 
its necessary to work and work hard he saidwe dont 
impose anything on the worker we persuade the worker 
the rectification campaign has moved away from economic 
incentives toward the kind of moral exhortation employed in the 
early days of the revolution 
castro also made it clear that he isnt going to launch any 
reform campaigns like those of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
cuba will never adopt methods styles philosophies or 
idiosyncracies of capitalism he said capitalist systems castro 
said are complete garbage theyre not good for anything 
he also said there will be no move away from oneparty rule 
castro wore his standard green uniform and cap although his 
famous beard is turning white he spoke with as much vigor and 
animation as ever but his image was still a sharp contrast to the 
pictures of the young revolutionary and his comrades preparing for 
the july 26 1958 attack on the moncada garrison 
the attack failed but five years and five months later castro 
marched triumphantly into havana

a longtime political activist said 
wednesday he has been the target of three breakins in as many 
weeks and believes they were politically motivated 
chris wood who has been active in the vermont rainbow 
coalition the vermont committee on southern africa and the vermont 
central america nonintervention network said the breakins 
occurred this month at his home former office and current office 
he and a spokeswoman for a new york group that defends the civil 
rights of activists said the breakins fit the pattern of more than 
100 similar burglaries at homes and offices of activists and 
journalists around the country and abroad 
in all three breakins wood said a crowbar or other flat 
instrument was used to pry open a door papers were shuffled 
around and nothing of value was stolen 
wood said he suspected the fbi was involved but ray mcelhaney 
an fbi spokesman in washington said i dont think there have 
been any breakins involving the fbi i have no statement 
regarding the allegations of this person in montpelier vermont 
were now monitoring more than 120 breakins around the 
country of this type said alicia fernandez of the movement 
support network which is affiliated with the center for 
constitutional rights 
she said that the motives for the breakins in which nothing 
was stolen but files were rifled appeared to intelligence 
gathering harassment and intimidation 
mcelhaney said the fbi had launched its own investigation into 
allegations of politically motivated breakins but determined that 
jurisdiction for the burglaries rested with state and local police 
montpelier police officer kenneth roberts said he too 
initially thought the breakins were politically motivated but 
that other recent breakins with similar modes of operation had 
since led him to believe otherwise he said it was unusual for 
breakins to occur without anything being stolen but that it had 
happened on at least two other instances in the city recently 
woods allegation came the same day the boston globe reported 
that confidential cbs news memos stolen from the home of a reporter 
based in costa rica had turned up in files released by the fbi in 
response to a subpoena 
freelance reporter tony avirgan told the lobe that his home was 
broken into in 1985 and about a year later during a time when he 
was investigating on assignment from cbs an assassination attempt 
against a dissident contra leader rep don edwards dcalif 
chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee that oversees the fbi 
said the documents indicate that the fbi could have been getting 
the fruits of political burglaries and breakins 
a spokesman for the fbi said the bureau had no comment on how 
the reporters documents ended up in its possession

still nursing scars from the irancontra 
affair reagan administration officials are publicly imposing 
ground rules which seemingly limit flexibility to win the 
liberation of american hostages in lebanon 
officials at the white house and state department say no deals 
will be negotiated with iran and that the us government will 
discuss the hostage situation only with authoritative 
representatives of the tehran government 
neither of these limitations was placed on the jockeying in 
198586 that led to the clandestine sales of us arms to iran the 
diversion of proceeds to nicaraguan rebels and the subsequent 
indictment of two onetime white house officials 
however two american hostages david jacobsen and the rev 
benjamin weir were released during that mercurial period 
president reagan subsequently argued that he was merely seeking 
an opening to iran not an armsforhostages trade when he 
approved the transfer of tow antitank and antiaircraft missiles 
to tehran 
a presidential panel disagreed with him and so did a joint 
congressional investigative committee 
reagan eventually acknowledged that what had started out as an 
overture to moderate political elements in iran had turned into 
what the public perceived as an armsforhostages swap 
irans acceptance last week of a un resolution imposing a 
ceasefire in the long war with iraq has raised expectations of an 
improved climate for getting the hostages out of lebanon 
when asked monday if the time was ripe to try once again to talk 
to the iranians about the hostages reagan said of the iranian 
officials if theyre ready and willing to talk its time 
but administration officials followed that broadbrush remark 
with a series of statements stressing limitations on us 
willingness to deal with iran on this subject they said the 
administration would not again fall prey to something that can be 
construed as bargaining with a terrorist nation for the release of 
hostages 
so the guidance that administration officials gave out for 
public consumption was that they would not go to any length to get 
the hostages out 
but the administration previously had denied certain aspects of 
the 198586 initiative and was proved wrong 
reagan for instance sent an amended statement to the tower 
review board about how the initial missile shipments had been 
approved by him 
while steadfastly insisting that officials are doing all they 
can to learn the whereabouts of the nine americans and get them 
out white house spokesman marlin fitzwater sought wednesday to 
minimize the significance of statements from iran suggesting a new 
interest in the issue 
in so doing he set forth another ground rule limiting us 
diplomatic flexibility an insistence that the us government have 
direct communication from tehran or an authoritative source 
speaking for the government of revolutionary leader the ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini 
if iran wants to talk to the united states the spokesman said 
its leaders must back up statements in speeches with 
authoritative communications to the united states 
fitzwater left no doubt that the uproar over earlier us 
dealings on hostages has made us officials more wary and even 
cautious than before 
one of the lessons we learned from that experience 
irancontra is that its very difficult to have those kinds of 
discussions without them becoming arms for hostages or ransom for 
hostages or negotiations for hostages the spokesman said 
and thats why were not going to do it again 
as if to prove his point fitzwater scoffed at statements by 
irans parliament speaker hojatolislam hashemi rafsanjani 
indicating an interest in warming relations with washington and 
suggesting a willingness to deal on the hostages 
we frankly dont know what theyre trying to say fitzwater 
said it their pattern to make these kinds of claims and hope 
somebody bites and you will recall we went through this a year 
ago 
my scars are deep enough i do not forget those 
conversations said fitzwater who bore the brunt of reporters 
questions after the irancontra affair was exposed in november 1986 
the release of 52 american hostages from iran in early 1981 was 
brought about at least in part by a us deal to turn over to an 
international tribunal at least 3 billion in frozen iranian assets 
reagan signed an executive order seeking to enforce the assets 
agreement that thenpresident jimmy carter made with iran although 
officials of the new administration said they would not have signed 
such an agreement 
asked wednesday if the administration was ruling out just such 
an arrangement fitzwater said we dont link assets to hostages 
and no deals 
the state department spokesman charles e redman said freeing 
the nine hostages was not subject to bartering with iran over 
frozen assets 
this is a proposal that has been surfaced and resurfaced many 
times over the past two years and each time we have noted that 
there can be no connection between the hostages and irans claim in 
international claims tribunal the hague redman said 
fitzwater bristled when asked whether the hostages had become 
the forgotten men 
no weve been talking about them every day for a week he 
said referring to his giveandtake with reporters during white 
house news briefings

gastroenteritis killed 14 more people in the capital on wednesday

on the contamination of wells by overflowing sewers they also 
blame the contamination on rainfall washing through uncollected

between two city agencies 
in parliament home minister buta singh said the government 
would take action against those found responsible for the epidemic

monsoons have resulted in more than 300 deaths from drowning

rescue workers wednesday recovered 20 bodies when 
they raised the wreckage of a fishing boat that sank after 
colliding with a navy submarine last week at the entrance to tokyo 
harbor 
that brought the confirmed death toll from saturdays accident 
to 29 a coast guard official said still missing was a 24yearold 
woman mami yuhara 
fortyeight people were on board the 154ton no 1 fujimaru to 
fishing boat when it collided with the submarine which was 
cruising on the surface of the water across the busy shipping lane 
the vessel sank in less than two minutes and 19 people were rescued 
no injuries were reported among the 75 men on board the 
submarine which was almost undamaged 
the salvage team using a massive crane winched the boat to the 
surface from a depth of about 160 feet 
the coard guard official said a long narrow hole under the bow 
of the ship indicated the impact from the submarine which probably 
lifted up the front of the boat and caused it to sink sternfirst 
survivors and newspapers have charged that the submarines crew 
members stood by watching on the deck as victims sank out of sight 
in the water 
i saw the men on the submarine so i called out why dont 
you help one survivor told reporters but even though there 
were more than 10 of them watching they didnt do anything she 
said 
the submarine picked up only three survivors 
news reports wednesday said defense agency chief tsutomu kawara 
has offered to resign over the accident but would stay on until an 
investigation was completed 
news reports have suggested the submarine the 2200ton 
nadashio may have erred in continuing on its course after sighting 
the fishing boat before the collision 
but news reports quoted the fishing boats surviving crew as 
saying the nadashio on the left blasted its horn to warn the boat 
of its approach 
adm shuichiro higashiyama navy chief of staff said wednesday 
he believed the submarines crew had taken proper measures to avoid 
the accident 
defense officials have said the collision was the worst between 
japanese navy and civilian vessels since world war ii

sen john h chafee rep claudine c 
schneider and gubernatorial candidate bruce g sundlun can remain 
on this novembers ballot despite discrepancies in their filing 
papers the state board of elections ruled wednesday 
the discrepancies between the candidates declarations of 
candidacy and their voter registration cards included a missing 
middle initial in a signature and a street that was listed as an 
avenue 
opponents had challenged the candidacies of chafee sundlun and 
schneider saying they violated a state law requiring declarations 
of candidacy and voter registration cards to match exactly 
but the elections board said the discrepancies werent important 
enough to disqualify the candidates 
board chairman joseph r distefano said after wednesdays 
hearing that the board would ask the general assembly to amend the 
law next year to allow minor variations in signatures the current 
statute which has been in effect since 1950 may be more exacting 
than needed to prevent fraud he said 
the question is is it overkill distefano said could we 
have had a less stringent requirement to accommodate the given 
purpose i think so 
schneider a republican was accused of signing her declaration 
with her initial but leaving it off her voter registration card 
schneider also listed her address on the form as central avenue 
instead of central street 
she argued that she made the same signature error on her 1986 
candidacy papers and that was not challenged by the board at the 
time 
as for schneiders address the board said this board has 
interpreted the statute in its prior rulings so as to permit some 
variation in the address so long as there no substantial variance 
sundlun the democratic candidate for governor signed his 
declaration with his initials but his registration card spells out 
his first name and included the word street which was omitted 
from his address on his registration 
sundlun said he signed both forms with his initials but someone 
added ruce to his first name on the registration card without 
his knowledge later 
mr sundlun is not chargeable with knowledge of or 
responsibility for an unauthorized alteration of his signature on 
the voter registration card the board ruled 
chafees bid for a third term was been challenged by an 
independent opponent because the senator listed his house number on 
the form declaring his candidacy while his voter registration card 
left out the number 
the republican senator told the board of elections that when he 
bought his house in warwick in 1961 the homes there had not yet 
been numbered 
sundlun said that if he is elected he would seek to make the 
law governing candidacy declarations less stringent 
i dont think any candidate should have to go through this 
he said

golfers at the waterville country club 
are experiencing a new barrier between them and that perfect game 
foxes that steal their golf balls and stash them in sandtrap 
hideaways 
during one recent tournament the fleetfooted critters swiped 
the golf balls of all three players on one team and forced the 
players to drop out of competition proshop employee robert 
timmons said wednesday 
its a very common occurrence to have them the foxes stand 
five or six feet away said timmins who plays the 18hole course 
frequently 
foxes have burrowed holes in two sand traps at the central maine 
course pups emerging from their dens sun themselves while golfers 
chip and putt 
golfers are also distracted by deer that meander across fairways 
and canada geese and mallards whose droppings near ponds create a 
hazard of their own 
one golfer blamed a fawn for his failure to break 100 he said 
he was searching for his ball in the rough when the young deers 
mother let out a warning sound forcing him away 
timmins said golfers are also interrupted occasionally by deer 
that meander across fairways canada geese and mallards near ponds 
a snapping turtle and a few muskrats which wander onto the course 
however he added most players are amused rather than 
aggravated by the wildlife

senate candidate herbert kohl criticized by 
rival anthony earl for his political contributions released a list 
wednesday showing that the person to benefit most from his 
donations has been earl himself 
the list showed kohl multimillionaire owner of the milwaukee 
bucks basketball team made 290 political contributions since 1975 
with a total of 9000 going to earl for his gubernatorial 
campaigns in 1982 and 1986 earl was elected the first time but 
lost two years ago 
the two men are among several democrats running in the sept 13 
for nomination to the seat of retiring sen william proxmire 
earl has questioned kohls commitment to democratic causes 
pointing out that he made three contributions to republican 
senators during the early 1980s kohls contributions each for 
1000 were to minnesota incumbents david durenberger in 1982 and 
rudy boschwitz in 1983 and to malcolm wallop of wyoming in 1982 
when he won election to the senate 
kohls list includes almost 90000 in contributions to 
individuals and party committees at the federal state and local 
levels the vast majority are democrats according to the milwaukee 
journal which was given a copy of the list 
kohl said tuesday he had made the three contributions because he 
had been solicited in each case by a friend he said he had given 
the money without consideration to the candidates political stands

congress and the defense department shouldnt 
overreact to the current pentagon bribery investigation by passing 
a lot of new laws and regulations the head of a commission that 
reviewed pentagon business practices said wednesday 
justice department investigators must do everything possible 
to identify the real criminals and bring them to justice and try to 
do so in ways that will help to deter such action in the future 
david packard told the senate armed services committee 
but packard who headed a presidential commission that in 1986 
recommended changes in the way the pentagon purchases weapons and 
other items warned that i believe it is very important not to 
overreact to these recently disclosed allegations 
this country has longestablished legal procedures to deal 
with crime he said they should not be preempted in the name 
of military reform to do so results in actions of a kind that 
would be expected only in the most tyrannical type of a police 
state 
such actions are the antithesis of the very fundamental 
concepts of a free society and a free enterprise economy he 
said it is very hard for me to understand how this came about 
during an administration dedicated to free enterprise 
packard is chairman of the board of the hewlettpackard company 
and is a former deputy secretary of defense 
his testimony was his first major comment on the current bribery 
case which involves allegations that defense contractors and 
private consultants bribed pentagon employes for inside information 
about future contracts no one has yet been charged 
criminal activity is a problem that should be handled by 
professional investigators packard said but losses to criminals 
are not large in comparison with the waste and inefficiences in 
the major acquisition programs 
there are four major reasons for that waste and inefficiency he 
said including lack of a worldwide military strategy 
pressure on each of the four services to promote their own weapons 
annual congressional appropriations instead of multiyear spending 
and congressional spending for weapons and bases that are not 
needed 
he said there have been many positive steps in the right 
direction in implementing the changes proposed by his commission 
but he added that the breakdown of the procurement system is 
caused by congressional attempts to impose competition among 
defense contractors where it is virtually impossible to achieve 
or with regulations enforced by what i consider to be identical 
to police state tactics 
in the private sector he said price is seldom if ever the 
only factor in purchasing a product or awarding a contract the 
quality of the product is almost always more important and the 
support and service the supplier can provide are also more 
important than price alone

the navy is investigating whether james 
gaines a figure in the pentagon procurement investigation 
violated the ethics code by dealing with his former employer the 
boeing co a spokesman said wednesday 
gaines flew to seattle last october for a briefing on the latest 
version of the p3c orion antisubmarine aircraft manufactured by 
boeing said navy spokesman lt brian cullin 
gaines deputy assistant secretary of the navy for acquisition 
management is a former boeing executive who agreed after joining 
the pentagon to disqualify himself from any dealings with his 
former employer 
we dont know the extent of his involvement with boeing in 
that trip said cullin we have referred it to the naval 
investigative service a branch of the navy which is working with 
the federal bureau of investigation on the case 
it was not whether anyone had approved gaines trip to seattle 
cullin said 
gaines is one of six pentagon officials who were moved to other 
duties after justice department disclosed that it was investigating 
allegations that defense contractors and consultants many of them 
former military men bribed defense officials for contracting 
details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of 
dollars 
in the navy department gaines was a deputy to melvyn paisley 
the assistant secretary for research engineering and systems 
paisley had worked at boeing for 28 years before he was recruited 
by the then navy secretary john lehman in 1981 
paisley who left the navy in 1987 to become a consultant 
recruited gaines with whom he had worked at boeing in the 1970s 
the navy spokesman said his office had referred the matter to 
the naval investigative service last week bringing to their 
attention the disqualifier in his financial disclosure form that he 
is prohibited from dealing with boeing 
our feeling was that an investigation was needed to determine 
whether gaines had violated us code 208 which governs ethics 
cases said cullin 
gaines financial disclosure form released through the navy 
said boeing would pay him a lifetime pension his service with the 
company which ended sept 30 1985 and would include him in its 
major medical plan until he turned 65 
because of gaines continuing financial relationship with 
boeing through the pension and health insurance plans navy 
officials sent him a letter on sept 19 1986 saying that you 
are hereby disqualified from taking any action in connection with 
matters involving these firms boeing and its affiliates or any 
subsidiary or affiliates of these firms 
such actions include but are not limited to participation in 
program reviews approval of funding actions review of acquisition 
plans and justifications and approvals said the letter which 
was released by the navy 
the letter was signed by richard l rumpf principal deputy 
assistant secretary of the navy for research engineering and 
systems 
a spokesman for the naval investigative service said the agency 
would have no comment and referred all questions to the navy

the ira says it is 
investigating botched operations that have killed 17 civilians 
recently and damaged its image in the guerrilla campaign to drive 
the british from this troubled province 
the irish republican army prides itself on attacking only 
security forces sparing civilians but even some staunch 
supporters have criticized the blunders 
one is gerry adams president of the iras legal political wing 
sinn fein and a member of the british parliament after a bomb 
exploded outside a public swimming pool in west belfast earlier 
this month killing two of his roman catholic constituents he said 
the ira must get its house in order 
four recent bombings have been bungled beginning with one that 
killed 11 protestant men women and children in november at a 
memorial service for britains war dead at enniskillen the attack 
inspired international condemnation of the ira 
ira statements said the bomb was radiocontrolled to explode as 
soldiers marched by but british electronic scanners may have 
detonated it prematurely 
onsaturday a misdirected bomb killed a protestant family of 
three returning from a vacation in the united states 
at first the ira said they were victims of mistaken 
identity then claimed the 1000pound bomb was detonated by 
british army scanning equipment 
on wednesday the ira said high court judge ian higgins a 
catholic was the intended target higgins and his family drove 
home from a us vacation at about the same time 
in other admitted blunders ira men shot and killed a 
21yearold protestant woman in march then said her brother was 
the intended target the ira said the brother belonged to the 
ulster defense regiment but he was found to have no connection 
with the security forces of the protestantdominated province 
its operatives planted a bomb on a schoolbus last month 
intending to kill the driver a parttime member of the ulster 
defense regiment a dozen protestant and catholic teenagers were 
wounded one seriously 
police superintendent raymond moore said in an interview 
people who set out to kill other people have to accept the 
consequences of their acts i dont accept the word accident or 
mistake these people are criminal thugs waging war on the 
population 
the ulster volunteer force an outlawed protestant extremist 
group claimed responsibility tuesday for killing ira member 
brendan davidson 33 shot at his home the previous day by three 
men who reportedly wore police uniforms 
sinn fein accused police of collusion with the killers saying a 
police patrol passed outside davidsons home shortly before he was 
killed 
sammy wilson of the hardline protestant democratic unionist 
party says the religion of most victims indicates the overwhelming 
catholic ira targets protestants 
sinn fein is sensitive to the charge of sectarianism and denies 
such a motive 
jackie donnelly a sinn fein spokesman said every blunder is 
very very serious and tragic and the ira cancels more operations 
than it conducts for fear of civilian casualties 
if you take the amount of operations the ira have successfully 
carried out over the last 18 years and put it beside the list of 
mistakes theyre very minimal he said in an interview 
he added however that a very serious inquiry into civilian 
deaths is under way because no one realizes more than the ira 
that bad operations can damage them 
donnelly said the ira was examining whether remotecontrolled 
devices have been tampered with and possible carelessness by its 
operatives 
theories abound on why the ira is missing targets 
moore said selfprotection measures by security forces make 
attackers run more risks 
seamus mallon leader of the social democratic and labor party 
a moderate catholic group said the ira is using the dregs of the 
organization as operatives 
it seems to me that they are not getting the young people of 
ability that they did in the past and because of that their 
expertise simply does not exist he said on radio ulster 
eamonn mallie a journalists and coauthor of a book about the 
ira says there is a split within the organization but donnelly 
denied it 
the ira have never been as united as what they are now he 
said

the senate on wednesday approved 15 billion 
for the state justice and commerce departments after calling on 
the reagan administration to reassess us relations with china if 
beijing does not stop selling missiles in the middle east 
the bill which was approved 8016 was the 11th appropriations 
bill the senate has passed this year the measure now goes to 
conference with the house which passed its own version of the 
measure last month pegged to a far lower 7 billion spending level 
the measure includes 75 million to establish a usbased 
television station to broadcast news information and entertainment 
to cuba the station to be known as television marti would be a 
followon to radio marti which has been in operation since 1983 
the proposal was sponsored by sen ernest hollings dsc who 
said television marti would send the message of democracy to 
everyone in cuba 
acting on amendments the senate adopted 970 a proposal by 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas calling on china to 
immediately halt the sale of ballistic missiles and other 
destabilizing weapons in the middle east 
it urged china to cut off discussions with syria iran libya 
and pakistan about possible missile sales 
and it declared if these sales and policies are not 
discontinued the united states should reassess its relations with 
the peoples republic of china and reexamine agreements or 
contemplated agreements providing for arms and technology transfers 
to the peoples republic of china 
acting on other amendments the senate approved 
a proposal by dole creating within the state department the 
position of special envoy to the afghanistan resistance to 
coordinate us policies toward the antisoviet rebels 
noting the ongoing soviet troop withdrawal in afghanistan dole 
told the senate now more than ever we need to make sure we are 
on top of events in afghanistan in touch with and closely 
coordinating our activities with the resistance and doing what 
makes the most sense diplomatically to advance our strategic and 
political goals 
a senseofthesenate amendment from sen john mccain rariz 
expressing support for human rights in soviet armenia armenian 
activists have been leading an unsuccessful campaign to have a 
predominantly armenian region of the neighboring republic of 
azerbaijan rejoined to armenia 
armenians who form a majority of the 162000 population in the 
contested region in the soviet republic of azerbaijan allege 
mistreatment by the azerbaijani government they began a vocal

the next administration will have a difficult 
time reducing the defense budget because much of the budget goes 
for personnel and affects the nations military preparedness a 
study released wednesday warned 
the current pentagon budget is about 300 billion a year and has 
doubled during the eight years of ronald reagans presidency 
a total of 55 percent of the budget is spent for a category 
known as operation and support oamps which covers pay for the 
nations 21 million uniformed military personnel and a variety of 
other daily expenses the congressional budget office said 
reagan has approved a series of pay increases for the troops a 
move hailed by republicans and democrats alike as having improved 
the quality of military recruits 
but after five years of large annual increases in defense 
spending the pentagon budget has been frozen the past three years 
and both republican and democratic leaders have predicted that no 
major defense budget increases are likely in the near future 
aside from reducing spending on personnel the pentagon could 
cut future spending by reducing the number of new weapons it buys 
defense secretary frank carlucci earlier this year announced 
layoffs among the civilian pentagon workforce as part of the effort 
to meet lowerthanforecast defense budgets 
as the pentagon modifies its budget to conform with likely 
fiscal realities some further reduction in the number of forces 
could occur the cbo study said these reductions would 
adversely affect us military capability 
decreases in oamps spending could be serious because they are 
associated with military readiness which is defined as the ability 
of us forces to fight well early in a war the cbo said 
readiness is considered crucial by many military analysts 
since it determines how well active forces could respond to 
surprise attacks and how rapidly reserve forces would be available 
to augment them it said it is enhanced if forces are fully 
equipped manned and trained in peactime and operations spending 
influences manning and training

now decomposed rats have washed ashore on new 
york city beaches joining medical waste in a bounty of unwanted 
debris that has closed many east coast recreation areas this summer 
altogether 10 of the 143 miles of beaches administered by the 
city parks department were closed because of debris wednesday in 
addition most of the beaches in the gateway national recreation 
area remained closed 
its very disappointing to us said parks commissioner henry 
stern who added that he hoped investigators would find who was 
responsible for the illegal dumping and send them away for a long 
time 
while officials in new york said they were baffled by the 
seaborne invasion of debris authorities in rhode island said they 
had traced medical waste that washed ashore in that state to new 
yorkarea hospitals drug stores and ambulances 
nine rats were among the 246 pieces of waste that were found at 
rockaway beach on tuesday according to health department spokesman 
barry adkins at least 24 more pieces of debris were found 
wednesday most of the items were syringes adkins said 
rockaway beach which ordinarily attracts hundreds of thousands 
of bathers on hot summer days remained closed 
health department officials initially thought the rats had been 
used in laboratories because they appeared to have been 
systematically shaved but adkins said investigators later 
determined the rodents hair had fallen out in clumps due to 
decomposition 
there is no evidence that they are laboratory rats adkins 
said 
on long island nassau county officials reported the discovery 
of what appeared to be infectious medical waste at the town of 
hempsteads oceanside transfer station 
health department spokeswoman shelly feuer domash said the waste 
had been traced to the south nassau communities hospital in 
oceanside 
however a spokesman for the hospital said all the material had 
undergone a hightemperature sterilizing procedure and was allowed 
at the transfer station 
in rhode island officials have found at least 60 items in 
recent weeks including needles and syringes catheter bags rubber 
tubing a colostomy bag and respirator parts waste continued to 
wash ashore on wednesday 
everything that were picking up is coming back to the same 
geographic source said ronald l diorio policy director for 
gov edward d diprete all of the evidence coming in at this 
point points to the new york general area 
a 9inchlong sign inscribed nycems washed ashore last 
thursday in nantucket mass said john stobierski a spokesman for 
the massachusetts department of public health 
officials believe the sign stands for new york city emergency 
medical service which provides ambulance services for that citys 
health and hospitals division diorio said 
the sign has washed up but that doesnt explain how it got 
into the water said stobierski 
we dont even have signs that say nycems lt vicky 
bertland of the medical service said wednesday she said she 
could not comment further without seeing the sign

a national research council study released 
wednesday said nasa needs to build a system to more accurately 
predict weather conditions at the moment spacecraft are launched 
from the kennedy space center in florida 
the study which analyzed the system used by the national 
aeronautics and space administration to protect its spacecraft from 
lightning and other adverse weather said that major improvements 
are needed in organization and in instruments 
nasa the panel said has been poorly organized to provide 
weather support and the result is a system that is less than 
stateofthescience the report said it noted that unless 
improvements in the weather forecasting system are made at the 
kennedy center weather will loom larger as a threat to a 
rejuvenated and accelerated space flight program 
the study said that nasa must have a system that can accurately 
forecast weather and lightning conditions that are valid for at 
least two hours 
observations of lightning electric fields aloft and rapid 
wind variations are most urgently needed the report said 
john a ernst director of nasas weather support office said 
the space agency asked for the study and is now studying the 
results 
weve taken some initial steps and the recommendations confirm 
that the steps weve taken are the right thing to do said ernst 
weve got a better handle on the problem now 
the national research council recommended these actions 
equipping an aircraft with instruments to measure electric 
fields aloft and to gauge wind velocity and turbulance in the path 
of a spacecraft to be launched or landed 
installation of an instrument that will detect sudden wind 
changes 
installation of additional instruments to monitor the approach 
of major thunderstorm systems 
nasa managers were criticized in the study for not defining the 
precise minimum weather conditions for a space shuttle launch 
the weather support system has not been able to concentrate 
sufficiently on the special problems of the space shuttle the 
report said some critical parameters are currently not measured 
such as drop sizes in clouds and rain which are hazardous 
because of the possibility of protective tile damage and there is 
no program to initiate these types of measurements the report 
said 
ernst said that the agency is planning to put special weather 
instruments aboard an airplane that will cruise near the space 
center during a space launch countdown he said the airplane will 
be equipped to measure the potential for lightning in clouds up to 
45000 feet 
nasa also is installing instruments on a buoy anchored in the 
atlantic ocean east of the launch pad ernst said this should give 
more information on approaching thunderstorms 
additionally he said the space agency is planning to install a 
radar which will warn of wind shear turbulence 
nasa requested the nrc study when lightning caused the 
destruction of an atlascentaur rocket after it was launched from 
the kennedy space center later studies showed the rocket was hit 
by four strokes of lightning 48 seconds after liftoff the 
electrical discharge disrupted an onboard computer memory system 
and the vehicle went out of control nasa destroyed the rocket to 
protect property and people downrange using a signal from the 
ground 
at the time of the atlascentaur destruction the national 
research council panel said nasa and the air weather service of 
the air force were operating one of the largest networks of 
electrical field measurements in the world yet the report said 
these measurements had not been entered into the system that 
committed to launch 
rockets as they rise from the launch pad and streak toward 
space are able to trigger lightning if they penetrate clouds that 
contain high charges of electricity the tail of hot gases 
streaming from the rockets can actually form a conduction path for 
the lightning charge to flow to the ground 
triggered lightning has hit only one piloted us spacecraft 
apollo 12 was struck twice by lightning as it was launched on nov 
14 1969 the electrical charge temporarily disrupted 
communications and permanently damaged nine nonessential circuits 
but the spacecraft and its astronauts successfully completed the 
second manned landing on the moon

the united states will have to develop 
advanced rocket systems if the nation plans to launch the star wars 
defense system or to send people to mars someday the office of 
technology assessment said in a study released wednesday 
ota a research agency that serves congress issued what it 
called a buyers guide outlining the options congress could 
consider if it decides to go shopping for new rocket systems 
to continue the nations space program at about the rate of the 
era before the challenger accident the ota said the best buy 
would be to improve the space shuttle and the existing fleet of 
expendable rockets titan atlascentaur and delta 
this approach would have little technical risk and would 
require a small investment the report said 
to achieve an increase in us launches by about 5 percent a 
year the ota suggested four options increased production and more 
launch sites for the current rockets modification of current 
rockets so they can carry more cargo development of a cargo ship 
called shuttlec based on space shuttle technology or 
construction of a new rocket based on current technology 
the agency said that if the nation decides to deploy star wars 
formally known as the strategic defense initiative or to send 
people to mars it will need to invest in new rocket technology to 
reduce cost increase performance and provide flexibility 
it said such new technology could be developed three ways an 
air force proposal to build an advanced expendable rocket a 
national aeronautics and space administration proposal to build a 
new generation of space shuttle called the shuttle ii or 
development of a national aerospace plane a hypersonic aircraft 
capable of taking off from a runway and flying into orbit 
the ota said the air force advanced launch rocket would be the 
cheapest least technically challenging and could be ready by the 
end of this century the other two would take longer and cost more 
but a shuttle ii would preserve the nations ability to send humans 
into orbit the study said 
the report said the united states has or can develop the 
technology for any of the options but it lacks the resources to 
pursue them all simultaneously and congress will have to make a 
choice

a vital testfiring of space shuttle 
discoverys three main engines has been delayed again until 
monday because of a faulty fuel valve and other problems the 
space agency announced wednesday 
the troubles halted a practice countdown during which the 
spaceships external fuel tank was to have been loaded wednesday 
night the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the 
challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 
officials said the count was held up several hours by the need 
to replace a fuel valve other technical problems also contributed 
to the delay 
the flight readiness firing of the three engines had been set 
for saturday but earlier this week was put off until sunday to 
give technicians more time to close out the engine compartment 
under the new schedule the fuel tank now will be loaded with 
half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid nitrogen on 
thursday night and the countdown will be taken down to 10 seconds 
before a mock liftoff 
at that point a simulated problem will force a launch 
delay engineers then will rehearse what is called a 72hour launch 
turnaround they will drain the fuel from the tank and start 
another countdown aiming for a firing of the engines at 730 am 
monday 
the 20second firing will test several modifications made to the 
engines and is essential to certifying discovery for the first 
postchallenger shuttle launch 
elsewhere engineers seemed to be favoring cutting a hole in 
discoverys rear cargo bay wall as the best approach to repair a 
small gas leak without having to take the shuttle off the launch 
pad moving the shuttle could delay the planned early september 
launch by as much as two months 
cutting the hole would enable experts to reach the 
otherwiseinaccessible leak which is in a fitting on a line 
leading to an oxidizer tank in an engine compartment they could 
either tighten the fitting or enclose the leak with a clamshell 
device filled with an epoxy sealant 
nasa officials estimate this approach would take 10 days to two 
weeks 
engineers still are testing a method in which a device 
resembling a badminton shuttlecock would be pushed into the 
27footlong vent line trailing a sealing agent 
no decision is expected until after the main engine firing on 
whether to try to fix the leak on the pad or to roll discovery back 
to a hangar for repair even if the leak can be repaired don the 
pad officials expect the launch to slip past midseptember 
the leak is in a steering engine system separate from the main 
engines which are to be testfired

too much rain has slowed this summers grain 
harvest in the soviet union the agriculture department said 
wednesday 
rains accompanied by strong winds reportedly have caused 
lodging tangling impeding the early grain harvest in european 
ussr this year the departments foreign agricultural service 
said despite the unfavorable conditions some areas are 
reporting excellent winter grain yields 
as of july 18 grain and pulses which include peas and beans 
had been cut on 149 million hectares of which 98 million had 
been threshed the report said that was below the fouryear 
average of 235 million hectares cut and 186 million harvested by 
this time between 1983 and 1986 
even so harvest progress is ahead of the yearago pace when the 
season was late and only 89 million hectares were cut and 54 
million harvested by now the report said 
in all the soviet union has around 116 million hectares for 
harvest this year one hectare is equal to about 247 acres 
the 1987 soviet grain harvest went on to produce an estimated 
2114 million metric tons and this years has been forecast by 
usda at 215 million tons one of the largest on record 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or 394 bushels of corn

foreign countries selling meat and poultry to 
the united states would have to be certified annually that their 
programs to control drug contamination meet us standards the 
agriculture department said wednesday 
the proposal responds to the requirements of the 1985 farm law 
said lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service 
under the plan the agency would certify that each country 34 
now are eligible to ship meat and poultry into the united states 
uses reliable analytical methods to determine whether products 
contain residues of drugs or other chemicals that are within us 
limits 
for many years we have required foreign countries that export 
meat and poultry to the united states to have a system of 
inspection that is equal to our domestic inspection system 
crawford said 
he added in recent years the legal requirements governing 
how we regulate imported meat and poultry have become increasingly 
strict especially with respect to oversight of residuecontrol 
programs 
the proposal would provide that if a countrys program was not 
certified the country would lose its eligibility to ship meat and 
poultry to the united states

deposed philippines president ferdinand marcos 
may have faked reports about carloads of gunmen to divert attention 
from reports that he offered 5 billion for permission to return 
home the philippines consul said wednesday 
frankly this is another one of marcos imbecilities said 
tomas gomez the philippine consul general here every time 
marcos finds himself in thick soup he does something bizarre 
marcos and his wife imelda spent tuesday night at a friends 
home following a report that guards saw guns sticking out the 
windows of three cars driving by their home according to marcos 
spokesman gemmo trinidad 
the marcoses returned home wednesday and feel its a little 
bit safer trinidad said 
the marcos household had been warned of a plot to kill marcos 
before the cars drove past marcos aide arturo aruiza said 
in the philippines spokesman teodoro benigno said wednesday he 
didnt know anything about the report and didnt want to comment 
because one of the worlds master illusionists is at work 
the report of gunmen came on the same day that a published 
report said marcos had offered to pay the philippine government 5 
billion in exchange for being allowed to return to his homeland 
free from criminal prosecution marcos admitted negotiations are in 
progress but said money was not involved 
gomez who keeps tabs on marcos for the philippine government 
said he believed the alleged threat was a ploy to draw attention 
from the published report 
trinidad said tuesday that marcos guards who were on foot 
chased the cars but could not get a description because it was 
early in the morning and still dark no shots were fired and no one 
was injured he said 
a honolulu police dispatcher said the incident was not reported 
trinidad said the marcoses were awakened shortly after the cars 
drove by and driven to the friends home 
marcos has lived in hawaii since his ouster in a 
civilianmilitary revolt in february 1986 that brought president 
corazon aquino to power marcos his family and associates are 
alleged to have stolen up to 10 billion from the philippine 
treasury during his 20year rule 
mrs aquino has refused to allow marcos to return from exile in 
hawaii in january 1987 us authorities barred marcos and his 
wife from leaving oahu island following a coup attempt in manila by 
his followers

republicans filed suit wednesday to prevent 
the federal election commission from releasing 46 million in 
public campaign funds to michael dukakis and his democratic running 
mate sen lloyd bentsen 
the national republican senatorial committee also asked the 
court to issue an injunction to keep the treasury department from 
acting on tuesdays decision by the fec that cleared the way for 
the dukakisbentsen team to get the public funds allowed general 
election presidential contenders 
bentsen is also seeking reelection to his senate seat in texas 
we asked the district of columbia court of appeals to stop 
the treasury department from acting on the fec certification of the 
funds for dukakisbentsen until the court hears our case said 
ben ginsberg legal counsel for the nrsc 
the republicans contend bentsens situation violates federal 
election law and gives the democratic presidential ticket an unfair 
financial advantage 
an unusual texas law allows bentsen to run for reelection as 
senator and seek the vice presidency at the same time 
the senate race is funded with private contributions but 
federal law forbids private funds in the presidential general 
election race since each party nominee receives 46 million from 
the 1 voluntary income tax checkoff fund 
in the suit the nrsc charged that the fec acted in an 
arbitrary and capricious manner in its 60 vote on tuesday 
rejecting the groups petition seeking to block release of the 
public funds for dukakis and bentsen 
we dont want to hold up dukakisbentsen getting 46 
million ginsberg said we want to stop dukakisbentsen from 
getting 46 millionplus from the senate reelection committee 
in its complaint the nrsc cited examples of bentsens use of 
private funds for the general election campaign including a 
telegram sent by his senate reelection committee asking for 
support for the dukakisbentsen ticket 
the group also told the court it would be able to argue the case 
on monday which falls within the 10day period the fec had to 
decide on the petition

cities and towns still not in compliance with 
federal sewage treatment requirements or on their way to compliance 
should expect to pay fines the government warned wednesday 
eightysix percent of the nations sewage treatment plants 
handling 95 percent of the nations sewage flow met the july 1 
deadline for subjecting their discharge to socalled secondary 
treatment treatment with bacteria to remove about 90 percent of 
ordinary pollution the environmental protection agency said 
we think it is a success story largely attributable to 
state agencies and municipalities epa administrator lee m 
thomas told reporters at a news conference with roger mazrullah 
assistant attorney general for land and natural resources 
we still have major water quality problems from other 
sources thomas said the resolution behind this effort is 
exactly the resolution required to deal with the remaining issues 
of the 2095 noncomplying treatment plants more than 
twothirds are the subject of administrative or court settlements 
containing compliance deadlines and setting out automatic penalties 
for failure to meet them 
the laggards are in every state but idaho montana wyoming 
north dakota south dakota wisconsin kansas and new mexico all 
plants in those states use secondary treatment 
the worst states were hawaii 36 percent of plants complying 
washington 54 percent and ohio 68 percent 
its the 629 remaining noncomplying plants a little over 4 
percent of the overall total of 15486 that were the subject of 
the warning from thomas and marzullah 
they should assume there probably will be a penalty thomas 
said 
epa has won 7 million in penalties since 1984 and another 5 
million was ordered by courts to be spent by local authorities on 
environmental projects in lieu of fines the maximum penalty is 
25000 a day 
of the 629 plants 409 have been referred to the justice 
department or state attorneys general for action most of the rest 
already use secondary treatment and are disputing with epa how much 
advanced treatment is required to remove toxic substances like 
heavy metals 
asked about the recent discovery of medical waste on new york 
beaches thomas said sensitive coastal environments are being 
overwhelmed by pollution and sewage plant discharges were a 
piece of the issue 
among major coastal water problems he singled out nonpoint 
source pollution like fertilizerladen agricultural runoff 
coming down tributaries into our estuaries and combined storm 
sewersanitary sewer outflow in older cities 
thomas said he had ordered lawyers to research his authority 
over hospital waste but had doubts that he could legally require 
it to be handled like hazardous waste 
some large noncomplying sewage plants have tried to qualify for 
waivers permitting them to discharge directly into the ocean after 
primary filtering and settling treatment removing roughly 40 
percent of pollution 
applicants must show they will not degrade local water quality 
it is a high hurdle to get over thomas said and only a 
quarter are successful 
marzullah said his office and the state of california filed a 
joint suit wednesday against the city of san diego san diego had 
won tentative approval for a waiver in 1981 but that approval was 
reversed in 1986 and the city withdrew its application a year and a 
half ago 
some communities had gambled on the availability of federal 
grants and they could now be out of luck the roughly 2 billion 
in annual grants is being converted to revolving loan funds in each 
state to be completed by 1994 
epa has distributed 42 billion in grants since 1972 when the 
clean water act originally set a 1977 deadline twice extended 
since then 
president nixon vetoed the 1972 act on the grounds it was too 
expensive but was overridden president reagan twice vetoed the 
last renewal trying to hold the authorization to 12 billion 
through 1994 instead of the 18 billion congress approved 
but congress passed it successfully in 1987

the interstate commerce commission heard from 
two railroads wednesday that are vying for the purchase of the 
southern pacific railroad which is on the auction block because of 
a failed merger attempt last year 
the santa fe pacific corp had agreed to sell its southern 
pacific subsidiary to rio grande industries inc the parent 
company of the denver amp rio grande western railroad for 102 
billion 
but the deal which requires icc approval has run into strong 
opposition from kansas city southern industries operator of the 
kansas city southern railroad which has offered 125 billion for 
the 13000mile rail system that stretches from kansas city to the 
west coast 
the icc heard from both railroads wednesday as it tries to 
determine which buyer to choose or whether it might approve both 
applications and allow santa fe to choose 
a decision is expected next month 
samuel freeman an attorney for rio grande industries told the 
icc in formal arguments that the company is in better financial 
position to buy the southern pacific than is kansas city southern 
the request by kansas city southern that it be allowed to buy 
the railroad is unprecedented and unwarranted he said 
rio grande officials noted that kansas city southern faces a 
possible 600 million settlement from a legal entanglement that 
grew out of its role in the a failure of a coal slurry pipeline 
project 
kansas city southern however maintained before the icc that it 
would be the most fit buyer of the southern pacific arguing that 
it is offering more money and plans to invest 20 percent more funds 
in the railroad than the rio grande 
we are committed to the acquisition and rehabilitation of the 
southern pacific said landon rowland president of kansas city 
southern industries he said the company would invest more than 4 
billion in the railroad over a fiveyear period 
kansas city southern has accused the santa fe pacific corp of 
favoring the lower rio grande bid because the merger would benefit 
the santa fe railroad the other rail line owned by santa fe 
pacific corp 
jerome donohoe representing santa fe pacific said the company 
has a binding contract with rio grande and could not complete the 
sale this year if the icc were to choose kansas city southern 
the southern pacific was put up for sale under an icc 
divestiture order after the icc last year rejected a planned merger 
of the southern pacific with the santa fe

the majority of americans cant find great 
britain france japan or the persian gulf on the map and have no 
idea of what the us population is according to surveys conducted 
by the gallup organization and the national geographic society 
moreover americans in the 1824 age group ranked last when 
their survey results were compared to similar tests conducted in 
eight other nations said the society which sponsored the 
international testing americans of all age group scored sixth 
i have a terrible feeling that the american public is not 
taking education as seriously as they have in the past and its 
not just geography you are seeing this across the board said 
society president gilbert m grosvenor at a news conference 
wednesday 
the survey results indicated that three out of four americans 
couldnt locate the persian gulf most couldnt come close to 
guessing their own nations population and the majority were lost 
when it came to finding britain france or japan 
what was most alarming was not only that young americans did 
worse than all other 18 to 24yearolds but that they were the 
only ones in that age group among nine countries who did worse 
than the oldest group tested grosvenor said 
were not motivating our kids to take education seriously 
he said noting recent national science foundation studies ranking 
us students well below their foreign counterparts in scientific 
fields 
to combat this the society has launched a multimilliondollar 
public awareness campaign on the problem he said 
the campaign includes the initiation of a national geography bee 
for secondary students a training program for the nations 15000 
geography and social studies teachers and the free distribution of 
an atlas of us history in 35000 public private and parochial 
schools 
another component involves the development of computer softwear 
learning tools and a laser disc version of the atlas the laser 
disc scheduled for release in late 1989 is a joint project with 
apple computer and lucas films producers of star wars 
the international survey tested 10820 adults in canada france 
italy japan mexico sweden the united kingdom the united states 
and west germany those surveyed were asked to locate 13 selected 
countries central america the pacific ocean and the persian gulf 
on an unmarked world map 
out of a possible score of 16 the americans ranked sixth with 
an average of 86 on par with the british 85 but significantly 
better than only the italians 76 and mexicans 74 top honors 
went to the swedes 116 and west germans 112 followed by the 
japanese 97 french 93 and canadians 92 
american youth received a score of 69 the lowest mark of all 
youth tested and all other us age groups 
overall 75 percent of americans placed the persian gulf in the 
red sea the mediterranean the black sea or the indian ocean 
fortyfive percent did not know where central america is 
located onethird identified vietnam and less than half the 
americans were able to identify the united kingdom france south 
africa and japan 
in a multiplechoice question 57 percent of americans tested 
did not have a remote idea about the current us population most 
participants in sweden japan and canada chose the correct range 
from a field of four 150 to 300 million 
in addition to the international quiz a more comprehensive 
battery of 81 questions including a world map test was 
administered to 1611 americans by gallup 
the results which gallup senior study director jeffrey s 
friedman says can be projected to the us population at large 
include 
not more than half of adult americans know that the sandinistas 
and contras are fighting in nicaragua and not in iran lebanon or 
afghanistan 
about onethird could name four of the 16 nato member 
countries another third failed to name any and 16 percent of those 
questioned conferred membership on the soviet union 
fifty percent failed to name any members of the warsaw pact 20 
percent could name four and more than one in 10 erroneously made 
the us a member 
only 55 percent identified south africa as the nation where

two californians testified wednesday that drug 
tests which produced erroneous findings cost them their jobs and 
caused terrible disruptions to their lives 
collette clark of san diego and alan pettigrew of san francisco 
told a house investigations subcommittee that they were required to 
take a urinalysis which proved positive although both said they 
were not illegal drug users 
each was fired but got their jobs back after filing a lawsuit 
against their employers 
ms clark took a test because her employer san diego gas and 
electric co required one for all new employees and those who were 
to be promoted a data entry operator she was fired after her drug 
test showed positive for marijuana 
after she filed suit in 1986 it was determined that not only 
were the results of her tests invalid but the confirmatory test 
which the laboratory claimed it conducted was in fact never 
done her suit was settled out of court 
i think that drug testing in the workplace is machiavellian in 
that the end result does not justify the means ms clark told 
the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations drugs in the workplace or any place else are 
wrong but so is drug testing and two wrongs have never made a 
right 
i do not think that a persons livelihood should depend on a 
lab test result she said i know that i will never allow 
myself to be left open to chance again that if i have to submit to 
the indignity of giving another urine sample it will be on my own 
terms through my own choice of a lab and my own personal 
physician 
there are bills pending in congress calling for regulation of 
drugtesting labs 
pettigrew was fired in 1985 as office manager for the vice 
president of operations at southern pacific transportation co 
after a random urine test showed positive for cocaine 
after filing suit and being reinstated at southern pacific as a 
purchasing manager his attorney established that the company was 
unable to find a positive reading for cocaine seven months after 
his initial urinalysis in the confirmation test 
while i may be an example of what can go wrong with a false 
positive my example cannot and should not be shrugged off as 
being an exception and not the rule he said one simple 
seemingly innocent urine test ruined my career my life and the 
health and welfare of my family 
while drug testing may be seen as a way to cure this countrys 
drug problems as long as there is the possibility of error in test 
results and error in human judgment drug testing in itself is a 
fallacy pettigrew said

researchers have taken the first steps 
toward understanding the causes and the inheritance of asthma with 
the discovery of two asthmarelated genes in laboratory mice 
roy levitt of the johns hopkins medical institutions in 
baltimore said wednesday that learning how these genes work could 
help doctors identify people at risk for asthma and also could 
speed the development of better drugs to treat it 
so far levitt and wayne mitzner also of johns hopkins have 
shown that at least two genes can produce a hypersensitivity in the 
bronchial tubes of mice 
the increased sensitivity of the airways to drugs or 
environmental agents a phenomenon called increased bronchial 
reactivity is one of the hallmarks of asthma levitt and 
mitzner write in the current issue of the faseb journal published 
by the federation of american societies for experimental biology 
asthma is estimated to afflict about 6 percent of the 
population levitt said 
levitt who presented his findings at a genetics course at the 
jackson laboratory in bar harbor said increased bronchial 
reactivity can lead both to asthma and to a serious lung disorder 
called chronic obstructive lung disease in which patients 
experience extreme difficulty breathing 
the causes of asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease are 
not known but inherited genetic factors and exposure to agents in 
the environment both play a role levitt said 
studies of families in which asthma was inherited showed that 
even some family members without asthma had inherited an increased 
bronchial reactivity 
this seemed to suggest there could be a simple genetic basis 
for airway hyperreactivity asthma and chronic obstructive lung 
disease levitt said 
he and mitzner developed machines to monitor breathing in 
laboratory mice and they have determined that at least two 
different genes in mice can lead to this bronchial sensitivity 
it is not yet known whether these genes have counterparts in 
humans levitt said 
one of the genes has been shown to be inherited in mice as a 
recessive genetic trait meaning that an offspring would have to 
inherit the defective gene from both of its parents in order to 
have bronchial hyperreactivity mice do not develop asthma levitt 
said 
the inheritance pattern of asthma in humans is not known levitt 
said 
further studies of the asthmarelated genes in mice should allow 
researchers to look for similar genes in humans he said 
in order to demonstrate the bronchial hyperreactivity in the 
mice the researchers had to expose the mice to agents thought to 
be related to the development of asthma in humans 
these agents called serotonin and acetylcholine are natural 
substances used by nerve cells to communicate with one another 
some mice were sensitive to one of the agents some to the other 
and some to both 
studies of the different mice eventually led levitt and mitzner 
to conclude that at least two different genes in the mice could 
contribute to bronchial hyperreactivity

an opposition legislator warned 
wednesday that a nuclearpowered soviet satellite could spread 
radiation across europe when it falls to earth later this year 
gerhard schmid a federal lawmaker in the opposition social 
democrats said the entire european economic community lies in 
the geographical range of the falling satellites path and that 
the area could be peppered with radioactive debris 
schmid said soviet officials confirmed the satellite left orbit 
and was expected to reenter the atmosphere in september western 
sources have said it could crash in august or earlier 
tass the official soviet news agency has reported that radio 
contact was lost in april with the cosmos 1900 satellite launched 
dec 12 1987 
in his statement schmid called for precautions without saying 
what they should be he announced he had sent a letter about the 
satellite to jacques delors president of the european economic 
community commission 
the soviets have put 33 nuclearpowered satellites into space 
when one of them reentered the atmosphere in 1978 it rained 
thousands of pieces of radioactive debris on canada

the environmental lobby scored a longsought 
victory wednesday as the house passed 36147 a bill to overhaul the 
commercial timbering program in the tongass national forest in 
alaska 
the measure sent to the senate would scrap the 1980 law that 
guarantees the us forest service at least 40 million a year to 
support timber sales from the nations biggest national forest and 
the continents last large temperate rain forest 
supporters of the bill like the wilderness society say the 
guarantee unique among us forests has not only destroyed 
ancient trees but handed huge losses to taxpayers with tongass 
sales posting a deficit of 254 million from 1982 through 1987 
alaskas lone house member republican don young argued that 
the bill repudiates a deal made in 1980 with environmentalists when 
congress put huge portions of alaskas vast acreage offlimits to 
development 
young said that in return for allowing 85 million of the 
forests 17 million acres to be declared wilderness alaska 
lawmakers won the spending guarantee and another requiring the 
forest service to make an average of 450 million board feet of 
tongass timber available for sale each year 
the leisure lobby now wants to go back on its word said 
young who argued that the guarantees are necessary to preserve 
some 6000 timberrelated jobs in southeast alaska 
its a matter of jobs young said there are peoples 
livelihoods at stake 
house supporters of the bill argued that the tongass region 
should be looking to tourism and commercial fishing for economic 
growth they said overharvesting the tongass hurts both tourism 
and fisheries 
besides getting rid of the guarantees the overhaul bill 
sponsored principally by rep robert mrazek dny would put 
another 17 million tongass acres offlimits to timber cutting for 
five years 
much of the tongass timber is sold to two large corporations 
louisiana pacificketchikan and the japaneseowned alaska lumber 
and pulp co which turn it into pulp chiefly for export to japan 
the bill would require the forest service to renegotiate the 
50year contracts it entered into with these firms in the 1950s 
rep george miller dcalif the bills floor manager said new 
contracts are needed to encourage competition in tongass timbering 
prevent excessive cutting of oldgrowth stands and ensure the firms 
will pay more for tongass trees 
miller said that a mature sitka spruce from tongass now sells 
for 148 compared to 2 for a map of the national forest

the man conducting a private probe into 
the unsolved assassination of prime minister olof palme told a 
hearing wednesday that authorities knew palmes life may have been 
in danger but failed to act 
if it is not a conspiracy it is a stupidity so big that i 
cant believe it exists even inside the security police ebbe 
carlsson told the constitutional committee in a hearing carried 
live on national television 
carlsson also made note of wide reports of his homosexuality 
saying he had never made a secret of it and that it had nothing to 
do with his investigation of palmes assassination 
palme the dominant figure in swedens postworld war ii 
politics was shot in stockholm on feb 28 1986 as he was leaving 
a movie theater with his wife he was unguarded police failed to 
find the killer or establish a motive 
carlsson a publisher and editor last year organized a secret 
unauthorized probe into the killing with financial help from a 
banker 
the investigation led to an uproar when it was revealed in the 
press along with reports that carlsson subordinates tried to 
smuggle illegal eavesdropping equipment into sweden 
justice minister annagreta leijon who had secretly helped 
carlsson resigned under pressure june 7 
carlsson has said he thought palme was killed by kurdish exiles 
possibly acting on orders from iran his theory holds that iranian 
leaders were angry with palme because he tried to stop illegal 
weapons sales to iran 
carlsson said he spoke with the head of security police the day 
before palme was killed and was told that police learned from a 
telephone tap that members of the kurdish workers party in sweden 
were planning an assassination 
neither olof palme nor his colleagues got any part of the 
information that the security police had carlsson said 
the kurds are an ethnic group seeking a separate state in part 
of iran and iraq a small group of leftist kurdish exiles known as 
the kurdish workers party were mentioned in several reports during 
the police investigation as perhaps organizing palmes killing 
the palme government classified the group as a terrorist 
organization and sentenced two of its purported members to life 
imprisonment for killing two defectors from the group 
leading police and government officials including prime 
minister ingvar carlsson no relation to the publisher were also 
scheduled to testify before the standing committee on the 
constitution an independent parliamentary body that acts as a 
watchdog to insure that the government follows the constitution

the us economy grew at a slightly faster 
rate than previously believed in 1987 and 1985 although the country 
did experience one quarter in 1986 when the economy actually 
contracted the government said wednesday 
the commerce department announced those findings as it released 
updated statistics on the gross national product the countrys 
total output of goods and services 
each year the government goes back and revises its earlier 
estimates of gnp growth to take into account additional 
information the revisions boosted growth rates in 1987 and 1985 
while lowering the growth rate slightly in 1986 
the government said it underestimated growth rates in large part 
because it failed to record all of the consumer spending that 
occurred in previous years 
the largest revision took place in 1987 gnp growth for that 
year is now estimated at 34 percent up from a previous estimate 
of 29 percent growth 
gnp growth in 1985 was revised up to 34 percent compared with 
an earlier estimate of 3 percent growth growth for 1986 was 
lowered to 28 percent instead of the previous 29 percent 
in addition the government reported that the economy actually 
contracted in one quarter in 1986 falling by 08 percent in the 
second quarter instead of rising by 06 percent as previously 
believed 
however that onequarter decline was not enough to spell an end 
to the current recovery from the 198182 recession one of the most 
commonly used definitions of a recession is two consecutive 
quarters of declining gnp 
the 08 percent decline in the gnp from april to june of 1986 
was followed by a 1 percent rise in the gnp in the third quarter 
that year 
commerce undersecretary robert ortner said it was not at all 
unusual to have one or two isolated quarters of declining gnp 
during long expansions the current recovery from the 198182 
recession has lasted a peacetime record of 68 months 
we have not had a recession ortner said when asked about 
the decline in the spring of 1986 in an expansion you get one 
or two isolated down quarters which reflect isolated 
circumstances 
officials said the longest recovery on record the 106month 
expansion from february 1961 to december 1969 which included the 
vietnam war buildup had two negative quarters 
the previous recordholder for peacetime expansions the 
58month recovery from march 1975 to january 1980 had three 
isolated quarters of declining gnp

negotiators for the chicago amp north western 
railway and united transportation union have ended facetoface 
meetings but they remain willing to talk if it will avert an aug 
4 strike the two sides said wednesday 
in an order preventing an earlier walkout president reagan said 
a strike against campnw would disrupt essential rail shipping in 
several midwest states and halt service for 40000 chicagoarea 
commuters 
two days of bargaining in the presence of federal mediators 
ended tuesday without a settlement and the company said no new 
sessions were planned 
chicago amp north western spokesman james foote was quoted 
wednesday as saying the company would go ahead with plans to 
eliminate the jobs of 1156 brakemen next week and that the union 
can strike 
however another spokesman said campnw remains willing to 
negotiate 
we have left the door open for further talks if the unions 
willing to come and sit down north westerns fred bloedorn said 
but if theres no hint that theres going to be any place to 
negotiate theres no sense in meeting for nothing 
utu president fred hardin meanwhile said his union would 
return to the bargaining table whenever the company wants to talk 
were perfectly willing to negotiate and attempt to resolve 
it hardin said but the carrier seems determined to 
precipitate a strike 
chicago amp north western wants to eliminate the jobs of 1156 of 
its 2600 unionized brakemen changing the makeup of most train 
crews from an engineer conductor and two brakemen to only an 
engineer and conductor 
the nations eighthlargest rail carrier said it could save 51 
million a year and become more competitive if it made the cuts but 
the union said the action would compromise safety and violate its 
contract 
utu members threatened to walk off the job at 1201 am aug 4 
if the company makes the cuts 
an emergency board appointed by the president in april to 
intervene in the dispute issued a report july 1 proposing the 
layoff of 689 brakemen cuttng one brakeman per train in most cases 
and both brakemen when approved by an arbitrator on a 
trainbytrain basis 
both sides rejected the report the union calling it too 
sweeping and the company saying it didnt go far enough 
union and company bargainers had broken off negotiations on 
march 22 but resumed talks monday under the supervision of the 
national mediation board 
if either party refuses to meet theres not much we can do 
about it said charles r barnes executive director of the

on charges they took part in an operation that may have shipped 
hundreds of tons of highly potent marijuana to the united states 
for years 
the indictments stemmed from the us coast guards seizure last 
month of 72 tons of pot worth an estimated 280 million from a 
ship off the washington coast the ship was from southeast asia 
among those charged in the 10count indictment was brian peter 
daniels a new yorker living in bangkok thailand who was 
identified as the organizer of the operation 
daniels 42 who was arrested monday in switzerland was one 
of the major suppliers of marijuana to the united states said 
gary liming agentincharge of the us drug enforcement 
administration office in seattle 
daniels was charged with conducting a continuing criminal 
enterprise the most serious of federal drug crimes as well as 
conspiracy to import and distribute marijuana 
also indicted was the 18member crew aboard the encounter bay 
when it was seized june 30 about 500 miles off the washington 
coast four others not on the ship also were charged 
among crew members indicted was samuel colflesh the master of 
the encounter bay his twin brother robert also was charged and 
remains at large both were originally from pennsylvania and have 
been living in bangkok 
all were charged with possession with intent to distribute more 
than 1000 kilograms of marijuana and with conspiring to import a 
like amount of the illegal plant into the united states 
us attorney gene anderson and liming said the indictment ends 
a fouryear effort to break up daniels alleged operation 
anderson and liming said in a statement that agents posing as 
fisherman brought about last months bust 
the highgrade thai marijuana aboard encounter bay passed 
through thailand laos and vietnam before the coast guard seized 
the drugs on june 30 court documents say 
papers filed in us district court said daniels and five other 
men met may 5 in a hong kong hotel room to plan a shipment aboard 
the converted oil rig supply ship 
two of the men were larry brant and helmut witt undercover 
agents with the drug enforcement administration who posed as 
fishermen willing to use their boats to unload marijuana off the 
washington coast for a cut of the profits they were introduced by 
mutual associates the court documents said 
the agents said the others at the meeting included the colflesh 
brothers and michael forwell an australian who the agents said 
established a hong kong company called trademax to hire a crew 
launder money and handle other arrangements 
the dea concluded that daniels would supply the marijuana 
affidavits said he was known to the dea as a major supplier of 
thai marijuana since the early 1980s and agency files listed him 
as the head of a marijuana growing operation in thailand the 
seattle postintelligencer reported wednesday 
brant and witt said that in april they were shown a vessel in 
hong kong the agents were told it was similar to the one that 
would transport the marijuana court documents revealed the dea 
was able to learn the vessel to be used in the operation was the 
encounter bay which left singapore june 2 according to the ships 
log 
the marijuana was loaded onto the encounter bay from daniels 
vessel the meridian in the south china sea off da nang vietnam 
about june 10 according to court documents 
vietnamese soldiers were involved in the loading operation a

theater near the banks of the moscow river gave the american 
director composer and musician a standing ovation that lasted for 
more than 10 minutes at the programs end

schleswigholstein music festival orchestra in soviet composer 
dmitri shostakovichs symphony no 1 and in his own work titled 
songfest 
bernstein wielded the baton with his customary brio punching 
the air with his fist to show when piano chords should sound 
swaying from side to side during a lyrical string passage and 
waving his left hand to coax more volume out of the young 
musicians whose average age is 23 
the concert was his second in moscow with the orchestra which 
includes musicians from 20 countries he led the group at 
tchaikovsky hall on tuesday the ensemble will also play on 
thursday in the mirror hall of hermitage park 
bernstein whose compositions include the stage musical west 
side story told reporters he hopes the performances will 
increase world understanding as well as promote changes launched 
under mikhail s gorbachev the communist party chief and soviet 
leader 
i admire infinitely more mr gorbachev than i do george bush 
the us vice president and republican presidential candidate 
from a point of view of statesmanship he told a news conference 
held at the ministry of culture 
i hope in whatever small way we can to increase feelings of 
friendship and love between peoples of different cultures 
backgrounds and political systems and to encourage as much as 
possible the progressive movements taking place in this country as 
i work for them in my country 
proceeds from the concerts are being paid to the soviet cultural 
fund and the lenin childrens fund according to concert organizers 
and culture ministry officials tickets for wednesdays performance 
cost 5

i understand its sometimes not easy especially when youre

in fact youve already been called such things because youve 
stood up for christ she said 
when it comes to drugs the reason for such putdowns is that 
youre a danger youre a danger to the drug attitudes that have 
ruled this country for the past two decades 
she said young people who oppose illicit drug use should 
persevere in their efforts to stop it 
young people have more power to stop drugs than all our drug

striking scriptwriters returned to picket 
lines wednesday after a marathon bargaining session failed to 
resolve differences between writers and producers that have hobbled 
most hollywood production 
meanwhile the writers bargaining position appeared to be 
strengthened when a group of dissident writers announced they would 
not break away from the union as they had threatened 
a federal mediator called off talks between negotiators for the 
writers guild of america and the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers tuesday morning after a 20hour session failed 
to settle the dispute now in its 21st week new talks are expected 
to be announced soon 
the latest talks which began on saturday were conducted under 
a news blackout and details of the negotiations have been limited 
more than 1500 members of the writers guild picketed at warner 
bros and columbia studios and at the offices of television 
producer aaron spelling said wga spokeswoman cheryl rhoden 
pickets drew encouragement from tuesday nights announcement by 
a splinter group called the writers coalition that they would not 
resign from the guild the coalition said it will support the 
bargaining process until it is either successfully concluded or 
proves barren 
the group had been widely blamed for splitting the guild in a 
1985 strike and union members had expressed fears that any 
resignations now would weaken their bargaining stance 
its a victory for guild solidarity daniel petrie jr 
author of beverly hills cop and the big easy and an 
outspoken critic of the coalition said while picketing outside 
warner bros and columbia it will make the negotiating process a 
lot cleaner 
twilight zone and star trek writer harlan ellison said 
there is total solidarity its like the old days of organizing 
the auto plants 
neal marshall a member of the writers coalition refused to 
comment wednesday about the strike and the coalitions change of 
heart 
in a further show of guild unity more than 150 leading writers 
took out advertisements in entertainment industry newspapers 
wednesday supporting the guilds bargaining position 
the writers coalition claims to represent the lions share of 
working writers the advertisement reads this claim is both 
offensively elitist and patently untrue 
the statement was signed by billy wilder sunset boulevard 
william goldman all the presidents men glen and les charles 
cheers and gary david goldberg family ties 
the writers and producers remained divided mainly on payments

the wellreceived democratic national convention 
boosted michael dukakis to his biggest lead of the presidential 
campaign 18 points over vice president george bush in a poll 
released wednesday 
dukakis drew 50 percent support to 32 percent for bush in the 
nbc newswall street journal national survey of 1770 registered 
voters dukakis had led by 10 points 4636 in a preconvention 
nbcjournal poll 
the national nominating conventions often provide candidates a 
boost in the polls especially when the conventions proceed as 
harmoniously as the democrats did last week the bounce usually 
settles as the race proceeds 
other recent surveys have found the jump in dukakis support 
two gallup polls done after the convention had the massachusetts 
governor ahead by 17 points and he led by 10 points in one poll 
and by 12 in another conducted during the convention 
the nbcjournal poll found women providing a major component of 
dukakis support a continuation of the gender gap suffered by 
bush dukakis led by 30 points among women 5424 compared to a 
sixpoint lead among men 
the poll also found that twothirds of the democrats who bolted 
the party to vote for president reagan said they would come back 
and vote for dukakis over bush and it said 71 percent of 
respondents and 52 percent of blacks believed dukakis had treated 
jesse jackson fairly at the convention 
the survey was conducted by telephone saturday through monday 
among a random sample of adult americans it had a margin of error 
of three points

in the wake of the drowning death of a 
recruit the navy has reviewed its training programs and concluded 
that there were no major problems a top service official said 
wednesday 
the results of the review indicated that there were problems 
but they were not severe and with few exceptions training was 
being conducted in a safe and proper manner said vice adm nils 
r thunman chief of the navys education and training branch 
we found no major systemic problems he told a house armed 
services subcommittee other than the rescue swimmer school 
there were no training areas in which the cumulative effects of 
improper supervision incorrect practices and poor administration 
were degrading the safety of training 
the review was conducted after the march 2 death of a 
19yearold recruit at the rescue swimmer school at pensacola fla 
five enlisted navy instructors have been charged in the case 
including one who was charged with involuntary manslaughter the 
other four were charged with conspiracy to commit battery 
the recruit lee mirecki died after he panicked climbed out of 
a pool shouted that he was quitting and then had his head held 
under water 
thunman said the navy trains 80000 officer and enlisted 
students daily in 3200 different courses at 29 bases all of them 
were reviewed in the wake of the mirecki case to make sure they 
were safe he told the military personnel subcommittee 
some training rules have been changed for example thunman 
said students will have the opportunity in course critiques to 
comment on training practices they thought were unsafe and whether 
the instructors were sensitive to safety issues 
in addition instructors will be evaluated on whether they 
maintain safe practices he said 
a top pentagon official told the subcommittee that the defense 
department has a good safety record considering the dangerous 
nature of much of military training and the large number of 
personnel trained 
but the pentagon is still trying to improve its record said 
marine lt gen anthony lukeman deputy assistant secretary of 
defense for manpower

the nations only opposition 
newspaper la prensa returned to print wednesday counterpunching 
after its 15day shutdown by the government 
the newspapers wednesday edition accused the leftist sandinista 
government of violating the central american peace plan known in 
the region as esquipulas ii it ran a special section with a banner 
headline saying five simultaneous blows to esquipulas ii 
the government ordered closure of the 60yearold newspaper on 
july 11 the day after a large opposition rally in the southern 
city of nandaime ended in violence between sandinista police and 
demonstrators about 40 protesters were arrested 
the government accused la prensa of reporting falsely on the 
protest and of inciting violence disorder and disrespect for 
authorities 
la prensa denied any wrongdoing 
the newspaper countered wednesday that the government had dealt 
several recent blows to the regional peace plan it cited its 
own suspension the actions of police at nandaime the expulsion of 
us ambassador richard melton and seven american diplomats accused 
of backing a plan to destabilize the sandinista government and the 
expropriation of nicaraguas largest private surgar mill 
at the same time the government closed la prensa it also took 
off the air for an undetermined time the roman catholic radio 
station radio catolica as well as a private news show on the 
radio noticias station 
on sunday the interior ministry announced a 48hour suspension 
of a news broadcast by the staunchly antigovernment superior 
private enterprise council a ministry statement said the program 
transmitted false news but it did not elaborate 
the sandinistas maintained strict media censorship from 1982 
until last january when a state of emergency was lifted 
la prensa was shut down for 15 months on june 26 1986 a day 
after the us congress approved 100 million in aid for the contra 
rebels fighting the nicaraguan government 
radio catolica was closed for almost two years for failing to 
broadcast president daniel ortegas yearend address on dec 31 
1985 
they both were allowed to reopen last october under the regional 
peace plan signed aug 7 1987 by the presidents of nicaragua el

the office of government ethics said wednesday 
it has launched an analysis of attorney general edwin meese iiis 
activities in the wake of an 814page report stemming from a 
criminal investigation of the attorney general 
oge director frank nebeker said the analysis is under way and 
that the office will respond to a request from sen carl levin 
dmich for the results of the ethics offices study 
the justice departments office of professional responsibility 
is conducting a separate ethics inquiry of meese based on the 
departments standards of conduct for employees 
nebeker said he is reviewing the lengthy report on meese by 
independent counsel james mckay reports by levins subcommittee on 
oversight of government management and tuesdays testimony by 
former deputy attorney general arnold burns and excriminal 
division chief william weld 
he is reviewing all these sources with a view toward 
determining whether there existed any violation of a 1965 
executive order or model standards of conduct issued by the ethics 
office said nebeker 
nebekers comments came following a request from levin who said 
he wants the ethics office to launch an inquiry of meeses 
acceptance of benefits from longtime friend e robert wallach 
meeses actions at wallachs request on behalf of wedtech corp 
and a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline project may have violated a 
1965 executive order detailing standards of ethical conduct for 
government officers levin said in a letter to nebeker 
those standards prohibit an official from taking anything of 
value from someone who is seeking to obtain business with the 
officials agency the standards also direct federal employees to 
avoid conduct which might create the appearance of using public 
office for private gain or giving preferential treatment to someone 
or adversely affecting the confidence of the public in the 
integrity of government 
levins request follows the report on the attorney general 
issued july 18 by mckay who decided not to seek an indictment of 
meese even though mckay concluded he probably broke two tax laws 
and twice violated a federal conflictofinterest statute 
mckay found no basis for action in connection with meeses 
involvement with wedtech the iraqi oil pipeline project or his 
dealings with financial manager w franklyn chinn to whom meese 
was steered by wallach 
chinn turned a 40000 profit for meese on a 55000 investment 
in just 18 months mckay reached no conclusions on meeses ethical 
behavior 
mckay said that among the benefits meese received from wallach 
were arranging two loans for him arranging for chinn to be meeses 
financial manager and helping to arrange a 40000ayear job for 
meeses wife ursula 
in an appearance tuesday before the senate judiciary committee 
william weld former head of the justice departments criminal 
division said he concluded before resigning in protest march 29 
that meeses conduct gave the appearance of partiality to wallach 
and constituted the use of meeses public office for private gain 
weld said he told meese that the attorney general probably also 
had violated the federal gratuities law he said that if meese were 
an ordinary citizen he probably would have been prosecuted for 
taking gratuities from wallach who is a san francisco attorney and 
longtime friend of meese 
in his letter to nebeker levin said although mr meese has 
announced his intention to leave office in the next month a 
determination of the relevant ethics issues remains important 
particularly because of the visibility of this case and mr meeses 
continued strong denial of any impropriety on his part 
without a public finding on these issues questions will 
remain as to whether such conduct was in accordance with the 
standards of conduct applicable to all federal employees levin 
added 
in response justice department spokesman patrick korten said 
levin does know how to beat a dead horse korten said it is 
supremely ironic that levin who played a key role in enacting 
legislation reauthorizing independent counsels should be so 
unwilling to accept an independent counsels findings as final 
the office of professional responsibility is using mckays 
report as a basis 
opr counsel michael shaheen has not yet decided precisely what 
areas to focus on in regard to meeses activities according to 
government sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
in addition to the inquiry by opr and the analysis by the ethics 
office the state bar of california has requested a copy of mckays 
report to review meeses conduct meese is licensed to practice law 
in california 
opr can recommend a range of actions against a federal employee 
including dismissal but meese is leaving government next month to 
join the conservative heritage foundation

police arrested about 30 students who 
held a demonstration outside us army headquarters wednesday 
demanding expulsion of us troops and marking the 35th anniversary 
of the korean wars end 
students yelled yankee go home and tried to stage a 
peaceful sitdown protest at us 8th army headquarters in southern 
seoul but hundreds of riot officers forced them into police buses 
at the national assembly officials said the legislators were 
ready to accept a request from communist north korea for talks on a 
nonaggression pact and the norths possible participation in the 
olympic games in september the war began in 1950 when the north 
invaded south korea 
about 2000 radical students and dissidents rallied later in the 
day at korea university then half the crowd marched to the us 
embassy 
thousands of riot police followed the march blocked the way 
less than a mile from the embassy and persuaded the protesters to 
move into a nearby park where they dispersed voluntarily 
down with the united states which forced partition of the 
korean peninsula protesters shouted demanding the withdrawal of 
42000 american soldiers based here under a defense treaty 
the united states and 15 other nations intervened on south 
koreas side during the war and china supported north korea the 
war ended in a stalemate and armistice july 27 1953 but the two 
koreas remain technically at war because no treaty has been signed 
radical students say the united states is responsible for the 
peninsulas continued division and claim it treats the south as a 
colony they have called for immediate reunification but have 
little public support 
assembly officials said representatives of the top four 
political parties and speaker kim chaesun agreed to accept the 
north korean offer and the agreement would be conveyed to 
pyongyang north koreas capital on aug 1 after party leaders 
give formal approval 
lawmakers added however that they want preliminary talks at 
the panmunjom border truce village to work out preliminary details 
for negotiations they recommended a meeting in the second week of 
august 
the south is ready to take up the olympic issue and does not 
want to limit the agenda one aide said 
north korea has indicated it does not want preliminary talks 
south korean media reports earlier this week said north korea 
considered them a waste of time 
the north koreans sent a proposal to the south last week calling 
for talks between their legislatures on a nonaggression pact and 
suggested the first round be held in pyongyang 
in a second letter tuesday the north said it also was ready to 
discuss entering the olympics in seoul on condition its demand to 
be cohost was discussed 
south korea and the international olympic committee have refused 
to let the north be cohost because the games are awarded to a 
single city the north has said it will boycott the games 
three previous rounds of talks on easing tension and 
establishing relations ended in failure the north ended the most 
recent series in 1986

the senate adopted an amendment wednesday 
which would allow the united states to move its embassy in israel 
to jerusalem despite the international controversy over such a step 
the amendment proposed by sen jesse helms rnc was 
incorporated into a 15 billion appropriations bill adopted by the 
senate for the 1989 funding of the state justice and commerce 
departments 
helms provision authorizes funds for building two diplomatic 
facilities in israel provided that each one equally preserves 
the ability of the united states to locate its ambassador or its 
consul general at that site 
the helms amendment also would not allow the administration to 
designate either building as the new embassy until construction of 
one is near completion the amendment does not give a dollar figure 
for the construction project 
the us embassy along with nearly all the other foreign 
missions in israel currently is located in tel aviv even though 
israel considers jerusalem its capital the united states has a 
consulate in jewish west jerusalem and another in the predominantly 
arab east jerusalem 
us policy over more than two decades has been to leave the 
embassy in tel aviv as long as the status of jerusalem has not been 
resolved by international arbitration especially contentious is 
the question of israels 1967 annexation of east jerusalem which 
it captured from jordan in what is known as the sixday war 
the question of the embassys location is a very emotional one 
for moslems around the world who consider jerusalem as one of 
their most venerated shrines the state department unwilling to 
offend the moslem world has fought to keep the embassy from moving 
there 
the issue has periodically come up during us election 
campaigns serving as a litmus test for a candidates support of 
israel 
michael dukakis the democratic candidate this year said in an 
interview recently that he would favor locating the embassy in 
jerusalem because that is the city israel considers its capital 
helms who wants the embassy moved said in floor debate on his 
proposal that because both new facilities will be equally capable 
of serving as our embassy subsequent presidents will be able to 
select which site should serve as the us embassy 
for the past three years helms has blocked the state 
departments request to build a new embassy in tel aviv and a new 
consulate in jerusalem the current buildings are old and crowded 
the bill now goes to a joint housesenate conference committee 
to iron out differences

us air force pilots sometimes 
take drugs to help them stay awake on long flights the air force 
said wednesday a rash of accidents have caused worry about the 
safety of lowlevel training flights 
the air force was responding to a report on west german 
television tuesday nights broadcast by ard television network 
said us air force pilots assigned to west germany take the drug 
dextroamphetamine dexedrine to increase their alertness while in 
flight 
ard quoted an unidentified a us military officer as saying air 
force pilots routinely use dexedrine 
pilots use the drug so that they are able to fly when they 
havent gotten enough sleep or dont feel fit enough ard quoted 
the officer as saying 
the ard report also said pilots then take the sedative seconal 
at night to counteract the effects of dexedrine 
however in an official statement from its headquarters in 
ramstein the air force stated categorically that its pilots 
do not take medication for normal daytoday training flights 
us air force jet fighters sweeping over west germany are a 
common sight while they practice lowlevel missions in designated 
areas 
worries grew after five f16 fighter jets crashed in west 
germany within three months this year 
on june 29 three us air force f16s crashed in two accidents 
in west germany one pilot was killed when two of the jets collided 
in the air 
on march 31 another air force f16 crash in the town of forst 
killing the pilot and a person on the ground the accident came one 
day after a french mirage jet fighter crashed in southern bavaria 
near a nuclear power plant 
on april 18 a pilot was slightly injured when he ejected from 
his us air force f16 as it crashed near the luxembourg border 
the air force statement said the use of stimulant and 
sedative medications is limited by regulation to flights in which 
the length or precise schedule of the mission presents a 
significant risk of flight safety due to fatigue 
dexedrine and seconal use almost exclusively involves solo 
flights to or from the united states and overseas bases it said 
lt col ed neunherz the chief spokesman at ramstein 
emphasized that a pilot would only use the sedative once hes 
back on the ground 
he could take it after hes landed to help get his body clock 
back in order neunherz told the associated press in a telephone 
interview 
he said a pilot would only take dexedrine if he felt fatigue 
during a long mission 
routine use of these medications is never advised they are to 
be used only in the event that an air crew member feels fatigue may 
jeopardize flight safety if the medications are not used the air 
forces written statement said 
in most instances the prescribed medication is not taken by 
the air crew member the statement said

complaints that the 1988 miss 
district of columbia pageant was unfair prompted contest officials 
to restage the event and now contestants say the second goround 
smacks of racism 
edwina richard was named the winner on june 24 but when 
contestants started grumbling to national pageant officials about 
the judging process the slate was scratched and the entire affair 
was repeated on saturday said leonard horn chairman of the miss 
america pageant 
noreen patricia morrin originally the fourth runnerup 
walked away the winner on saturday miss richard became first 
runnerup two of the original 13 contestants did not return horn 
said wednesday 
miss richard said she was embarrassed and humiliated by 
the incident 
id like to be the one to go to atlantic city because i won 
the first pageant fair and square she said and there was bias 
and unfairness in the second 
she told the washington times that she plans to sue the miss 
america pageant 
the second contest prompted allegations of racism since miss 
richard is black and miss morrin is white the panel of judges in 
the first pageant was predominantly black as is the population of 
the district of columbia while the second panel was mostly white 
horn defended the decision to hold a second pageant 
it was not an easy decision to make its not an easy thing to 
tell a girl who won that she has to try again he said 
but the girls were the ones up in arms he said within 24 
hours of the original pageant we started receiving complaints from 
some of the contestants who ultimately banded together and 
complained the pageant was not held fairly 
an investigation by national pageant officials revealed that at 
least one of the original judges knew several contestants horn 
said 
we learned that one judge was on the faculty of a school where 
at least two contestants were students and knew the contestants or 
at least knew of them he said 
the foundation of our system is that none of the judges knows 
anything about the contestants he said the only thing they 
should see are the four competitions which include the talent 
evening gown and swimsuit portions and a personal interview 
further investigation revealed that the director of the miss 
district of columbia pageant in his first year as head of the 
event selected the head of the judges committee to serve as a 
judge replacing one who canceled 
thats also an infraction because that committee head sees 
the young ladies in rehearsal and in circumstances other than in 
competition horn said 
the young ladies were unhappy and knew it was not fair he 
said 
the only option was to rehold the pageant horn said using 
judges selected by the national pageant office 
the director of the miss district of columbia pageant nathan 
lewis has been advised to cease and desist from any further 
activities and we are looking for a new franchise owner horn 
said 
were not impugning his integrity and were not suggesting 
improper motives he said but in his zeal to run the pageant 
he made serious errors

costa rican president oscar 
arias said wednesday that although the nations of central america 
have failed to fulfil all their obligations under a regional peace 
plan we cannot lose faith 
arias who won the 1987 nobel peace prize for the plan that he 
originated singled out nicaragua in particular for criticism 
during a brief news conference 
he said the main objective of his fivehour visit to el salvador 
was to show his affection for and solidarity with a very dear 
friend president jose napoleon duarte 
duarte has terminal liver cancer his doctors give him between 
six and 18 months to live 
i am certain that when the history of the decade of the 1980s 
in central america is written the predominant role could not be 
denied napoleon duarte for his consolidation of democracy and 
liberty here in el salvador said arias 
duarte sat at arias side but took no questions 
most of arias comments concerned the regional peace plan known 
as esquipulas ii that he duarte and the presidents of nicaragua 
honduras and guatemala signed in esquipulas guatemala on aug 7 
1987 
arias said there has been progress and there has been 
backsliding over the last 12 months 
but he said we cannot lose faith in esquipulas if the will 
existed to reach accords last aug 7 today the world demands that 
the same will exist to carry out what we committed ourselves to 
the plan called for dialogue between government and insurgents 
in el salvador nicaragua and guatemala and for political 
amnesties and greater democracy in the region 
if we weigh the plan on balance what we have achieved is more 
positive than negative arias said were not completely 
satisfied none of the central american countries has been able to 
fulfill all its obligations 
the accord helped ease hostilities between the leftist 
sandinista government and usbacked rebels in nicaragua but had 
almost no effect on the salvadoran and guatemalan civil wars 
the five presidents tentatively planned to meet on aug 7 the 
first anniversary of the peace plan 
duarte who is to leave aug 1 for a week of treatment in 
washington and president jose azcona of honduras said recently no 
plans for a summit exist arias said wednesday a summit is 
pending but with no date place or agenda as yet 
arias said regarding nicaragua 
lately the backsliding that has caused me the most pain is 
seeing the closure of la prensa and radio catolica in managua the 
jailing of demonstrators for merely wanting to freely express their 
opinions 
nicaraguan police reacted with violence to a big opposition 
rally july 10 the government later closed la prensa the only 
opposition newspaper and muzzled several broadcast outlets 
la prensa resumed publishing wednesday after a 15day suspension 
but radio catolica the roman catholic radio station is still off 
the air 
arias lamented that dogmatic and intransigent people 
dominated both sides of the nicaraguan conflict 
there are people in the contras that dont want democracy 
because they know that if there were democracy in nicaragua theyd 
have to live their whole lives in miami he said 
and there are people in the sandinista government who dont 
want democracy because they only know how to fire a machine gun 
because they find that a regime like that needs excuses and they 
find the excuses in military struggle excuses for not having 
enough food the poverty the hunger the misery 
arias also chided us secretary of state george p shultz for 
arranging to meet with only four of the five central american 
foreign ministers in guatemala city on aug 1 
if he would have asked my advice i would have recommended the 
inclusion of nicaragua arias said but he did not ask me

gov michael s dukakis put the final piece into a 
budgetbalancing puzzle before heading off wednesday on a 
presidential campaign swing 
the 124 million bill closed the books on fiscal 1988 which 
ended 27 days earlier dukakis signed the measure about 5 pm 
just before leaving his statehouse office 
unlike the fullfledged news conference dukakis held on july 17 
to announce signing a scaleddown 116 billion state budget for 
fiscal 1989 there was no fanfare to mark the governors last act 
in erasing a 400 million shortfall in fiscal 1988 
the signing of the measure was announced by the governors 
statehouse press office by title only in a list of 28 bills press 
aides could not say specifically what it contained 
the late action on the money bill was due to negotiations and 
trying to make sure we didnt have a replay of what happened with 
some of the vetoes that happened on fiscal 1989 said michael 
lelyveld spokesman for the executive office of administration and 
finance 
those problems included the announcing of cuts for legislative 
commissions and other programs which the governor later said would 
be funded 
major spending in the fiscal 1988 deficiency bill included 37 
million to help hospitals offset losses in federal medicare funds 
56 million for underfunded medicaid accounts and 32 million for 
underfunded aid to families with dependent children accounts 
the hospital medicare payments were added by the legislature to 
meet commitments under the new universal health care act the 37 
million dukakis agreed upon was still 13 million less than the 
acts full commitment of 50 million representing the largest 
veto contained in the bill

abuse center named for the governors wife kitty was threatened 
if the hospital didnt get the 2 million to 3 million 
appropriation

appropriation

the senate on wednesday approved spending 75 
million to establish a us government television service to beam 
american news and entertainment programs to cuba 
tv marti which would supplement radio marti would accelerate 
the free flow of information to our friends in cuba said sen 
ernest hollings dsc sponsor of the measure 
the money was earmarked in the 1989 budget of the us 
information agency which was included in an appropriations bill 
for the commerce state and justice departments and the judiciary 
approved 8016 the bill now goes to a housesenate conference 
committee 
the service would provide a variety of shows from news and 
information to sitcoms and soap operas 
the 75 million would cover the cost of setting up a tv studio 
recruiting and training staff and conducting a 90day operating 
test 
the national association of broadcasters opposed the tv marti 
proposal because of the possibility of retaliatory jamming by cuba 
of american radio stations and potential interference to southern 
florida tv stations from the tv marti signal itself 
but the nab applauded a provision in the bill that would hold up 
funding for full operation of the service until the senate foreign 
relations committee holds hearings and decides whether tv marti 
would violate international treaty obligations of the united states

bassam abu sharif 
as a palestinian my problem is with the israelis so i must 
speak with them said faisal husseini head of the arab studies 
institute in east jerusalem

last fall and defense minister yizhak rabin once called him the 
leading plo representative in the occupied lands husseini 
commented wednesday in a public meeting in jerusalem with israeli 
peace activists 
israel refuses to negotiate with the plo which it describes as 
a terrorist organization and plo hardliners have denounced the abu 
sharif proposal for negotiations 
the extremists patrolling east jerusalem are members of the kach 
movement which is led by americanborn rabbi meir kahane and 
advocates expelling all arabs from israeliheld lands the patrols

negative they are absolutely irresponsible elements and one has 
to do everything to stop it

career said police could handle security problems in east 
jerusalem where israeli buses often are stoned 
he accused kach followers of conducting the escorts to make 
headlines 
four kach members and an orthodox jewish journalist who 
accompanied the extremists were detained for questioning wednesday 
but were later released said police spokeswoman nurit bouton 
there was a suspicion they would be provocative ms bouton 
said israeli officials have said they can only stop the patrols if 
kach members carry unlicensed weapons or violate the law 
the worst that can happen is that some of our guys get put in 
jail for a few hours and are then released said gadi servetman 
a kach activist who volunteered to participate in a patrol 
wednesday we wont stop 
in the gaza strip refugee camp of khan yunis troops wounded a

stoned an israeli bus on the outskirts of jerusalem a settler and 
two reserve soldiers got off the bus and started chasing the 
stonethrowers the report said 
the settler fired his pistol in the air and the two soldiers 
fired their rifles the report said the settler could not have 
fired the fatal shot because he was too far from rabadi the radio

stonethrowing and was riding his bicycle when he was killed army 
officials said without elaborating that military police would now 
take up the investigation

prime minister margaret thatcher long accused of 
an insular attitude toward the rest of europe on wednesday 
dismissed as airyfairy suggestions for tighter political union 
among european economic community nations 
she also ruled out a central bank for the 12nation trade bloc 
it was mrs thatchers most outspoken criticism yet of what she 
regards as impractical overenthusiasm for some kind of united 
states of europe 
they spend far too much time talking about these airyfairy 
ideas mrs thatcher told a radio interviewer who asked her about 
proposals for a federal government for western europe 
they say lets have european union i say what do you mean 
because i cant see any of you dissolving your own countries into a 
united states of europe 
she spoke on the british broadcasting corps jimmy young 
show a mixture of chatty interviews and popular music aimed 
mainly at housewives 
last week the prime minister did not reappoint to the eec 
headquarters in brussels a british commissioner lord cockfield 
who was masterminding an alignment of sales taxes throughout the 
trade bloc a move mrs thatcher opposed 
aligning of taxes is part of preparations for 1992 when the eec 
is due to become a single market without trade barriers 
mrs thatcher replaced cockfield with leon brittan 
brittan left her cabinet in 1986 after siding with mrs thatcher 
in a dispute over a helicopter company westland and then taking 
the blame for leaking a confidential document 
critics charged that mrs thatcher has repaid brittan 48 for 
permanent exclusion from the cabinet and also hoped for a more 
amenable commissioner 
opposition labor party leader neil kinnock said wednesday that 
the prime minister sent brittan to the eec to get him out of the 
way but predicted brittan would avenge his being fired from the 
cabinet by following cockfields line 
former prime minister edward heath whom mrs thatcher ousted as 
conservative party leader in 1975 on friday accused her of firing 
cockfield out of sheer spite he called it a disgrace and a 
public scandal 
thatcher aides denied cockfield was dropped because he became 
obsessed with eec interests over british interests and pointed to 
his age 71 
however brittans appointment was widely seen as underlining 
mrs thatchers differences with britains eec partners on 
continental europe while nurturing a special relationship with the 
united states 
mrs thatcher argued wednesday she is simply being practical 
about the limits of european union 
the whole history of the two places is entirely different 
she said of comparisons between west european nations and the 
united states of america 
it is not possible to have a united states of europe what is 
possible is for the 12 countries of europe steadily to work more 
closely together on things we do better together so that we can 
trade better together 
she said jacques delors president of the european commission 
and the eecs chief official erred in predicting that within a 
decade 80 percent of national decisions by member nations would be 
taken on a europewide basis 
mrs thatcher said no need existed for uniformity of sales taxes 
as for an eec central bank she said that would mean 
surrendering fundamental economic decisions to another country 
that i will not do 
opinion polls show british voters are less enthusiastic about 
closer ties within the eec than say the west germans or the 
french

a welfare mother of five has been promised a job 
and a home in a middleclass neighborhood from a millionaire who 
says he just wanted to help real people 
i cant believe this is happening to me said 28yearold 
anita hunter its just a miracle from god ive struggled and 
hoped for so long to get my children out of this neighborhood and 
into a safe environment 
businessman james gisclair said he plans to buy a house for ms 
hunter and her family and give her a college education a job a 
car and someone to care for her children who range in age from one 
month to 10 years 
the idea is to get anita to become selfsufficient to the 
point where she can pay her own rent on the house pay her own 
bills and do everything on her own someday gisclair told the 
miami news in an interview published wednesday i plan to pay for 
everything until she reaches that point 
he also wants ms hunters monthold son to be her last child 
i just want anita to be honest with me i want her to become 
selfsufficient and she has promised to have no more children 
he said i will see to it that she gets medical care as well to 
take care of that 
gisclair a 43yearold new orleans native and the principal 
owner of six companies in boca raton said he was tired of donating 
to charities and not seeing the results he went to livia garcia of 
miamis community development department and said he wanted to help 
real people he could see and talk to 
boy have i got a family for you garcia said 
ms hunter had come to garcias office five months pregnant and 
looking for help for her family 
but she never dreamed of the likes of gisclair who she met just 
last friday 
ms hunter said gisclairs requirement that she have no more 
children was tiny compared with the chance hes giving her 
family she said the drugridden innercity neighborhood where she 
lives now is so dangerous she doesnt let her children play outside 
now my children will have a chance to start a fresh new 
life ms hunter said thats all ive ever prayed for these 
kids deserve the best and now thanks to mr gisclair they will 
have it

officials checking a teenagers report 
of a socalled lizard man found large tracks near scape ore 
swamp and a bigfoot researcher says the creature is a skunk 
ape 
the search began almost two weeks ago when 17yearold chris 
davis says he was chased at speeds up to 40 mph by a tall wet 
green creature after he changed a tire about 2 am near a bean 
field 
since then the swamp has been swamped with the curious 
including scores of news people and lee county sheriff liston 
truesdale has fielded hundreds of calls about the beast 
youre dealing with a skunk ape which is a colloquial name 
you can call it anything you want to but its a bigfoot said 
erik beckjord who has researched creature sightings for 10 years 
and interviewed davis 
he said the lizard man sounds like the skunk ape that has 
reportedly been seen in woods and swamps around the country since 
1958 
a state trooper and sheriffs deputy on patrol near the swamp 
found the 14inch by 7inch tracks and the sheriff made five sets 
of plaster casts of them 
while truesdale said he believes davis saw something it 
probably was a bear he said its likely a prankster was at work 
sunday when the tracks were found 
whoever did it they sure did a convincing job said the 
sheriff 
the prints were found on a dirt road that parallels the swamp 
and traveled about 400 yards before stomping off into woods 
truesdale said 
the sheriff asked the state law enforcement division to send 
bloodhounds to scour the swamp 
we couldnt find anybody coming out of there and if it was 
some thing we wanted to see if the dog would trail it 
truesdale said 
the hounds however failed to pick up a scent probably because 
of an afternoon rainstorm said sled spokesman hugh munn 
they did see tracks they had three toes and dug down into the 
ground in sixfoot strides i cant even say this with a 
straight face munn said 
but others have told truesdale they too have seen the redeyed 
creature and this week the sheriff said he was tracking down 
reports of tracks seen after a january snowstorm 
the prints found sunday are the same dimensions as a set found 
in 1977 by the dw berry family in saluda county officials said 
sheriffs investigators there concluded the prints were made by a 
prankster 
a week before that a 12by5inch set of prints was found by 
the leonard gromoske family in fort mill 
beckjord said skunk apes are harmless sometimes travel in pairs 
and quite frequently stink 
florida has more reports of skunk apes than any other state in 
the nation added beckjord founder of the national 
cryptozoological society which records sightings of creatures 
whose existence is questioned by scientists 
beckjord of malibu calif said davis account of the creature 
coincides with other bigfoot descriptions except for lizard mans 
green skin most bigfoot sightings are of hairy beasts and the 
majority have red eyes like davis described he said

former philippine president ferdinand marcos 
definitely offered to provide 5 billion to president corazon 
aquinos government a us historian who relayed marcos feelers 
about returning to his homeland said wednesday 
boston university professor allen weinstein said the 5 billion 
offer was in a proposal brought to him by a marcos representative 
and was part of the substance of a letter to him from marcos 
i was approached last month in washington by a representative 
of former president marcos with a list of proposed agreement 
points for an arrangement which would allow his return to the 
philippines said weinstein 
the points were conditioned by an offer on his part to accept 
the legitimacy of the aquino government stay out of politics 
throw his support behind aquino and provide her government with 5 
billion weinstein added 
weinstein identified the marcos emissary as jay hoffman a 
california advertising man 
in a statement tuesday from hawaii where he lives in exile 
marcos said negotiations about his return were taking place but 
denied that he had offered to pay the money in exchange for 
permission to return to the philippines with immunity from 
prosecution 
weinstein declined to comment on marcos denial a source close 
to the discussions with marcos insisting on anonymity said the 
ousted presidents statement appeared worded to provide him 
deniability 
weinstein is president of the washingtonbased center for 
democracy a nonpartisan us organization promoting democracy 
abroad and was a member of the us observer team to the 1986 
philippine elections 
hoffman returned on july 13 with two letters signed by marcos 
one addressed to president aquino and one addressed to weinstein 
which outlined what i view as mr marcos personal petition to 
the philippine government said weinstein 
i sent president aquinos letter to manila assured that it 
would reach her along with the substance including the 5 billion 
figure of what was contained in the letter to me weinstein 
said he said he also sent the contents of the letters to 
philippine ambassador emmanuel pelaez 
pelaez could not be reached for comment a philippine embassy 
official confirmed that the ambassador received marcos letter but 
added that the government does not take it seriously and mrs 
aquino did not receive it 
a source knowledgeable of the weinsteinhoffman contacts said 
the 5 billion was explicitly mentioned in marcos letter to 
weinstein but not in the one to president aquino 
the letter is authentic but the offer is phony said 
severina rivera a lawyer for the philippine commission on good 
government which is charged with recovering marcos assets in the 
united states rivera also said the manila government has been not 
been negotiating with marcos

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
stressed lawandorder issues wednesday meeting with his state 
anticrime council and signing legislation to ease prison 
overcrowding and fight child pornography 
the massachusetts governor also took what should be the last 
step to close the books on the states 1988 fiscal year just 
meeting a deadline to sign legislation providing 124 million the 
money is largely for underfunded entitlement programs such as 
medicaid and aid to families with dependent children 
top aides to dukakis meanwhile struck back in answer to 
republican criticism of dukakis and suggested bushs search for a 
running mate was not going well but dukakis himself generally 
steered clear of such topics 
dukakis who embarks on a sevenstate campaign swing thursday 
spent wednesday tending to gubernatorial duties meeting with his 
anticrime council and signing into law measures that will add 
about 1000 beds to the states overcrowded prison system and 
restore a childpornography statute struck down by the state 
supreme court 
later he announced a number of other bill signings including 
the deficiency budget legislation the governors last act in 
erasing a 400 million shortfall during fiscal 1988 which ended 
june 30 
dukakis held a public ceremony to sign the prison and 
childpornography bills not long after senior dukakis aides held a 
briefing at which they said that bush the certain republican 
nominee and the republican party were having to scramble to give 
their fall effort direction and that bush had begun his vice 
presidential search on a sour note 
dukakis refused to enter that fray telling reporters he did not 
know details of bushs search and saying every candidate had a 
personal approach to such tasks 
his aides were less kind 
it is our view that the process has not begun well said 
susan estrich the dukakis campaign manager she cited reports that 
bush had a pollster robert teeter heading the search and that 
bush was requesting background information from new hampshire gov 
john sununu and other republicans who were not being seriously 
considered just to placate them 
estrich also criticized bush and other republicans for what she 
called an early decision to go negative and attributed sharp 
criticism of dukakis by republicans to a lack of good things to say 
about bush 
its a bit early in the campaign to have run out of positive 
things to say about your own candidate estrich said 
many democratic speakers at last weeks democratic national 
convention including keynoter ann richards criticized bush at 
length receiving loud applause for comments ridiculing the vice 
president 
estrich said that dukakis planned to campaign during the 
republican national convention next month but that an itinerary had 
not been established 
we do not plan any fishing or hunting trips during that 
period she said referring to a trip bush took with treasury 
secretary james a baker during the first few days of the 
democratic convention we plan to campaign 
dukakis in addition to signing the crime and prison bills 
wednesday announced distribution of 78 million in state and 
federal grants for victim assistance programs 
he said that massachusetts has been a national leader in 
increasing sensitivity and awareness of what it is like to be a 
victim of crime and he also said there has been a 13 percent 
drop in crime in his state in the past four years 
dukakis shrugged off questions about bushs repeated criticism 
of a massachusetts furlough program that until it was amended 
allowed passes to firstdegree murderers including a man who 
escaped from a furlough and raped a maryland woman 
ive got a record dukakis said referring to the crime 
statistics and other programs i dont know what the vice 
presidents record is

president reagan encouraging a reformminded 
eastern european communist party leader praised hungarian premier 
karoly grosz wednesday for your openness to new ideas 
at the conclusion of the firstever official white house visit 
by a hungarian communist party leader reagan and grosz agreed that 
economic reform in hungary will necessitate a freer political 
climate 
hungary has to face enormous tasks today grosz said through 
an interpreter during a departure statement on the south lawn of 
the white house this can only be done we are aware if the 
people if the citizens enjoy more rights more freedoms 
reagan told grosz we are encouraged by your recognition that 
economic reforms cannot succeed unless acompanied by political 
reforms as well 
the president said that decisions to be made by grosz 
government in the coming months will set the direction of 
hungarys development over the next decade adding that we have 
been impressed with your openness to new ideas 
grosz replied that we are modernizing our political system and 
our political practices 
at a news conference wednesday night grosz said his visit 
symbolized a new era of detente in eastwest relations which 
provides not only the superpowers but the small and mediumsized 
powers with the opportunity to participate in a dialogue 
he said the current relaxation of tensions is much deeper 
and much richer than the detente era of the 1970s 
grosz said the administration promised to review ways in which 
hungarian products can have greater access to us markets 
on tuesday grosz who leaves washington for niagara falls 
ny on thursday indicated in a national press club speech that 
political reform has to be carried out within the framework of 
hungarys one party state 
a senior administration official describing wednesdays talks 
on grounds he not be publicly identified acknowledged there was no 
discussion between reagan and grosz of any possible move to a 
multiparty system in hungary 
this official said reagan wanted to focus attention on grosz 
because of the hungarians interest in establishing economic ties 
with the united states and his willingness to consider internal 
change 
this official said that while the united states believes hungary 
has improved its human rights situation it could do more in the 
area of permitting demonstrations and dissent but he said 
freedom of travel from the warsaw pact country has improved 
substantially 
the official also said the two leaders did not discuss the 
question of possible withdrawal of the 65000 soviet troops based 
in hungary 
several weeks ago state department officials had received 
increasing indications that a soviet military retreat from its 
warsaw pact ally was likely 
grosz told the national press club gathering that any soviet 
troop pullback from hungary would have to be part of general 
scaling down of nato and warsaw pact forces in central europe 
the visit was the first ever by a hungarian party leader since 
the country came under communist rule 40 years ago grosz became 
premier a year ago and was named party chief in may

gartner as president of its struggling news division on wednesday 
hours after lawrence k grossman said he was leaving because it 
hasnt been all that fun lately 
different times call for different types of people nbc

tribune a former president of the american society of newspaper 
editors he is also former editor of the courierjournal of 
louisville ky the des moines iowa register and the front page 
of the wall street journal 
grossman who left public broadcasting four years ago to join 
the network said he is quitting because of differences with the 
executives installed by general electric which bought the network 
in 1986 
its time for them to get their own guy in there grossman 
said in los angeles where he was attending an nbc meeting 
things have changed it hasnt been all that fun lately ive 
been there four years its a difference in style personality and 
priorities 
gartner said that he had met wright a couple of months ago in a 
meeting about first amendment issues he said wright had asked to 
meet him in atlanta and offered the job last wednesday 
he wants me to lead he wants me to manage he wants me to use 
my news judgment and he wants me to be a good businessman

of the des moines register hes a brilliant journalist a great 
idea person and a very outgoing personality who had good effects on 
morale in the newsroom

has an energy field that gets everybody fired up he is just an 
exceptional individual hes the best questioner ive ever heard in 
my life 
waller said gartner would retain the title of editor of the 
tribune and plans to commute to des moines on weekends

a judge declared a mistrial wednesday in the 
drugdealing case against reputed mobster gene gotti and two 
codefendants after a haggard jury announced it was deadlocked on 
the seventh day of deliberations 
the time has come to declare a mistrial us district judge 
joseph mclaughlin said before calling the jury back into the 
courtroom ending the second trial stemming from a 1983 indictment 
the earlier trial also ended with a mistrial in january in that 
case prosecutors accused the defendants of jury tampering a 
charge us attorney andrew maloney said remains under 
investigation 
this time the foreman of the anonymous jury said jurors were 
troubled by a defense claim that tape recordings made from an fbi 
bug placed in the kitchen of codefendant angelo ruggieros home 
might have been tampered with by the government to fit the case 
the jurors finally indicated their problem with the evidence 
is in fact tampering said jeffrey hoffman attorney for 
ruggiero 
we only hope the court system will recognize this situation 
and correct it by dismissing the case so these defendants do not 
once again have to undergo criminal proceedings he concluded 
assistant us attorney robert larusso denied the tampering 
charges but agreed with defense lawyers that no one was happy with 
the result 
i feel empty having been with it for so long and not having a 
resolution said larusso 
gottis attorney ronald fishetti said gotti brother of 
reputed gambino family head john gotti was not happy 
he wants this matter resolved once and for all the attorney 
said 
and george santangelo attorney for defendant john carneglia 
said a mistrial isnt a victory its a nonverdict 
gotti 41 of valley stream ruggiero 48 of cedarhurst and 
carneglia 43 are charged in a 1983 indictment with supervising a 
multimilliondollar heroinsmuggling operation 
the judge set sept 7 as a tentative retrial date the second 
trial began in may 
earlier wednesday mclaughlin had sent the jurors back to 
deliberate despite a pessimistic message from the anonymous panels 
foreman your honor its a dead point 
the jurors began rehearing the fbi tapes sunday as they 
considered charges of heroin possession obstruction of justice 
conspiracy racketeering and running a continuing criminal 
enterprise 
news of a deadlock surfaced after the jury sent a note to the 
judge at 1145 am that said after breaking yesterday we all 
gave serious thought to where we were heading it amounted to 
nowhere 
we unanimously agreed that we will be unable to reach a 
verdict on any count no matter how long we are asked to continue 
deliberating said the note 
only 11 jurors were deliberating because one juror was excused 
after a federal marshal found several grams of cocaine in clothing 
that was delivered to him tuesday maloney said maloney said the 
matter is being investigated by the fbi

two acting justice department officials on 
wednesday insisted the agency is running smoothly with no hint of 
the deep malaise portrayed by two of their predecessors who 
quit in protest earlier this year 
at their confirmation hearing for permanent positions francis 
a keating ii and edward sg dennis jr painted a rosy picture of 
department operations under outgoing attorney general edwin meese 
iii 
sen howell heflin dala who presided at the senate judiciary 
committee session warned keating and dennis that removal of 
clouds is essential 
since may keating has served as acting associate attorney 
general the departments no 3 position a month later dennis 
took over the top spot in the criminal division on an acting basis 
president reagan has nominated both men to hold those jobs 
permanently for the remaining halfyear of his administration 
on tuesday former deputy attorney general arnold burns 
testified that when he resigned march 29 a deep malaise had set 
in at the department in the face of meeses legal problems 
william e weld who preceded dennis as criminal division chief 
told the committee that if meese were an ordinary citizen he 
probably would have been prosecuted for taking gratuities from e 
robert wallach a longtime friend of the attorney general 
keating told the committee that when he went to the department 
from a top treasury department position i was under the 
impression there was a black hole that morale was shattered i 
found that was not the case morale was not on the floor 
i dont think morale was as serious a problem as portrayed by 
mr burns and mr weld at least since april at this time i think 
the department is functioning well 
have you seen an instance where meese acted improperly 
asked sen orrin g hatch rutah and a meese supporter 
keating all of my professional associations with the attorney 
general have been correct and proper he called burns and weld 
professionals men of integrity and decency who simply had a 
different view of department morale 
dennis who started at the department in june said no i 
didnt see any malaise i found the criminal division conducting 
itself according to the highest standards 
hatch told him there are some who will never like attorney 
general meese the department functions well and does a good job 
but the senator also had criticism for meese saying he 
probably shouldnt have made comments critical of burns and 
weld on monday 
in a speech at the national press club meese said that if burns 
and weld had conducted a competent and thorough preliminary inquiry 
of his conduct there likely would have been no need for an 
independent counsels investigation 
meese has announced he will resign at the end of the month now 
that independent counsel james mckay has decided not to bring 
charges against him following a lengthy investigation mckay 
concluded that meese probably committed three felonies and a 
misdemeanor meese has sharply criticized the findings

a military judge wednesday found pvt 
adrian morris jr guilty of two aidsrelated courtmartial charges 
but acquitted the soldier of other charges 
army col raymond d cole convicted morris of bringing discredit 
upon the army for engaging in unprotected sex early in 1987 after 
testing positive for presence of antibodies to the aids virus and 
having been counseled to take precautions if having sex 
cole also found morris guilty of consensual sodomy with 
thenpfc anthony l baldwin during march 1987 
the judge acquitted morris of aggravated assault against baldwin 
and a soldier identified only as pfc jane doe he also found 
morris innocent of two counts of conduct bringing discredit upon 
the army 
i am convinced the accused never intended to harm any of his 
sexual partners cole said in acquitting morris of assault 
by gods good grace and blind luck no one was infected 
cole later sentenced morris to receive a badconduct discharge 
but did not set a specific date for it morris is scheduled for 
release from the army in november 
the judge also restricted morris for 60 days to fort huachuca 
outside this southeast arizona town ordered him to forfeit 1200 
in pay over three months and ordered him not to have unprotected 
sex 
the sodomy charge alone carried a maximum term of five years in 
prison cole had indicated previously that he would not impose a 
prison term on a discredit conviction 
morris hugged his mother after the sentencing and told reporters 
he was surprised because i was expecting the whole 17 years in 
prison the maximum penalty if he had been convicted of all the 
charges he said he had expected a heavy sentence because of the 
emotion surrounding it and the disease itself 
morris said he would not stay in the military even if his 
automatic appeal is successful but he said i dont feel any 
remorse toward the army and the press 
the bad conduct dischage is considered better than a 
dishonorable discharge because morris may be entitled to retain 
some veterans benefits 
col harry c beans iii staff judge advocate at fort huachuca 
whose office prosecuted morris said he was trying to figure out 
the judges logic with our failure to prove an aggravated assault 
quite frankly i thought we did it i thought we made our case 
beans said the sentence is light but you can understand that 
this soldier has had this cloud hanging over his head for 17 
months 
morris 28 of caseyville ill was accused of having 
threatened the health of baldwin and two female soldiers by failing 
to use condoms during sex and by failing to warn them he had tested 
positive for the aids virus which indicated he may develop aids 
and could spread it 
he was the first member of the armed forces charged with 
aidsrelated offenses in march 1987 legal issues delayed his 
trial though and military courts have tried other aidsrelated 
cases in the interim 
cole said morris case was factspecific involving 
knowledge about aids two years ago and therefore would have little 
value as a precedent in other cases 
cole ruled after receiving written closing arguments from the 
prosecution and hearing oral arguments from the defense wednesday 
afternoon 
capt gaylen whatcott the prosecutor called 10 witnesses 
tuesday including morris two alleged female victims they 
testified that morris had told them he had a rare or incurable 
blood disease but did not mention acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome before having sex with them 
cole permitted whatcott to submit a transcript of pretrial 
testimony from baldwin after the government said it was unable to 
find him for the trial 
baldwins 1987 testimony included a description of homosexual 
activity with morris 
in addition the judge allowed the prosecution to admit medical 
records reflecting morris aids test results despite defense 
objections that the government had not demonstrated sufficiently 
that adequate steps were taken to secure blood drawn in 1986 when 
morris was tested for aids

two democrats charged wednesday that campaign 
tax proposals by republican nomineetobe george bush would undo 
ronald reagans greatest achievement 
sen bill bradley of new jersey and rep richard gephardt of 
missouri said tax cuts suggested by bush would destroy the 
reaganbacked tax reform act of 1986 they specifically blasted 
bushs plans to reduce the tax rate on capital gains and to 
increase tax credits for oil and gas exploration 
bush says the capitalgains cut would stimulate investment and 
generate longterm revenue the oil and gas breaks would restore an 
estimated 1 billion in credits lost by energy developers in the 
1986 reforms 
but bradley a major figure in the writing of the 1986 
taxreform bill called bushs plans an attempt to dismantle tax 
reform which is ronald reagans greatest achievement 
george bush is practicing the old politics of pandering to the 
special interests bradley said 
gephardt echoed the charge saying the rich and powerful have 
never really had to ask where bush was hes always been in their

new hampshire sen gordon humphrey on 
wednesday announced the formation of a new coalition to push for a 
strong conservative running mate for likely republican nominee 
george bush 
humphrey said the coalition for a winning ticket isnt going to 
be a stalking horse for any one candidate but instead will 
serve as a rallying point for conservatives who hope to persuade 
the vice president to choose someone from the conservative majority 
of the party 
bush would lose the election if he picked a less conservative 
candidate from the minority wing of the party which is the old 
line country club establishment humphrey predicted 
he said a more conservative candidate is needed to attract the 
conservative democrats and independents who helped elect ronald 
reagan democratic nominee michael dukakis would get more votes if 
a less conservative running mate were selected he said

an irish teenager with a history of running 
away from home stowed away on a us navy guided missile destroyer 
and five sailors accused of helping her during 10 days at sea have 
been arrested officials said wednesday 
police in ireland identified the 16yearold girl as suzanne 
twomey of cork she was hospitalized in satisfactory condition 
wednesday after an illness delayed attempts to return her to 
ireland 
the five sailors accused of helping her during the uss 
conynghams trip were being held at the norfolk naval base 
the teenager was found aboard the destroyer saturday when it 
returned from its visit to ireland she was being taken to atlanta 
for a return flight when she became ill 
after an emergency landing tuesday night in raleigh nc the 
girl was taken to rex hospital where was discharged wednesday 
evening 
charles coble jr an agent with the naval investigative 
service said travel arrangements were being made for the girl he 
would not elaborate and neither he nor hospital officials knew 
where she was spending wednesday night 
the girl apparently slipped aboard the conyngham while it was on 
a courtesy call in cork harbor the ship held an open house during 
the visit and that is apparently when the girl slipped aboard 
officials said 
lt cmdr john w lloyd an atlantic fleet spokesman in norfolk 
said the girl was discovered in a 2foot by 15foot utility 
passage when the ship docked 
five sailors who allegedly helped the girl are in the base brig 
lloyd said some of the sailors apparently brought food and water 
to the girl during the 10day atlantic crossing 
no charges have yet been filed said lloyd 
lloyd said the girl was expected to be released from rex 
hospital sometime wednesday to continue her trip home irish police 
said they expected her to take a thursday flight from atlanta to 
ireland 
according to the naval investigative service the girl escorted 
by an nis agent was flown tuesday from norfolk to washington dc

the senate voted wednesday to extend medicaid 
abortion payments to rape and incest victims although president 
reagan has said he might veto a 140 billion appropriations bill 
over the issue 
the 7319 vote came during the third day of contentious debate 
on the fiscal 1989 appropriations bill for the departments of 
labor health and human services and education 
the massive spending bill covering most of the nations social 
spending was approved 8016 at the end of a confusing day of 
parliamentary maneuvers reversals and lastminute amendments 
medicaid now pays for poor womens abortions only if their lives 
are endangered the senate vote was the first time either chamber 
of congress had expanded eligibility since 1981 
sen lowell weicker rconn who championed the move said it 
would help break the chain and get moving in the other 
direction after years of restrictive federal abortion regulations 
as approved on the floor the provision requires prompt 
reporting of the rape or incest incident in order for a victim to 
qualify for federal funds it also gives state legislatures 
authority to adopt less liberal funding schemes 
i sincerely believe this amendment reflects the middle ground 
protects the maximum number of lives said sen james exon 
dneb who offered the modified floor amendment 
the laborhhseducation appropriations bill passed by the house 
does not expand eligibility for medicaid abortions beyond what is 
permitted in current law that difference and others will be 
resolved in a housesenate conference committee 
the office of management and budget has said presidential 
advisers would recommend a veto of the entire apropriations bill 
which would keep the three agencies in business after the new 
fiscal year starts oct 1 over the medicaid expansion 
weicker said he agreed to the exon modifications because they 
gave his provision a better chance of surviving conference as far 
as a possible veto he predicted that considering everything else 
thats in the bill and that its an election year it could be 
overridden 
the massive appropriations bill which includes 12 billion for 
aids research education prevention and treatment drew numerous 
amendments on family planning abortion and aids 
in several instances the senate first rebuffed and then accepted 
amendments on controversial subjects 
senators earlier in the week rejected attempts to eliminate and 
restrict the federal family planning program for lowincome women 
on wednesday they voted against a ban on federal money for school 
clinics that distribute contraceptives then later approved the ban 
for school clinics that provide abortion counseling or referral 
services 
they also rejected several attempts to renew a ban on federal 
money for aids education material that encourages or promotes 
homosexuality then approved two amendments that sent conflicting 
messages on the same subject 
sen jesse helms rnc who sponsored the aids education 
restrictions last year failed several times to extend them on 
wednesday 
but the senate later embraced an amendment that not only 
contains the helms restrictions but also says federally funded aids 
materials cannot use words stating that homosexuality is 
normal natural or healthy lawmakers voted 8215 not to 
kill it and then approved it by voice vote 
weicker called the amendment sponsored by sen gordon humphrey 
rnh an exercise in bigotry period its about the most 
objectionable thing ive seen on the senate floor 
the humphrey amendment won approval after the senate voted 6137 
for what sen alan cranston dcalif labeled a preemptive strike 
against the helms restrictions 
the cranston amendment bans federal funds for material that 
directly promotes or encourages homosexual or heterosexual sexual 
activity or intravenous drug use but at the same time says aids 
education programs and materials must provide accurate information 
on how to avoid aids 
some senators who voted for the helms restrictions last year 
said they did not anticipate the chilling effect they would have on 
the war against aids 
sen john glenn dohio said a study by his governmental 
affairs investigations subcommittee found that the amendment had 
delayed program funding diverted staff time slowed the 
distribution of educational materials and prompted some educators 
to produce material that is less explicit less risky and less 
effective 
sen edward kennedy dmass said he initially thought the 
measure was toothless but it is a fact that effective materials 
have been shelved and vital proposals have been tabled because of 
the fear of what this amendment might do 
in other action wednesday the senate voted 4845 to kill a 
helms amendment that would have banned federal funds for 
contraceptives or contraceptive prescriptions issued on school 
premises the target was schoolbased clinics which receive some 
medicaid and block grant money 
but later lawmakers approved by voice vote a more limited ban on 
funds to schoolbased clinics that provide abortion services

rep mario biaggis defense lawyer took a final 
swing at attorney general edwin meese iii in closing arguments at 
the wedtech corruption trial wednesday calling meese a crook 
and the case against the congressman a frame 
attorney james larossas remarks sparked a bitter exchange with 
prosecutors while the jury was out of the room 
biaggi dny and six others are accused of a racketeering 
conspiracy that turned wedtech corp a nowbankrupt military 
contractor into a cash cow that paid out millions of dollars in 
bribes to obtain nobid government contracts 
but a cornerstone of the defense case has been the theory that 
four corrupt wedtech executives who testified for the government 
had links to white house insiders like meese and did not need to 
bribe biaggi 
if these four people from wedtech knew that they had an open 
door to the white house said larossa you tell me what they 
needed mario biaggi for extra baggage 
in his closing argument to the jury last week assistant us 
attorney edward j little sought to defuse the socalled meese 
defense by conceding meese is a sleaze but insisting that it 
had no bearing on biaggis alleged crimes 
but larossa the last defense attorney to sum up before the 
jury said the case was really about meese 
sleaze is not enough were talking about a crook were 
talking about a man who today sits in a building with that eagle in 
front of it larossa said pointing to the great seal above the 
judges bench the attorney general of the united states he got 
promoted for being a crook 
meese has not been charged with any wrongdoing but has admitted 
getting key aides to help wedtech win an army contract while he was 
white house counselor 
meese was under scrutiny for some time because of his wedtech 
connections but a special prosecutor in washington james c 
mckay determined there was insufficient evidence to charge meese 
with wrongdoing however mckay questioned the attorney generals 
ethics on several issues 
meese has said he will leave office later this summer 
you dont think ed meese wants you to convict mario biaggi 
larossa asked the jury hed throw a party if you did 
at another point he said wedtech obtained the army contract 
without biaggis help adding the case against biaggi is a phony 
ladies and gentlemen its a frame 
larossa also attacked the four cooperating wedtech officials 
fred neuberger mario moreno anthony guariglia and lawrence 
shorten as vultures who lived for money 
all four pleaded guilty to state and federal corruption charges 
and testified in exchange for leniency all four also admitted to 
stealing millions of dollars from the company when they werent 
trying to cheat the government or each other 
little bitterly protested larossas comments about meese to the 
judge during a recess with the jury out of the room 
larossa claimed he meant the four cooperating wedtech witnesses 
were framing biaggi not the prosecution 
but the defense attorney stuck to his prediction of a 
postconviction celebration by meese 
meese created the swindle that led to the indictment 
larossa said during the exchange insisting that a biaggi 
conviction will take his participation in wedtech away from the 
public 
little accused larossa of poisoning the jurys mind and 
leaving them with the impression that meese is behind this case 
i will stipulate that meese engaged in improper conduct in 
connection with this case and i said so in my summation said 
little adding that larossa was hinting meese somehow was behind 
biaggis indictment 
your argument is deceptive little told larossa who shot 
back maybe youd also like me to put a bound over my mouth so i 
wont talk that might also be more helpful to you 
the prosecution was slated to present its rebuttal argument to 
the jury thursday paving the way later this week for the judges 
instruction on the law to jurors and the start of deliberations in 
the fourmonthold trial

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said wednesday that he raised very specifically with irans 
foreign minister the issue of american and other hostages held by 
proiranian factions in lebanon 
this is a question on which one has to be very discreet the 
un chief told reporters after meeting foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati of iran for two hours i raised it very very 
specifically 
perez de cuellar did not disclose the iranian envoys response 
and velayati later did not answer reporters questions about the 
hostages 
earlier wednesday perez de cuellar told reporters he thought 
iran might help on the hostage issue for humanitarian and 
political reasons 
the question was raised in talks concerning the implementation 
of a ceasefire in the 8yearold iraniraq war 
hashemi rafsanjani irans parliament speaker and military 
commander offered on tuesday to help get the nine americans freed 
if the united states would release iranian assets frozen since 1979 
us officials said washington would not ransom the americans 
who are among 18 foreign hostages in lebanon held longest of the 
18 is terry a anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press who was kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985 
i intend to do it raise the hostage issue with iran because 
i feel that their good offices will be very good for obtaining the 
release of the hostages the secretarygeneral told reporters 
earlier 
i think they might assert their possible influence in order to 
have this problem out of the way for both the humanitarian and 
political business 
he said the hostages were a parallel issue to ending the 
war perez de cuellar has pursued the hostage question previously 
with iranians and others 
rafsanjani said tuesday if they the americans really want 
to talk let them take a nonhostile pose by releasing our assets 
if so we will use our influence in lebanon and intercede to solve 
the problem of hostages 
in a meeting with reporters tuesday velayati said the problem 
of hostages in lebanon is a question relating to the lebanese 
it is not our question but on the basis of humanitarian 
aspects we will do our best as we have done till now and we do 
hope that all innocent people as hostages in lebanon or anyplace 
else could be released very soon 
us ambassador vernon a walters said wednesday he believed the 
secretarygenerals good offices could help what was ineffective 
in the old days may not be so today things are moving things are 
changing 
asked about rafsanjanis statement and the us response 
walters said we are not closing the door on anything we 
maintain the policy that we do not pay blackmail 
the hostages are with us day and night in our heart and 
our mind always and we will do whatever is honorable and decent 
and wont provoke more hostage taking 
walters said he has visited syria five times to discuss the 
matter and the important thing for us is to liberate the hostages 
in such a way that they wont be replaced by another group of 
hostages

the un secretarygeneral held separate 
peace talks with the foreign ministers of iraq and iran wednesday 
on a ceasefire in their 8yearold war but iraq insisted that 
facetoface negotiations with iran must precede any truce 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said that he also 
raised very very specifically with iranian foreign minister 
ali akbar velayati the issue of american and other hostages held by 
proiranian factions in lebanon 
this is a question on which one has to be very discreet he 
told reporters after meeting velayati for two hours i raised it 
very very specifically 
he did not disclose the iranian envoys response and velayati 
later did not answer questions about the hostages 
earlier wednesday the un chief told reporters he thought iran 
might help on the hostage issue for humanitarian and political 
reasons 
perez de cuellar met for two hours with iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz in the morning and saw velayati in the evening no 
substance was disclosed 
it was the first full day of separate talks with both 
adversaries perez de cuellar met velayati for almost three hours 
tuesday 
aziz told reporters wednesday that iraq will not be 
stampeded into a settlement 
iraqs insistence on direct talks appeared to raise difficulties 
for agreement on a ceasefire in the persian gulf war 
perez de cuellar said he could not require the belligerents to 
hold direct talks if iran objects iran opposes direct talks at 
this time but left the door open to a request by the 
secretarygeneral 
perez de cuellar told reporters wednesday night he was awaiting 
answers from both sides on his proposals for implementing a 
ceasefire and peace plan mandated by the security council one 
year ago 
some diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said 
problems appeared to be cropping up in the negotiations because of 
iraqs insistent attitude its military offensive and the use of 
outlawed chemical warfare 
they noted that aziz described as a courtesy call his 
official visit with the secretarygeneral while un officials 
described it as substantive 
perez de cuellar said irans first responses were hopeful 
proposals 
no formal meetings were scheduled thursday 
before aziz entered un headquarters wednesday he said iraq 
insists on facetoface negotiations with iran before it will 
accept a ceasefire last monday iran abruptly said it would accept 
a ceasefire after rejecting a un ceasefire for one year 
perez de cuellar said the iranians know this request from the 
iraqi side and i imagine they are considering it 
velayati did not answer questions on direct talks after his 
meeting wednesday night he said iran responded very 
postitively to the secretarygenerals proposals he did not 
elaborate 
perez de cuellar has not disclosed his current proposals for 
implementing a ceasefire troop withdrawal prisoner exchange and 
other parts of a security council peace plan adopted in july 1987 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati countered iraqs 
call for direct talks by charging that iraq was procrastinating and 
sabotaging un peace efforts he said he lodged a protest with the 
security council over iraqs purported use of chemical weapons 
how can we take the iraqis seriously when they are using 
chemical weapons mahallati said to reporters 
perez de cuellar said a solution cannot be done on terms of 
one side or the other and urged both governments to help me in 
finding a solution through compromise 
on the way into his meeting with the un chief aziz said 
iraq shall not allow itself to be stampeded to reach a 
ceasefire or to make a hasty step under the present 
circumstances 
aziz said his government wants real peace durable and 
comprehensive but doubts irans intentions 
we shall seek guarantees and we believe that the first step 
and the starter for constructive work is facetoface negotiations 
between the two parties under the auspices of the 
secretarygeneral aziz said 
if the iranians do not accept that formula that means that 
they are not sincere about peace 
diplomats and un officials said pressure was mounting on iraq 
to soften its position and stop the ground offensive it began after 
iran announced on july 18 that it would accept the un ceasefire 
resolution iraq accepted resolution 598 soon after the 15member 
security council passed it unanimously on july 20 1987 
resolution 598 provides for a truce withdrawal to recognized 
borders prisoner exchange peace negotiations and an investigation 
to determine which side started the war iraq invaded iraq in 
september 1980 after several border skirmishes

a pair of missing newlyweds have turned up 
alive and well in california police said wednesday 3 months 
after the couple dropped out of sight without a word to relatives 
or classmates at a suburban christian college 
the father of carolyn maclean 22 who eloped with scott 
swanson 23 said the couple was madly in love and disappeared 
so they could spend time alone together 
the brides parents jim and kathy maclean flew to san diego on 
wednesday afternoon for a reunion later in the day with the couple 
we just know they are alive and well and very happy and very 
anxious to see us said maclean who was asked when he arrived in 
san diego if he was upset with his daughter and soninlaw im a 
father i dont think they ran from us 
they ran to something else they were interested in perfect 
love thats what it appears to be from what weve been able to 
piece together maclean told reporters 
the couple both students at wheaton college in suburban 
chicago had eloped a week before they vanished april 2 their 
ransacked luxury car was found in an alley in downtown chicago its 
motor still running 
the couple were not seen or heard from until they sent letters 
to their parents and contacted the macleans by telephone tuesday 
police commander ettore divito said wednesday 
the newlyweds were not at san diegos lindbergh field on 
wednesday afternoon when the macleans arrived maclean said they 
were headed for a private reunion with the couple at a hotel 
after the couple vanished police in three states poured 
resources into the search and friends at wheaton college held 
prayer vigils put up posters and questioned people at roadside 
restaurants and gas stations 
were disappointed that they would put people through all that 
grief but at the same time were glad that theyre ok said 
christy hodson a spokeswoman for wheaton a private evangelical 
christian school 
we are disheartened that wed expended so many manhours 
said divito who headed the investigation he said police may try 
to recover the costs of their efforts but refused to comment 
further 
divito refused to provide details about the condition or 
whereabouts of the couple except to say they had called from the 
san diego area 
as far as i know there is no criminal activity involved in 
the case said divito 
isnt that terrible two yuppie zeros costing taxpayers all 
that money said a chicago police officer after divitos news 
conference he refused to give his name 
the elder maclean said in san diego that his daughter and 
soninlaw would touch base with the chicago police department 
later wednesday he wouldnt disclose their whereabouts

that a significant part of it was that they just wanted to spend 
time together he said we havent asked them any particular 
questions were here as mother and dad really 
ms macleans parents who live in haddonfield nj told 
police wednesday morning they had heard from the couple divito 
said swansons parents were vacationing and may not have heard the 
news he said 
telephones went unanswered wednesday at the homes of both sets 
of parents and at the flint mich home of ms macleans 
grandmother elaine peterson 
the search for the couple began when police found their bmw in a 
downtown chicago alley investigators noted that some of the 
circumstances surrounding their disappearance indicated they had 
planned to vanish 
but families and friends were concerned the couple might have 
come to harm saying they were too responsible to have gone away 
without letting loved ones know they were all right 
maclean said wednesday that the couple indicated their car was 
found ransacked apparently because it was stolen after they left it 
with the keys under the mat 
as concern spread police in illinois michigan and indiana 
joined the search

before easter as they left her home they had said they were 
having dinner in the city before heading for swansons home in

entries in her diary about travel 
in june police learned that hidden hawaii the adventurers 
guide had been checked out march 29 on swansons library card 
fueling speculation the couple was missing by choice 
swanson had been scheduled to graduate in may ms maclean a

crews set backfires with flame throwers wednesday to protect old 
faithful from the worst forest fire outbreak at yellowstone 
national park this century while wildfires forced hundreds of 
people from their homes in south dakota and idaho 
in alaska about 1200 firefighters battled blazes that burned 
about 13 million acres an area larger than the state of delaware 
and strong winds fanned two of the largest fires officials said 
large fires also burned in arizona oregon utah and washington 
state 
interior secretary donald hodel flew by helicopter over 10000 
charred acres in yellowstones southern areas and told 500 
firefighters that he supports the policy of letting naturally 
caused wildfires burn unchecked in wilderness areas unless they 
endanger buildings people or roads the socalled prescribed fires 
are believed to eliminate dead and diseased timber and stimulate 
new growth 
we arent going to waste our resources where fires arent 
doing harm to the park he said there is a longterm 
beneficial effect from fire 
later hodel appeared to hint at a more aggressive stance 
because of the dry conditions in the area 
the problem is to decide when you have a prescribed burn or 
when you have a fire you want to fight hodel said in the dry 
conditions theyre taking the view that any fire that begins they 
will try to fight it 
but ben clary yellowstone assistant superintendent said park 
officials largely will follow the existing policy on natural fires 
well evaluate each one he said if its one log and you 
dont want it to go anywhere else you dont want to waste the 
effort and the manpower but if its in the middle of the forest 
and has the potential we certainly dont need to have additional 
fronts to work on at this point 
crews took an active role against a 9700acre fire burning 
within six miles of old faithful the parks most famous attraction 
firefighters with flame throwers and some in helicopters started 
backfires in meadows to direct the blaze away from the geyser and 
nearby structures they hope the backfires will exhaust fuel ahead 
of the fires eastern and northeastern edges and prevent it from 
spreading to old faithful 
bruce fox a fire information officer at yellowstone said 1000 
acres had been burned intentionally by wednesday evening and 
firefighters were optimistic that the tactic would succeed 
while we havent had a chance to evaluate it we are being 
told it is going as planned and people seem very upbeat on what is 
going on out there he said 
three pumper trucks were parked at old faithful to provide fire 
protection if necessary 
in all about 83000 of yellowstones 22 million acres have 
been blackened by fires an unusually hot dry summer has left 
yellowstone and the rest of northwestern wyoming parched 
the last time they had this much fire in the park was in the 
late 1800s said larry caplinger a forest service official 
coordinating firefighting 
arson was blamed for a forest fire that burned 2000 acres 
outside rapid city sd destroyed at least seven houses and 
forced the evacuation of over 2000 people said tom draper of the 
state division of forestry the blaze also burned four vehicles and 
15 outbuildings including garages sheds and barns 
an estimated 575 firefighters had the blaze 70 percent contained 
earlier wednesday but winds fanned the flames and reduced the 
containment figure to 50 percent one firefighter suffered a burned 
neck and a resident suffered smoke inhalation another person was 
hurt in a smokecaused traffic accident 
fire incident commander don kopp said the blaze which was first 
reported tuesday afternoon may have been started by the arsonist 
who is believed to have started about 50 fires since may 
whoevers doing is they could burn down half of the black 
hills if they want kopp said 
a 1700acre blaze in idaho forced two dozen people from their 
homes about 35 miles north of boise and crept toward about 50 
homes but officials said the structures were not threatened 
about 130 firefighters got a hand from two helicopters toting 
water buckets and four air tankers that strafed the flames with 
retardant 
fire officials imposed strict fire restrictions beginning friday 
throughout droughtparched idaho south of the salmon river 
until we see a major break in the weather these restrictions 
will hopefully minimize new fire starts which could very quickly 
threaten life property and high value resources with potentially 
catastrophic results said gene benedict branch chief for fire 
management in the payette national forest 
alaskas largest fire 15 miles north of livengood in the 
states interior was pushed by winds and grew to 409000 acres 
said sue mitchell a bureau of land management spokeswoman the 
fire has been burning since early june 
most of the fires in alaska were burning in remote areas and 
were allowed to burn because they posed no threat to people or 
property 
a fire northeast of mount rainier national park in washington 
state quickly spread across 1200 acres in steep terrain fanned by 
wind and temperatures near 90 more than 800 firefighters battled 
the blaze which closed part of the transcontinental pacific crest 
trail and a highway 
a timely rainstorm and the labors of up to 700 firefighters 
contained a 5dayold fireworkscaused fire that blackened 1955 
acres in the flaming gorge national recreation area in northeastern 
utah officials said 
firefighters also contained a lightningsparked wildfire that 
burned an estimated 3400 acres of remote terrain in northwestern

international paper co said wednesday it has 
agreed to pay an 873220 fine for hundreds of alleged safety 
violations at its striketorn paper mill here 
the occupational safety and health administration initially 
proposed fines totalling 13 million but later downgraded some of 
its citations for safety violations and reduced the fines said ip 
spokesman richard white 
ip promised not to contest the citations to pay the fines by 
aug 15 and to correct any remaining violations but it did not 
admit any wrongdoing company officials said 
osha officials did not comment on the settlement ted 
fitzgerald an osha spokesman in boston said the agency would 
announce its findings thursday 
in those instances where safety deficiencies were brought to 
our attention we moved swiftly to correct them jim thompson 
the mills resident manager said in a prepared statement in 
fact an overhwleming majority of the items cited by osha have 
already been corrected 
we will continue to do everything possible to ensure we are in 
compliance with all state and federal regulations as the safety of 
our employees is our highest priority he added 
spokesmen for unions representing more than 1200 ip workers who 
have been on strike since june 1987 said they would not comment 
until thursday the company has continued to run the mill with what 
it says are permanent replacement workers 
the unions went on strike over wages but subsequently have 
sought to publicize the alleged safety violations 
white said osha agreed to downgrade the severity of citations 
previously categorized as willful to serious 
the settlement covers 197 citations for about 1000 individual 
violations found during osha inspections in january and june white 
said that includes 29 citations previously classified as 
willful 122 in the less severe serious category 14 
repeat citations and 32 listed as other 
white said the violations were similar to those cited in a 
preliminary list released earlier by the striking unions 
that list cited such things as flammable liquids stored in 
unapproved containers fire extinguishers that were improperly 
discharged unguarded fan blades and oxygen stored with fuel gas 
the company is appealing a 242000 fine levied by osha last 
october for a separate series of safety violations

the economy expanded at a healthy 31 percent 
annual pace from april through june but rising food energy and

highest level in almost six years the government reported

was signaling the concluding stages of the current long economic 
recovery and could well result in a recession some time next year 
the white house dismissed the inflation figure as a temporary 
deviation

eightyeight ky ap its 88 in eightyeight and people 
are getting ready to celebrate the odd convergence of a point in 
time and a pinpoint on the map 
the last time eightyeight entered the spotlight was when voters 
here cast 88 votes for president harry truman and 88 votes for 
thomas dewey that earned the town a feature in ripleys believe 
it or not 
four decades later this is the year for eightyeight to call 
attention to itself again 
the townspeople have really got excited about it said 
rosemary mcpherson owner of the 88 market and the driving force 
behind the eightyeight celebration set for sunday 
thats on the eve of the big day said ms mcpherson 
referring to aug 8 or 8888 
there will be a parade an antique car show gospel singing and 
arts and crafts offerings 
the celebration includes a reunion for all who attended the 
nowdefunct eightyeight school and a special invitation is going 
out to anyone 88 years old 
its doubtful theres ever been anything like it in 
eightyeight a picturepostcard village with the market a tire 
company neat little houses lining a twolane road and a red brick 
church anchoring the town at each end 
the first hint that eightyeights time had come was back in 
january when collectors sent their new years cards to receive the 
towns postmark 
one collector enclosed a note this is your year 
until then i hadnt even thought about it said 
postmistress donnie sue bacon 
soon all manner of mail including about 200 graduation 
announcements from students at the university of southern 
california began arriving for cancellation at mrs bacons 
cubbyhole post office inside ms mcphersons store 
im happy that theyre recognizing us said mrs bacon 57 
who had to make a concession to the towns sudden vogue after 31 
years of handcanceling mail she was trading her ink pad and 
rubber stamp for a selfinking postmarker 
the town attracted other attention as well 
daniel t gray and karen ann davis of bowling green decided to 
get married here and the rev michael thomason who performed the 
ceremony recalled the couple was quite specific about the time 
428 pm on 42888 in eightyeight 
it was just sentimental said the new mrs gray when the 
marriage license was filed she added the clerks office thought 
the minister put the date where you put the place 
eightyeights 200 or so residents were at first loath to make a 
fuss but finally yielded to the times 
serious planning for a commemoration got under way in a town 
meeting in june at the 88 market which is something of an 
unofficial community center 
and ms mcpherson whose store already sold everything from baby 
food to country hams has added a special line of merchandise for 
the occasion eightyeight caps and tshirts 
theyve been going like hotcakes she said 
the first tshirt was ceremonially presented to local resident 
elsie billingsley age 88 
how did the town get its numerical name 
the explanation given by some is that it lies 88 miles east of 
glasgow the barren county seat 
thats not it says bobby richardson an eightyeight native and 
glasgow attorney who says he has the authoritative account 
it begins with dabnie l nunnally who opened a general store 
and stagecoach stop here around 1850 and became the first 
postmaster sometime in the late 1860s 
needing a name for the place nunnally opted for a number 
because his figures were more legible than his handwriting 
said richardson who is nunnallys greatgreatgrandson 
to pick the number nunnally counted the money in his pocket 
88 cents 
thats the correct version according to all the older people 
in the family who told me said richardson 
at some point just when isnt clear the towns name was 
officially spelled out 
but mail still arrives here sometimes addressed to 88 ky

kids we just cant afford to buy this we 
dont have enough money right now 
but mom why dont we go to the bank machine and get some 
more 
if youre a parent of small children that sort of exchange most 
likely sounds familiar one of the innumerable tasks of rearing 
your offspring in this capitalistic society is to teach them about 
money 
its a complex subject of course intermingling facts with 
personal styles and values it can hardly be taught in a single 
lesson 
and as in many other basic elements of life children are likely 
to gain much of their understanding of money by observing what 
their parents do rather than by listening to what they say 
nevertheless professional advisers on matters of personal 
finance say there are strategies and tools available to help in 
the process of teaching about money 
for instance suggests the credit union national association 
the backtoschool shopping parents and children do over the next 
few weeks can provide a chance to make some points about money 
management 
shopping can teach children about making choices and 
separating needs from wants the trade group says 
start by making a wish list then set priorities show 
children that if you shop without a plan youre likely to run out 
of money before youve bought everything you need 
next talk about alternatives is it better to buy several 
moderately priced items or fewer more expensive items will buying 
one item mean you cant buy another or that youll perhaps have to 
wait to buy the other 
after you make the purchases help your child evaluate them 
for example you might ask would you buy the item again did it 
work the way you thought it would 
on a broader scale what is the best way to teach children what 
money is how it works and and what it can and cannot do 
these days schools are devoting increased time and resources to 
the subject extensive learning material some of it even in 
comicbook form is produced by the various federal reserve banks 
around the country 
for information about how to get this material most of which is 
available at no charge when requested in single quantities you can 
write or telephone your nerest federal reserve bank or branch 
fidelity investments the bostonbased mutual fund and discount 
brokerage firm offers a teaching kit titled you and money free 
to parents it can be ordered by telephoning 18005446666 in 
massachusetts 6175231919 collect 
nina lyvers a fidelity spokeswoman offers assurances that 
callers will not encounter sales pitches for the companys products 
or be inundated with subsequent mailings of promotional material 
the kit which employs such devices as crossword puzzles and 
word search grids stresses these points 
money is an essential resource that gives people 
decisionmaking opportunities 
money is not only earned by working but also by investing 
economics is the science of how people produce goods and 
services how they distribute them and how they use them 
to achieve financial goals planning and investing are 
essential 
however they go about it parents who try to teach their 
children about money may get an unexpected dividend that often 
comes to those in the role of instructor they may learn a few 
things themselves

you can always worry about inflation if it 
isnt present in fact it is as a threat and while the threat 
might be small it is always magnified by the number of worriers 
which is great 
inflation today is both a presence and a threat 
as a presence it is relatively minor running at an annual rate 
of about 4 percent in the past year relord 
however relative to the doubledigit rates of the 1970s 4 percent 
is indeed small 
but even at 4 percent a lot of damage can be done at 4 percent 
for example ative is a big wa 7 percent savings account earns only 3 percent 
in 
real terms but the tax is applied as if it were 7 percent 
a savings account by whatever name it is known therefore 
becomes mainly a financial technique for staying afloat rather than 
getting ahead four percent inflation cuts your dollar in half 
within 18 years add in taxes which are always applied to inflated 
rather than constant dollars and the time shrinks 
meanwhile the cost of things you save for such as an education 
for your kids or your own retirement may have their own private 
inflation rate health care inflation for example sometimes runs 
double the overall rate 
so is 4 percent damaging it is if it persists it is insidious 
as tance art merges and emerges at summer festival

its been more than 50 years since modern 
dance pioneers martha graham and doris humphrey defiantly kicked 
off their toe shoes and whirled in bare feet for a tiny vermont 
college audience 
the revolt against the rigid parameters of ballet that 
characterized the movements earliest days has faded indeed 
ballet itself has lost much of its formality over the past four 
decades largely due to the late george balanchine and his influence 
on other choreographers 
the war is over said charles reinhart director of the 
american dance festival the ballet world is more and more 
turning to modern choreographers for their creative work 
we need each other theres no doubt about that 
the proof was in the lineup for the recent sixweek festival on 
the forested campus of duke university outside of new york the 
nations dance capital the annual event is considered the mecca 
of modern dance 
virtually every major name associated with modern dance from 
martha graham to martha clarke has studied taught or performed 
at the festival more than 300 new works have premiered here more 
than 100 of them since 1969 when reinhart took over and thousands 
of dance students including betty ford kitty dukakis and madonna 
have studied here 
at this years festival choreographers known for their 
collaboration with bigname ballet companies such as paul taylor 
and lar lubovitch mixed with experimental and sometimes bizarre 
talent 
when i hear that isnt dance thats when i sit up and take 
a look reinhart said in an interview some of his farout 
proteges such as twyla tharp have gone on to become darlings of 
the modern dance world tharp was recently named resident 
choreographer at american ballet theatre 
this years event devoted two weeks to revivals of black 
american composers works including pearl primus strange 
fruit of 1943 an eerie portrayal of a white woman who has just 
witnessed a lynching donald mckayles games a dance set to 
the chanting of black ghetto children playing a street game and 
works by talley beatty and eleo pomare 
the festival also showcased 26 choreographers from china south 
africa nicaragua and other parts of asia africa and europe who 
traded ideas and styles from their own cultures as part of the 
international choreographers workshop cosponsored by the us 
information agency 
we have to help to interchange dance styles because the 
world is dying said visiting choreographer stella urzua of chile 
the worlds only festival devoted to modern dance was born in 
1934 at bennington college in vermont martha graham doris 
humphrey hanya holm and charles weidman fed up with the new york 
summer heat and the constraints of classical ballet headed for the 
cool new england climate to encourage each other and to start the 
revolution 
they danced in bare feet gained weight and practiced movements 
while lying or sitting on the ground all antithetical to the 
ethereal world of ballet they also taught students in order to 
support themselves and at the end of the sixweek session 
performed only for each other on the campus 
the festival moved to connecticut college in new london in 1948 
in 1959 new york city ballet director george balanchine 
choreographed episodes with martha graham using paul taylor as 
a solo dancer 
that was the beginning of the comingtogether 
choreographically of the two worlds reinhart said 
since moving to duke university in 1978 the festival has 
continued its cautious partnership with classical ballet while 
maintaining the endless battle for funding 
raising money to support the festival 175 million for this 
years operating budget is a yearround operation for reinhart 
his wife stephanie and two staff members at adfs new york office 
about 45 percent comes from festival tuition and ticket sales 
with the rest gathered from private corporations foundations and 
individual dance lovers as well as local governments reinhart 
said 
with funding uncertain the festivals trappings are modest an 
old white frame house shaded by crepe myrtle trees on dukes east 
campus serves as summer headquarters more than 300 dancers attend 
classes and perform in converted classrooms and gymnasiums around 
the university most of which lack airconditioning to ward off 
the stifling north carolina heat 
in a sweltering gymnasium betty jones a diminutive blonde in 
her 60s who helped found the jose limon dance troupe called out 
instructions to about 30 muscular men and women in leotards 
outside on the campus lawn more than three dozen dancers in 
chuck davis african american dance class hopped frenetically and 
sang the words to an african folk song while drummers played 
african rhythms 
in a makeshift studio off the universitys student union 
cafeteria the sound of clattering dishes competed with a jazz 
dance recording 
susan hartley a 34yearold dancer from chapel hill tried to 
absorb it all 
its live breathe and work dance every hour of the day and 
night she said i love it

when creator gene roddenberry has a question 
about star trek the man he turns to is richard arnold 
the information about star trek and the lore amassed over 
the past 22 years is so vast that only the most dedicated trekkie 
could possibly keep track of it 
arnold has been the shows official archivist at paramount 
studios for the past two years but for nearly nine years before 
that he was an unpaid but virtually fulltime consultant 
i might get a call from a game show asking which cast member 
first said beam me up scotty said arnold no one ever said 
that on any star trek episode the fans made it up like play it 
again sam 
i frequently get calls from merchandising and licensing 
theyll want to know what actor played suchandsuch a character 
and how can they get hold of him to sign a waiver television 
stations call a lot asking for help in designing a promotion 
campaign 
arnold emphasized however that he is not the final word on the 
show im a consultant he said im not hanging over 
anyones shoulders they can consult me or not 
star trek made its debut on nbc in 1966 and ran for three 
years it has also been an animated series four hit motion 
pictures have been made and a fifth is in the works and the new tv 
series star trek the next generation is an enormous hit in 
syndication 
i was 12 years old when star trek began said arnold 
id gone through the hardy boys even my sisters nancy drew 
books and edgar rice burroughs had gotten me into science fiction 
i remember i spent one summer in a tent in the backyard reading my 
mother thought there was something wrong with that 
on tv id watched lost in space voyage to the bottom of 
the sea and time tunnel then star trek came on the first 
episode intrigued me the next episode was so good i cried at the 
end after that i scheduled my life around watching star trek i 
watched the shows over and over and over again my mother couldnt 
understand that i asked her if she ever went back to the same 
restaurant 
his mother incidentally finally began watching and was soon an 
avid star trek fan herself 
arnold who was born in the same hospital in vancouver canada 
as jimmy doohan scotty ran a star trek fan club in high 
school and college he moved from canada to st louis in 1969 and 
went to his first science fiction convention with a cousin in 
downtown st louis 
it changed my whole life he said i went to the first 
star trek convention in new york in 1971 i met gene roddenberry 
there and he was very kind to me but i didnt know who he was 
until he was introduced at the convention 
that was the first of many star trek conventions he was to 
attend in following years in 1974 he moved to los angeles to work 
as a hospital orderly 
i still kept in touch with everybody and susan sackett 
genes assistant began calling me for information he said 
she knew my memory of the shows if there was a question or a 
problem theyd call me eventually it got to the point where i had 
an office a parking space and my name in the paramount studio 
directory and i wasnt even on the payroll 
i kept getting more and more calls from publicity from 
merchandising from everybody i was spending nearly all my time at 
the studio finally gene proposed establishment of the job of 
archivist and i went to work on july 1 1986 
its a job that youd think would make arnold the envy of every 
trekkie but arnold said theyre such a compatible group that they 
help each other out he frequently calls on other trekkies when 
hes stumped 
ill call denise tathwell if i need to know dialogue from the 
first 79 episodes or the movies he said richard barnett knows 
all about the toys and memorabilia guy vardaman who works on the 
new series as a standin knows the dialogue better than i do and 
hes worked with a lot of the guest stars 
arnold also turns out the bestselling star trek calendars 
for pocket books 
next up is the fifth star trek movie which was postponed 
when leonard nimoy accepted an offer from disney to direct diane 
keaton and jason robards in the good mother 
the tentative start date for star trek v the final frontier 
is sept 12 william shatner will direct harve bennett will 
produce 
i think theyll keep making the movies as long as the original 
seven cast members want to he said leonard is becoming very 
hot as a director and that could affect his availability its such 
an ensemble cast that if one actor was lost for any reason i dont 
know if the other actors would want to go on or how the fans would 
accept it

after half a century in the grip of chiang 
kaishek and his family the longruling nationalist party has a 
new leadership that hopes to steer taiwan from the authoritarian 
and uncompromising ways of its past 
the changes at the top and in direction came at the partys 
recent 13th congress in taipei 
ever since the government of chiang kaishek was driven to 
taiwan from mainland china in 1949 by mao tsetungs communists 
the nationalist party or kuomintang has been consumed by an 
undying dream of returning to govern the worlds most populous 
nation 
while the congress vowed to keep that dream alive it cautiously 
acknowledged the need to replace its aging party elders who date 
from the chiang days on the mainland to a more dynamic leadership 
aware of the need for democratic change at home and pragmatism in 
dealing with mainland china 
the new thinking comes as the mainland chinese have been making 
radical changes of their own including overtures to taiwan for a 
onenation twosystems type of arrangement they made with the 
british on capitalist hong kong 
the nationalist partys new leadership unveiled at the congress 
clearly showed power is shifting to native taiwanese who 
constitute 85 percent of this prosperous islands nearly 20 million 
people 
president lee tenghui was acclaimed the first native taiwanese 
leader of the party that helped consolidate his power base that 
was virtually nonexistent when he succeeded chiang chingkuo the 
eldest son of chiang kaishek as head of government upon his death 
in january the elder chiang who was elected head of the party in 
1938 died in 1975 
the partys policymaking central standing committee long 
dominated by mainland chinese for the first time has a native 
taiwanese majority 
giving more power to native taiwanese was part of a sweeping 
liberalization program that began with chiang chingkuo the final 
ruler of the chiang family dynasty 
shortly before his death chiang chingkuo lifted martial law 
allowed the formation of opposition political parties and ended a 
38year ban on travel to china to allow family reunions 
president lee has promised to continue the liberalization 
process but may proceed with caution since his new 31member 
central standing committee still contains some party elders who 
remain unenthusiastic about a quick pace of change 
we dont believe drastic change will benefit society the 
partys 38yearold deputysecretary general ma yingjeou told 
reporters at the end of the congress 
the major unresolved political issue is overhauling the 
parliamentary system in which aging nationalists elected in 
mainland china before 1949 hold a majority of seats as a symbol of 
the partys claim to rule the country 
in the legislative yuan the highest lawmaking body the old 
guard has an advantage of about 2to1 over taiwanelected 
legislators 
ma said that through retirement of party elders and an increase 
in the number of seats contested on the island the ratio of 
holdovers to taiwanelected lawmakers should be about equal after 
elections in late 1989 
after another three years taiwanelected representatives should 
hold a 2to1 edge he said 
the opposition democratic progressive party however has staged 
street demonstrations in support of opening all seats to elections 
actions that elicited expressions of caution from the nationalists 
on the need to maintain law and order 
under pressure from the new generation of leaders the party 
congress adopted a more practical approach to dealing with the 
mainland ma described the new policy as providing much more 
flexibility to what we had been doing before 
the kuomintang which once sent ballons across the taiwan strait 
with handbills urging an uprising against communist bandits 
now will try to influence their compatriots by taking the taiwan 
experience of economic prosperity and growing democracy to china 
the ban on travel to taiwan from china also has been eased the 
nationalists also will tolerate imports of chinese raw material and 
the export of taiwan investment to the mainland so long as the 
business is conducted through a third country 
there is no way we can control indirect investment as well as 
indirect trade ma said 
the point of the new flexibility according to the policy 
statement is to utilize our political and economic influence to 
win the support of our mainland compatriots 
the changing face of the kuomintang prompted a leading member of 
taiwans opposition party to acknowledge the ruling partys new 
dynamism 
huang huanghsiung a lawmaker from the opposition democratic 
progressive party acknowledged that his party is facing a new 
challenge from the restructured kuomintang 
but i believe the condition is better for democratization 
now he said we can better pressure them to compete with us on 
equal footing

alice hoffman calls at risk her seventh 
work of fiction another very small domestic book everybody 
else in the publishing industry is calling it that aids novel 
even before publication 20th century fox snapped up the film 
rights to that aids novel and the bookofthemonth club made 
it a main selection hoffmans publisher gp putnams sons has 
run off a first printing of 100000 copies and is spending 100000 
to promote at risk the kind of publicity campaign usually 
reserved for authors who trade bon mots on the talk show circuit or 
write diet and exercise books 
hoffman was recently in new york to discuss at risk 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and why such topical subject 
matter is often considered the kiss of death for socalled 
literary fiction 
i think some critics for reasons i dont truly understand 
feel that a writer shouldnt write about something thats topical 
that theres news and theres literature and the two have nothing 
to do with each other said hoffman whose illumination 
night fortunes daughter and other works have firmly 
established her as a serious writer 
i think that i always write about issues white horses her 
fourth novel is about incest my last book illumination night 
is about agoraphobia she said i think it just so happens that 
what i was obsessed with was what a lot of other people are 
obsessed with i think thats why at risk is getting more of a 
reaction than anything ive done before 
i really wrote it for myself i really thought it was this 
very small domestic book it seems to me amazing that there 
arent more books about aids because i think there are so many 
different stories to tell 
the story hoffman has chosen to tell is of the farrells a 
painstakingly normal new england family whose world collapses with 
the discovery that 11yearold amanda has contracted aids from a 
blood transfusion while she battles ostracism from her classmates 
and struggles for small victories in gym meets her parents ivan 
and polly retreat from one another and her 8yearold brother 
charlie languishes from neglect 
hoffman was asked why she opted to have a character get the 
disease through a blood transfusion a rare occurrence even before 
blood was routinely screened for aids 
i wrote about the thing i know the best the thing that im 
most enmeshed in right now and thats family life said hoffman 
who has two sons jake 5 and zack 4 months 
i imagined how i would feel if my kid was in school with 
somebody with aids especially at the preschool level i felt 
fearful i knew it was irrational i knew it made no sense and in 
a way this book was a personal way of working that out 
she said her approach highlights the universality of the aids 
problem by giving the disease to a child instead of to a homosexual 
male aids is not a gay disease and to look at it that way is 
very dangerous and really destructive hoffman said 
writing a book in which a central character suffers from a fatal 
disease smacks of potboilerdom but hoffmans rich and imagistic 
prose saves at risk from becoming maudlin she was asked if she 
found herself fighting sentimentality 
i dont think i fight sentimentality she said quickly 
laughing i dont think im sentimental but im definitely 
emotional i think sometimes those two things are thought of as the 
same thing i also think that a lot of times what women are 
sometimes more interested in is thought of as sentimental as less 
important things like families and children emotional 
entanglements that kind of thing 
hoffman 36 grew up on new yorks long island and attended 
adelphi university before earning her masters degree from stanford 
universitys prestigious creative writing program she has been 
writing and publishing steadily since then living in a big old 
fallingdown house outside of boston with her husband and two 
children 
since moving to that area about eight years ago she has written 
one or two screenplays a year only one has been made into a 
commercially released film independence day but the pay is 
still lucrative enough that her husband tom martin quit his 
teaching job to work at home with her on the projects she has 
already completed the screenplay for at risk although 
production has not begun on it 
the writers strike has idled her screenwriting for now and she 
has not started work on her next novel what then is she working 
on these days 
she smiled birth announcements

a papal edict that caused an upheaval in roman 
catholicism was commemorated this week american bishops saluted it 
for prophetic wisdom but recognized obstacles to it 
the occasion was the 20th anniversary of the late pope paul vis 
1968 encyclical humanae vitae of human life which 
reaffirmed the churchs ban on contraception and set off a church 
storm 
repercussions still linger in the widescale catholic rejection 
of the particular prohibition and as seen by some scholars in the 
spread of dissent to other areas of church teaching 
in this country and elsewhere the event catalyzed a searching 
examination of catholic rights of conscience and debate over it 
still goes on 
the enclyclical asserting an inseparable link between the 
unifying and reproductive dimensions of sexual intercourse said it 
always must remain open to the transmission of life 
despite continuing resistance to the rule bishops and some 
catholic groups paid tribute to it also a new study gave a 
positive assessment of the churchs only approved way of limiting 
pregnancies natural family planning 
this involves charting the wifes period of fertility and 
avoiding intercourse during it in responses from 3763 couples 
using the method 70 percent found it satisfactory 
the results verify that couples who are properly instructed 
and welldisposed find natural methods satisfactory and 
effective said chicagos cardinal joseph bernardin head of the 
bishops prolife committee 
it was the first such nationwide study of its kind with answers 
to questionnaires gathered from couples instructed in the use of 
natural methods in 24 diocesan programs across the country 
the study funded by the knights of columbus a national 
catholic fraternal organization found that twothirds of the 
husbands and wives consider it important to be in conformity with 
church teaching in their sex lives 
only about 10 percent reported unintended pregnancies in the 
past year 
the results are highly encouraging said auxiliary bishop 
james t mchugh of newark nj director of the churchs diocesan 
development program for natural family planning 
however as indicated by numerous surveys over the past decade 
large majorities of catholics generally found at more than 70 
percent and ranging up to 90 percent disagree with the churchs 
ban on contraception 
that situation multiplying into dissent on other church fronts 
burst widely after the promulgation on july 29 1968 of humanae 
vitae 
it generated public dissent from about 650 american catholic 
theologians including most of some faculties and created 
prolonged turmoil in washington between priests and the late 
cardinal patrick oboyle 
several national hierarchies in canada belgium austria west 
germany and elswhere affirmed conscientious decisons about the 
issue similar to a 1971 vatican compromise settling the dispute 
in washington 
meanwhile in the early phases of the outcry us catholic 
bishops in 1968 issued a statement recognizing rights of 
responsible theological dissent 
but in 1986 this was repudiated as unworkable by 
washingtons archbishop james hickey now cardinaldesignate after 
the vatican barred the rev charles curran a noted moral 
theologian from teaching theology 
he dissented from various church sexual teachings including 
bans on contraception and divorce 
paul vis controversial encyclical came in the wake of the 
196265 second vatican council from which he had removed the 
issue to study it he set up a broad commission of scientitific 
and religious scholars 
its strong majority recommended dropping the contraception ban 
and pauls reassertion of it hit like a thunderclap 
he attributed resulting difficulties largely to a certain 
climate of expectation which had given rise among catholics and in 
the wider circle of public opinion to the idea of presumed 
concessions 
twenty years later the us bishops committee for prolife 
activities said we see ever more clearly the prophetic wisdom 
of the churchs position and the courage of pope paul vi in 
reaffirming it 
at the time he did so they said the birthcontrol pill was 
relatively new and people were still reeling from the sexual 
revolution of the 1960s todays climate is different again 
looking back over the past 20 years we can see a gradual 
decline in family size and an increase in divorce both notably 
pronounced among catholics and an overwhelming assault on the 
sacredness of human life in judicial decisions and social policies 
regarding abortion 
we find in our society a growing ambivalence regarding 
children and an increasing tendency to equate the bond of marriage 
with mere cohabitation 
against these tendencies the bishops said adherence to the 
churchs teaching against contraception helps married couples 
develop sensitivities to each others needs that solidify the 
marriage relationship 
efforts to live their sexuality in accord with the teaching of 
the church brings to married couples peace of mind and conscience 
it also deepens their faith and affirms their reliance on gods 
providential care

dont be surprised to find a certain lack of 
respect for authority in martin brests films the director is a 
bit of a smart aleck himself 
it has to with my upbringing and feeling that im on the 
outside said brest i was a sort of wiseguy kind of kid very 
antiauthoritarian i sort of loved to be indignant to authority 
that seems to be a good thing for the movies 
hes directed his share of wiseguys george burns in going in 
style eddie murphy in beverly hills cop and robert de niro 
in midnight run all three films feature someone in trouble 
with the law a theme that dates back to brests earliest efforts 
i think about movies i did in new york university film 
school little tiny short films he said all those films 
usually centered around one person who is on the outside and starts 
getting involved in some overambituous thing to get ahead and 
winds up creating a chain reaction 
midnight run is brests fourth feature film de niro stars 
as a bounty hunter who will collect 100000 from his bondsman if 
he can bring a bailjumping accountant from new york to los angeles 
de niro is going to los angeles by plane but changes his plans 
when the accountant grodin reveals his fear of flying the two 
instead travel by car bus passenger train and box car pursued by 
the fbi local police a fellow bounty hunter and the mafia from 
whom grodin took 15 million and donated to charity 
brest and screenwriter george gallo created the story 
we were just hanging around talking and he told me about a 
friend of his that had to go to new york to pick up a prisoner and 
after he got the prisoner on a plane the guy went nuts and 
couldnt fly brest recalled they had to come across the 
united states with different types of transportation 
the film required extensive location work a process that took 
its toll on the crew 
each day the crew is presented with an entirely new set of 
problems he said each time we got to new a place by the time 
we knew the problems and how to deal with them we had to move to 
another place 
our camera crew quit our assistant director crew quit it was 
a difficult production 
but brest had more than enough to be thankful for while making 
midnight run starting with the actors 
it never occurred to me in a million years that robert de niro 
would want to do my movie said brest still shaking his head in 
amazement i couldnt believe it 
he recalled one scene in midnight run in which de niro 
visits his exwife in chicago and asks for money 
he asks her what her new husband will think about her giving 
him money and she just says itll be ok hell understand he 
says well thats love when he says it his spine just kind of 
collapsed his posture just collapses in the subtlest way 
i cant picture him thinking well when this line comes up 
ill just collapse my spine its just so in character that it 
happened and its so subtle and so powerful that you think where 
did this guy think of that 
thats genius of the highest order when hes doing apparantly 
so little 
genius is a word brest also uses for grodin who the 
director described as one of the great deadpan humorists 
the pairing of the blankfaced grodin and the intense de niro 
worked out better than brest had ever imagined 
when i told people i was doing this movie with robert de niro 
and charles grodin they thought it was the weirdest combination 
brest said once i saw the two of them together it was 
screamingly obvious to me that they were the perfect combination 
midnight run centers on the lovehate relationship of de 
niro and grodin who are endlessly fighting and making up the 
bantering between male leads can be found in brests other features 
as well 
i think it all has to do with the fact that when i was growing 
up the things i used to watch on tv that i enjoyed were laurel and 
hardy movies and the honeymooners he said those are the 
things that entertain me more than anything having them as sort of 
role models

many heavyweights bound for tokyo to appease local hunger pangs for 
foreign theater 
its event heaven here said shirahama who has also 
published several books on japanese theater 
for star performers a tokyo engagement usually is more than 
just stage appearances many are given plum tv spots plugging 
sponsor products in their contracts 
we even get requests from foreign artists to sponsor them in 
tokyo said norio takahashi of the japan performing arts corp 
theyve recognized the clout japan holds and the need to succeed 
here 
for giant corporations doubling as sponsors for the eager 
artists is a way of polishing the company name takahashi said 
though they rarely make profits because of the astronomical costs 
and heavy taxes involved 
asahi breweries paid dearly when it sponsored a recent met tour 
it picked up a tab of 3 million to put the company on stage but 
the amount is small compared to the estimated 17 million needed to 
transport milans 500member la scala opera in september 
hefty door prices are inevitable to offset the production costs 
but for the yenstrong japanese who still buy if the price is 
high money is no obstacle 
peter brooks the mahabharata for example was sold out 
months in advance despite the 270 ticket price for the ninehour 
play choice box seats for two were tagged at 615 each 
japan is an affluent society said toshiko kuronuma 
director of japan arts corp people can afford the high prices 
for the tickets 
she also said the japanese people are no longer satisfied with 
home productions of opera and ballet and now want to see the real 
thing 
their tastes have gone up kuronuma said 
language is also no handicap for the japanese audience the 
shows make sure to cater to every need 
during its tour the second to japan but the first in 13 years 
outside north america the met projected japanese subtitles on a 
small screen above the stage 42nd street meanwhile made do 
with simultaneous interpretation 
but the phantom of the opera went one step further and was 
both translated and adapted for a local theater group as were 
other musicals including cats la cage aux folles and 
les miserables 
as for the greatest show on earth which made its 
international debut last month in northern sapporo the singing 
american ringmaster is pulling in crowds with shouts of 
subarashii zoosan okashii piero amazing elephants strange 
clowns after a twomonth japaneselanguage crash course 
in order to accommodate the flood of imported productions 
concert and theater halls have been sprouting up all over tokyo in 
less than three years more than a dozen have opened their doors 
while about eight more halls will be inaugurated next year 
probably the most ambitious to date has been the tokyo globe 
theater a pinkish gray 650seat structure built at a cost of 154 
million it was inaugurated with a performance by the royal 
shakespeare company in april across town the casals hall 
dedicated to the late cellist pablo casals opened last december 
the sleek new suntory hall was the site for the israeli 
philharmonic orchestra conducted by mehta seating over 2000 it 
was among the first of the modern music halls to open its doors to 
imported artists two years ago 
the rise in foreign theater has definitely influenced interest 
for new halls its a good feeling to listen to music in pleasant 
surroundings kuronuma said 
she dismissed criticisms that the japanese interest in foreign 
productions was merely a boom and said it was even likely to 
replace noh and kabuki as the major theater form 
noh and kabuki appeal to the older generations kuronuma 
said but opera ballet and the like attract a bigger group of 
people including the young crowd 
with them the trend is toward internationalizing japanese 
theater she added is too traditional

dissident bishop richard williamson 
excommunicated from the roman catholic church in the churchs first 
split in 118 years says pope john paul ii is wrecking his own job 
he is like a soft drink seller praying for cold weather 
williamson says hes going to put himself out of business 
williamson 48 was ousted from the church at the end of june 
after he and three others were consecrated bishops by rebel 
archbishop marcel lefebvre in a ceremony in switzerland 
pope john paul ii promptly excommunicated him and the four new 
bishops provoking the first major schism in the roman catholicism 
since 1870 also ousted was retired brazilian bishop antonio de 
castro who took part in the ceremonies 
williamson predicted the official church in 10 years will 
almost have disappeared 
the only catholic church strong will be the catholics that 
keep to the complete faith he said for us the future looks 
bright but for the mainstream church people will have gone the 
modern way and cease to be catholics 
lefebvres traditionalist followers are estimated at 100000 to 
500000 by the vatican and more than a million by lefebvres 
headquarters in econe switzerland 
lefebvre 82 denounces church reforms of the 196265 second 
vatican council including its affirmation of religious liberty 
ecumenical relations with other christians and putting the latin 
liturgy into modern languages 
he charges the church has been protestantized and 
democratized he was suspended from functioning in 1976 but 
defied it and expanded his movement ordaining more than 200 
priests 
consecrating the new bishops brought his ouster and theirs 
the britishborn williamson a graduate of cambridge university 
ran the rebel movements st thomas aquinas seminary in ridgefield 
until it recently moved to winona minn he plans to stay in 
rdigefield to operate a retreat center there 
he said pope john paul ii is not understanding of how to 
defend the faith in todays world 
for example the church is to move with the times but not 
jump in with the times williamson said in an interview at the 
st ignatius retreat house 
if a man with a rope is trying to save a man who is drowning 
he shouldnt jump in with him williamson said 
williamson said it doesnt bother him that his actions are 
disapproved by the pope 
if he was a rootin and tootin catholic pope id be all 
shook up he said but since hes losing his catholic way it 
doesnt upset us 
the excommunications expel williamson and the others from the 
church and prohibt them from receiving its sacraments 
this pope on his present course will destroy the papacy 
williamson said but the catholic church has the guarantee of the 
lord that it will survive until the end of time and part of that 
is the survival of the papacy 
williamson has not always been a catholic nor has he always had 
dreams of becoming a priest or bishop an anglican he converted to 
catholicism when he was 30 years old 
i never wanted to be a bishop williamson said he added 
that he was selected by lefebvre 
williamson said he decided to become a catholic because i 
knew the world was going to hell in a hand basket 
he said he the catholic religion is the only answer 
williamson says he plans to travel and admister confirmations 
and ordinations 
a number of catholics dont take this excommunication too 
seriously he said 
he pointed out the pope is considered infallible only under 
certain circumstances and outside of those hes not infallible 
the pope has to be speaking as a pope on a matter of faith and 
morals with the intention of binding the whole church in a 
definitive or defining fashion he said outside of those 
circumstances hes capable of saying 2 plus 2 is 5 
williamson also denies the ceremony in switzerland was a schism 
a schism means someone was cut off from the church he said 
we claim to be very much a part of the church 
in another interview with the long island catholic williamson 
predicted that rome will come back to tradition when god uses 
the russians who are on the brink of invading europe to 
chastize the church 
the pope fleeing rome will then turn to the traditionalists 
williamson said 
in response to a question he agreed with lefebvres charge that 
the roman hierarchy is doing the work of the antichrist

harvey fierstein said he wrote tidy 
endings because he wanted to explore the personality of a man who 
would fall in love with another man terminally ill with aids 
the short play picks up the story after collins death as 
arthur his lover and marion his former wife bicker over 
division of the estate 
tidy endings which home box office will cablecast beginning 
sunday was the last segment of fiersteins safe sex trilogy on 
broadway fierstein also stars as arthur and stockard channing is 
marion 
its a drama about a man whos bitter lost hurt and 
bleeding said fierstein i had a lot of questions about that 
character i write to explore personalities i wanted to look at a 
man who would fall in love with someone terminally ill 
this is about how he deals with it theres something very sad 
about arthur i think he wants everyone to mourn for him and hes 
sort of disappointed when people dont he has a kind of florence 
nightingale quality he gives up his job to care for this man 
fierstein was interviewed during a lateevening break on a 
location set for the motion picture version of torch song 
trilogy he won two tonys for writing and starring in the comedy 
on broadway it tells the story of arnold beckoff a gay young man 
and female impersonator whose homosexuality is driving his jewish 
mother to distraction fierstein won a third tony for writing the 
book of the musical la cage aux folles 
in tidy endings marion has gone on with her life but 
arthur is devastated by the death of collin 
she had to give the funeral write the obituary and now shes 
telling arthur to move out of the apartment said fierstein 
she has a problem of letting go as well i thought of them as two 
vultures fighting over the memory of this dead man these are two 
people who should be taking care of each other theyre jealous and 
neither can trust that collin could love them both thats what 
drew me to the story 
i think theyre both incredible people i couldnt do what 
either one did i think theyre both heroes although the death 
puts them in their worst light 
in the story that spawned the play arthur does not begin his 
relationship with collin until the latter is terminally ill he 
also forges a truce of sorts with the young son collin had with 
marion 
fierstein was in his motor home dressing room which was parked 
outside a seedylooking bar standing in for a gay hangout in new 
york he was preparing for a scene in which he meets his lover 
played by brian kerwin he was in the last days of a twomonth 
shooting schedule torch song trilogy was written in the 
worryfree days before aids and is played as a period story 
the movie also stars anne bancroft as his mother estelle getty 
of the golden girls played the role on broadway matthew 
broderick plays the love of his life who is killed by a street 
gang hunting for gays eddie castrodad is his young adopted gay 
son and karen young is the woman kerwin leaves arnold for when he 
begins to worry about appearances 
fierstein is both an actor and a writer but calls himself an 
artist because he doesnt want to be limited he has a degree in 
painting from the pratt institute if i never act again its 
ok he said if i never write again its ok lifes too short 
i always say a murderer is much more forgivable than a person who 
is boring 
i had a painting teacher who turned me off painting i turned 
to ceramics i have a house full of ash trays to prove it in 
college i was writing and painting and acting all at the same 
time 
fierstein has also appeared in such movies as garbo talks 
annie hall dog day afternoon the tv movie apology 
and narrated the awardwinning documentary the life and times of 
harvey milk his wellknown foghorn voice has also been heard as 
satan in the tv movie the demon murder case 
he bristles at a question suggesting that playing mostly gays 
might be typecasting you wouldnt ask william hurt if he plays 
only straight roles he said id much rather play a 
homosexual i know a lot more about it i happen to think 
homosexuality is the norm 
fierstein has also written the book for the musical legs 
diamond very loosely based on the new york gangster it goes 
into rehearsal soon with peter allen who wrote the music and 
lyrics in the title role 
this has almost nothing to do with the real legs he 
explained we are not glamorizing gangsters we are glamorizing 
show business

michael dukakis was in cleveland preparing for 
several interviews when he picked up a microphone and announced 
good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to bostons 
historic faneuil hall for tonights segment of the advocates our 
topic tonight the horrors of the vietnam war 
the democratic presidential nominee was simply making a 
microphone check but he also was providing a glimpse back to his 
days as a television star of sorts 
ronald reagan had his death valley days when he was a 
candidate dukakis has the advocates 
while no one is comparing the massachusetts governor favorably 
to the great communicator in terms of television presence his 
cool and relaxed manner in tv interviews and campaign debates has 
been noted 
the program dukakis hosted from 1971 to 1973 and from 1978 to 
1980 pitted two teams usually divided along liberal and 
conservative lines against one another to debate topical issues 
he had little onair experience before that but former 
executive producer greg harney said he took to it like a duck to 
water we spoke to him about looking at that camera lens as if its 
your wife beyond that dukakis needed little coaching harney 
said 
the 60minute program broadcast on public television from 
wgbhtv studios in boston kept dukakis up to date on major issues 
also it helped him develop skills on television that he would 
later use successfully as a candidate and a governor 
it was superb training for him said robert barum a 
broadcast journalism professor at boston university who watched 
dukakis from close range as an onair columnist for public 
broadcasting stations 
it wasnt one of those tv programs where all you did was look 
at a teleprompter barum said he had to be very fast on his 
feet and yet be evenly paced 
dukakis joined the program after an unsuccessful run for 
lieutenant governor it was a period of political planning for 
dukakis when he was beginning to build the organization that would 
win him the governorship four years later 
conservative writer avi nelson who appeared on several 
programs said dukakis television presence has changed little 
it was a dry level performance then and its a dry level 
performance now nelson said 
new york media consultant david garth also appeared on the 
advocates 
he learned very early on that television is a medium of the 
economic use of the body and the hands garth said you dont 
have to be jumping all over the stage or the screen to get 
attention 
garth said the taped format enabled dukakis to review his own 
performance on the broadcasts each week and to work slowly to 
improve but garth who worked for dukakis democratic rival albert 
gore in the new york primary said that not all of dukakis 
experience could be carried over to a campaign 
some of those dynamics change when you become the total focus 
rather than the man in the middle garth said in speeches and 
debates he finds dukakis a little bit too much under control 
and he is annoyed by dukakis frequent tuckedinthumb hand 
gestures 
dukakis took two years to decide whether to seek office again 
after his failed bid for reelection in 1978 he needed only weeks 
to decide to go back on the air as moderator of the advocates 
while i regret the circumstances that allow me to be here 
its good to be back dukakis told his audience he said of his 
return performance its amazing how fast you settle back in 
being governor didnt hurt 
the emmy awardwinning program was presented in a courtroom 
format two teams of advocates faced off over an issue each 
team had an attorneylike figure and several witnesses teams were 
allowed to crossexamine the opposing witnesses 
the advocates was one of the most popular offerings on 
public television second only to masterpiece theater at the 
time in the number of public television stations which picked up 
the program one nielsen survey indicated that 36 million homes 
tuned in to at least one broadcast of the advocates per month in 
1971 
throughout the programs on such topics as salt ii opec oil and 
vietnamese refugees dukakis seemed to side with the audience in 
almost a ted koppellike role asking witnesses to explain arcane 
or technical words in everyday language he appeared clipped sober 
and straightforward yet his demeanor seemed more relaxed than his 
typical gubernatorial appearance 
at one point during a debate on nuclear power for example a 
witness kept referring to quads of energy could you tell us 
lay people what that is dukakis asked when the response was 
its a million billion british thermal units dukakis 
translated its a lot of power 
former network correspondent marvin kalb who directs the press 
and public policy center at harvards kennedy school of government 
said the experience seems to have made dukakis about even in 
television effectiveness with george bush his future opponent in 
the the presidential election 
bush kalb said listens too much to his advisers who would be 
better to let bush be bush dukakis has a way of clipping off 
the end of a sentence his voice runs down and he repeats 
phrases according to kalb neither one is gods gift to 
television

analysts say ibms fourthquarter earnings could 
benefit from its new series of mainframe computers which are 25 
percent to 50 percent more powerful and up to 15 percent more 
expensive than their predecessors 
international business machines corp on tuesday unveiled the 
new machines which are the latest version of the companys 3090 
series that debuted in 1985 
the 10 models in the enterprise system3090 s series are led by 
the model 600s which ibm called the industrys most powerful 
general purpose processor it has 56 percent more processing 
power than its preceding model 
the new machines range in price from 985000 for the basic 
120s model which will be available in september to 124 million 
for the most powerful 600s model which will be available in the 
fourth quarter 
analysts said that although the new machines were priced between 
10 percent and 15 percent more than preceding models they welcomed 
the increase because of the positive effect it would have on 
overall future earnings 
in the past ibm had been pushing prices down very aggressively 
while looking for volume to offset the increase and they had 
been disappointed said stephen cohen analyst at gartner 
securities corp in stamford conn 
but computer users have been more interested in a products 
performance it appears ibm has been getting that message and 
this is clear evidence they are focusing more on performance than 
price cohen said 
on the new york stock exchange ibm gained 25 cents to close at 
12262 a share in composite trading 
while analysts had been predicting strong earnings in the fourth 
quarter they said the latest announcement solidified those 
predictions 
mainframe and peripheral products account for about half of 
ibms total revenue if this announcement had not come the 
earnings estimates would have been down dramatically cohen said 
the new products had been expected widely in the industry 
analysts said ibms mainframe orders had dropped off dramatically 
in the past few months as customers held off making decisions until 
the new products were announced 
james cannavino vice president and president of the data 
systems division said demand for the new series will be very 
strong we have talked to a lot of customers already and they are 
anticipating it 
he said he expected orders to begin coming in within the next 
few weeks 
irving wladawskyberger vice president of ibms data systems 
division said the new mainframes would help customers reduce the 
number of people needed to manage data as well as cut the cost of 
manufacturing 
the new models offer faster highvolume transaction processing 
as with credit card checks or airline reservations and have 
scientific and technical applications as in aerospace design 
more than 67 upgrade options are available in the series from 
the basic system the customer has 67 different ways to increase 
capacity 
in addition to the new mainframes ibm said its mvsesa 
operating system is available a month ahead of schedule this 
operating system can be used with the 3090e models as well as new 
s models 
the company also announced an improvement offering higher 
performance levels for customers who use the computers for 
numerically intensive work such as weather forecasting and oil 
exploration

for the first time federal prosecutors have 
brought racketeering charges against a lawyer accused of insider 
trading and said they would use the law more in the future to crack 
down on financial wrongdoing 
attorney alfred elliott was one of 12 people indicted tuesday by 
a federal grand jury for alleged financial crimes 
this is the first time in history weve used the racketeering 
statute in an insider trading case said us attorney anton 
valukas 
elliott now of melbourne beach fla was accused of making 
680000 in illegal profits by using information he obtained when 
he was a partner of the schiff hardin amp waite law firm in chicago 
he misappropriated the confidential information of his firm 
and of the clients said valukas 
on nine occasions elliott learned of large pending stock 
acquisitions by clients then invested heavily in the company whose 
stock was being bought the government alleged 
the racketeering statute provides greater penalties and gives 
the government greater power to seize illicit gains than other laws 
prohibiting insider trading valukas said 
in the future we expect to use the racketeering laws as a 
powerful weapon in these cases valukas said 
elliott is charged in the 70count indictment with wire fraud 
securities fraud racketeering and filing a false income tax 
return if convicted on all counts he could be fined 135 million 
and forced to make restitution of any illegal profits 
elliott 44 could not be located for comment directory 
assistance for melbourne beach had no listing for him and his

chinas foreign trade in the first half of 1988 
increased by almost 20 percent over the same period last year led 
by sharp jumps in trade with hong kong and the united states the 
ministry of foreign economic relations and trade said wednesday 
ministry spokesman liu xiangdong told a news conference that 
total trade was 358 billion up 195 percent above last year 
exports were up 161 percent to 202 billion and imports climbed 
243 percent to 156 billion 
liu said chinas foreign trade was stable and healthy and 
demonstrated good prospects of a smooth transition from the old 
system to the new 
china is decentralizing controls over its foreign trade and is 
trying to develop export industries while confining imports to 
machinery and high technology items that will help in the nations 
modernization drive 
liu said that through may chinas trade with the united states 
was 29 billion up 263 percent from the first five months of 
1987 
trade totalled about 75 billion with the hong kong region 
during that time up 355 percent 55 billion with japan up 8 
percent 38 billion with the european community up 35 percent 
and 1 billion with the soviet union up 321 percent 
the ministrys figures differed from those released earlier this 
month by the customs office which showed china with a trade 
deficit of slightly more than 1 billion on total trade of 432 
billion 
liu said the two offices calculated differently the goods 
imported and then processed for export he said the ministry does 
not include imports of equipment by foreignfunded enterprises 
which will be used to produce goods for export 
foreign investment jumped by 186 percent in the first half 
compared with last year with the approval of 2109 foreignfunded 
enterprises liu said the value of those contracts was 2 billion 
up 130 percent he said 
he said usinvested projects jumped to 85 this year from 34 
last year 
hong kong continued leading foreign investors with 79 percent of 
projects and 67 percent of money invested 
foreigninvested companies in china exported 570 million worth 
of goods in the first half of the year up 133 percent liu said

britains merchandise trade deficit narrowed 7 
percent to 152 billion pounds or 26 billion in june the 
government said wednesday 
the improvement was below market expectations and the pound 
tumbled on the news 
the seasonally adjusted deficit compared with a revised deficit 
of 164 billion pounds in may and a deficit of 793 million pounds 
in june 1987 the department of trade and industry said 
britains current account deficit which includes invisible 
trade narrowed 11 percent to 102 billion pounds in june from a 
revised deficit of 114 billion pounds in may this deficit stood 
at 93 million pounds in june 1987 
last months trade in invisible items which covers services 
overseas investment earnings and official transfer payments was 
estimated to be in surplus by 500 million pounds 
the department previously reported mays trade deficit as 171 
billion pounds and the current account deficit as 121 billion 
pounds 
market forecasts had called for a june trade deficit of 13 
billion pounds and a current account deficit of 800 million pounds 
exports totaled 682 billion pounds in june up from a revised 
654 billion pounds in may and up from 64 billion pounds in june 
1987 
imports totaled 834 billion pounds in june up from a revised 
819 billion pounds in may and up from 72 billion pounds in june 
1987 
a foreign exchange dealer at major british bank who wasnt 
identified in accordance with british custom said the pound was 
hit by a wave of selling right after the figures were released 
shortly after the release of the trade report the pound was 
quoted at 17065 compared with 17120 just before the 
announcement 
the drop increased fears that interest rates which have risen 
sharply since early june would go up again that pressured british 
stock prices at midday 
but the foreign exchange dealer said it was too early to 
ascertain if the pound would continue falling 
nigel richardson an analyst with the london investment firm 
warburg securities said these are very disappointing trade 
numbers whether or not the cost of borrowing has to rise depends 
on what happens to sterling perhaps the markets will ride it out 
sterling has risen in the past few trading sessions on the 
countrys relatively high interest rates but market players had 
warned that the currency was susceptible to a deterioration of the 
countrys trade balance

the us economy expanded at an annual 31 percent rate during 
the second quarter but with that healthy growth came sharply 
higher inflation the government reported today 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of economic health was off slightly from a 34 
percent increase in the first three months of the year 
inflation however picked up substantially during the spring 
with a price index tied to the gnp climbing at an annual rate of 
47 percent the biggest advance since a 55 percent rise in the 
third quarter of 1982 
this inflation index which measures a fixed selection of goods 
had risen 35 percent in the first quarter 
todays report blamed the pickup in inflation on higher costs 
for a wide range of consumer goods 
in another report tuesday the commerce department said order to 
us factories for durable goods quickened by their fastest pace in 
30 months in june when heavy demand for new aircraft pushed orders 
for big ticket items up 88 percent 
but stock traders unexcited by tuesdays report noted that 
much of the increase came in military goods a category often 
subject to wide monthly fluctuations the stock market struggled to 
post a slight gain with the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
rising 214 to 207397 
in commodities markets most crop futures prices plummeted in 
response to forecasts for continued rain in the midwest 
in its durable goods report the commerce department said orders 
for items expected to last at least three years totaled 12523 
billion last month 1014 billion higher than the may total 
the june increase which followed a 19 percent decline in may 
was the biggest advance since an 89 percent jump in december 1985 
and provided further evidence analysts said of the strength in 
us manufacturing 
stripping the fluff away we are still left with a strong pace 
of activity in the durable goods sector said allen sinai chief 
economist of the boston co 
on the labor front the government said that major collective 
bargaining settlements in private industry during the first six 
months of this year provided for wage increases averaging 22 
percent a year 
the labor department said this was a slight decline from the 29 
percent average wage increases in the contracts the last time they 
were negotiated generally two to three years ago the contracts in 
the first six months of the year covered 102 million workers 
separately most crop futures prices plunged their permitted 
daily limits on the chicago board of trade following forecasts for 
more rain in the midwest and reports that recent showers had helped 
the crops 
the broad decline marked the seventh straight day of falling 
prices for future delivery of soybeans which closed at their 
lowest levels in nearly nine weeks

also contributing to growth in the apriljune quarter was a 
144 billion rise in consumer spending which climbed at an annual 
rate of 23 percent 
business investment shot up at a 14 percent annual rate during 
the spring as us manufacturers continued to spend heavily to 
expand production facilities because of export demands 
exports rose at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second 
quarter while imports fell by 62 percent 
even housing construction showed some strength in the second 
quarter rising by 28 percent partially reversing a 65 percent 
drop in the first quarter 
john wilson chief economist of bank of america said he 
believed gnp growth would slow to a rate of 25 percent to 3 
percent from july through december 
the rise in interest rates that has already occurred will slow 
growth in the second half and i am looking for unemployment to rise 
a little bit as well he said 
christopher caton director of forecasting for data resources 
inc a lexington mass economic forecasting firm said he was 
looking for the economy to slow either on its own or because of 
inflationfighting moves on the part of the federal reserve 
if the fed doesnt see some signs that the economy is slowing 
then it will move to push interest rates up farther out of fear 
that inflation could get out of hand caton said 
john hagens an economist at the wefa group another private 
forecasting service said he believed growth would be reduced by 
about onehalf percentage point in the second half of the year 
because of the adverse impact of the drought he said the higher 
prices consumers will have to pay for food will reduce the amount 
of income they have to spend on other items

the securities and exchange commission is 
investigating unusual movements in stocks prior to their mention in 
upcoming issues of business week the magazines publisher 
confirmed wednesday 
mary mcgeachy a spokeswoman for mcgrawhill inc said the 
company was cooperating with the sec which is being joined in the 
probe by the new york stock exchange 
according to wednesday editions of the wall street journal the 
american stock exchange and the national association of securities 
dealers are also participating but mcgeachy could not confirm that 
claim 
late last week the publishing company confirmed that its legal 
counsel was investigating suspicious price movements and heavy 
trading in stocks mentioned in the inside wall street column 
before business week was available to the public 
while the investigation encompasses mcgrawhills entire 
operation some magazine officials believe the information was 
leaked by someone unrelated to the editorial staff such as a 
printer at one of the four plants where business week is printed 
or a postal worker 
the magazines 960000 weekly issues are printed early thursday 
released to the press after the market closes that day and to the 
general public on friday 
experts had expected mcgrawhill to team up with the enforcement 
operations of stock exchanges and the sec to trace the leak 
mcgeachy said the magazine plans to include a statement on the 
stock activity in this weeks issue due to reach the public on 
friday the statement is expected to confirm that business week is 
conducting its own investigation as well as cooperating with 
authorities

the savoy the edwardian dream hotel on the thames 
that still makes its own mattresses and decorates each room 
differently is under siege from a massmarket predator 
the sevenyear struggle for the flagship savoy and its five 
sister hotels has become a titanic clash of business philosophies 
represented by two 79yearold men 
inside the savoy hotel plc is sir hugh wontner chairman for 36 
years and now a director he is a former lord mayor of london whose 
family controls a key 10 percent of savoy shares 
banging at the door is lord forte an italian immigrant whose 
trusthouse forte empire claims to be the worlds most profitable 
hotel and catering company 
the battle pitting old guard against the new is the kind of 
lively confrontation that inspired the gilbert and sullivan 
operettas launched at the adjoining savoy theater 
wontner is a catering adviser to buckingham palace and to 
borrow a phrase from hms pinafore he very much remains an 
englishman 
trusthouse forte does the catering at prime minister margaret 
thatchers downing street residence and symbolizes the kind of 
swashbuckling entrepreneurship that mrs thatcher deeply admires 
wontners upper crust credentials contrast sharply with 
fortes harddriving commercialism wontner says quality comes 
before profit forte says they go handinhand 
wontner wrote in a recent circular to shareholders that to be 
sucked into a vast miscellaneous combine like thf many people 
consider would be a disaster for our patrons and our staff 
there can be no need to gratify lord fortes ambitions 
in his 1987 autobiography lord forte claimed the savoy was 
falling well short of its potential he said the groups hotels 
needed to be refurbished and reequipped to restore their old 
glamor 
they require a massive injection of capital such as we can 
provide and which they have not been able to accumulate because of 
poor profitability forte claimed 
officials at the savoy built in 1889 fear a takeover will 
endanger its uniquely english identity its discretion and personal 
service 
youve got a difference of philosophy a david versus a 
goliath a small company that is trying very hard not to be part of 
a great big one said giles shepard 51 only the fourth managing 
director of the savoy in 99 years i just dont believe theyll 
provide quite what we do 
trusthouse forte promises to double the savoys profits in one 
year by injecting new money and firing its top management which it 
claims is grossly overpaid 
one of the best hotels in the world has been starved of 
investment and could be a lot better said richard power 
personal assistant to rocco forte the 43yearold heir and chief 
executive we believe that we could make it the best in the 
world 
the savoy earned 24 million before taxes last year trusthouse 
forte a 44nation conglomerate posted pretax profits of 306 
million last year from its 800 hotels and 3000 catering outlets 
in 1981 trusthouse forte captured 69 percent of the ordinary 
shares in the savoy but a complex twotier share structure 
designed by wontner to repel takeovers left the company with just 
42 percent of voting shares and no representation in the savoy 
boardroom 
trusthouse forte is suing the savoy over a 57 percent block of 
shares it wants canceled it claims wontner issued the shares 
fraudulently to strengthen his personal control over the savoy when 
he negotiated its only foreign acquisition the hotel lancaster in 
paris in 1970 
the suit is expected to reach court this fall and if forte 
wins the wontner groups absolute majority on the board of 505 
percent will drop to 47 percent and leave the balance of power in 
the hands of 2000 independent shareholders 
in a vote july 1 a majority of those shareholders voted to 
retroactively approve the 57 percent share issue as wontner had 
urged them to do but trusthouse forte is confident they can be won 
over 
wontner said the shares had been placed in a swiss foundation to 
help hotel trainees the foundation which had wontner his 
daughter and soninlaw on its board did not declare its 
shareholding until october 1986 
under british company law shareholdings in excess of 5 percent 
must be declared 
when it opened the savoy was a wonder of the age with 24hour 
room service speaking tubes on every floor and 67 bathrooms at a 
time when its most luxurious rival the victoria had just four 
the hotel still insists on pure linen sheets and towels keeps 
separate kitchens on all seven floors and decorates each of its 
300 rooms individually so that no two are identical 
under trusthouse forte shepard contended i think youd find 
some pictures might disappear off the walls youd find nice bits 
of furniture would end up in the auction room probably a lot of 
the reserves of wine in our cellars would be sold and wed get a 
standard wine list 
power denies this saying we allow places to develop their 
own character and we market them as a collection not a brand or a 
chain 
trusthouse forte spent 12 million restoring the ritz in madrid 
to its former splendor and we actually have a rembrandt in the 
george v in paris power said 
it owns the westbury in new york bought its 19th luxurygrade 
hotel the eden in rome and for 25 years it has owned familyrun 
browns in london which power calls the typification of the 
english hotel even more so than the savoy

six years after its first product was sketched on 
the back of a pancake house napkin compaq computer corp continues 
to take the computer industry by storm 
the houstonbased company last year posted sales of 12 billion 
reaching the billiondollar level faster than any other company 
in history and despite the overwhelming presence of industry giant 
international business machines corp 
the companys first product a portable computer was the result 
of a meeting over coffee involving founders rod canion bill murto 
and jim harris 
all three worked for texas instruments inc and were brought 
together on a project to start a diskdrive unit while with texas 
instruments the trio decided to venture on their own 
we didnt really realize the fast track we would be on we 
were moving quickly but we didnt fully understand how big the 
potential was said canion when we were raising our initial 
venture capital we told the investors that we thought 20 million 
or 30 million in sales the first year was possible and they 
laughed that was unheard of a company had never started with 
their firstyear sales that high 
canion and his partners began designing their first personal 
computer in february 1982 sales began in 1983 when the year was 
complete they had tallied sales of 1112 million an american 
business record 
sales in 1984 hit 329 million as the company introduced the 
desktop personal computers which became one of the topselling 
lines of desktop business personal computers within four months 
in 1985 compaq climbed into the fortune 500 making it the 
first company to do so in four years 
compaqs sales records have continued because its personal 
computers are compatible with industry standards meaning they 
support the largest base of business software programs and addon 
equipment 
in an industry dominated by international business machines 
corp compaq is playing the role of a modernday david 
challenging goliath head to head ibm has gone on to create a new 
standard with its personal system2 line but many customers prefer 
to stick with the old one 
i think were competing very well with ibm says canion 43 
company president and chief executive officer 
compaq countered an ibm product announcement in june with one of 
its own in what some analysts said will protect compaqs leadership 
in the 386processor personal computer market the new personal 
computers are based on intel corps 80386 microprocessor 
compaqs deskpro 38625 is the worlds most powerful personal 
computer according to company spokesman bob beach and the compaq 
deskpro 386s canions favorite is the first personal computer to 
use a new cheaper intel chip 
ibm announced additional models of its personal system2 line 
which included a 25megahertz 386 machine but the ibm product 
wont be available until september compaq machines already have 
been shipped 
compaq which already has 1 million square feet of space in six 
houston buildings in july announced plans for a 137 million 
expansion which will add 14 million square feet on 85 acres the 
expansion makes room for up to 4000 more employees nearly 
doubling the present worldwide work force of 4800 
i kind of like the path were on canion said of his 
companys performance i dont intend to make any major changes 
weve developed a system for identifying new product opportunities 
and then delivering those new products to market quickly 
just last week the company reported a 91 percent jump in 
profits in the second quarter to 59 million on sales of 457 
million for the first six months of the year earnings more than 
doubled to 105 million on sales of 896 million 
michael davis an analyst with lovett mitchell webb amp garrison 
in houston doesnt see compaqs growth or profits stumbling 
i dont see any clouds in the nearterm future i dont see 
any clouds in general said davis who follows compaqs ventures 
in its third year compaq unveiled its deskpro 286 model and 
portable 286 computers it took ibm nine months to offer a similar 
product and by that time compaq was enroute to unveiling a 
suitcasesize portable the portable 386 and deskpro 38620 
computers were introduced in september 1987 
eighty percent of the 386based personal computers sold through 
us dealers during 1987 were compaq personal computers according 
to storeboard inc of richardson a consulting company that 
provides market information on the computer industry 
the survey somewhat exaggerates compaqs share because it misses 
ibms sales through its direct sales force compaq only sells its 
products through about 3000 authorized dealers in 40 countries 
they primarily are attuned to the marketplace analyst davis 
said they bring products the public wants and they do well 
because they are sold only through dealers they go to great 
lengths to make sure their dealers are happy 
much of the credit for compaqs success goes to canion who has 
been responsible for overseeing its recordsetting growth in all 
operational areas canion who spent 13 years with texas 
instruments also is responsible for recruiting highlevel 
executives from other corporations he credits compaqs success to 
teamwork among employees 
we were naive in many ways and we stuck with some very basic 
philosophies canion said we didnt have all the answers and 
we used the capabilities of everybody to come up with good answers 
that evolved into our culture 
compaq was named one of the five bestmanaged companies in 1987 
by business month magazine 
what carried the day with the judges was not compaqs 
survival or even the speed with which its sales homed in on the 1 
billion mark but that it accomplished these feats fighting mano a 
mano with ibm the magazine said in its december 1987 issue 
internationally compaq is establishing a network of 
manufacturing facilities with a portable and desktop production 
plant under construction in erskine scotland and a 
printedcircuit board assembly plant in singapore compaqs first 
satellite manufacturing facility outside the united states the 
companys main assembly operations are in houston 
cofounder harris who also spent 13 years with texas 
instruments oversees the technical group that supports all product 
development he led development of the original compaq portable 
personal computer and was instrumental in engineering the companys 
subsequent products 
murto directed and coordinated overall sales operations and 
marketing before leaving the company in april 1987 to pursue a 
religious vocation 
compaqs only setback so far came when the company set up a 
dallasbased subsidiary telecommunications corp in 1984 its 
main product was telecompaq which was used to line a telephone and 
a computer into a single unit production stopped last year after 
an investment of more than 20 million analysts say 
despite that stumble analysts predict compaq 1988 sales will 
increase 25 percent to 40 percent pushing revenues as high as 18 
billion

acting associate attorney general frank 
keating said today that morale at the justice department is not as 
bad as former top department officials have portrayed it 
at his confirmation hearing before the senate judiciary 
committee keating said the morale is not on the floor 
on tuesday former deputy attorney general arnold burns 
testified that when he resigned march 29 a deep malaise had set 
in at the department in the face of attorney general edwin meese 
iiis ongoing legal problems 
keating however testified that he doesnt think the morale 
problem is as serious as burns and former criminal division chief 
william weld portrayed it at least not today 
keating said that when he came to the justice department in may 
after serving as an assistant treasury secretary i was under the 
impression that it was a black hole over there in terms of 
morale 
i found that was not the case keating said 
i think the department is functioning well and i look forward 
to serving under the man chosen by president reagan to be meeses 
successor former pennsylvania gov richard thornburgh keating 
testified 
keating was asked by sen howell heflin dala what could be 
done to improve morale at the justice department 
keating replied that it is important for the senate to confirm 
nominees to top positions in the justice department keating is 
serving in an acting capacity in the no 3 job in the department 
while harold christensen is serving as acting deputy attorney 
general 
edward dennis is the acting attorney general in charge of the 
criminal division the judiciary committee is holding a 
confirmation hearing on dennis today a hearing for christensen is 
scheduled for thursday 
earlier in the day burns said he believes meese has a blind 
spot on ethical issues and allowed himself to be hornswaggled 
by a friend trying to benefit from meeses influence 
burns also described vice president george bush as showing deep 
concern in a meeting to discuss the resignation of burns and former 
criminal division chief william e weld last march 
burns told the judiciary committee that meese had created an 
alice in wonderland world where right was wrong and wrong became 
right 
i am clinging to the notion that ed meese had a blind spot 
where these ethical issues were concerned and that he was taken 
advantage of that he was abused that he was hornswaggled by one 
e bob wallach burns said today on cbs this morning 
weld told the committee that if meese were an ordinary citizen 
he probably would have been prosecuted for taking gratuities from 
wallach a longtime friend of the attorney general 
meese has announced he will resign at the end of the month now 
that an independent counsel has decided not to bring charges 
against him following a lengthy investigation meese has criticized 
the special counsel james mckay for saying in his report that the 
attorney general probably committed three felonies and a 
misdemeanor 
burns in the cbs interview described a meeting in which he and 
weld explained to president reagan and bush why they were resigning 
the vice president was distressed ive described him as being 
florid burns said he asked quesitons and there was no doubt 
when i left the meeting i felt that in time the problem would be 
solved as it has been by mr meeses resignation 
burns said bush participated actively in the meeting he was 
both vocal and there was a lot of body language he said 
meanwhile meeses supporters were trying to undercut 
congressional testimony by the former top aides 
complimentary letters about the attorney general from 10 current 
and former justice department officials were released at the same 
time tuesday that the senate committee was hearing testimony highly 
critical of meese 
burns told the committee the attorney general was responsible 
for a deep malaise in the justice department 
meese responded by citing the favorable letters saying it 
appears that the rest of the leaders of the department dont agree 
with mr burns and theyre the ones that are much closer to the 
career employees 
weld testified to the commitee that he resigned in protest last 
march 29 along with burns after telling meese that the attorney 
general had probably broken the law 
weld told the judiciary committee that if meese were an ordinary 
citizen he probably would have been prosecuted for taking 
gratuities from longtime friend wallach at whose request meese had 
provided assistance to wedtech corp and on a 1 billion iraqi oil 
pipeline project 
weld said that on the morning he and burns resigned the 
criminal division chief told meese 
ed i dont gainsay that there are other reasons why you might 
have wanted to push these two projects a 32 million engine 
contract for wedtech and the iraqi oil pipeline redeem the 
campaign pledge in the south bronx save our cities peace in the 
middle east that is not the question 
the question is whether mr meese is taking official actions 
that he knows are going to rebound to the financial benefit of his 
friend 
justice department spokesman patrick korten responded that 
aggressive prosecutors can take the facts a little bit too far 
and pointed to the conclusion by mckay that meese had not violated 
the gratuities statute 
mckay said in his 814page report that there is no direct 
evidence that mr meese accepted anything of value from mr wallach 
with the requisite state of mind for a gratuities violation 
however mckay said meese should have been sensitive to the 
possibility that wallachs motivation was to show appreciation for 
official activities benefiting him

the present leadership of ford motor company was 
internationally trained detroit auto analyst arvid jouppi said 
wednesday the first henry ford was a worldclass guy ford 
motor co became international long before anybody else even 
thought about it 
the increases overseas offset an 88 percent decrease in its 
us earnings which dropped to 903 million in the second three 
months of this year from 982 million during the same period in 
1987 ford said 
the company said sales incentives higher material and labor 
costs and development of new products depressed domestic earnings 
but ford said those costs were offset partially by reduced 
manufacturing costs and a lower tax rate 
for the first half of 1988 ford has earned 329 billion or 
674 per share on sales of 4313 billion up 10 percent over the 
299 billion or 577 per share on 3764 billion in sales it 
made during the first six months of 1987 
wednesday marked the ninth straight quarter in which ford has 
reported a record company profit and the fourth quarter in a row in 
which it has outearned gm 
of course to beat gm the way they have is like winning two 
gold medals in the olympics jouppi said ive felt them to be 
the bestmanaged worldwide corporation today theyre proving it 
despite the showing jouppi said he doesnt expect ford to 
continue on the same pace this is the last time that ford in 
the near future will beat general motors in its earnings he 
predicted 
they are very close right now even in the second quarter and 
ford has the momentum to stay where it is jouppi added 
but its easier to move upward than to move down and general 
motors has surely been down 
another analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert in new 
york city disagreed 
my guess is that gm is not gaining on them he said if 
you look at gms profits they are just what they should have been 
theres a big gap of profitability there that is not being 
closed 
i think ford will have three times the profit margin of gm 
this year healy said gm does not appear to be catching up

shell oil co on wednesday said its 
secondquarter net income slipped 1 percent to 263 million partly 
because of lower earnings from its oil and gas exploration and 
production division 
net income totaled 266 million in the 1987 period shell a 
wholly owned subsidiary of royal dutch shell of the netherlands 
does not release per share figures 
revenue totaled 54 billion for the quarter up from 52 
billion a year ago 
in the oil and gas exploration and production division earnings 
totaled 73 million in the second quarter down from 152 million 
for the same period last year 
but earnings from oil products nearly doubled totaling 103 
million in the second quarter compared with 56 million in the 
yearago period earnings from chemical products were 133 million 
up from 101 million in the same period last year 
shell president frank h richardson said strong earnings in the 
oil and chemical products divisions helped to offset the decline in 
exploration and production earnings which mainly reflected lower 
crude oil prices 
the outlook in our exploration and production segment is for 
the most part tied directly to crude oil and natural gas prices 
crude oil prices have been at lower levels than a year ago 
richardson said 
for the first six months net income totaled 609 million a 63 
percent increase from the 374 million earned in the first half of 
1987 total consolidated net income for the first half was 15 
billion which includes a onetime gain of 900 million as a result 
of a new accounting measures adopted in the first quarter

the kroger co announced wednesday it would 
sell all of its supermarkets in florida saying it could not afford 
to invest the money needed to compete in that rapidly growing 
market 
the units to be sold include 43 supermarkets in the florida 
choice food and drugstore chain 39 liquor stores and three 
supermarkets under construction 
our florida choice operations have been unprofitable for some 
time and our own projections indicate that too much time and 
additional investment would be required to make them profitable 
kroger president joseph pichler said in a statement 
the decision does not affect the three krogerowned warehouse 
stores known as welcome stores in jacksonville fla 
kroger spokesman jim mcintire said florida choices 5000 
employees were notified of the decision wednesday the stores will 
continue to operate until they have been sold he said 
mcintire would not say how much money the florida choice chain 
has lost or for how long it has been unprofitable he also would 
not say how much money kroger felt it had to invest to be 
competitive 
he said optimistic estimates indicated that many of the stores 
could be sold in 60 days the stores could be sold individually or 
as a chain with profits being reinvested in other kroger stores or 
being used to repurchase kroger common stock periodically mcintire 
said 
kroger entered the florida market in 1980 when it opened a 
superx drugstore there the superx chain was sold in 1986 and the 
remaining supermarkets were renamed florida choice

of 5 million in the second quarter while usair group inc said 
its aftertax profit rose 21 percent during the same period 
new yorkbased pan am the nations eighthlargest airline said 
the loss compared with an aftertax profit of 105 million or 8 
cents a share in the second quarter of 1987 
the loss occurred despite a 198 percent rise in secondquarter 
revenue to 107 billion from 8968 million a year earlier 
the company blamed the earnings deterioration largely on a loss 
of 199 million at pan american world airways compared with 
profit of 63 million a year earlier the loss at world airways 
pan ams main subsidiary was partly offset by improvement in its 
northeast shuttle operation the company said 
world airways earnings were hurt by increased fuel costs 
higher aircraft rental charges and higher costs of new maintenance 
standards pan am said 
pan am recently reached a tentative labor agreement with leaders 
of its biggest union the transport workers and withdrew its 
earlier threat to sell a large portion of its assets the accord 
if ratified by the transport workers membership is expected to 
save the airline around 81 million over the next three years 
the transport workers union is the third out of the five unions 
at pan am to sign a new costsaving contract with the carrier 
which is still seeking 90 million in wage cuts from its flight 
attendants and has imposed 35 million in reductions on the 
teamsters under federal labor rules 
the new agreement with the transport workers brings us 
significantly nearer to finalizing our total labor cost reduction 
package pan am chairman thomas g plaskett said in announcing 
the secondquarter results 
the company has lost about 17 billion since 1981 
in the first half of the year pan ams loss widened to 884 
million from a loss of 831 million a year earlier firsthalf 
revenue was up 192 percent to 197 billion from 166 billion 
washingtonbased usair group the ninthlargest us carrier 
reported that its secondquarter profit rose to 925 million or 
214 a share from 727 million or 232 a share on 258 
percent fewer shares a year earlier 
revenue in the latest quarter more than doubled to 15 billion 
from 6196 million 
secondquarter results are indicators of trends that began in 
march and have continued to date said chairman and president 
edwin i colodny i am also pleased that all subsidiaries of 
usair group contributed to the record profitability of the second 
quarter 
usair group operations include usair inc piedmont aviation 
four whollyowned commuter airline subsidiaries and a leasing and 
servicing unit pacific southwest airlines which was acquired by

jitters about next weeks weather held crop futures prices in 
check wednesday on the chicago board of trade where corn prices 
fell soybeans were mixed and wheat was higher 
on other markets coffee futures plummeted sugar fell sharply 
precious metals were higher livestock and meat were mixed energy 
futures advanced and stockindex futures retreated 
chicago grain and soybean futures traded higher for most of the 
session in a technical rebound following seven straight days of 
generally falling prices linked to improved crop conditions in the 
droughtstricken midwest 
but late in the session a rumor surfaced that the national 
weather services new 6to10day forecast would predict normal 
rainfall in the region during the middle of next week said victor 
lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
the rumor was correct the forecast released about 1 hours 
after the close called for abovenormal temperatures and normal 
rainfall in most of the midwest during the five days beginning 
tuesday 
a similar rumor on monday had been borne out by the 6to10day 
forecast released that day 
today people started selling when they heard that rumor and 
down we went lespinasse said 
the price rise earlier in the day reflected bargainbasement 
buying after the sharp break in prices particularly for soybeans 
during the past seven days analysts said soybeans for august 
delivery had tumbled nearly 240 during that period to a 9week 
low of 755 a bushel 
this market has undergone significant damage and i think 
people now will be more inclined to buy on the breaks said rich 
feltes grains analyst with refco inc a large chicagobased 
commodity trading firm 
wheat settled 4 cents to 10 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in september at 361 a bushel corn was 8 cents lower 
to 2 cents higher with september at 279 a bushel oats were 4 
cents to 8 cents higher with september at 249 a bushel soybeans

bushel 
coffee futures plummeted to their lowest levels since dec 14 on 
new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange mimicking tuesdays 
sharp selloff in sugar futures sugar futures extended their 
losses 
the coffee market plunged despite the international coffee 
organizations announcement that it was cutting export quotas in a 
move designed to bolster prices said kim badenhop an analyst with 
merrill lynch capital markets inc 
the 15millionbag quota reduction brought to 515 million bags 
the total amount of coffee that producer countries may export 
during the current marketing year which ends on sept 30 it was 
the second quota reduction this quarter and the ico is allowed no 
make no more quota cuts for the marketing year 
the selloff was triggered when the price for september delivery 
of coffee slipped below 131 a pound a psychologically important 
level for technical traders badenhop said 
we just saw a wholesale bailout of speculative and fund money 
from the market today he said 
september coffee settled 890 cents lower at 12405 a pound 
october sugar settled 71 cents lower at 1135 cents a pound 
strong cash prices and expectations for a bullish cattle 
inventory report friday from the agriculture department supported 
cattle futures on the chicago mercantile exchange 
the cattle inventory report is expected to show that 
droughtrelated selling of cattle by producers has reduced the 
nations cattle herd to its lowest level in 25 years said charlie 
richardson livestock market analyst for lindwaldock amp co in 
denver 
pork futures finished mostly lower with hog prices pressured by 
a drop in the volatile porkbelly market richardson said 
live cattle settled 48 cent to 97 cent higher with august at

higher with august at 7882 cents a pound hogs were 70 cent lower

bellies were 185 cents lower to 20 cent higher with august at

precious metal futures on new yorks commodity exchange were 
buoyed by a government report that inflation had risen 47 percent 
in the first quarter the sharpest increase in almost six years

eastman kodak co said wednesday its 
secondquarter earnings rose 8 percent on a 29 percent revenue 
increase despite a sluggish performance in the companys core 
business photographic products 
for the quarter ended june 12 the company earned 390 million 
or 120 a share up from 362 million or 106 a share a year 
ago sales totaled 413 billion up from the 321 billion 
recorded in last years second quarter 
both the earnings and sales figures were records for the 
quarter the company said 
i think these numbers are more of a surprise than most people 
thought said mark obenzinger a stock analyst at wood gundy amp 
co in new york it looks like everything is cooking on all 
burners 
although sales and earnings were higher because of last 
februarys acquisition of sterling drug co the maker of such 
products as bayer aspirin and lysol disinfectant sprays kodak 
spokesman paul allen said records would have been set even without 
sterlings help 
its hard to single out any one thing that really stood out 
we had good advances across the board allen said 
he was unable to provide exact figures on just how helpful 
sterling has been to kodaks bottom line 
a lower corporate income tax rate also helped kodak to the 
record allen said 
profits for the first six months of the year were up 20 percent 
at a record 650 million or 2 a share compared with the first 
half of 1987 when they were 540 million or 159 a share sales 
for the first half of the year at 746 billion were up 27 
percent compared with last years 586 billion 
the company which is one of this countrys 10 largest 
exporters continued to enjoy the benefits of the weak us dollar 
that has made american products cheaper overseas 
the best example of this can be found in kodaks imaging 
segment which includes the companys mainstay products of film and 
photographic paper sales in this country declined 1 percent in the 
second quarter but jumped 13 percent elsewhere 
overall sales for the second quarter increased 24 percent in 
the united states and 33 percent in the rest of the world 
the imaging segment offered the most interesting aspect of the 
financial report according to eugene glazer analyst for dean 
witter reynolds worldwide profits for both the quarter and the 
first half of the year were down glazer noted 
this is because of a very significant sales phenomenon as a 
result of the introduction of kodaks new gold film he said 
dealers are selling out of inventory with the old film and 
havent been able to order enough of the new film from kodak 
as a result film sales are on the decline glazer said 
kodak chairman and chief executive officer colby chandler 
adressed that problem in his brief comment about the financial 
results when he noted that early results from the third quarter 
indicate strong sales of the new kodacolor gold film

primerica corp on wednesday reported 
flat secondquarter earnings on a 45 percent increase in revenues 
net income for the quarter totaled 505 million the same as 
the second quarter in 1987 a slight drop in the number of 
outstanding shares increased pershare earnings to 91 cents 
the greenwichbased company said a gain from retiring debt added 
10 cents per share or 54 million to the earnings totals for the 
period 
primerica revenues for the 1988 second quarter were 11 billion 
up from 7485 million a year ago the revenues included those 
generated by smith barney which was acquired by primerica in 1987 
net income for the first half of the year totaled 1062 
million off from 1202 million last year revenues in the first 
half of 1988 were 21 billion compared to 15 billion in the 
same period in 1987 
gerald tsai jr primerica chairman and chief executive officer 
said many of primericas businesses performed well during the 
second quarter and earnings continued to benefit from lower 
corporate expenses 
he also said the operating income for the companys financial 
services businesses excluding investment banking and securities 
brokerage was limited to a 3 percent improvement yearto year 
primarily due to lower earnings from the companys mutual fund 
subsidiary resulting from continued investor uncertainity 
smith barneys commissions trading and underwriting revenues 
were adversely affected by prolonged sluggishness in the financial 
markets resulting in a small operating loss for the investment 
banking and securities brokerage subsidiary during the period 
tsai said

investors who jumped into the agricultural 
commodity markets when the midwestern drought became apparent last 
spring have been scrambling for the exit doors since the weather 
changed for the wetter experts say 
with crop conditions either static or improving prices for 
future delivery of grains and soybeans have fallen precipitously 
this is not a good market for speculators anymore said 
katharina zimmer grain market analyst for merrill lynch capital 
markets inc 
the drop in crop futures prices has spilled over into the 
livestock and sugar futures markets and has prompted some 
economists to lower their monthold projections for 1989 food 
inflation from about 7 percent to 6 percent or less 
that may be good news for consumers but its a weak balm for the 
bruised speculators who bet on rising crop prices but failed to 
collect their winnings when the markets peaked late last month and 
early this month 
the ensuing decline accelerated last week into a tailspin that 
ended tuesday with soybeans for august delivery at 755 a bushel 
a 31 percent drop from the contracts high of 1093 reached on 
june 23 the value of a 5000bushel soybean contract plunged 
nearly 17000 during the period 
august corn settled tuesday at 287 a bushel down 21 percent 
from its high of 364 on july 5 
the reason for the collapse rain after 2 months of 
unseasonable heat and very little water in the corn belt the 
midwestern weather suddenly turned friendly to the struggling crops 
about two weeks ago five days of scattered showers were followed 
by cool temperatures then more rain then more cool temperatures 
the change in the weather turned this market on a dime said 
rich feltes chief grain market analyst for refco inc a large 
chicagobased speculative trading firm 
trees dont grow to the sky and this certainly is a reminder 
of that old trading adage feltes said things dont go up 
forever 
soybean futures best illustrate the rise and fall of the 
agricultural commodities because the nations relatively small 
soybean stockpile has made that market extremely sensitive to 
changing weather patterns during the growing season 
speculative interest in soybeans began mounting in april after 
the agriculture department predicted us soybean inventories would 
total about 290 million bushels when the new marketing year begins 
on sept 1 down from 436 million bushels a year earlier 
on april 4 august soybean futures settled at 680 a bushel on 
the chicago board of trade speculators who bought in at that price 
and sold just before the market peaked realized enormous profits 
they could sell today and still come out ahead 
analysts say the biggest losers were speculators who bought into 
the soybean market at about 9 a bushel in midjune and were 
determined not to sell until prices topped 11 soybeans never went 
that high and by the second week in july those investors were 
losing money on paper many have been forced to sell at a loss 
people bought on emotion rather than on supply and demand and 
lo and behold those speculators are out now said steve bruce 
an analyst with gelderman inc a chicago trading firm that caters 
to commercial processors of grain 
its not easy to make money trading commodities and i think a 
lot of people found that out he said 
some commodity funds managed by large investment houses and 
speculative commoditytrading firms had gains as high as 35 percent 
in june said chicagoan jay klopfenstein who tracks more than 90 
such investment pools and publishes their results in his monthly 
norwood index 
but klopfensteins own fund the norwood hyacinth fund was down 
12 percent as of wednesday morning according to its management 
firm dunn commodities inc of stuart fla 
sophisticated commodity traders can profit from a falling market 
as well as a rising one but analysts said the public loves a bull 
market and its difficult to persuade investors to bet that prices 
will fall 
feltes said american farmers also were losers in the drought 
rally he said grain growers could have used futures and options 
markets to lock in high prices for their crops for the next two or 
three years but relatively few did 
the american farmer is at fault here feltes said we had 
these prices up here for a month and he just let them go by

members of the house telecommunications 
subcommittee said wednesday they remain unconvinced that consumers 
will benefit from a federal communications commission proposal to 
change the way telephone companies are regulated 
panel members said they were openminded about the fccs 
proposal to lift limits on the profits of american telephone amp 
telegraph co and the local bell phone companies and instead set a 
ceiling on prices but they said they have yet to see evidence that 
the change would benefit ratepayers 
the only thing that we know for certain is that this plan has 
raised more questions than it answers said rep edward j 
markey dmass subcommimttee chairman 
atampt and the bell companies have been lobbying hard for a change 
from profit regulation to price caps but other players in the 
telecommunications industry fear the proposal would give these 
large companies too much power over competitors 
the fcc could vote on the plan this fall and put it into effect 
next year unless congress acted to block the plan or pressured the 
fcc to drop it 
at the panels hearing lawrence garfinkel atampt vice president 
of marketing services supported the plan as it applied to his 
company the nations largest longdistance company and serving 
about 70 percent of the market 
the rates of atampt the only longdistance company whose 
interstate business is federally regulated set the pace for the 
rest of the industry 
limits on prices rather than profits would in all probability 
result in greater price decreases or smaller price increases by 
creating incentives for costsavings by allowing the company to be 
more competitive and innovative garfinkel said 
but as applied to the bell companies the proposal fails to 
assure that charges for connection to the local phone networks will 
drop with declining costs he said 
mci communications corp the no 2 longdistance company also 
opposes price caps for the bell companies because of the local 
companies control of access to the local phone network 
local access charges are already excessive and higher charges 
would simply raise longdistance rates for consumers said gerald 
j kovach mci senior vice president 
philip campbell chief financial officer of bell atlantic said 
the bell companies and thus consumers would benefit from the same 
encouragement for costsavings efficiencies and innovation that 
atampt would under price caps 
at a minimum local phone rates would go up 3 percent less than 
inflation he said 
but dennis dundon chairman of the competitive 
telecommunications association which represents more than 100 
longdistance companies said lifting profit regulation on atampt and 
the bell companies would be a mistake 
deregulating monopolies is just not good policy dundon said 
without adequate controls atampt would be able to undercut 
competition by charging below cost for some services and making up 
the difference with higher prices on essential services the bell 
companies given more flexibility could tailor service 
arrangements for the large longdistance companies at the expense 
of the smaller companies 
the price cap plan is appropriate only in a fully competitive 
environment where market forces would exercise a check on 
excessive or predatory prices he said in his testimony

a new aircraft leasing company formed by great 
britains rollsroyce plc and gpa group ltd of ireland plans to 
acquire a significant fleet of boeing 757 passenger jets in a 
deal possibly worth billions of dollars to the seattle planemaker 
a rolls royce spokesman said wednesday 
michael jolley spokesman for rollsroyces us unit said the 
company envisions an order in the range of recent deals completed 
by boeing with american airlines and united airlines 
in may american announced it was buying 50 757200s and taking 
options on 50 more in a deal worth more than 4 billion if all 100 
planes are delivered a few days later united said it was ordering 
30 757s and taking options on 30 more an order united chairman 
stephen m wolf valued at more than 2 billion 
were talking about that sort of order jolley said in a 
telephone interview from the greenwich conn headquarters of 
rollsroyces us subsidiary we cant be more specific at the 
moment 
he said the two partners in the new venture company gpa rolls 
ltd were negotiating with boeing commercial airplanes officials 
but he declined to say when an order might be placed 
boeing spokesman john wheeler said he had no information about 
any negotiations they simply advised us of their preference for 
the 757 and some of the delivery dates they were looking for he 
said 
we dont have a contract or anything with them at this 
point he said were just glad to see it at this point as an 
endorsement of this particular model 
formation of the new company was announced wednesday by sir 
ralph robins managing director of rollsroyce and ta ryan 
chairman and chief executive of gpa group who signed a memorandum 
of understanding in london 
gpa currently leases 135 aircraft valued at more than 2 
billion the company does not have any 757s boeing said but has 
115 of the smaller boeing 737s 
the twinengine 757200 can carry up to 228 passengers for 3000 
nautical miles 
the 757 first introduced in 1982 had been a lagging seller 
until this year when the american and united orders were placed 
so far this year 121 of the planes have been ordered compared 
with 239 for all previous years said boeing spokesman tom cole 
boeing only lists firm aircraft orders in its records not 
options 
for 1988 boeing has orders for 426 commercial jets worth a 
total 1901 billion the company is well on its way to a 
fourthstraight year of record orders in 1987 366 jets worth 
199 billion were ordered 
boeing has a backlog of more than 170 757s and wheeler said 
space on the 757 assembly line in suburban renton has been booked 
well into 1991 
boeing says the 757 is unsurpassed for fuel efficiency and 
exceeds the toughest airport noise standards but with fuel prices 
remaining low in recent years airlines had been reluctant to place 
orders for the new jets which run 41 million to 47 million a 
copy 
besides being quiet and cheap to run industry analysts and 
airline executives have said many carriers are choosing the 757 
because the aging planes in airline fleets are starting to require 
too much maintenance also as airports are becoming more 
congested american and other carriers are looking at 757s to 
replace smallercapacity planes on many routes 
gpa and rollsroyce like the plane because it can be used in a 
wide variety of applications including transatlantic flights 
jolley said 
the 757 is a pretty flexible airplane he said noting that 
it is used by a wide range of operators from major trunk airlines 
to tour operators 
rollsroyce also has been a supplier of engines for the plane 
since its inception part of the gparollsroyce deal is that the 
planes will be equipped with rollsroyce rb211535e4 engines 
jolley said 
of the 360 757s ordered so far 211 are or will have rollsroyce 
engines pratt amp whitney is the other major engine supplier for the 
plane

the arrests of 26 merchants on charges 
of selling sexually explicit tsirts have raised questions of 
antisemitism and constitutional rights in this beach resort city 
thats ridiculous said mayor bob grissom who said the 
sweep was designed to get offensive tshirts off the streets 
the allegations of antisemitism surfaced outside a police 
station tuesday when those arrested were released on bail several 
defendants and their relatives who would not identify themselves 
complained they were targets of the probe because they were jewish 
they feel very badly that they were mistreated said rabbi 
doran aizenman of chabad lubavitch who met and prayed with the 
defendants at the jail i think its natural thats 
antisemitism one of the things that came up 
eighteen of the 26 people arrested were jewish aizenman said 
wednesday adding that 17 were from israel 
rabbi rubin kesner of temple emanuel a conservative jewish 
congregation said the issue of antisemitism is merely a nasty 
ploy by this group that has been challenged with illegality in 
their business 
kesner said those arrested are not part of his congregation but 
added the jewish teaching is the law of the land supersedes all 
other laws 
kesner said that during his 24 years in myrtle beach i have 
never had an antisemitic experience 
many of those arrested have declined to talk with reporters 
saying they are afraid their complaints might lead to more legal 
problems 
police didnt tell us what not to sell i just dont know 
exactly whats going on said solomon castro a store owner who 
was arrested he said he would stop selling tshirts when told 
which ones not to sell 
those arrested are charged with violating state obscenity 
statutes a felony offense punishable by up to three years in 
prison and a 10000 fine 
under state law something is considered obscene if it appeals 
to the prurient interest in sex is patently offensive and when 
applied to contemporary standards has no artistic political or 
scientific value 
police began buying tshirts in beach shops over the weekend 
they were shown to solicitor jim dunn who told authorities which 
decals would be considered obscene under state law police have not 
confiscated any tshirts from the stores 
one of the tshirts carried a cartoon of a male sex organ 
wearing a condom with the slogan captain condom on the front 
jack flom an attorney representing the merchants said they 
were hoping to get a national organization such as the 
antidefamation league involved in the matter 
bonds in the case were set at amounts ranging from 10000 to 
30000 by city judge dwight c lambe all those arrested were 
released by early wednesday morning 
the amount of the bonds was in the same range as those set in 
three recent murder cases in the county 
circuit judge don rushing has agreed to review the bail 
the bond amounts brought fire from steve bates the executive 
director of the state chapter of the american civil liberties union 
he called them an outrage adding jaywalking is more 
dangerous than these shirts
