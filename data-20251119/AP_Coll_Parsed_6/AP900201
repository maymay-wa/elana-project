buried in a mountain meadow on the 
edge of yellowstone national park is a complex of 150footlong 
steel cylinders outfitted with beds food kitchens and water 
systems for 756 people 
the 30 cylinders are the guts of a giant fallout shelter being 
built by the church universal and triumphant a new age religious 
group that moved its international headquarters to this 
southwestern montana ranch in 1986 
church members say the sixacre complex isnt provocative or 
extraordinary merely a precaution against nuclear war or accident 
others see it as a symbol of church chicanery and disregard for the 
areas rural environment 
we believe if you live in a nuclear world you have to come to 
grips with the reality of our time said murray steinman a 
church staffer we feel its the responsible thing to do we feel 
that more people should do it 
theyve never been willing to discuss plans prior to 
construction on anything said richard parks owner of an 
outdoorequipment shop at gardiner and a frequent critic of church 
developments any responsible developer is going to do the 
planning first and then go to the community for approval 
church officials didnt divulge its construction until last 
summer five months after the state completed an extensive 
environmental review of other church developments at the corwin 
springs ranch 
i think i was had basically said steve pilcher chief of 
the water quality bureau which oversaw the review that was 
completed last february 
church spokeswoman erin prophet said that construction began in 
may and that a decision on the site wasnt made until after the 
state review 
i personally think thats a little bit of a crock pilcher 
said you dont decide overnight on a project of this magnitude 
the church has been scrutinized by the media and its neighbors 
since buying the 12500acre royal teton ranch bordering 
yellowstone in 1981 from publisher malcolm forbes it has since 
expanded its holdings in park county to 30000 acres built two 
foodprocessing plants opened a printing plant in livingston and 
sponsored two housing developments for church members near 
emigrant 25 miles north it plans another housing development at 
the ranch 
local officials estimate 2000 church members live in the area 
or 15 percent of the county population 
persistent rumors that the church was stockpiling weapons 
against some armageddon were fueled last year when two members 
pleaded guilty to charges of illegally obtaining a dozen military 
assaultstyle weapons federal agents said they seized a shopping 
list for more firearms church officials have denied the rumors 
and say the two who bought the guns including church vice 
president edward francis were acting without the knowledge or 
approval of the church 
the shelter complex isnt the only churchrelated underground 
construction adherents are building private shelters at emigrant 
county officials counted at least 16 under construction there one 
with a capacity of 170 people a magazine published by church 
members carries advertisements selling space in the shelters with 
prices ranging from 1250 to 6270 a person 
church leader elizabeth clare prophet has preached civil defense 
since the 1970s and warns of economic and nuclear calamity in the 
90s in 1987 she said she received a divine message that the 
nation should develop civil defense and missiledefense systems in 
anticipation of a nuclear confrontation 
the confrontation didnt occur by the predicted date of oct 2 
1989 but followers say her messages are warnings rather than 
predictions 
she has said that it may happen because theres always 
free will says erin prophet mrs prophets daughter the 
americans have free will the soviets have free will but as 
long as the soviets have nuclear weapons and icbms then we think 
we need to have shelters 
the large shelter complex is in a valley where the church holds 
an annual conclave attended by thousands of followers nonmembers 
are not allowed in the area which is considered sacred church 
engineers designed the structure with advice from private firms 
and the federal oak ridge national laboratories most of the work 
has been done by church staff members 
the complex consists of six hshaped configurations each with 
five 150footlong steel cylinders about 13 feet in diameter a 
large central structure lies between two of the hshaped shelters 
church officials say the shelters water and sewage systems are 
exempt from state review because it wont be occupied by more than 
25 people for more than 60 days a year the legal description of a 
public water system 
the government says you would only need to be in the fallout 
shelter for a few weeks in the event of a nuclear catastrophe 
steinman said we dont want to live down there any longer than 
necessary 
critics including yellowstone national park superintendent 
robert barbee scoff at such reasoning and have asked the state to 
reopen its review what does it take to have state officials 
say you cant build an underground city for 750 people without 
the proper permits parks fumed 
pilcher said his office is looking for evidence of deception 
but without it the state cant reopen the case the only thing i 
could do is say to the church i think youre a liar but i dont 
have anything to prove that 
parks and other critics say the construction is indicative of 
the churchs preemptive methods of development in areas illsuited 
for it 
prophet replies that the church has followed the law and doesnt 
need to disclose its plans unless legally required to do so they 
dont really care about the environment she said they care 
about stopping us basically what they want to do is shut us down

in 1924 the times of london tuttutted about a 
peculiar new craze sweeping america making devastating inroads 
on the working hours of every rank of society 
within six years the times itself had fallen victim to the new 
addiction and the crossword puzzle was on its way to becoming as 
much a part of the british way of life as buckingham palace and 
kippers for breakfast 
the times daily crossword is 60 years old today and is 
celebrating the event by offering devotees a monster that fills 
half of page 11 with nearly 200 clues spread over five days 
like all british crossword puzzles its a maze of puns 
anagrams and misleading punctuation 
take 3 down from the times diamond jubilee puzzle faulty 
memory first daughter put in joans place 7 letters 
amnesia dynasty no reshuffle the letters of 
memory add the first letter of daughter and up comes 
domremy joan of arcs birthplace 
a practical person might ask why the clue isnt simply joan 
of arcs birthplace 
but that would be too literal for the puzzleloving british 
mind the object isnt to crack the whole thing over coffee and 
cereal but to pore over it on the train discuss it with colleagues 
at work go back to it after dinner and wake up in the middle of 
the night screaming mousetrap by jove twelve across is 
mousetrap 
according to michelle arnots sprightly history of the 
crossword puzzle the first crosswords appeared in the united 
states in 1913 and within a few years began turning up across the 
atlantic 
arnot says the ground rules for the british puzzle were laid 
down by edward powys mather a literary critic with a fondness for 
semantic contortions who published crosswords under the apt 
penname torquemada after the torturer of the spanish inquisition 
the times soon found itself having to swallow its contempt for 
such frivolities reader demand and competition from other papers 
forced it to begin running a weekly puzzle and on feb 1 1930 
the first daily puzzle appeared 
adrian bell a bookish farmer who became the times first 
compiler produced more than 5000 puzzles until his death in 1978 
it was he once remarked the ideal job for a chap with a vacant 
mind sitting on a tractor harrowing clods or bicycling 
john grant 66 who has been the times crossword editor for 
seven years works at a desk at home but often finds inspiration 
between holes on the golf course he has 10 compilers around the 
country 
solving a british crossword requires familiarity with 
shakespeare cockney slang basic french cricket and a code of 
tricky euphemisms 
for instance if the clue mentions hesitation it means the 
answer has er in it record usually signifies the word 
components list log or lp a french points the 
solver to un or une back suggests reversing the word 
so that run back means the syllable nur within hints 
at one word inside another as in unbearable 
the times crossword is by no means the hardest all the leading 
british papers publish a daily puzzle while the spectator 
listener and observer magazines run weekly puzzles of even more 
fiendish complexity 
the spectator puzzle not only contains unclued answers that call 
for intuition but also requires a dictionary that will reveal to 
solvers such words as guebres a branch of zoroastrianism 
grant does not go for puzzles that require dictionaries 
i think its much more worthwhile and difficult to outwit 
readers with words they are familiar with he said in an 
interview 
since 1970 the times has offered jumbo crosswords to tide 
solvers over holiday periods and an annual crossword tournament 
every week about 3000 solvers send in completed puzzles from the 
saturday edition the first five winners drawn by lottery win a 
goldnibbed fountain pen 
for solvers of the diamond jubilee megapuzzle first prize is a 
vacation in india and second prize a set of the encyclopaedia 
britannica 
but for most the prize is simply that sense of accomplishment 
at figuring out such mysteries as man older than most than an

member of this great house now as president it is my privilege 
to report to you on the state of the union 
tonight i come not to speak about the state of the

coming year nor to describe every line item in the budget im 
here to speak to you and to the american people about the state of 
the union about our world the changes weve seen the 
challenges we face and what that means for america there are 
singular moments in history dates that divide all that goes before 
from all that comes after many of us in this chamber have lived 
much of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were 
defined in 1945 the events of that year decreed the shape of 
nations the pace of progress freedom or oppression for millions 
of people around the world 
nineteen fortyfive provided the common frame of reference the 
compass points of the postwar era weve relied upon to understand 
ourselves that was our world until now the events of the year 
just ended the revolution of 89 have been a chain reaction 
change so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in the 
worlds affairs 
think back just twelve short months ago to the world we knew 
as 1989 began 
one year ago the people of panama lived in fear under the 
thumb of a dictator today democracy is restored panama is free 
operation just cause has achieved its objective the number 
of military personnel in panama is now close to what it was before 
the operation began and tonight i am announcing that well 
before the end of february the additional numbers of american 
troops the brave men and women of our armed forces who made this 
mission a success will be back home 
a year ago in poland lech walesa declared that he was ready to 
open a dialogue with the communist rulers of that country today 
with the future of a free poland in their own hands members of 
solidarity lead the polish government 
a year ago freedoms playwright vaclav havel languished as a 
prisoner in prague today its vaclav havel president of 
czechoslovakia 
and one year ago erich honecker of east germany claimed history 
as his guide he predicted the berlin wall would last another 
hundred years today less than one year later its the wall

in the tough competitive markets around america faces great 
challenges and great opportunities we know that we can succeed in 
the global economic arena of the 90s but to meet that challenge 
we must make some fundamental changes some crucial investments in 
ourselves 
yes we are going to invest in america this administration is 
determined to encourage the creation of capital capital of all 
kinds physical capital everything from our farms and factories to 
our workshops and production lines all that is needed to produce 
and deliver quality goods and quality services intellectual 
capital the source of ideas that spark tomorrows products and of 
course our human capital the talented workforce well need to 
compete in the global market 
and let me tell you if we ignore human capital we lose the 
spirit of american ingenuity the spirit that is the hallmark of 
the american worker and the american worker is the most productive 
worker in the world 
we need to save more expand the pool of capital for the new 
investments that mean more jobs more growth thats the idea 
behind a new initiative i call the family savings plan which i 
will send to the congress tomorrow 
we need to cut the tax on capital gains encourage risktakers 
especially those in our small businesses to take those steps 
that translate into economic reward jobs and a better life for 
all of us 
well do what it takes to invest in americas future the budget 
commitment is there the money is there its there for research 
and development rampd a record high its there for our housing 
initiative hope to help everyone from firsttime home buyers to 
the homeless the moneys there to keep our kids drugfree 70 
percent more than when i took office in 1989 its there for space 
exploration and its there for education another record high 
and one more thing last fall at the education summit the 
governors and i agreed to look for ways to help make sure kids are 
ready to learn the very first day they walk into that classroom 
ive made good on that commitment by proposing a record increase 
in funds an extra half a billion dollars for something near and 
dear to all of us head start 
education is the one investment that means more for our future 
because it means the most for our children real improvement in our 
schools is not simply a matter of spending more it is a matter of 
asking more expecting more of our schools our teachers of our 
kids and our parents and ourselves thats why tonight i am 
announcing americas education goals goals developed with the 
nations governors 
and if i might id like to say im very pleased that gov 
gardner gov clinton gov branstead gov campbell all of whom 
are very key in these discussions these deliberations are with us 
here tonight 
by the year 2000 every child must start school ready to learn 
the united states must increase the high school graduation rate 
to no less than 90 percent 
and were going to make sure our schools diplomas mean 
something in critical subjects at the fourth eighth and 12th 
grades we must assess our students performance 
by the year 2000 us students must be first in the world in 
math and science achievement 
every american adult must be a literate worker and citizen

every school must offer the kind of disciplined environment 
that makes it possible for our kids to learn every school in 
america must be drugfree 
ambitious aims of course easy to do far from it but the 
futures at stake this nation will not accept anything less than 
excellence in education 
these investments will keep america competitive and i know this 
about the american people we welcome competition well match our 
ingenuity and energy our experience and technology our spirit 
and enterprise against anyone let the competition be free but 
let it be fair america is ready 
since we really mean it and since we are serious about being 
ready to meet that challenge were getting our own house in 
order weve made real progress seven years ago the federal 
deficit was 6 percent of our gross national product in the new 
budget i sent up two days ago the deficit is down to 1 percent of 
the gnp 
that budget brings federal spending under control it meets the 
grammrudman target brings that deficit down further and balances 
the budget by 1993 with no new taxes 
and let me tell you theres still more than enough federal 
spending for most of us 12 trillion is a lot of money 
and once the budget is balanced we can operate the way every 
family must when it has bills to pay we wont leave it to ur 
children and grandchildren we will start paying off the national 
debt 
and theres something more we owe the generations of the future 
stewardship the safekeeping of americas precious environmental 
inheritance 
as just one sign of how serious we are we will elevate the 
environmental protection agency to cabinet rank not more 
bureaucracy not more red tape but the certainty that here at 
home and in our dealings with other nations environmental issues 
have the status they deserve 
this years budget provides over 2 billion in new spending to 
protect our environment with over 1 billion for global change 
research and a new initiative i will call america the 
beautiful to expand our national parks and wildlife preserves 
and improve recreational facilities on public lands 
and something else something that will help keep this country 
clean from our forest land to our inner cities and keep america 
beautiful for generations to come the money to plant a billion 
trees a year 
and tonight let me say again to all the members of congress 
the american people did not send us here to bicker theres work to 
do and they sent us here to get it done and once again i offer 
my hand to all of you lets work together to do the will of the 
people clean air child care the educational excellence act 
crime and drugs its time to act the farm bill transportation 
policy product liability reform enterprise zones its time to 
act together 
and theres one thing i hope well all be able to agree on its 
about our commitments im talking about social security 
</TEXT>

to every american out there on social security to every 
american supporting that system today and to everyone counting on 
it when they retire we made a promise to you and we are going to 
keep it 
we rescued the system in 1983 and its sound again our budget 
fully funds todays benefits and it assures that future benefits 
will be funded as well the last thing we need to do is mess around 
with social security 
theres one more problem we need to address we must give 
careful consideration to the recommendations of the health care 
studies now underway thats why tonight i am instructing dr 
louis sullivan secretary of health and human services to lead a 
domestic policy council review of recommendations on the quality 
accessibility and cost of our nations health care system i am 
committed to bring the staggering costs of health care under 
control 
the state of the government does indeed depend on many of us 
in this very chamber but the state of the union depends on all 
americans we must maintain the democratic decency that makes a 
nation out of millions of individuals i have been appalled at the 
recent mail bombings across this country every one of us must 
confront and condemn racism antisemitism bigotry and hate not 
next week not tomorrow but right now 
the state of the union depends on whether we help our neighbor 
claim the problems of our community as our own weve got to step 
forward when theres trouble lend a hand be what i call a point 
of light to a stranger in need weve got to take the time after a 
busy day to sit down and read with our kids help them with their 
homework and pass along the values we learned as children thats 
how we sustain the state of the union 
every effort is important it all adds up its doing the 
things that give democracy meaning it all adds up to who we are 
and who we will be 
and let me say that so long as we remember the american idea 
so long as we live up to the american ideal the state of the 
union will remain sound and strong 
and to those who worry we have lost our way well i want you 
to listen to parts of a letter written by james markwell pfc 
james markwell a 20yearold army medic of the 1st battalion 75th 
rangers its dated december 18th the night before our armed 
forces went into action in panama its a letter servicemen write 
and hope will never be sent sadly private markwells mother did 
receive this letter and she passed it on to me 
here is some of what he wrote i have never been afraid of 
death but now he is waiting at the corner i have been trained 
to kill and to save so has everyone else i am frightened of what 
lays beyond the fog yet do not mourn for me revel in the life 
that i have died to give you but most of all dont forget that 
the army was my choice something that i wanted to do 
remember i joined the army to serve my country and ensure that 
you are free to do what you want and live your lives freely 
private markwell was among the first to see battle in panama 
and one of the first to fall 
he knew what he believed in he carried the idea we call america 
in his heart

i began tonight speaking about the changes weve seen this past 
year there is a new world of challenges and opportunities before 
us and there is a need for leadership that only america can 
provide 
nearly 40 years ago in his last address to the congress 
president harry truman predicted such a time would come he said 
as our world grows stronger more united more attractive to men 
on both sides of the iron curtain then inevitably there will come 
a time of change within the communist world 
today that change is taking place 
for more than 40 years america and its allies held communism in 
check and ensured that democracy would continue to exist today 
with communism crumbling our aim must be to ensure democracys 
advance to take the lead in forging peace and freedoms best hope 
a great and growing commonwealth of free nations 
to the congress and to all americans i say it is time to 
acclaim a new consensus at home and abroad a common vision of the 
peaceful world we want to see 
here in our own hemisphere its time for all the people of the 
americas north and south to live in freedom 
in the far east and africa it is time for the full flowering of 
free governments and free markets that have served as the engine of 
progress 
it is time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of 
eastern europe so that continent for too long a continent 
divided can see a future whole and free 
and its time to build on our new relationship with the soviet 
union to endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal 
change toward democracy and economic opportunity 
we are in a period of great transition great hope yet great 
uncertainty we recognize that the soviet military threat in europe 
is diminishing but we see little change in soviet strategic 
modernization therefore we must sustain our own strategic offense 
modernization and the strategic defense initiative 
but the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms 
control agreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military 
forces in europe a coherent defense program that ensures the us 
will continue to be a catalyst for peaceful change in europe ive 
consulted with leaders of nato and in fact i spoke by phone with 
president gorbachev just today 
i agree with our european allies that an american military 
presence in europe is essential and that it should not be tied 
solely for the soviet military presence in eastern europe 
but troop levels can still be lower so tonight i am announcing 
a major new step for a further reduction in us and soviet 
manpower in central and eastern europe to 195000 on each side 
this number reflects the advice of our senior military advisers 
it is designed to protect american and european interests and 
sustain natos defense strategy a swift conclusion to our arms 
control talks conventional chemical and strategic must now be 
our goal that time has come

still we must recognize an unfortunate fact in many regions of 
the world tonight the reality is conflict not peace enduring 
animosities and opposing interests remain thus the cause of peace 
must be served by an america strong enough and sure enough to 
defend our interests and ideals its this american idea that for 
the past four decades helped inspire the revolution of 89 
here at home and in the world there is history in the making 
and history to be made six months ago early in this season of 
change i stood at the gates of the gdansk shipyard in poland at 
the monument to the fallen workers of solidarity its a monument 
of simple majesty three tall crosses rise up from the stones atop 
each cross an anchor an ancient symbol of hope 
the anchor in our world today is freedom holding us steady in 
times of change a symbol of hope to all the world and freedom is 
at the very heart of the idea that is america 
giving life to the idea depends on every one of us our anchor 
has always been faith and family 
in the last few days of this past momentous year our family was 
blessed once more celebrating the joy of life when a little boy 
became our 12th grandchild 
when i held the little guy for the first time the troubles at 
home and abroad seemed manageable in perspective 
now i know what youre thinking thats a grandfather talking 
well maybe youre right but ive met a lot of children this 
past year across this country and everywhere from the far east 
to eastern europe all kids are unique yet all kids are alike 
the budding young environmentalists i met this month who joined me 
exploring the florida everglades the little leaguers i played 
catch with in poland ready to go from warsaw to the world series 
even the kids who are ill or alone god bless those boarder 
babies born addicted to drugs coping with problems no child 
should have to face but you know when it comes to hope and the 
future every kid is the same full of dreams ready to take on the 
world all special because they are the very future of freedom to 
them belongs this new world ive been speaking about 
so tonight im going to ask something of every one of you let 
me start with my generation the grandparents out there you are 
our living link to the past tell your grandchildren the story of 
struggles waged at home and abroad of sacrifices freely made for 
freedoms sake and tell them your own story as well because 
every american has a story to tell 
parents your children look to you for direction and guidance 
tell them of faith and family tell them we are one nation under 
god teach them that of all the many gifts they can receive 
liberty is their most precious legacy and of all the gifts then 
can give the greatest is helping others 
and to the children and young people out there tonight with you 
rests our hope all that america will mean in the years and 
decades ahead fix your vision on a new century your century on 
dreams we cannot see on the destiny that is yours and yours 
alone 
and finally let all americans all of us together here in this 
chamber the symbolic center of democracy affirm our allegiance 
to this idea we call america and let us all remember that the 
state of the union depends on each and every one of us

text of the democratic response to president 
bushs state of the union address by house speaker thomas s foley 
of washington state 
good evening 
im tom foley the speaker of the house earlier tonight you 
may have seen me sitting behind president bush as he delivered his 
address 
the first time i was present for a state of the union message i 
was a young staff member working here in the capitol for one of the 
giants of the united states senate scoop jackson of washington 
state it was the cold winter of 1962 a few months after the 
berlin crisis and president kennedy spoke eloquently to the 
congress and the country of the burden and the glory of 
freedom 
today as we begin a new decade we join together to celebrate 
the glory of a new era of freedom this new era is not a 
coincidence or an accident its coming is due in large measure to 
those who carried the burden for nearly half a century presidents 
and people alike defenders and dissenters congresses and 
administrations from harry truman to george bush 
in a special way the credit goes to successive generations of 
young americans the 25 million who have served in the armed forces 
since world war ii and the 350000 who have been wounded or lost 
their lives 
in the end the credit goes to all the american people who have 
paid the costs and stayed the course of a cold war that was the 
longest conflict in american history and perhaps the most fateful 
conflict of modern history 
some doubted that it could ever be ended except in defeat or in 
flames but we as a nation met john kennedys challenge to 
persevere to look beyond our own shores and ambitions and 
so we have helped in ronald reagans words to turn the tide of 
history away from the totalitarian darkness and into the warm 
sunlight of human freedom 
the events are still unfolding and the old worlds new 
revolution of hope is still unfinished but this is a time of honor 
and pride for america and for free men and women everywhere

we have a continuing obligation to fulfill an obligation to 
those who struggle on from south africa to china who could ever 
forget the bravery of one chinese student who stood all alone in 
front of a tank near tiananmen square and stopped it 
we democrats believe that it was wrong for the bush 
administration to yield to pressure from a communist dictatorship 
in beijing it was wrong for the president to veto a bill that 
would have safeguarded chinese students in america from being sent 
back to their homelands reign of repression one lesson of the 
past fortyfive years is that no congress and no president should 
be timid in the defense of freedom 
theres another underlying truth in the ferment sweeping the 
globe we are perhaps near the end of a great struggle but we are 
certainly not at the end of history 
the 1990s will be a period of profound and continuing change 
this new decade marks more than a division of time and it will 
lead to more than a new century for there are new realities to be 
grasped new challenges to be met and very different battles to be 
won 
in the 1990s and well into the next century the central 
challenge for america will be economic not military the greatest 
test of our strength will be in our classrooms not our missile 
silos the gravest threat will come not from any nations attempt 
at world domination but from every nations complicity in the 
worldwide destruction of the environment 
this period of vast change will be a period of fundamental 
choice much of what the president said tonight i agree with some 
of what he said i disagree with 
but my purpose here is not to debate point by point im here to 
tell you where we as democrats stand the values we hold the 
vision we have the choice we believe in 
first we believe that we must renew our economic capacity and 
regain control of our economic destiny 
today the america that invented the computer chip and the vcr 
has seen its market share shrink or vanish in both products 
we are falling dramatically behind in new technologies such as 
high definition television 
as democrats were not satisfied with a trend that has seen 
this nation drop from first to sixth in standard of living were 
not satisfied to be told that within 10 years the average west 
german worker may earn 150 percent as much as the average american 
worker were not satisfied to have american students rank near the 
bottom of the industrial nations in math and science

we will set a national goal of making our schools once again the 
best in the world by the year 2000 on this issue the presidents 
words seem to agree with us but his actions say something else 
you cant become the education president with all the problems we 
face in this area by proposing a meager 2 percent increase in the 
education budget thats a fact and for all the talk thats 
exactly what the president proposes to do 
we also believe that american corporations have a responsibility 
and should have the opportunity to reinvest in america we believe 
that the wave of corporate mergers and leveraged buyouts is a 
waste of resources it leaves wall street raiders with large sums 
of money in their pockets and it leaves our companies 
overburdened with debt and weakened in competing for world markets 
this issue represents another real difference between us and the 
republicans for too many years their policies have encouraged 
debt and quick profit instead of investment and longterm growth 
the result the amount of private resources put into research and 
development has fallen in real dollars 
its imperative to reverse the trend and to secure americas 
place on the frontiers of enterprise and invention 
at the same time we must demand that nations trading with us 
give our products an equal chance in their markets products 
ranging from innovations in the service sector of the abundant 
harvests of american agriculture 
make no mistake about it we favor expanded trade but we reject 
the idea of oneway free trade we believe this nation should be in 
the business of exporting the goods our workers make not the jobs 
our workers need 
we also believe in encouraging a rise in savings which have 
collapsed to a record low during the 1980s the republicans say 
they want to do this by cutting the capital gains tax a cut which 
would give 80 percent of the benefits to the richest 1 percent of 
americans instead we are fighting to restore iras so 
middleincome families can save as much as 2000 a year taxfree 
and then use the money for their own retirement or as a down 
payment on a first home 
we took on the struggle against the capital gains proposal when 
the odds were against us we won last year and this year we will 
do all we can to make sure that the greatest part of any tax cut 
of any kind goes to those of you who live on a paycheck not just 
the few who have the highest incomes the largest stock portfolios 
and by the way the potential for the biggest tax shelters 
this issue goes to the heart of the reason we are democrats 
above all else we stand with you the people who go to work and 
pay the taxes it is your cause to which we are committed and your 
side on which we fight

so we will also fight for the most effective clean air bill 
even though that may offend entrenched and powerful interests 
we will fight for child care so that working parents dont 
have to choose between their familys standard of living and their 
childrens standard of care 
we will fight for campaign finance reform we disagree with the 
administrations opposition to limits on campaign spending lets 
be blunt about it dont we all know there is simply too much money 
being raised and being spent in american politics 
and there is another issue on which we have only just begun to 
fight this administrations practice of misusing the social 
security trust fund to hide the size of the federal budget deficit 
social security involves more than a trust fund it involves the 
basic bond of trust between our people and our government from the 
beginning social security has been the democratic partys proudest 
achievement we reject the suggestion of some republicans to 
privatize the system they say thats a new idea we think its the 
same old bad idea another version of the repeated republican 
attempt to undermine social security 
finally as democrats we believe that there are areas where the 
government simply does not belong we will continue to defend a 
womans right to choose for we are convinced that politicians 
cannot and should not attempt to make the choice 
but we also believe government can have a positive role not to 
dominate but to help people improve their own lives 
the reason we have so many homeless in america today is not 
because government has cared too much but because government has 
cared too little we have to do better than that on a whole range 
of issues 
we will seek to secure the right of all our children to learn in 
better schools and to earn a better life 
we will seek to secure the civil rights of all our people we 
cant celebrate freedom abroad and then deny freedom at home 
we are also committed to the strongest possible attack on the 
drugs that are attacking our society and our families on this we 
are all united narcotics destroy the children of democrats and 
republicans alike 
one of my first jobs was as a deputy prosecutor in my hometown 
of spokane washington i believe then and i believe now in 
enforcing the law not in legalizing drugs we wont win this 
struggle overnight or in a few months or even over a year or two 
but together we can begin to reclaim our streets and our schools 
and our neighborhoods

let me say it again we will work with the president wherever 
and whenever we can on some issues we will have differences 
because we care deeply about certain principles and about the 
people who have been the abiding concern of the democratic party 
today we democrats stand as we have before for working families 
we stand for both economic justice and economic opportunity for 
protecting the environment for senior citizens and the soundness 
of social security 
and where we must we will disagree with the administration we 
will stand our ground when that is the only way to stand for you 
above all else we have high ambitions for america in the 1990s 
we cannot be content to be bystanders riders on the storm of 
history for we are living in one of those rare seasons of change 
that come to few generations we are being challenged by countries 
who say america is in decline that we can never again be the best 
in the world marketplace we do not accept that we reject those 
who assume that americans arent smart enough or disciplined 
enough or tough enough to rise to the moment 
we were in the 1940s and we saved the postwar world now we 
must strengthen our own country the time has come for america to 
help herself to rebuild to reenergize to reinvigorate our 
hopes to gather together our talents and to reclaim our place in 
the world 
in the short span of this decade we have a long way to move as 
a nation let us resolve that on that day when america enters the 
twentyfirst century we shall be first first economically first 
in education and science first in human decency and human rights 
thank you god bless you god bless our country

in the drug trade theyre known as swallowers 
or mules drug carriers who ingest condoms packed with cocaine or 
heroin federal authorities werent surprised that two turned up 
among the survivors of avianca flight 52 
i wouldnt be surprised if more turned up said tony 
contorno supervisory us customs inspector at john f kennedy 
international airport my first thought was how many internals 
would turn up on the flight 
authorities say the use of mules is on the increase mostly 
among colombians bringing in cocaine and west africans transporting 
heroin 
in the past four months 59 swallowers carrying 95 pounds of 
drugs have been arrested at kennedy contorno said during the 12 
months before that there were 110 arrests with 155 pounds seized 
most of them carry drugs more than 90 percent pure officials said 
wednesday 
weve seen a definite increase said drug enforcement 
administration spokeswoman mary cooper who estimated every 
colombian flight included three or four swallowers its a pretty 
common practice weve seen it for years 
some of the stories are mindboggling several years ago a man 
was found with 445 condoms in his system last year a man loaded 
with 46 pounds of cocaine was arrested customs agents spent 23 
days at the hospital with one suspect until he passed all the drugs 
he carried 
the carriers are likely able to swallow such large amounts by 
anesthetizing their throats and sliding the condoms down said dr 
faroque khan chairman of the department of medicine at the nassau 
county medical center 
this is the hardest method for us to detect and the people 
involved are becoming a little more sophisticated said contorno 
one of 60 customs agents checking out an average 100 international 
flights each day many of the mules make multiple trips carrying 
drugs officials said 
potential swallowers are identified by customs agents through 
questioning said contorno they are then taken to hospitals for 
xrays contorno said the agents success rate is 65 percent to 70 
percent 
the use of mules was splashed across newspapers and television 
after last weeks avianca crash on long island when two of the 
surviving passengers attracted police attention 
the two jose orlando figeroa 31 and antonio zaluaga 46 
remained under police guard wednesday at two hospitals both will 
be arrested on drug charges upon their release from the hospital 
said nassau county police spokesman officer james higgins 
zaluaga passed 19 condoms filled with white powder at the nassau 
county medical center said hospital spokesman ed smith figeroas 
case was more dramatic doctors at north shore university 
hospital trying to stop internal bleeding after the crash removed 
four allegedly drugfilled condoms from his bowel the man has 
since passed 10 more 
the mules who make about 3000 or receive a us visa for 
transporting up to 1 million in drugs dont run as much of a 
risk as they did in the early 1980s when the practice started said 
contorno better wrapping materials make it unlikely the condoms 
will give way 
but if they do burst the result is fast and final instant 
death said khan a doctor cant get in fast enough to get it 
out

a man arrested for deserting from the army 
nearly 30 years ago knew he might be picked up at the airport when 
he returned to the united states from east germany but 30 
relatives who came to greet him were stunned 
i think this must be what it was like in east germany before 
the wall came down said arnold kepharts sister alice smith 
we do live in a free country or so we thought 
kephart 53 was being held at the fort riley kan army base 
wednesday on a warrant charging him with desertion 
he was arrested tuesday night at eppley airfield by military and 
civilian police as relatives looked on kephart was allowed to talk 
to his 86yearold father and sister before being taken away 
some family members came from as far away as arkansas to greet 
kephart who was accompanied by his son frankie and who 
according to his attorney had tried to escape from east germany 
several times 
kephart believed he might be arrested at the airport said mrs 
smiths husband roy 
we thought it was a possibility but we didnt think it would 
be handled in this manner smith said they just took him 
off the plane 
kepharts attorney james martin davis said military police 
didnt show him an arrest warrant and wouldnt allow him to speak 
to his client until civilian police intervened 
it was an absolute worstcase scenario for the image of the 
united states military davis said kephart and his son thought 
theyd left a totalitarian country he said 
an army spokesman said he wasnt aware of all the circumstances 
surrounding the arrest but defended the armys action 
how many ways can you arrest somebody lt col dick bridges 
said in a telephone interview from washington 
kephart was scheduled to be transferred today to fort sill 
okla said capt ed garven a fort riley spokesman 
if convicted of desertion by a courtmartial kephart could 
receive up to three years in prison lt col john dobbs said from 
fort sill he also could receive a lessthanhonorable discharge 
without undergoing a courtmartial 
as of dec 31 1989 the army had 2595 names on its list of 
socalled active deserters according to lt col jack horn of 
army personnel command in washington 
kephart originally from langdon mo was declared absent 
without leave in november 1960 while a private stationed in 
heidelberg west germany army officials said there is no statute 
of limitations on the charge davis said 
he apparently deserted after an army truck he was driving 
crashed davis said 
a staff sergeant told kephart he would be prosecuted do time in 
the stockade and have to pay for the truck on his 69amonth 
salary the attorney said the sergeant lied but kephart believed 
him and fled with a girlfriend to east germany davis said 
kephart panicked because he was 24 in a strange country and 
away from home said smith 
after leaving the army kephart worked for 30 years as a truck 
driver in the small southern city of smalkalden he tried to escape 
three or four times but was caught at the border davis said 
his family thought he was dead because the army would not give 
details of his whereabouts or disappearance but learned he was 
alive about a year after he vanished when they received a letter 
only three or four censored letters reached his family over the 
years davis said 
while in east germany kephart was married and divorced twice 
his second wife gave birth to frankie on oct 27 1977 kephart 
received custody of frankie after the divorce 
kephart decided to return to the united states with his son 
after hearing about the opening of east germanys borders late last 
year davis said 
he arrived in hamburg west germany on dec 15 and worked in a 
hotel with frankie for a few weeks until he contacted his family 
kepharts son who doesnt speak a word of english is staying 
with relative in council bluffs iowa smith said 
hes taking it well to tell you the truth he said im 
surprised hes a very brave boy

a study has found a possible link between 
fluoride and cancer in rats but dental experts said previous 
research gives strong evidence that fluoridated water is safe 
you have to sort of consider that one study in relation to 
many others that have been carried out said colin dawes editor 
of the journal of dental research 
theres no material thats been added to the diet or water 
thats been more thoroughly tested than fluoride in terms of its 
potential toxicological effects he said 
the evidence against its causing cancer is overwhelming said 
dawes professor of oral biology at the university of manitoba his 
journal is an official publication of the international association 
for dental research 
dawes and other experts interviewed wednesday were reacting to 
news that federal researchers had found cases of osteosarcoma a 
form of bone cancer in some rats fed high doses of fluoridated 
water 
one rat in a group of 50 developed the cancer after drinking 
water with 45 parts per million of fluoride over two years while 
four rats in another group developed it after drinking 79 parts per 
million during the period 
those concentrations are much higher than the average 1 part per 
million many communities put in their water to protect against 
cavities high doses of potential cancercausing substances are 
routinely used in rodent experiments to expose any effects 
osteosarcoma is uncommon in humans with about 700 new cases a 
year 
an estimated 132 million americans about 53 percent of the 
population drink water with enough flouride to fight cavities 
according to the national institute of dental research 
dental experts interviewed by the associated press said they 
could not comment on the new study itself because they had not seen 
the work which is still preliminary and has not yet been released 
by the government 
but gary whitford of the medical college of georgia who studies 
side effects of fluoride said previous research gives no evidence 
of a link to cancer 
he participated in a study that found no harm when rats were fed 
high fluoride doses in the form of toothpaste daily for 18 months 
he said 
asked if the federal study made him worry about the possibility 
of the substance causing cancer he replied i have no reason to 
think that thats a realistic possibility 
he said he was concerned that the news might make some 
communities remove fluoride from their water supplies boosting 
risk of cavities 
benefits of fluoridated water have been questioned in recent 
years australian researcher mark diesendorf wrote in the science 
journal nature in 1986 that nonfluoridated communities in europe 
and elsewhere have shown reductions in cavities that are comparable 
to declines in fluoridated communities 
he suggested that fluoridation may have had only a minor effect 
at best in reducing cavities and that greater impact may have come 
from other factors such as changes in diet patterns and in some 
cases use of fluoridated toothpaste 
dawes said that at a recent international conference of fluoride 
experts the general feeling was that fluoride in water is still 
beneficial although not as beneficial as it used to be when 
there was no fluoridated toothpaste 
ken burrell secretary of the american dental associations 
council on dental therapeutics said fluoridated water especially 
helps young children whose teeth are forming they appear to get a 
longlasting benefit he said

president fw de klerk 
reversed himself wednesday and ordered a judicial inquiry into 
allegations that police carried out authorized killings of 
antiapartheid activists 
he called for a separate investigation of the death of a 
20yearold black man found hanged in his prison cell the man 
clayton sithole was closely associated with the family of 
imprisoned black leader nelson mandela 
newspapers said de klerk would meet with mandela on thursday 
the day before delivering a major address to parliament 
a luxury car was seen arriving at the victor verster prison farm 
where mandela lives at 430 am thursday 930 pm est 
wednesday then driving away at high speed across the countryside 
after meeting up with another car and minibus on the road outside 
the prison 
journalists following the cars were chased away by the 
authorities no other details were immediately available 
their meeting wouldnt be the first between the black leader and 
the south african president mandela and de klerk met last dec 13 
at the presidents office in cape town 
the cape times and business day citing government sources they 
did not identify said the meeting probably would influence de 
klerks speech which is expected to outline his plans for reform 
de klerk is expected to release mandela within weeks the 
nations bestknown black leader now 71 has spent more than 27 
years in prison for his role in planning the guerrilla campaign of 
the african national congress the main black group fighting white 
domination 
mandelas release is seen as necessary before black leaders will 
negotiate with the government there has been an increase in 
political unrest recently however and the government fears 
releasing him could lead to violence among the disenfranchised 
black majority 
de klerks decision to investigate the alleged police hit squads 
comes less than two months after he refused to appoint such a 
commission the controversy began late last year when three former 
policemen said they participated in killings of government 
opponents under authorization of their superiors 
police have denied the existence of any hit squads 
justice minister kobie coetsee said de klerk appointed supreme 
court judge ltc harms to investigate the alleged incidence of 
murders in order to achieve effect or promote constitutional 
or political aims 
in a number of cases attorneysgeneral are considering the 
reopening of inquests coetsees statement said 
he said details on how the inquiry is to be carried out would be 
published soon in the official government gazette 
an antiapartheid group that has demanded an inquiry into the 
alleged death squads welcomed the move and called off a thursday 
protest planned for cape town 
the ministers announcement shows that ordinary concerned 
south africans can have influence on government decisions if they 
display the courage of their convictions said the campaign for a 
judicial inquiry into hit squads 
activists have alleged for years that government security forces 
were involved in the unsolved killings of more than 60 
antiapartheid figures 
on oct 19 the night before he was scheduled to be hanged 
former policeman butana almond nofomela gave an affidavit saying he 
was part of a police death squad 
nofomela a black who was on death row for a killing with no 
apparent political overtones identified two former policemen he 
said also participated in the killings 
the men dirk coetzee a white former captain and david 
tshikalanga who is black have fled south africa and confessed to 
participation in at least 10 killings 
coetzee was scheduled to give a press conference thursday in 
harare zimbabwe and was expected to make additional allegations 
about police involvement in the deaths of activists 
nofomela has pleaded guilty to the 1981 stabbing death of an 
black antiapartheid attorney and arrest warrants have been issued 
for coetzee and tshikalanga in the same case 
police said sithole was found hanging from a shower pipe tuesday 
at john vorster square johannesburgs central police station 
sithole was arrested friday along with four others accused in 
the slayings of 10 people in guerrilla attacks over the past two 
years 
shortly after his death was announced de klerk ordered a 
judicial inquiry a step not taken after scores of previous 
incidents in which black activists died while in police custody 
law and order minister adriaan vlok expressed condolences to 
sitholes family 
according to local newspapers sithole was a former lover of 
zindzi mandela and fathered one of her three children there was no 
immediate comment from the mandelas but associates of the family 
said they believed the report was accurate 
a family friend of the mandelas who requested anonymity said 
sithole belonged to a controversial group of young men who served 
as winnie mandelas bodyguards nine people associated with the 
group have been in custody for months awaiting trial for the death 
of a young black activist 
neither vlok nor de klerk indicated whether the decision to 
launch an investigation was related to sitholes reported 
connection to the mandela family 
denis worrall coleader of the antiapartheid democratic party 
welcomed de klerks swift response 
it is surprising that president de klerk would do this 
worrall said im quite sure that a judicial commission of 
inquiry would be justified 
audrey coleman a prominent human rights activist said 
sitholes family suspected the young man had been mistreated and 
would obtain its own pathologist to conduct an independent post 
mortem 
police said sithole confessed to a magistrate before his death 
implicating himself in several killings police reportedly were 
investigating whether sithole and the other suspects were anc 
guerrillas 
about 100 anc guerrillas and antiapartheid activists have died 
in police custody the past 25 years 
according to police suicide by hanging has been the most common 
cause of these deaths but human rights groups have insisted 
interrogators mistreated many of these prisoners

president bushs nominee to head the nations 
troubled atomic weapons complex is faltering amid a newly disclosed 
investigation of an allegation that he lied to congress 
the senate armed services committee delayed indefinitely 
wednesdays scheduled vote on the nomination of victor stello jr 
a former top nuclear power regulator to become assistant secretary 
of energy for defense programs 
committee chairman sam nunn dga and ranking republican john 
warner of virginia recommended the delay after the nuclear 
regulatory commissions inspector general told them his office is 
investigating stello 
we did not know how serious the allegations were regarding mr 
stello nunn told reporters after a closed committee meeting 
wednesday the committee voted not to come to a conclusion or 
vote until such time that we have at least an oral report from 
the ig inspector general 
rep peter kostmayer dpa has accused stello the nrcs 
former executive director of making willful misstatements last 
fall to the house interior committees investigations subcommittee 
that kostmayer chairs 
nunn said nrc inspector general david c williams has said the 
investigation should be completed by april stello the nrcs 
former executive staff director is now hospitalized as the result 
of a skiing accident jan 10 
in the meantime nunn said he is not leaning for or against the 
nomination im going to wait until all the information is in 
he said 
not since bushs illfated choice a year ago of former sen john 
tower rtexas to become secretary of defense has the armed 
services panel been so divided on a presidential nomination 
environmentalists and antinuclear activists and their allies on 
the committee led by sen timothy wirth dcolo accuse stello of 
being too close to the nuclear industry to effectively supervise 
operation of the weapons complex 
the administration is showing no inclination to withdraw the 
nomination of stello who was picked for the job by white house 
chief of staff john sununu a vehement supporter of nuclear power 
in a letter to the committee tuesday energy secretary james d 
watkins said he continues to have full confidence in stello 
who in the absence of confirmation is acting as watkins 
principal deputy in charge of the weapons program 
no facts have been brought to my attention at this time which 
are not already part of the record before your committee watkins 
said 
kostmayers allegation centers on stellos approval in 1988 of 
6000 to a technician at the nine mile point nuclear power plant 
in new york state the technician had alleged that nrc investigator

the head of a house investigations 
subcommittee wants the government to ensure that a lowerpriced 
medicine for high blood pressure is available now that both 
generic versions are off the market 
the second of two generic versions of smithkline beechams 
dyazide was recalled wednesday by its maker bolar pharmaceutical 
co inc which is under fire for allegedly giving false test data 
to the food and drug administration 
bolar also said it was recalling its 100 milligram 
extendedrelease phenytoin sodium capsules a generic version of 
the epilepsy drug dilantin made by parkedavis 
the company said the products bioequivalence to the 
brandname drugs cannot be assured in light of serious questions 
concerning the accuracy and reliability of the documentation 
supporting fda approval of bolars drugs 
the fda said patients taking the two generic drugs being 
recalled should consult with their physicians and are urged not 
to stop taking either medication abruptly 
the agency advised patients taking bolars generic dyazide to 
continue taking the drug until their prescription runs out and to 
arrange with their physicians to take another medication patients 
on bolars phenytoin should consult with their physician in the 
next few days about changing drugs it said 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce investigations subcommittee said in a letter to fda 
acting commissioner james benson unfortunately the consumer 
stands to be the principal victim 
dingell said he asked smithkline beecham maker of dyazide to 
cut the price of its product when allegations against the makers of 
its generic competitors surfaced the company raised the price of 
dyazide after bolars generic version came on the market in 1987 
in the absence of a price cut dingell said the fda should 
consider several options including requiring smithkline to 
reformulate the drug so that it is easier to copy in a generic form 
jeremy heymsfeld a spokesman for smithkline beecham said 
bolars recall represents a significant change in the 
marketplace we have not seen congressman dingells statement we 
take seriously our responsibilities to all our publics our 
shareholders our customers and the patients who use our products 
we plan to respond accordingly 
dingell said for the millions of americans without health 
insurance or those with minimal prescription drug reimbursement 
plans the cost of a drug which is the most common treatment for 
high blood pressure is critical 
dingell worried that price considerations may cause many to 
discontinue the treatment without consulting their physician 
last spring vitarine pharmaceuticals of springfield gardens 
ny took its version of dyazide off the market after it admitted 
cheating on fda tests 
the fda had been trying to remove bolars generic dyazide a 
combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide from the market 
because of questions about its therapeutic equivalence to the 
brandname drug 
last week lawyers representing bolar told the fda the company 
appeared to have used false documents to challenge fda action 
against the companys generic dyazide 
two days after the lawyers concerns were made public the 
securities and exchange commission temporarily suspended trading of 
bolar securities citing a lack of adequate current 
information the suspension in trading began last thursday and 
was to continue through this week through saturday 
bolars version of dyazide was the companys largest selling 
product and accounted for about half of its pretax income the 
absence of sales of this product will have a material adverse 
effect on earnings bolar said

the christmas freeze that hit major vegetable 
areas of the south is responsible for a sharp increase in the 
agriculture departments price index for raw farm products 
according to preliminary figures 
department officials said wednesday the overall index received 
by farmers rose 27 percent from december to january leaving the 
monthly average also 27 percent above the yearago level 
higher prices for tomatoes lettuce and broilers mostly were 
responsible for the increase from december the departments 
agricultural statistics board said in its preliminary report 
tomato prices more than doubled due to short supplies brought 
on by the freeze in florida in december the report said 
lettuce prices were nearly double for the same reason 
commercial vegetables as a group were up 68 percent from 
december and 32 percent from a year ago 
lower prices were reported for soybeans strawberries and 
oranges 
milk prices at the farm which had risen to record levels late 
last year were unchanged in january department dairy economists 
have forecast milk prices would level off this year 
prices paid by farmers to meet expenses meanwhile were up 11 
percent from october the previous reading and averaged 29 
percent above a year ago the report said the prices paid 
index is revised every three months 
the report said prices for feeder cattle and calves feeder 
pigs diesel fuel and lp gas were up from october 
department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990 
may be in the range of 52 billion to 57 billion compared with 
about 53 billion in 1989 
net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left 
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash 
expenses it includes government payments and proceeds from crops 
grown previously but sold during the year 
in another method taking into account changes in inventories 
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that 
1990 net farm income may be in the range of 44 billion to 49 
billion compared with 48 billion last year 
consumer food prices are estimated by department economists to 
have risen about 57 percent this year the sharpest rise since 
1981 they project food prices may rise 3 percent to 5 percent in 
1990 
based on the preliminary figures the january price index for 
livestock and poultry was unchanged from december but averaged 76 
percent more than a year ago 
crop prices overall rose 63 percent from december but 
averaged 43 percent below a year ago the sharp rise in the price 
of commercial vegetables caused most of the increase from december 
the report said 
the fruit index dropped 93 percent from december and was 98 
percent below a year earlier 
all fruit prices used in the index were down from last month 
except for apples and lemons which were up slightly the report 
said oranges and strawberries had the largest downward influence 
on the index

a new oilseed lobbying group has urged 
legislation to guarantee farmers a larger choice in what they 
produce under federal crop programs 
the oilseed council of america said wednesday that genuine 
planting flexibility would help solve a decline in the 
competitiveness of the us oilseed industry oilseeds are led by 
soybeans but also include cottonseed sunflowers and canola 
lowell wilson of primghar iowa cochairman of the council 
said current commodity programs have dramatically reduced acreage 
planted to oilseeds by requiring producers to plant commodities 
supported by target prices to protect crop program base acreages 
used to compute benefits 
wilson said there is genuine planting flexibility when federal 
programs are neutral in their effect on farmers planting decisions 
according to a study released in washington by the council 
demand for protein meal and oil produced when oilseeds are crushed 
is growing at the rate of 4 percent a year world trade in oilseeds 
and their products the report said has increased twice as fast as 
trade in wheat and feed grains 
despite the growth the study reported the us share of global 
oilseed production has dropped to 24 percent from 39 percent six 
years ago and that the us share of oilseed trade has declined to 
45 percent from 75 percent 
floyd anderson of bismarck nd president of the national 
sunflowerseed association and cochairman of the council said 
planting flexibility would let farmers take advantage of the world 
demand for oilseeds by basing planting decisions on market 
situations as well as natural factors 
the formation of the group coincides with moves in congress to 
write new farm legislation to replace the 1985 law which expires 
at the end of the 1990 crop season 
but anderson said in a statement the council does not advocate 
any specific programs and that there are a number of policy 
approaches that will give producers genuine planting 
flexibility and continue farm income protection

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says 
rice farmers will have to idle only 20 percent of their acreage 
base to qualify for this years price support program instead of 
the 225 percent announced on jan 3 
yeutter said wednesday the lower setaside which means farmers 
can plant more for the 1990 harvest was decided after reviewing 
recent projected rice supply and demand figures 
the figures showed the us rice inventory will be drawn down to 
19 million hundredweight by aug 1 the lowest reserve at the start 
of a new rice marketing year since the 1980 crop the inventory 
last aug 1 was 267 million

a coalition of labor and social organizations 
called on taxpayers today to stage their own boston tea party and 
mail congress envelopes of crumbs to protest president bushs 
proposed capital gains tax cut 
the theme of the campaign would be a capital gains tax cut is 
a crummy idea according to citizens for tax justice 
the nonprofit coalition of labor citizen and social groups 
played a major role in passage of the 1986 tax overhaul and 
includes organizations claiming 20 million members 
restoring the capital gains loophole would be cake for the 
rich but crumbs for the rest of us robert s mcintyre director 
of citizens for tax justice said in launching the campaign 
if the campaign catches on members of congress could expect to 
be swamped with cookie remnants and letters declaring while 
youre giving the wealthy the whole pie youre leaving most 
americans with nothing but crumbs so you can have my crumbs back 
because im tired of paying higher taxes to give tax cuts to the 
rich 
bush has proposed that capital gains profits from the sale of 
real estate stock and other investments be given preferential 
tax treatment compared with wages and other incomes 
the plan the president outlined monday would when fully 
effective in 1993 tax only 70 percent of the profits from the sale 
of assets owned three years or more 80 percent of assets owned 
more than two years and 90 percent of profits from the sale of 
property held at least one year present law taxes 100 percent of 
gains 
bush said a tax break for capital gains would encourage 
investment that would create jobs and make us businesses more 
competitive abroad 
the house passed a capital gains tax cut last year but 
democratic leaders were able to kill it in the senate even though 
most senators favored it 
opponents say 80 percent of the benefits from a capital gains 
cut would go to people with incomes over 100000 a year they 
contend it would worsen the budget deficit and lead to the undoing 
of the 1986 tax overhaul 
the coalition expects to distribute more than 10 million 
brochures and addressed envelopes in february and march in an 
attempt to defeat the capital gains reduction 
in contending that only the truly rich would profit from a 
capital gains cut the campaign letter cites bush and hotel owner 
leona helmsley who was convicted of tax evasion as examples 
mrs helmsley and her husband harry saved 38 million in taxes 
in 1983 through 1985 because of an earlier capital gains break the 
letter says in 1986 bush saved 129000 in taxes because of his 
capital gains 
the 58 organizations sponsoring the protest include the aflcio 
childrens defense fund consumer federation of america and an arm 
of the united church of christ

labor department officers who police the 
nations pension system are poorly equipped for their job says 
the departments inspector general in questioning plans to add 100 
agents to the unit 
the officers dont have the mentality and the learning curve 
to know how to look and where to look for racketeers acting 
inspector general raymond maria said wednesday before a house panel 
studying the nations 17 trillion private pension system 
these types of complex cases generally require tips 
informants and the execution of search warrants maria said 
adding the departments officers are poorly equipped for these 
tasks 
but david ball who heads the departments pension benefits and 
welfare administration said those agents have closed 8268 pension 
investigations in the past five years and recovered 480 million 
the house education and labor subcommittee on labormanagement 
relations is studying enforcement of the employee retirement income 
security act passed in 1974 to protect retirees from abuses in 
their pensions plans 
maria and the labor department have been feuding over the 
departments handling of pension investigations 
maria who will not be permanently named to the inspector 
generals post has insisted the department improperly relies on 
civil instead of criminal remedies and that problems with the 
pension system rival those blamed for the savings and loan crisis 
ball called the comparison to the sampl crisis inflammatory 
rhetoric its like shouting fire in a crowded theater 
ball said the pension system with assets that have grown from 
290 billion to 17 trillion over the past 15 years has never 
been healthier he said there has been no evidence of widespread 
fraud in benefit plans 
after the hearing maria said he was skeptical of department 
plans to add 100 enforcement officers without a change in the way 
investigations are pursued 
if you dont have a sound game plan why add more players 
maria said 
the labor departments budget request for fiscal 1991 calls for 
increasing from 200 to 300 the number of pension enforcement 
ball said the addition of 100 enforcement officers would let the 
agency conduct an additional 1000 investigations he defended the 
departments pursuit of civil remedies and said criminal 
investigations are turned over to the justice department where he 
said they belong 
using what will be one of his last appearances before congress 
as acting inspector general president bush is expected to 
nominate a replacement within a week or so maria said department 
enforcement officers have not been trained to investigate 
professional racketeers 
maria also renewed his criticism of a justice department ruling 
that curtailed the investigative powers of inspectors general 
the ruling prohibited the inspectors general from launching 
their own investigations of alleged violations of agency 
regulations in essence the ruling said the departments themselves 
were responsible for such enforcement and that the role of 
inspectors general was to investigate and analyze the departments 
efforts 
maria wants congress to pass legislation giving inspectors 
general broader powers and jurisdictions

a bill to ease voter registration procedures 
across the country is moving forward in the house despite 
republican warnings that it could generate fraud and complaints 
about the price tag 
lets look before we leap and were leaping here today rep 
gerald bh solomon rny said wednesday as the house moved a 
step closer to floor action on the socalled motorvoter 
legislation 
the bill calls for automatic registration of all eligible 
americans applying for drivers licenses it also would mean 
registration by post card and at various government offices 
the house in a key procedural vote on wednesday upheld by 
254166 a rule requiring critics led by gop leader bob michel of 
illinois to tie together all of their proposed amendments to the 
measure in one batch 
the rule then provides for a single vote on the entire bundle of 
proposed amendments on tuesday when the house is scheduled to take 
up the bill 
mainly republican critics chafed at the rule urging the house 
instead to junk all restrictions on how amendments may be offered 
their way would give individual amendments a better chance of 
acceptance by the house and also slow action on the bill 
the bill emerged from the house government operations committee 
last year with support from a number of republicans including whip 
newt gingrich rga and rep bill thomas rcalif sponsors 
hailed a new era of harmony on an issue that once spawned feuding 
between the parties 
but feuding was in full swing on the house floor wednesday with 
rep al swift dwash a chief sponsor accusing michel of 
violating bipartisan harmony 
on monday the minority leader swooped into town and trashed 
the entire agreement swift said 
swift blamed michel for the collapse of what he called a 
bipartisan agreement fashioned in the government operations 
committee a number of republicans had backed the measure 
michel replied that he may have to share some of the blame for 
missed communication on my side im sorry the gentleman should 
have this feeling because boy there was nothing intended on my 
part to gut the gentleman and turn things on their head here 
rep james quillen rtenn publicly read a letter from the 
bush administration on tuesday saying it shares the goal of eased 
voter registration but has qualms about the bills specifics 
including whether it could cause fraud 
proponents say voter registration remains an obstacle course in 
some states and thus dampens turnout 
republicans trooped to the microphones to complain about the 
rule regarding amendments saying they needed more maneuvering room 
to combat burdensome procedures and high costs and rep lynn 
martin rill made clear she had no quarrel with the bush 
administrations warning against a potential surge in fraud 
im sure there are people in the united states where if you 
tell them they can have motor voter registration theyll be 
registering people in hearses before they get to the cemetery 
even she said

the prosecutor in the nations longest 
criminal trial says it will be an uphill fight to convict mcmartin 
preschool molestation defendant raymond buckey at a new trial but 
the case must be resolved 
district attorney ira reiner insisted that neither politics nor 
public pressure influenced his decision wednesday to pursue charges 
in the 6yearold case 
this is not a political matter and it is not going to be 
treated as such said reiner a candidate for california attorney 
general in junes election 
buckey and his mother were acquitted jan 18 of 52 molestation 
counts after a 33month trial the jury deadlocked on 12 
molestation charges and one conspiracy count against buckey 
buckey 31 will be retried on those charges 
this case has gone on for many years reiner said it must 
be resolved 
prosecutors said at least one child who did not testify at the 
first trial might testify at the second but conceded they might 
lose as witnesses one or two of the five children named in the 13 
counts the judge has suggested dropping some of the counts to 
speed the march 9 retrial 
if convicted on all 13 charges buckey could draw no more than 
36 years in prison reiner said but most defendants serve about 
half of their sentences and buckey already has been jailed with 
bail for five years the equivalent of a 10year sentence 
buckey said he was surprised by reiners decision but expected 
acquittal 
i believe the das decision was based on political pressure 
from a few vocal parents of children not involved in this trial 
rather than jurors leaning toward acquittal he said 
in the two weeks since the acquittals parents whose children 
attended the nowdefunct mcmartin nursery school mounted a strident 
campaign for a new trial they appeared on tv talk shows called 
news conferences and recruited politicians who vowed to take the 
case out of reiners hands if he failed to follow through 
reiner said his prime consideration was the feelings of parents 
and alleged victims who now range from age 11 to 14 
this is a positive step for us said marymae cioffi a 
mcmartin parent who led the campaign to retry buckey im going 
to run home and tell my kids we get another chance 
reiner said there remain serious evidentiary problems which 
he blamed on his predecessor robert philibosian 
this is an uphill battle theres no question about that 
reiner said 
the former district attorney has said he takes no responsibility 
for the case which he initially filed in 1984 with seven 
defendants under investigation 
five had charges dismissed after an 18month preliminary 
hearing only buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 63 
stood trial 
the trial was the longest and costliest in us history 
taxpayers have spent over 13 million on the case so far 
superior court judge william pounders said the facts in the 
remaining 13 counts mitigate in favor of a long second trial 
he said he hoped the charges could be scoped down to shorten 
the proceedings 
pounder urged a swift start because the range of emotions is 
very high there are a lot of people still sitting in agony we 
should seek an end to this as soon as possible 
buckeys attorney danny davis filed a motion denouncing the 
judge and seeking his removal for bias against him and buckey 
another judge will have to rule on that motion which could cause 
delays

there are still 15 republics and they are still part of the 
ussr said john b garver jr chief cartographer of the 
national geographic society 
but we are very excited at being able to put out a map when 
there is a possibility of change he said referring to unrest 
and secessionist movements in several soviet republics 
the new map doesnt show the latest protests and battles 
involving soviet nationalities but its charts graphs text and 
historical inserts can help readers follow and even predict trouble 
for the kremlin 
next to the soviet baltic republics mapmakers added a note in 
red ink the united states does not recognize the 1940 
incorporation of estonia latvia and lithuania 
popular fronts in those republics are agitating to leave the 
soviet union against the wishes of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
adjacent to the kuril islands in the pacific the map says 
formerly part of and still claimed by japan the disputed islands 
kunashir iturup shikotan and the habomais have been held by the 
soviet union since 1945 
tokyo has balked at improving relations with moscow until the 
two settle the issue of the islands which are occupied by soviet 
troops 
such disputes are grist in the mill of garver a former army 
colonel and west point professor who is helping shift the focus of 
national geographic magazine to current events 
the flip side of the new map tells an even more graphic 
political tale 
we did away with the pictures and replaced them with a map of 
russian historical annexation over the centuries its sort of a 
primer said garver if you read the text and examine the map 
you see that the soviet union has expanded mostly by conquest 
since the 14th century 
the map shows that over the centuries the princes and czars of 
ancient moscow gobbled up adjoining territories in europe siberia 
and central asia and that at the close of world war ii the 
soviets occupied eastern europe and annexed parts of poland 
czechoslovakia and romania 
a demographic map shows that ethnic russian colonists spread 
east from moscow and bar graphs depict some trends from the 1989 
soviet census that are unsettling for the kremlin 
the entry under soviet tadzhikistan says that if current 
trends continue the ussr could be a predominantly muslim 
country within a century trouble for a government that is 
officially atheist 
the bar graphs garver said show that the turkish central 
asian and islamic populations are increasing the russian and other 
european populations are increasing at a much slower pace 
the map took a year to complete in part because of the need to 
reconfirm the location of the 5000 cities lakes rivers and 
mountains that dot the 86 million square miles of the soviet 
union thats more than twice the area of the united states with 
36 million square miles 
among the most striking changes in the new map is the shrinking 
of the aral sea down 40 percent since the last national geographic 
map of the soviet union was produced in 1977 
the amu darya and syr darya rivers that once fed the aral no 
longer flow into it because their waters have been diverted to 
irrigate cotton fields 
the falling water level of the aral moved it from fourth to 
sixth place among the largest lakes of the world according to the 
february edition of national geographic magazine which described 
it as one of the globes worst ecological disasters

the supreme court turns 200 today marking the 
bicentennial of what by all accounts was indeed a slow start 
it took the justices two years to announce their first decision 
and by that time chief justice john jay was moved to call life in 
the backwater of washington intolerable 
indeed the high court couldnt even get a quorum on feb 1 
1790 jay had to put off the courts first meeting until the next 
day 
but it didnt really matter no case had arrived 
the 15th man to succeed jay chief justice william h rehnquist 
recently acknowledged the court had gotten off to what was indeed 
a slow start but he said the court eventually picked up the 
necessary speed to evolve into a truly coequal branch of the 
federal government 
the constitution written in 1787 and ratified by the requisite 
number of states the next year called for one supreme court 
but president washington did not nominate justices to the bench 
until late 1789 
the next february only three of the six showed up at the royal 
exchange building in new york then the nations capital 
one justice william cushing of massachusetts appeared in a 
powdered wig a british judicial custom that failed to catch on in 
the new nation 
the next day justice john blair of virginia arrived and they 
had a quorum the court appointed a clerk admitted some lawyers to 
practice before it and after some other administrative chores 
adjourned its first term feb 10 
the second term lasted two days later that year they were still 
waiting for a case 
these days a court term lasts nine months or so and presents 
some 5000 new cases 
the court now announces about 150 decisions each term noting 
fewer than 70 decisions were issued in the courts first decade 
retired chief justice warren e burger said recently i suspect 
that members of the court would like the docket to move in that 
direction 
by the time the court announced its first decision in 1792 
chief justice jay found life in the capital intolerable two 
years later he took a leave of absence from the court to become a 
special ambassador to england in 1795 he quit the court to take 
what he considered a more prestigious job to which he had been 
elected during his absence governor of new york 
much has changed besides the courts caseload in the last two 
centuries 
since 1869 there have been nine justices since 1935 the court 
has had its own building since 1981 members of the court have not 
addressed each other as mr justice that ended shortly before 
sandra day oconnor joined the bench 
other things are as they were when the nation was young 
the chant that ends with god save the united states and this 
honorable court still opens each session the brass spittoons are 
still hidden behind the bench quill pens are still given to each 
lawyer appearing before the justices 
and absent justices can still be a problem the supreme court 
held its 200th birthday celebration jan 16 because eral members 
said theyd be out of town thursday

most grandfathers are content with describing 
the new baby showing a few pictures bragging a little not george 
bush he worked little charles walker bush into the script 
when i held the little guy for the first time the troubles at 
home and abroad seemed manageable in perspective said the 
president giving a personal touch to his state of the union speech 
wednesday night 
in the gallery proud parents margaret and marvin bush beamed 
and so did barbara bush who became a grandmother for the 12th time 
when that son and daughterinlaw adopted the boy late last year 
now i know youre thinking thats a grandfather talking 
said bush well maybe youre right that may have sounded 
spontaneous but it too was in the script 
in his first state of the union speech bush appeared a little 
nervous and hurried he raced past some of the best lines in the 
speech depriving his republican supporters of rising in noisy 
approval not until he was halfway through did that opportunity 
come 
it happened when bush declared that his budget proposal sent to 
capitol hill on monday will bring the deficit down and balance the 
budget by 1993 with no new taxes 
the republicans rose as one and when there was no response from 
the democrats on the other side of the aisle they motioned get 
up get up a few did but most stayed put 
a few minutes later bush touched on a sensitive issue the 
attempt by sen daniel moynihan a new york democrat to cut social 
security taxes 
the last thing we need to do is mess around with social 
security said bush republicans shouted hear hear and 
stood 
there was a confused silence among the democrats until some 
realized how bad their restraint might look on national television 
finally they joined their republican colleagues in the standing 
ovation even moynihan applauded 
all the senators and congressmen it seemed had the speech text 
in hand and pages turned in unison there were no texts for the 
hundred members of the diplomatic corps who left their cars at the 
white house and were bused to the capitol 
but soviet ambassador yuriy v dubinin got a copy from a 
reporter he recognized in the white house press pool 
its much more important to have 100 friends than 100 
rubles said the delighted ambassador now i have the text 
like nearly every lawmaker

portauprince haiti ap lt gen prosper avril says the 
political leaders he exiled last month in a crackdown on the 
democratic opposition are now free to return and take part in free 
elections hes promised for october 
i hope they have learned their lesson haitis military 
ruler told a news conference wednesday at the national palace two 
days earlier he had lifted a 10day state of siege 
when the emergency was declared on jan 20 police rounded up 50 
opposition activists seven leading government critics were exiled 
most of the others later were released but said they were beaten 
as did the exiles 
france the united states canada and the european community 
condemned the crackdown france a former colonial ruler and 
haitis major donor suspended foreign aid and negotiations for 
500 million more in assistance over the next two years 
avril said wednesday that the crackdown was necessary to work 
rapidly to disarm subversive elements and block the escalation 
of murder 
we recognize that things got out of hand and police 
committed some abuses avril said but it is not only in haiti 
that such things occur 
the state of siege was declared a day after gunmen killed army 
col andre neptune critics accused avril of orchestrating the 
killing to blame it on the opposition and renege on his promises to 
hold the fall presidential vote 
avril said the exiled opposition leaders can return and will 
have all necessary guarantees to participate in elections 
they include louis roy the principle author of haitis 
constitution conservative politician hubert de ronceray prominent 
businessman antoine izmery communist party deputy leader max 
bourjolly and three leftist militants 
roy 74 said in a telephone interview from washington that he 
preferred to die in exile if necessary i will never return to 
compromise with those whose law is the violation of the 
constitution and whose morality is contempt for human dignity 
roy de ronceray and izmery issued a statement in washington 
tuesday that denounced avrils regime of terror and said free 
elections were not possible as long as he remained in power in this 
impoverished caribbean nation 
in an interview with radio france internationale monitored in 
puerto rico bourjolly said from paris earlier this week that he 
would return if allowed but would not take part in elections 
louis dejoie a prominent centrist who traveled to puerto rico 
the day before the crackdown said he would not take part in 
elections or return to haiti until avril steps down 
a singed cat fears the fire we dont trust avril or the army 
high command avril has zero credibility he said 
avril said he would not oppose international supervision of 
elections we are not hanging on to power he said 
several opposition leaders have charged that avril will rig the 
elections 
the crackdown included a weeklong censorship of radio news the 
censorship was lifted monday but by wednesday only two of eight 
private stations in the capital were broadcasting news 
avril rose to power in a september 1988 coup led by 
noncommissioned officers who professed disgust with the state 
terrorism under the military man they ousted lt gen henri namphy 
he had led the military junta that assumed power when

february 1986 during a popular uprising ending the harsh 27year

president bush is promising to reduce the us 
military presence in panama to its preinvasion level of about 
13000 troops well before the end of february but without 
giving an exact timetable 
bush won a standing ovation from a combined house and senate 
audience when he declared in his state of the union address one 
year ago the people of panama lived in fear under the thumb of a 
dictator today democracy is restored panama is free 
in the nationally televised address wednesday night bush 
declared that operation just cause the code name for the dec 
20 invasion that toppled the government of manuel antonio noriega 
has achieved its objective 
noriega whom bush did not mention by name is in a florida jail 
awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges 
bushs comments suggested that about 3000 additional troops 
would soon be brought home 
at the peak of the us intervention last month 27000 us 
troops were there the united states already has brought 11000 
home twentythree american servicemen were killed in panama and 
more than 300 were wounded 
before the dec 20 invasion about 13000 us troops were 
stationed in panama the number that will remain after the 
withdrawal is completed 
with noriegas surrender the military operation achieved all 
its objectives bush said 
the number of military personnel is now close to what it was 
before the operation began bush said and tonight i am 
announcing that well before the end of february the additional 
numbers of american troops the brave men and women of our armed 
forces who made this mission a success will be back home 
bushs remarks underscored comments in panama over the weekend 
by vice president dan quayle that the remaining us troops would 
be brought home in weeks rather than months 
however it still was not clear whether the additional us 
troops would be out of panama by feb 15 the date of the drug 
summit in colombia 
the president of peru alan garcia and other latin american 
leaders have protested the us invasion garcia called on bush to 
remove the forces before the drug summit and at one point suggested 
boycotting the colombia meeting in pst 
bush also read a touching letter written by pfc james markwell 
a 20yearold army ranger medic who died during the first hours of 
the invasion 
markwell and others in his company all had wrsuch letters a 
few days before they were sent into action letters only to beiled 
if they were killed in acti 
sadly private markwells mother did receive this letter and 
she passed it on to me said 
bush met with markwells family during a jan 12 tripetown of 
cincinnati 
here is some of what he wrote bush said and quoted from the 
letter 
i have never been afraid of death but now he is waiting at 
the corneen trained to kill and to save so has everyone else 
i am frightened of what lays beyond the fog yet do not 
mourn for me revel in the life that i have died to give you 
but most of all dont forget the army was my choice something 
that i wanted to do 
remember i joined the army to serve my country and ensure that 
you are free to do what you want and live your lives freely 
bush then added he knew what he believed in he carried the 
idea we call america in his heart

president bushs showstealing proposal for 
deeper troop reductions in europe disarms democratic critics at 
home and may help ease pressures in moscow on mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachev has been hit with blow after blow from the demise of 
the soviet empire in eastern europe to the bloody uprising in 
azerbaijan 
his economy is sick and his reform program of perestroika has 
not eased consumer shortages or improved standards of living 
next week gorbachevs authority is expected to be challenged at 
what promises to be a fiery meeting of the communist partys 
central committee the one body with the official power to remove 
him as party leader 
against that landscape bush made a point in wednesday nights 
state of the union address to say its time to build on our new 
relationship with the soviet union to endorse and encourage a 
peaceful process of internal change toward democracy and economic 
opportunity 
bush responding to the political upheaval in the oncesolid 
soviet empire announced a proposal to cut us and soviet combat 
forces in central europe to 195000 on each side 
it was a followup to a us offer last year to reduce troops 
throughout europe to 275000 for each superpower 
we are in a period of great transition great hope yet great 
uncertainty bush said adding that the soviet military threat in 
europe was diminishing 
the troopcutting proposal is likely to win favor from 
gorbachev eager to save money from military spending 
after all it was gorbachev who spurred conventional arms cuts 
beginning with his surprise announcement in 1988 that he was 
reducing global soviet troop strength by 10 percent and withdrawing 
six tank divisions from europe 
when bush proosed the cutback last year to 275000 gorbachev 
said fine and readily agreed to cut back the number of soviet 
tanks that could be used for a surprise attack 
pressures continue to build for gorbachev to do more 
poland hungary and czechoslovakia have announced troop cuts of 
their own and asked the kremlin to withdraw all its forces from 
their territory and the leader of east germany has said that all 
superpower troops could be out of europe by the year 2000 
a senior administration official explaining bushs new offer 
said it was a response to this sort of rapidly falling deck of 
cards of hardline communist regimes 
it appeared that in the area of arms control specifically 
conventional arms control in europe that events were running ahead 
of the negotiations said the official who commented only on 
condition of not being identified by name 
in recent days bush has offered a number of extraordinary 
political endorsements of gorbachev and has refused to criticize 
his military crackdown in azerbaijan 
at one point bush said of gorbachev i hope that he not only 
survives but stays strong a day later he said gorbachev was 
really the best hope for what our interests are 
bush is counting on gorbachev to help him seal a treaty to slash 
conventional forces in europe and to cut strategic weapons and 
chemical weapons before he announced his plan to the nation bush 
called gorbachev in moscow with a preview of the proposal 
asked how gorbachev responded bush said i cant characterize 
it but i can just simply say that he was receptive but i dont 
know whether hes supportive or not 
it was clear however how congress felt 
it was all cheers and standing ovations from republicans and 
democrats alike when bush announced his plan in a packed house 
chamber 
a good idea said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the 
house armed services committee very positive said sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services committee 
just when you thought you had a cold war budget boom 
exclaimed rep patricia schroeder dcolo a frequent pentagon 
critic and advocate of reduced us forces in europe im really 
delighted theres hope 
however the cheery reaction surely will fade if the 
administration tells congress that a yettobenegotiated proposal 
to scale down troops will not provide a desired peace dividend 
of reduced defense spending 
moreover from tax cuts on capital gains to bills dealing with 
crime child care and clean air there are plenty of areas of 
disagreement to ensure an abundance of electionyear battles 
between the white house and the democrats who control capitol hill

the mexican government promised an 
exhaustive inspection of a cubanowned freighter that drew 
machinegun and cannon fire from a coast guard cutter after 
refusing to stop for a drug inspection 
the 250foot panamaregistered freighter the hermann took 
several hits from the cutter chincoteague as the vessels steamed 
across the open gulf of mexico coast guard spokesman joe gibson 
said the ship was hit 50 times by coast guard fire but there were 
no injuries a mexican official said 
the vessel escaped into mexican waters but two mexican navy 
ships seized the hermann and escorted it to tampico about 300 
miles south of the us border 
the situation is not over theres action still being taken 
coast guard lt steve koska said late wednesday i cant go into 
it but there are things we can do we can go through diplomatic 
channels 
mexicos foreign ministry said in a statement that authorities 
began the exhaustive search of the vessel in tampico 
the inspection expected to take at least 24 hours was to 
include a search for drugs and an examination of the ships 
navigation diary said javier trevino a spokesman with mexicos 
embassy in washington dc 
the cuban government which had demanded that the united states 
not attempt to board the ship has made a formal complaint to the 
state department over the incident said a cuban diplomatic 
representative in washington 
the official called the incident a provocation 
this deed demonstrates once more that the united states 
intends to behave as owner of the world and with its proverbial 
barbarism appears willing to obstruct normal commerce between cuba 
and mexico said an official quoted by cubas official news 
agency prensa latina 
secretary of state james a baker iii disagreed 
it was not an attack and a provocation baker said we 
were engaged in a legal law enforcement activity 
state defense department and national security council 
officials held three meetings before giving permission to use 
disabling fire against the hermann said jack odell a coast guard 
spokesman in washington 
the coast guard obtained permission from panama to fire on the 
ship gibson said he said it is protocol to request permission to 
stop a vessel from its country of registry 
the hermann has a cuban crew is owned by a cuban company and 
originated from a cuban port coast guard officials said 
koska said the decision to board the ship was made because the 
vessel fit the profile of a narcoticssmuggling ship but he 
declined to elaborate 
the profile of a vessel that is engaged in illegal activity is 
when you ask them to stop and they dont stop he said 
wouldnt you say thats a pretty good indication 
cubas news agency monitored in mexico city said the ship had 
a 12man crew a cargo of 10 tons of chromium and was operated by 
the guamar shipping co of cuba 
the incident lasted from early tuesday when the chincoteague 
spotted the freighter until 5 am wednesday when the shots were 
fired about 45 miles east of tampico 
the coast guard cutter a 110foot patrol boat with a crew of 
16 is based in mobile ala it has two m60 machine guns and one 
20mm cannon

the aflcio is lining up behind a plan by sen 
daniel patrick moynihan to return social security to a 
payasyougo basis and take its surplus off the federal budget 
this plan would reduce the tax burden on working men and 
women whose tax share has become disproportionate to that of the 
wealthy the federation of 141 million union members said 
wednesday in a statement as it is the growing social security 
surplus is being used to mask budget deficits that have been 
exacerbated by unbalanced and unwise spending and revenue policies 
the moynihan proposal has exposed this scam for all to see 
moynihan said he was heartened by the federations support 
which came after a meeting wednesday with 20 member union leaders 
last week moynihan introduced a bill to cut the social security 
tax from the current 62 percent to 51 percent by next year this 
would cost the social security trust fund 55 billion but would 
save a working couple up to 600 a year 
the measure would stop building up a huge trust fund surplus 
which moynihan says is wrongly being used to mask the true size of 
the federal deficit 
the aflcio differed with moynihan over how much the trust fund 
surplus should be allowed to grow before repealing the social 
security tax increase the federation believes the surplus should 
reach 125 percent to 150 percent of one years benefits while 
moynihans legislation would make the cuts when the fund reaches 
100 percent

a financial crisis has forced the dance theater 
of harlem the first american ballet company to tour the soviet 
union to cancel its new york city season and lay off its 51 
dancers 
the layoffs which include 15 technical workers and some of the 
staff will take effect after the companys engagement at 
washingtons kennedy center for performing arts in march said 
artistic director arthur mitchell 
for two decades the company has performed on stages around the 
world winning rave reviews in dozens of languages 
mitchell said wednesday that sponsors at the last minute 
canceled two major tours a fiveweek run in england and a week in 
san diego contributing to a projected deficit of 17 million in 
the fiscal year 
the vibrant and youthful troupe was in san diego as part of a 
west coast tour when mitchell told them the bad news 
naturally they were stunned he said in a telephone 
interview from pasadena but what was so pleasing was the 
solidarity yes we must stick together they have a vested 
interest in what we are about not just as performers but as human 
beings they put in the extra hours the extra time they do 
lectures and community outreach projects for which theyre not 
paid 
mitchell said the company has had previous layoffs but never to 
this extent weve always been very fiscally responsible our 
accumulated deficit for 20 years is about 400000 
the groups dance school in new york will remain open but the 
new york season which was scheduled to begin in may and the 
summer course will be canceled 
corporations underwrite master classes lecture demonstrations 
and other educational projects that do not generate a profit but 
the company receives little corporate support for performances 
the groups problems are shared by most in the arts community 
for the past decade many of the nations leading orchestras have 
cut back some theater groups have disappeared and a few dance 
companies have gone out of business 
in general what youre seeing is true throughout the arts a 
decline in funding due to the economy the mergers and acquisitions 
phenomenon and to a change in priority in some companies who now 
have an emphasis in the environment education and social causes at 
the expense of the arts said betsy hopkins executive director 
of the fundraising organization corporate fund for dance 
hopkins said that in general the nations 400 or so dance 
companies were healthy and not any worse off than other art forms 
theres a heightened interest in dance in this country she 
said but dance companies just dont tend to have big 
endowments 
two decades ago mitchell a talented and brash principal dancer 
from the new york city ballet sliced through the barriers that had 
kept blacks from succeeding in classical ballet and founded the 
vibrant and youthful company 
mitchell who retired from the city ballet in 1970 has led the 
troupe to international renown 
the company prides itself on preserving american dance 
repertory it also demonstrates a variety of styles and moods from 
the classical swan lake to balanchines neoclassical allegro 
brillante to the mitchells modern work holberg suite to 
the folk ballet john henry 
in 1988 the troupe captivated audiences in the soviet union 
with its magical retelling of john taras stunning firebird 
set to the original igor stravinsky score 
after engagements in berkeley calif and portland ore the 
dance theater of harlem returns to new york on feb 24 and will 
launch a major fundraising campaign in the spring

a judge ordered the eviction of a 
72yearold woman who has lived in a squalid homestead for 19 years 
after the state demolished her house to make way for a seaside park 
that has yet to be built 
superior court judge karen sequino said wednesday that doris 
gagnon had no right to remain on the land along long island sound 
while the state converts it into a park which officials said could 
take two to three years the states plans to build the park are 
about 20 years old 
the eviction order carried an automatic 20day stay and the 
judge said it was likely that gagnon could qualify for a stay of up 
to nine months if she pursued her resettlement in public housing 
gagnon showed no emotion as sequino ordered her eviction 
but the plucky 4foot10 woman let the chairman of the milford 
housing authority keith rubinstein have an earful when he 
approached her after the hearing gagnon scolded him for testifying 
that he could get her moved ahead of other people on the waiting 
list for public housing she said that would not be fair and 
called it an example of the government corruption she has been 
fighting 
i am sorry our system is this way and our average citizen 
cannot get justice she said adding i dont want people to 
feel sorry for me i want people to respect me 
gagnon whose only income is 4000 annually in social security 
had testified she was not interested in public housing because she 
needs room for a garden and her pets which now include three cats 
three dogs two geese 12 ducks and about 50 chickens 
gagnons homestead consists of a collection of shacks and aging 
trailers with no electricity no telephone and no running water 
assistant attorney general grace dodier said that any hardships 
gagnon was suffering were selfimposed 
her attorney karen torre said the states treatment of gagnon 
had been shameful and disgustful and represented government 
at its worst when it doesnt care 
torre asked that gagnon who has been battling cancer but 
appeared quite energetic at the hearing be allowed to remain in 
her homestead until the bulldozers are ready to begin preparing the 
parkland for recreational use 
the state moved to evict gagnon last year after milford health 
inspectors found bags of human sewage piled up behind her living 
quarters

his body was found march 5 1985 on a ranch 65 miles southeast 
of guadalajara 
as head of interpol in mexico city aldana had access to foreign 
police intelligence on drug and arms trafficking

in mexico aldana said wednesday he would sue us authorities 
for indicting him the government news agency notimex reported 
aldana who now heads a lawyers association led attempts to 
discredit camarena after nbctvs drug war miniseries broadcast 
last month he reiterated his claim that camarena was in the 
marijuana trade and may not really be dead 
caro quintero and ernesto fonseca carrillo were sentenced by a 
mexican court in december to 40 years in prison without parole for 
their role in camarenas slaying and 10 other men also were 
sentenced by mexican courts 
but us officials have said for some time they believed 
highlevel mexican authorities were involved in coveringup

after the veteran pilot of avianca 
flight 52 was eulogized at a simple funeral mass officials drove 
his body to where he had tried to land a week before kennedy 
international airport 
the remains of capt laureano caviedes hoyos mourned wednesday 
at a service at st peters roman catholic church were to be flown 
today to colombia for burial 
the mourners who took up only three pews listened intently as 
associate pastor rev jeffrey johnston offered them comfort 
one who spent so much of his time in his life among the stars 
now rests beyond them he said 
caviedes 56 was an avianca pilot for 28 years he was survived 
by his wife and two sons ages 13 and 14 who live in bogota 
colombia 
the mass was arranged by caviedes sisterinlaw yolanda munoz 
todd who lives in nearby great neck with her husband and son 
johnston said 
the captain was one of 73 people killed jan 25 when the boeing 
707 he was flying apparently ran out of fuel and crashed in the 
small enclave of cove neck on long island another 85 people were 
injured 
national transportation safety board investigators have not said 
who or what was to blame for the crash 
they wrapped up their onsite probe tuesday and gave avianca 
permission to haul away the wreckage 
caviedes who was flying into kennedy under heavy fog and rain 
radioed controllers that he needed priority landing because he 
was low on fuel but never used the word emergency investigators 
said 
as a result flight 52 was switched from a holding pattern to an 
approach pattern but was placed behind several other incoming 
planes 
the pilot apparently thought when he came out of the holding 
pattern that he had enough fuel and thats why he appears on taped 
conversations to be calm and cool said ntsb investigator barry 
trotter who is handling the crash probe 
trotter left new york for washington on wednesday accompanied 
by aides who carried fuel gauges taken from the cockpit 
we have gathered much of the facts now weve got to sit down 
and analyze to determine exactly what happened that night 
trotter said theres no simple answer 
ntsb investigators will fly to bogota next week to review the 
planes maintenance records and gather information about the 
employment records and personal habits of flight 52s crew 
including what each avianca employee did the night before the fatal 
crash trotter said 
in coming months investigators will try to recreate flight 52 
down to the most minute detail a full report is expected in nine 
to 12 months

a study today raises the possibility of 
populationwide screening for carriers of cystic fibrosis but some 
worry about what will happen to parents who ignore the knowledge 
that they can pass on the disease 
making the test mandatory has the potential for grave 
danger warned dr harvey r colten of washington university 
even voluntary screening programs carry considerable economic and 
social risk 
cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal genetic disease of 
young americans it occurs most frequently among whites striking 
about one of every 2500 white newborns in the united states 
for the first time scientists can delve into grownups genes 
and spot those likely to bear children with the inherited illness 
while the test is still too crude for routine use doctors believe 
that within a year it will be able to detect 95 percent of all 
carriers of cystic fibrosis 
people for years have realized that if we had a good carrier 
test for cystic fibrosis there would be the potential to test 
everyone before reproduction to see if they were a carrier or 
not said dr arthur l beaudet of baylor college of medicine in 
houston the evidence is at hand that such a carrier test will 
soon be available 
beaudet described the results of the currently available 
screening test in a report in the new england journal of medicine 
his team found that it can identify 76 percent of all carriers 
one in 25 white americans carries one copy of the cystic 
fibrosis gene they are healthy but if they marry another carrier 
there is a 1in4 chance that their children will have cystic 
fibrosis 
last summer drs lapchee tsui of the hospital for sick 
children in toronto and francis s collins of the university of 
michigan pinpointed the genetic error responsible for most cases of 
cystic fibrosis the latest study looked at what happened when 
doctors screened people for this single defect 
scientists at about 40 labs around the world are cooperating to 
track down the half dozen or so other mutations within the gene 
that also can cause the disease collins predicted that the 
mutations will be identified within the next year then doctors 
should be able to offer highly accurate screening tests 
specialists hope that adults will use the test results for 
family planning if couples learn that both are carriers some 
might decide to adopt rather than run the risk of having a child 
with cystic fibrosis others might opt to have artificial 
insemination with sperm from an anonymous donor who is not a 
carrier 
if they decide to have a pregnancy the test can be performed on 
the fetus if the fetus turns out to have the disease parents can 
then decide whether to have the baby or to get an abortion 
the disease causes a variety of symptoms including abnormal 
mucous secretion that results in lung infections while doctors can 
ease many of the symptoms and extend lives there is no treatment 
for the underlying disease collins noted that if everyone in the 
united states gets the screening test it will turn up 8 million 
americans who carry the cystic fibrosis gene 
if this program is successful every one of them deserves to 
sit down with someone and find out what that means he said we 
dont by a long shot have the means to do that physicians are 
uncomfortable with that role and there arent enough genetic 
counselors to do the job 
in an editorial in the journal colten raised the possibility 
that insurance companies might refuse to pay the bills of children 
with cystic fibrosis if their parents knew before the pregnancy 
that they were carriers 
dr henry dorkin of new england medical center in boston said 
that while he supports widespread screening carriers should be 
allowed to make their own decisions about whether to have children 
we have to give people as much information as possible about 
the risks and pitfalls that lie ahead of them he said and 
after informing them we should support their decision whatever it 
is 
other questions involve at what age people should be screened 
and whether the tests should be routinely offered to nonwhites 
who have a much lower risk of cystic fibrosis

cnn chief ted turner says a report by his network 
that soviet president mikhail gorbachev was considering resigning 
as leader of the communist party was a rumor not a scoop 
how can you scoop a rumor turner said wednesday at an 
atlanta press club luncheon if rumors become scoops then every 
media will have one 
but another network executive said cable news network stood by 
the reporter steve hurst hurst who has been assigned to moscow 
for 12 years said the story he filed tuesday was culled from a 
wellinformed and usually reliable communist party source 
cnn continued to broadcast the report wednesday after gorbachev 
denied it although it added what hurst said he initially heard 
could be a trial balloon or just a rumor by people opposed to 
gorbachev rule 
we believed in hursts source because i have great confidence 
and faith in him said ed turner executive vice president of 
news gathering for cnn he knows when he thinks he has a solid 
story all you can do is trust your people 
other news organizations carried the report but did not confirm 
it instead they attributed it to cnn 
ted turner meanwhile belittled the reports importance and 
rapped other news organizations for their reaction 
you shouldnt credit someone for breaking a rumor he said 
anyone can break a rumor

scientists said today that a new class of 
chemicals can cripple the aids virus in the test tube at extremely 
low doses but other researchers said its potential for therapy is 
not yet known 
the new substances appear to be the most potent yet studied for 
stopping the virus from reproducing scientists said in the british 
journal nature 
human tests for effectiveness were still being planned but six 
healthy men tolerated one of the substances without major side 
effects according to researchers from the rega institute for 
medical research in leuven belgium the janssen research 
foundation in beerse belgium and in spring house penn 
they conducted laboratory studies of compounds called tibo 
derivatives in their tests the compounds inhibited reproduction 
of the aids virus at concentrations that were 10000 to 100000 
times lower than what is needed to kill cells 
that compares to concentrations of 100 times to 10000 times 
lower than a cellkilling dose required for azt the only approved 
drug for treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome and for the 
experimental drugs dideoxycytidine and dideoxyinosine the 
researchers said 
this testtube potency of the new compounds may bode well for 
avoiding side effects but nobody knows what would happen in 
humans cautioned aids researcher jay levy of the university of 
california at san francisco 
many drugs that look promising in the test tube turn out to have 
unpredicted side effects he said in a telephone interview and 
higher potentency in the test tube does not necessarily mean 
greater effectiveness in people he said 
jeffrey laurence of the new york hospitalcornell medical center 
said he was concerned that the compound highlighted in the study 
did not work against close relatives of the aids virus including 
hiv2 and a monkeycarried version of the aids virus 
that suggests the aids virus might become resistant to it by 
mutating only slightly he said

one of the largest plastics producers in 
the united states unveiled plans to open the nations first 
multimaterial comprehensive plastic recycling plant 
union carbide chemicals and plastics inc said wednesday the 
facility would be the first in the nation to recycle the ubiquitous 
plastic bags the plant also will recycle plastic beverage 
containers 
the recycling center is expected to open next year in converted 
space at the companys central new jersey manufacturing plant at 
piscataway 
the effort was praised by state officials and legislators but 
environmental groups were skeptical saying the recycling plans 
might be little more than a bid to keep plasticbanning lawmakers 
at bay 
union carbide officials said the project was aimed at making 
money as well as easing a nationwide garbage problem that is 
particularly acute in densely populated new jersey 
these cost a lot of money company vice president gordon 
mounts told a statehouse news conference as he gestured toward a 
display of plastic bags and containers we really dont believe 
we can use them just once 
only about 1 percent of the 60 billion pounds of plastic 
produced in the united states is being recycled now union carbide 
officials said the new plant will demonstrate that plastic can be 
reused on a far wider scale 
environmentalists said readily recyclable glass and naturally 
degrading paper are better for the environment than plastic 
i dont doubt union carbide does want recycling but they 
are doing it as much for the public relations as for the 
profitability of the venture said lisa collaton a solid waste 
specialist for the washingtonbased group environmental action 
but assemblyman robert smith chairman of the lower houses 
environment committee said the effort appeared genuine and will 
dramatically change the approach government takes to the plastics 
problem 
he said theres now a real alternative to several state 
bills that propose restricting or banning plastic packaging though 
none have passed 
plastics industry officials say more than 350 legislative 
initiatives have been introduced at the federal state and local 
levels around the country to curb the use of nonrecyclable 
plastics 
the plants breakthrough union carbide officials said was its 
ability to accept plastic bags the socalled plastic films now 
are recycled in europe but not in the united states said keith 
atkins director of new business for the companys polyolefins 
division 
about 20 percent of the softdrink containers used in the 
country also are being recycled but the percentage is nowhere near 
as high with other types of plastic 
union carbide officials said the new plant would melt the bags 
down like other types of plastic the material will be fashioned 
into pellets to be sold to plastic packaging manufacturers 
the new plant will be able to handle 40 million pounds out of 
more than 1 billion pounds of plastic garbage generated in new 
jersey each year but company officials said their project at least 
would demonstrate that comprehensive and profitable plastic 
recycling is possible

an 8yearold boy recounted how a man raped 
him and cut off his penis in an attack that has pushed legislators 
to draft tough new laws on sex predators 
embarrassed but determined the boy who was 7 at the time of 
the attack identified in court wednesday the man accused of the 
crime 
the boy did not look at the defendant earl kenneth shriner but 
pointed toward shriner at the defense table and said yes 
over there 
shriner 40 has pleaded innocent to firstdegree attempted 
murder firstdegree assault and two counts of firstdegree rape 
during 30 minutes on the witness stand in pierce county superior 
court the boy told of the may 20 attack 
judge thomas r sauriol limited attendance in the courtroom 
during the testimony to about 15 friends and relatives of 
principals in the case and 10 reporters the boys testimony was 
not announced in advance to avoid hoopla as much as possible 
deputy prosecutor james roche said 
deputy prosecutor barbara coreyboulet had the boy identify the 
small red bicycle that he rode into a wooded area near his home the 
day of the attack 
did something happen to you the last time you rode this 
bike she asked 
yeah the boy answered 
she asked if he met anyone in the woods 
a guy said the boy who nodded when coreyboulet asked if 
the man did something to him 
did the guy do some things that you are embarrassed about 
coreyboulet asked 
uh huh he said 
he then described the attack 
the boy said the man was wearing a fishing coat green and 
white 
under cross examination from defense lawyer lloyde alton the 
boy repeated his description of the jacket the jacket introduced 
into evidence and described by detectives as the one shriner likely 
wore is gray with a maroon lining 
the savageness of the case has sparked proposals in the 
legislature for dealing with predatory sex offenders that range 
from civil commitment to castration 
the trial which began monday is expected to last about three 
weeks 
prosecutors have said they would seek a life sentence for 
shriner who has a history of sexual attacks and completed a 
10year prison term shortly before the boy was attacked he was 
imprisoned for the kidnap and assault of two teenage girls

suspended navajo chairman peter 
macdonald said he was disappointed by a tribal judges decision to 
try macdonald with his codefendants 
everybody likes to be tried on their own macdonald said 
wednesday after judge robert yazzie of window rock district court 
made his ruling 
yazzie consolidated trials for macdonald and his son peter 
rocky macdonald and suspended vice chairman johnny r thompson 
he ordered three separate trials for the defendants on fraud and 
other charges related to the tribes purchase of a ranch for 
electioncode violations and for bribery and kickback but each 
trial will involve two of the defendants 
also wednesday yazzie refused to order macdonald to surrender 
his us passport told macdonalds attorney he would have to 
remain on the case despite the uncertainty of compensation and 
refused a motion that he step aside for another judge 
meanwhile a judge in phoenix on wednesday allowed the tribe to 
go ahead with its 24 million civil racketeering suit against 
macdonald and about 70 other defendants 
judge john foreman of maricopa county superior court rejected a 
defense contention that his court had no jurisdiction because 
tribal sovereignty prevents the tribe from suing a navajo in a 
state court 
the civil suit in phoenix and some of the 107 criminal counts 
facing macdonald allege that he swayed the tribal council to spend 
334 million on the big boquillas ranch near seligman in july 
1987 the nonindian company which sold the ranch had paid 272 
million for it less than a day before 
phoenix land broker byron bud brown another defendant in 
the civil case testified before a us senate committee last 
february that macdonald was to receive onethird of the 72 
million profit and actually got 50000 in cash a 25000 wire 
transfer the lease of a luxury automobile and vacation trips 
before the scheme was discovered 
the tribal council suspended macdonald a few days later and 
thompson on march 10 
yazzie set a may 1 trial date on the electioncode violations 
alleged against macdonald and thompson the trial on bribery and 
kickbacks with macdonald and rocky macdonald as defendants is 
scheduled for may 23 and the two are defendants in the big 
boquillas ranch trial scheduled to begin june 20 
in denying the prosecutors request that macdonald surrender his 
passport yazzie said macdonald had attended all previous hearings 
and that he saw no reason to limit his travel 
in a separate matter macdonald wanted the judge to disqualify 
himself contending that yazzie would be biased against him because 
he once tried to deny yazzie a permanent judgeship yazzie said 
there was no evidence to support the contention 
val jolley of farmington nm an attorney for peter macdonald 
had filed a motion for a limited appearance based on a january 
start of trial but yazzie ruled that a limited appearance was 
unethical and a restriction on the court jolley has said he 
was concerned about macdonalds ability to pay him for services in 
a lengthy case

the fbi was called in to investigate the death 
khalifa founded a group in 1978 called the right or true

one continental airlines jet missed colliding 
with another continental plane by 20 or 30 feet after it broke 
through low clouds for a landing only to see the plane on the 
runway one of the pilots said 
it was really a miracle that he didnt hit us he went right 
over the top of us and all we saw was his tailpipe through the 
windshield said capt jim lowry pilot of the plane that was on 
the runway at houston intercontinental airport 
the houston chronicle reported wednesday that the continental 
plane had to abort its landing jan 3 when it spotted the other 
plane on the runway 
jack sinon manager of the federal aviation administrations air 
traffic control facility at the houston airport said wednesday the 
matter is under faa review he declined to provide further details 
continental spokesman ned walker confirmed details of the 
incident but he would not identify the pilot of the second plane 
which was flying in from albuquerque nm 
weve been told by the faa that theyre investigating this as 
a possible air traffic control operational error and that the 
continental actions and aircraft positions were as they had been 
instructed walker said 
the close call was the scariest incident in his career said 
lowry a 25year pilot with houstonbased continental 
lowry said he warned the tower controller that his plane was 
still on the runway about 20 seconds before the other plane roared 
over 
the foggy and overcast day was turning dark as lowry and his 
crew sat in the plane awaiting air traffic control instructions for 
a takeoff to phoenix ariz 
we sat on the runway for a good while then we heard an 
airplane being cleared to land on the runway that we were on he 
said we called the tower and advised the controller that we were 
still in position on the runway 
the tower he said acknowledged the call but the crew soon 
heard the roar of the other plane 
as he came over us he was bringing the nose back up and we 
saw him through the windshield he probably missed us by 20 or 30 
feet lowry said it was terrifying

cardinal john j oconnor defended a bishop who 
was quoted as saying gov mario m cuomo was in danger of going 
to hell because of his abortion beliefs 
what the bishop told me he actually said was that the governor 
is quite possibly contributing to the loss of his soul to me 
that sounds significantly different from cursing or condemning 
the governor to hell oconnor said 
auxiliary bishop austin vaughan 62 had talked to a newspaper 
reporter from jail where he served 10 days for blocking the 
entrance to an albany planned parenthood clinic last march vaughan 
was released on jan 24 
the new york post had quoted vaughan jan 23 as saying cuomo was 
in danger of going to hell if he dies tonight 
i think for a believing educated catholic to take the 
position hes taken he takes a very serious risk of going straight 
to hell the post reported vaughan had said 
oconnor had refused comment until he could speak to vaughan on 
wednesday he said in a column published in catholic new york that 
vaughan assured him he was misunderstood 
the governor responded to oconnors column with a twosentence 
statement the cardinal says the bishop was misquoted im glad 
the posts state editor fred dicker said i read the 
cardinals comments to be much more an objection to the governors 
characterization than to what we had reported the bishop actually 
said 
cuomo has said that he and his wife accept the churchs teaching 
on abortion in their private life but that as governor he 
recognized the constitutional right of choice and a legal 
obligation to make the choice available to the poor 
cuomo originally had responded to the published comments by 
saying does any bishop any rabbi any citizen have the right to 
curse a politician curse them even to hell in this wonderful 
country the answer is yes 
oconnor said vaughan by issuing a warning to the governor from 
jail had followed in the footsteps of st john the baptist st 
thomas more and other religious leaders who had issued warnings to 
public officials from prison 
among other differences of course is that bishop vaughan 
will get to keep his head he said

for the man with the biggest roof in 
valdez this years snows come with a steep price hes paid 5000 
to have it cleared 
dennis holtz owner of the foodmart supermarket said wednesday 
it took two men with snowblowers a couple of weeks to finally get 
all the snow off 
my roof is 21000 square feet holtz said we had 400 tons 
of snow up there its built to hold 140 pounds per square foot and 
we had 100 pounds per square foot 
it took over 5000 to get the nine feet of snow on the roof 
blown off he said i guess thats just one of the costs of 
doing business 
holtz said valdez is pretty much back to normal after getting 
almost 4 feet of snow on jan 16 when a singledayrecord of 47 
inches was set 
more than 13 feet of snow fell in january leaving just the 
rooftops visible on onestory dwellings 
a city storage building collapsed last week from the weight of 
snow 
jeff bailey of the national weather service said valdez is 8 
inches away from passing the season record for snowfall 
accumulation of 3847 inches set in 198687 
at the airport which has been shut down twice this winter 
because of snow buildup maintenance crews are bulldozing snow off 
taxiways and parking ramps 
we had so much precipitation down here we work 32 hours a day 
to keep ahead of it said elmer mccain we cant keep it ice 
off so we just scar it for better traction 
harry rogers superintendent of schools said children no longer 
play king of the hill but man on the mountain at the 
elementary school where snow is piling up on a corner of the 
playground 
the biggest pile weve got is approaching 50 feet he said 
the most serious problem weve got is keeping the kids off 
thats a high pile of snow out there

sir georg solti hopes his last year as director 
of the chicago symphony orchestra includes the groups first tour 
of eastern europe and the soviet union 
america has here a messenger in this orchestra that is 
unparalleled by any politician unparalleled by any ambassador 
solti said wednesday when he unveiled plans for his 22nd and 
farewell season 
it is essential that we show them what we can produce not 
in armaments and not in missiles but in beethoven and 
shostakovich the 77yearold solti told reporters 
the chicago symphony performances in the soviet union would be 
part of an exchange that would bring the leningrad philharmonic to 
the united states 
the hopedfor tour would include a performance either in moscow 
or leningrad and stops at vienna austria and at soltis 
birthplace of budapest hungary 
logistical problems including uncertainties over lodging and 
food have made the plans tentative but the orchestra hopes to 
reach a decision within two weeks 
if all three stops cannot be arranged the tour will not take 
place officials said the trip would come during the ensembles 
centennial season which will run from september through april 1991 
something is quite wonderful to be part of an orchestra which 
will be 100 years old said solti who selected about twothirds 
of the musicians currently playing 
onefifth of the existence of this orchestra i have been 
honored to be its music director he said its remarkable and 
i feel very very rich 
crowning the program for the season will be verdis opera 
otello with luciano pavarotti in the title role for the first 
time solti said 
the maestro who has won a record 29 grammy awards and built the 
chicago symphony into one of the worlds best also promised to 
return to chicago as a guest conductor 
solti also said the orchestra this spring will make its third 
trip to the orient 
six conductors including solti and daniel barenboim his 
successordesignate in chicao beginning in the 199192 season will 
lead 12 concerts in japan during april 
the trip will be funded largely through a 750000 gift the 
single largest corporate donation the orchestra has ever received 
from motorola inc said richard l thomas chairman of the 
orchestral association 
japanese audiences received the orchestra enthusiastically 
during its previous trips there the last in 1986 and solti said 
he loves the opportunity to showcase us orchestral excellence 
in many fields to my great sadness america is going down 
he said here is where neither the japanese nor the germans can 
compete with us and this is one point when we should feel very 
proud

some journalists may have been tipped to 
topsecret military plans of the invasion of panama hours before 
the action began dec 20 but no one reported it before troops 
began landing an army general says 
i had strong indications based on people i talked to that 
the press had a pretty strong indication about tuesday dec 19 as 
to what was going to happen and they didnt run it army lt 
gen thomas w kelly told an audience wednesday at the university 
of notre dame 
so i think they earned a big plus for being good americans and 
not breaking the story 
kelly director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff did 
not specify who may have known of the topsecret plans or how word 
might have leaked he refused to accept reporters questions and 
confined his remarks to an informal talk before an audience of 
about 1000 mostly university rotc cadets 
broadcast news reports the evening of dec 19 reported american 
planes landing every 10 minutes at the us base in panama reports 
also indicated troops had left fort bragg nc but did not 
indicate where they were going 
since the invasion there have been reports that strongman 
manuel antonio noriega who was deposed after the us troops 
arrived had been tipped to an imminent invasion but refused to 
believe it 
during his wideranging talk kelly defended the invasion 
castigated noriegas leadership of the panamanian defense forces 
and discussed tactics 
we wanted to go in at 1 oclock in the morning because we own 
the night said kelly our forces train at night and just 
about no one elses do we have night vision devices that no one 
else has 
the pentagon reported scattered resistance from noriega 
loyalists up to a week after the invasion 
about 14000 soldiers joined 12000 troops already stationed in 
panama in the invasion ordered by president bush who said the 
operation was undertaken to protect american lives safeguard the 
panama canal and hunt down noriega 
kelly said the invasion announced under the code name operation 
just cause was planned under a more innocuous name blue spoon 
blue spoon was a sort of covering he said if you had 
come across it on a piece of paper you wouldnt think anything of 
something called blue spoon

chevron tosco and shell and by rick delege president pro tem of 
ocaw local 1326 which represents unocal workers 
earlier in the day the unions national bargaining committee

pay health benefits and environmental concerns telephone calls to 
amoco headquarters in chicago were not returned

president bush winning bipartisan acclaim in 
congress is proposing further deep cuts in us and soviet troop 
strength in europe and declaring that time has come to swiftly 
conclude agreements limiting conventional strategic and chemical 
weapons 
today with communism crumbling our aim must be to ensure 
democracys advance the president said wednesday night in a 
state of the union speech that blended his new troop withdrawal 
proposal with a pledge to withdraw the remainder of the us 
invasion force from panama by the end of the month 
in a surprise overture bush proposed cutting military manpower 
in europe to 195000 troops on each side down from the 275000 
figure that was the us bargaining position at conventional force 
negotiations in vienna 
the president said he called soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
earlier in the day to inform him of the offer which already had 
been endorsed by nato allies the move bush said was a response 
to the revolution of 89 in which he said the united states 
stands at the center of a widening circle of freedom 
bush said gorbachev seemed receptive to the idea and was 
studying it 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said on 
abctv this morning that the kremlin was satisfied with bushs 
troop cut proposal as a beginning but he said the soviets want 
all foreign troops out of europe and if thats bushs bottom 
line it is unfortunate 
in brussels belgium nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner 
said the allies offered their broad support in principle for 
bushs proposals these new steps take account of new political 
developments in the east while remaining consistent with the needs 
of the alliances strategy of deterrence 
the surprise overture was the centerpiece of an address that 
also promised to invest in america through savings incentives 
research and improved education and called on citizens to 
confront and condemn racism and hate 
bush also renewed his call for a capital gains tax cut slapped 
down by democrats last year and called on lawmakers to pass clean 
air child care crime and drug legislation 
but while congress applauded the troop cuts and the savings 
they eventually would produce democrats said bushs rhetoric on 
domestic issues did not match the budget he sent to capitol hill 
just two days earlier 
on education the presidents words seem to agree with us but 
his actions say something else said house speaker thomas foley 
dwash delivering his partys formal response to bushs 
primetime televised speech 
foley ignored the troop proposal in his formal remarks instead 
focusing on the domestic issues congressional democrats have 
decided to make their theme for this election year in the 1990s 
and well into the next century the central challenge for america 
will be economic not military he said 
foley raised the troop cut proposal this morning on nbcs 
today show saying democrats are in agreement that we ought 
to reduce our troops in europe i think everyone see3s there is a 
change in need there foley said 
lawmakers in both parties saw the troop cut as a welcome 
development with many characterizing the move as an attempt to 
catch up with events that outpaced the arms talks 
it was a very good move on his part because we were falling 
behind the curve of popular will said sen william cohen 
rmaine he had to get way out front if we didnt make these 
kinds of proposals wed be seen as being irrelevant to the 
process 
he is rushing to catch the reality of eastern europe said 
rep pat williams dmont events in eastern europe are pulling 
the pentagon and the president toward decisions they wouldnt 
otherwise make 
the cuts would place a heavier burden on the soviet union which 
has 565000 troops in central europe compared with the us level 
of 305000 but the offer could come as a welcome relief for 
gorbachev who is under heavy popular pressure to unilaterally 
remove soviet troops from warsaw pact countries which are shedding 
their ties to moscow 
the proposal reflects advice of top military strategists would 
sustain natos needs and would help push peaceful change forward 
bush said 
a swift conclusion to our arms control talks conventional 
chemical and strategic must now be our goal that time has 
come he said 
however bushs budget provides continued buildups for most 
nuclear weapons systems and the star wars missile defense a 
reflection of what the president called moscows continued 
modernization effort in that area 
in the only other concrete announcement in his speech bush said 
he would pull back the remaining us troops sent to panama for the 
december invasion by the end of february the pentagon said 
wednesday that troop levels now are about 16000 or about 3000 
more than the preinvasion number 
amid the agreement there also were signs that a tough year lies 
ahead when bush repeated his no new taxes pledge and again 
when he vowed to seek a cut in tax rates for capital gains 
republicans in the house chamber erupted into applause while 
democrats sat silent 
and foleys only mention of foreign policy came in two areas 
where democrats take issue with the administration south africa 
and china condemning bushs earlier veto of a bill to protect 
chinese students in the united states from deportation foley said 
no congress and no president should be timid in the defense of 
freedom 
in his speech the president condemned racially motivated mail 
bombings saying the nation must confront and condemn racism 
antisemitism bigotry and hate and he said our hearts go out 
to our hostages our hostages who are ceaselessly on our minds and 
in our efforts 
bush also expressed concern over the nations health care and 
directed health and human services secretary louis sullivan to 
review recommendations on the quality cost and accessibility of 
the health care system

country including demands by thousands of slavs to be given 
weapons so they can go fight the albanians

immediate talks with ethnic albanians 
ethnic albanians are not terrorists they are subjected to 
terror by the state a statement by the groups said

in addition to its ethnic and considerable economic troubles 
the nonaligned communist country is in the throes of a political 
crisis that principally pits serbia the largest republic against 
liberal and westwardlooking slovenia to the north 
serbia is controlled by hardline communists who are resisting 
the democratic reforms the more prosperous slovenia is already 
implementing the dispute has led to a serious rift in the ruling 
communist party 
in the montenegrin republics capital of titograd on wednesday 
up to 100000 slavs rallied and some fired guns into the air some 
demanded they be given weapons and volunteered to go to kosovo to 
fight the albanian nationalists 
the state news agency tanjug said three people were killed 
wednesday and five wounded in glogovac a village 12 miles south of 
pristina kosovos capital it said police there used a helicopter 
to disperse several thousand aggressive protesters 
belgrade television showed the huge rally of slavs in titograd 
gunfire could be heard and speakers implored demonstrators to stop 
firing handguns 
one speaker said montenegrin volunteers were signing up to fight 
in kosovo and would travel there unless the authorities use all 
available methods including repression to end the albanian 
uprising 
in ivangrad a montenegrin town 10000 people also demonstrated 
against albanian separatists and slovenian and croatian leaders 
supporting them tanjug said 
slovenia and to a lesser extent croatia have sided with the 
ethnic albanians and the rally in titograd had antislovene 
overtones slovenian police units have reportedly refused to serve 
in kosovo 
in belgrade the federal and serbian capital crowds estimated 
in the thousands held rallies the demonstrations were purportedly 
antialbanian but protesters also chanted down with communism 
and down with tito the late yugoslav president held 
responsible by the serbs for originally giving wide autonomy to 
kosovo 
ethnic albanians began protesting a year ago when serbia made 
constitutional changes to take firmer control of the province at 
least 28 people died in violence in kosovo over the issue last year

a governmentsponsored dirty tricks campaign in 
northern ireland began against the irish republican army in the 
1970s but later extended to smearing top british politicians a 
former army press officer said today 
colin wallace has long maintained he was dismissed in 1975 four 
years before mrs thatcher became prime minister for threatening 
to expose the program his dismissal is now under review 
prime minister margaret thatcher on wednesday admitted she had 
wrongly denied the existence of the campaign in the past but she 
blamed it on information she received from civil servants 
on tuesday her government confirmed the existence of a covert 
program codenamed clockwork orange to feed lies to journalists 
reporting from northern ireland where the ira is fighting to end 
british rule 
defense secretary tom king planned to make a statement to 
parliament today about the dirtytricks campaign 
the government has confirmed that a covert disinformation 
campaign was waged against the ira but it has always insisted 
there is no evidence to support wallaces broader allegations that 
the campaign extended to smearing liberal politicians as soviet 
stooges and sympathizers and that wallace was framed on a 
manslaughter charge to silence him 
wallace says smear targets included the prime minister at the 
time harold wilson and his predecessor edward heath 
the former army press officer says that in addition to his 
regular army duties he led a secret psychological warfare unit in 
northern ireland in the 1970s his claim was backed up by his 
superior officer 
wallace says clockwork orange began as an attempt to 
discredit the ira through false stories such as the claim the 
guerrillas had soviet rockets armed with unstable explosives 
he says he also was supposed to spread disinformation designed 
to create the suspicion inside extremist groups that they were 
being infiltrated 
the smear campaign gradually drew in northern ireland 
politicians and eventually some of those at westminster london 
wallace said 
merlyn rees labors northern ireland secretary at the time 
displayed a proira statement he said was doctored to include his 
name the intention was to paint labor as sympathetic to terrorism 
he said on bbctv wednesday night 
author paul foot in his book who framed colin wallace 
says wallace was given detailed briefings by the mi5 
counterintelligence agency he said the aim of the campaign was to 
prevent labor from being reelected in 1974 and to depose heath and 
former northern ireland minister william whitelaw from top 
positions in the conservative party 
foot says the mi5 briefings enabled wallace to make allegations 
about homosexuality bogus bank accounts corrupt earnings and 
communist sympathies 
tony benn a former labor cabinet minister told the house of 
commons that former prime minister james callaghan also was 
targeted foots book includes the rev ian paisley the militant 
protestant leader in northern ireland and former cabinet ministers 
mrs thatcher said wednesday in a letter to a conservative 
legislator that a reexamination of government papers has 
brought to light information which shows that there were a number 
of statements in my letters and in other ministerial statements 
and official correspondence which were incorrect or require 
clarification 
she said the government was already investigating how the errors 
in the handling of the papers occurred 
but of course the matters with which they deal originated 
under previous administrations and present ministers can only deal 
with them on the basis of information made available to us she 
said

rival christian forces fought from house 
to house under raining shells today in a showdown for control of 
lebanons christian enclave police said at least 62 people had 
been killed and 216 wounded 
hundreds of thousands of civilians huddled in basements and bomb 
shelters with dwindling water supplies as troops loyal to renegade 
gen michel aoun fought for a third day with militiamen of the 
lebanese forces 
christian radio stations said a new ceasefire the third in 24 
hours was called for 9 am in response to renewed vatican appeals 
but shellfire and bursts of gunfire persisted in beiruts 
burning christian sector well after the truce deadline although 
police reported a slight decrease in hostilities that allowed some 
casualties to be evacuated 
conflicting victory claims made it difficult to determine who 
held the upper hand in the fighting which left fires raging out of 
control and morgues packed with bodies 
lebanese forces commander samir geagea blamed the confrontation 
on aouns power lust and aoun blamed the united states 
america has engineered this collision but we shall surmount 
it soon aoun said in a statement on his television station he 
did not elaborate 
the us state department on wednesday said aoun should step 
down 
gen aoun must realize that his bellicose behavior does not 
advance the interests of the christians or any other community but 
only benefits those who want to see lebanon continue in anarchy and 
turmoil the state department said we reiterate our call for 
gen aoun to step aside and to do it now 
the fighting in the christian zone was the worst since february 
1989 when aouns 20000 troops last moved against the 6000strong 
lebanese forces more than 80 people were killed and 200 wounded in 
that fourday conflict 
the battle could break the stalemate over an arab league peace 
plan aimed at ending a 15yearold civil war that has cost 150000 
lebanese their lives 
aoun opposes the accord worked out in october because it does 
not guarantee withdrawal from lebanon of syrias 40000 troops 
which he calls an occupation force aoun also refuses to recognize 
president elias hrawi who was elected as part of the accord 
geagea has neither accepted nor rejected the peace accord but 
has recognized hrawi as president he and other rightwing 
christians oppose aouns rebellion 
aoun increasingly isolated and facing the prospect of a 
syrianbacked assault by the 22000 soldiers loyal to the hrawi 
government apparently felt he had to secure control of the 
christian sector 
the casualty count includes victims felled by stray morder 
rounds that exploded in moslem west and south beirut which have 
not been involved in the interchristian clashes it also includes 
15 people mainly children wounded when a shell fired by aouns 
gunners blasted a governmentowned secondary school in jemmayzeh 
district a stronghold of the lebanese forces 
the school has been used as a shelter by several christian 
families who sought refuge in it to avoid shelling 
the three daily newspapers operating in christian east beirut 
failed to publish due to the clashes 
shiite moslem militias meanwhile fought wednesday in southern 
lebanon continuing the latest round of their intermittent struggle 
for supremacy among the 12 million shiites the largest sect in 
the country of 35 million people 
four people were reported wounded raising the toll to 98 killed 
and 280 wounded in the battle that began dec 23 between the 
fundamentalist hezbollah which is loyal to iran and amal a 
mainstream militia backed by syria 
police said aouns mainly christian troops spearheaded by the 
ustrained 8th brigade scored initial successes wednesday when 
they overran four lebanese forces barracks on the coastal highway 
linking beirut and north lebanon 
but the militia outflanked aouns army with tankled assaults 
seizing his naval base in kasslik the armor base of sarba in 
jounieh and the main air base in halat said a police spokesman 
that reasserted the lebanese forces control of the enclaves 
30milelong mediterranean coast and restored their supply lines 
said the spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules 
the police spokesman said the focal point of ground fighting 
early today was a cluster of government buildings housing the 
ministries of finance and justice close to beiruts dividing green 
line 
there is housetohouse combat there buildings are frequently 
changing hands in attacks and counterattacks the spokesman said 
hrawi called on aouns troops to disobey and rebel against 
the general whom he fired as army commander a few hours after 
being elected by parliament and sworn in nov 24 
the armys mission is to protect the citizens not to kill 
them hrawi said in an interview broadcast by moslem and 
christian radio stations indicating he has thrown the weight of 
his internationally recognized government behind geagea in a bid to 
oust aoun from the presidential palace 
the telephone operator at st george greek orthodox hospital in 
ashrafiyeh said the facility one of the two main hospitals in east 
beirut was packed with casualties 
the morgue is full of bodies the wounded are on stretchers in 
the corridors the upper floors have been evacuated due to the 
fierce shelling duels 
there are not enough surgeons to operate on the wounded he 
said he would not give his name

pope john paul ii ended an eightday 
african tour today with a plea for regional and international 
cooperation to eliminate war discrimination and human rights 
abuses on the continent 
solidarity between peoples has no borders the pope said 
the great changes under way in eastern europe should not divert 
attention from the south especially from the african continent 
john paul made the appeal in a speech to diplomats at the end of 
his trip to five countries of the impoverished sahel region 
president hissene habre and the pontiff spoke at the airport for 10 
minutes before the papal aircraft departed for rome at 155 pm 
before leaving the pontiff celebrated mass at a soccer stadium 
and met with moslem leaders and other ndjamena residents at a 
hippodrome 
in the address to the diplomatic corps the pope noted that chad 
is now enjoying relative peace after years of civil war but said 
various conflicts afflicting africa continue to cause sufferings 
which seem to have no end 
i think of ethiopia sudan of other countries exposed to 
racial discrimination of others where ethnic rivalries sometimes 
lead to violence he said 
the pontiff called on all parties to examine the root causes of 
the conflicts including the oppression of minorities 
one must also have the courage to shed light on the role 
exercised by all parties starting with the most powerful who have 
control of the economy military aid and alliances 
we must manage to recognize the errors the abuses of power 
the injustices the exploitation we should always have as the 
first objective the respect of the rights and the dignity of man 
john paul praised africas charter of human rights but urged 
leaders to reduce the distance between words and action in 
strictly applying the terms of the document 
he singled out the plight of african refugees forced to flee 
their countries because of violence or hunger 
the problem goes beyond the field of action of specialized 
organizationsit involves men who should meet their brothers in 
humanity 
the pope reiterated his appeal for rich countries to provide 
economic aid that doesnt enslave third world recipients he said 
the developed world should also share its scientific and technical 
knowhow and help poor countries protect the environment and 
improve health services 
john paul also challenged african nations to collaborate more 
closely among themselves in fields such as energy production 
transport agriculture and industry 
african organizations should be more active as true 
instruments of promotion of peace and development to the benefit of 
all their members he said 
in his homily during the mass the pope urged married couples to 
observe fidelity and respect the womans vocation to be a 
mother 
in the ceremony at the hippodrome he encouraged chadians in 
their effort to build up the country after the long years of civil 
war and fighting with neighboring libya 
without mentioning libya he invited chad to offer gestures of 
solidarity with the african countries which surround you 
aside from chad the popes sixth voyage to africa took him to 
cape verde guineabissau mali and burkina faso

nasa decided to replace a fuel 
turbopump in space shuttle atlantis but said the repairs probably 
will not delay the shuttles launch now set for feb 22 
technicians began the weeklong job of replacing the turbopump 
located in one of the spaceships three engines late wednesday 
according to conrad nagel who leads a nasa team readying atlantis 
for launch 
nagel said the repair work was not expected to interrupt flight 
preparations although the schedule is a little soft if things go 
well there shouldnt be any impact to the launch date nagel 
said 
atlantis is scheduled to carry a secret cargo into space for the 
department of defense the national aeronautics and space 
administration has not set an official launch date but the liftoff 
is targeted for feb 22 
the turbopump became a concern after the failure of an unrelated 
fuel pump duct during a routine pressure test at the engines 
manufacturer the rocketdyne division of rockwell international in 
canoga park calif 
the failure was in a titanium weld done outside the factory 
according to nagel an inflight failure could hinder the flow of 
fuel to the engine 
that lead us to inspect other such welds and this turbopump 
is suspect nagel said we dont think we have a problem with 
it but safety first 
nasas concern for safety also lead engineers to order the 
replacement of a seal in an ignition controller on one of atlantis 
two solidfuel booster rockets 
that work announced several days ago and planned for sunday 
was not expected to cause a launch delay either according to nagel 
postflight inspections of the reusable rockets used to boost 
columbia into space jan 9 showed a tiny void in an identical seal 
the void is located in a backup seal on a gasket attached to a 
device on the coneshaped portion of the rocket it was missed 
during tests at the boosters manufacturer thiokol corp in utah 
according to nagel 
you would be hard pressed to see it with the naked eye he 
said but technicians will replace the atlantis seal to be 
ultraconservative

a sophisticated radio receiver soon to 
be installed in argentina will help scientists scan the whole 
universe as they expand their search for signals from intelligent 
aliens in space 
one of the fundamental questions that has faced the human 
species throughout history is are we alone what is our place 
in the cosmos said louis friedman executive director of the 
nonprofit planetary society 
tim lynch the groups program director called the search for 
extraterrestrials almost spiritual because if we find there is 
another civilization somewhere else its evidence this planet can 
survive as well 
the planetary society a pasadenabased group that advocates 
space exploration raised 150000 from its 125000 members in 70 
countries to pay for the hightech radio signal analyzer named 
megachannel extraterrestrial assay ii 
meta ii the size of two large refrigerators will be flown to 
argentinas institute of radioastronomy in two to three weeks said 
thomas mcdonough who coordinates the planetary societys part of 
the worldwide search for extraterrestrial intelligence program 
known as seti 
two argentine engineers have been building the device at the 
harvardsmithsonian oak ridge observatory in harvard mass west 
of boston 
since 1985 the societys identical meta receiver at the 
observatory has scanned the space visible from the northern 
hemisphere seeking a radio signal from an alien civilization 
steven spielberg director of the film et the 
extraterrestrial donated 100000 for the first meta project 
since 1960 astronomers have conducted more than 50 separate but 
mostly limited searches for any radio waves that may have been 
intentionally beamed into space by extraterrestrials 
almost all previous searches listened to space visible from the 
northern hemisphere with only brief partial scans of southern 
hemisphere skies from australia and the argentine institute 
located in a park 30 miles southeast of buenos aires 
meta ii tests will start in june after the 84 millionchannel 
receiver is hooked to one of the institutes two dishshaped 
98footwide radiotelescope antennas 
by its dedication on oct 12 the holiday commemorating 
christopher columbus discovery of the new world in 1492 the 
device will spend at least 12 hours daily for three or more years 
listening for signs that humanity is not alone 
with both meta receivers working the planetary society will be 
conducting the first systematic search of the universe as a whole 
for signals from another civilization mcdonough said this 
could be the system that makes the first contact with another 
civilization 
there are so many stars like the sun that its impossible to 
think the sun is the only one that has life on an orbiting 
planet said raul colomb director of the argentine institute 
colomb discussed the meta ii project during visits to the 
planetary society on tuesday and to nasa and the seti institute in 
mountain view on wednesday speaking in somewhat broken english 
colomb joked i hope if we make contact they extraterrestrials 
can understand spanish too 
scientists would know they discovered an alien civilization if 
they found an ultranarrow frequency signal that laws of physics say 
couldnt come from any natural phenomenon or earthly source 
mcdonough said 
national aeronautics and space administration scientists plan a 
more sophisticated seti effort they plan to start listening to the 
northern hemisphere in 1992 and the southern hemisphere no earlier 
than 1995 said nick renzetti who heads the radioastronomy effort 
at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
but the 10year 100 million effort may lag because nasa budget 
increases are smaller than proposed he added

cosmonaut alexander a serebrov cruised through 
space today on a special motorcycle designed to rescue spacemen in 
distress it was the cycles maiden voyage and soviet officials 
said it performed well 
soviet television interrupted its regular programs several times 
during the day for special coverage of the space ride which took 
serebrov as far as 33 yards from the orbiting mir space station 
live pictures showed serebrov attached to a tether anchored on 
mir as he prepared to ride the cycle which looks more like a 
floating armchair than a motorcycle 
the device formally known as the cosmonaut movement system is 
similar to the manned maneuvering unit that us space shuttle 
astronauts have used soviet space officials say 
it weighs 484 pounds has 32 motors and is designed to repair 
satellites and rescue spacemen it can move to a maximum distance 
of 50 yards from mir 
the cycle was delivered to mir on dec 6 
mission commander alexander s viktorenko 42 stayed at mirs 
exit hatch and monitored the cycles operations he and serebrov 
the flight engineer have been aboard mir since september 
the 20ton mir was launched in february 1988 and was designed to 
be permanently manned but it was mothballed in april for four 
months because a module and another addon were not ready and 
because it would have cost too much money to keep a crew aboard 
mir already is joined with kvant an astrophysics laboratory

the communist party has expelled a leading 
intellectual for joining in the spring prodemocracy movement 
according to an official report that reached beijing today 
wen yuankai a professor at the chinese university of science 
and technology in the central city of hefei was expelled late last 
year according to a local radio broadcast of jan 20 
the broadcast was reported today by the british broadcasting 
corps monitoring service 
wen made a speech in beijings tiananmen square in may 
supporting the students camped there to demand democratic change 
he and other intellectuals urged the government to talk with the

lifted 
wen yuankai has obstinately adhered to the stand of bourgeois 
liberalization the radio said bourgeois liberalism is the 
official term for western democratic ideas 
he went all out to advocate the need to increase openness and 
promote political restructuring it said he also vigorously 
plotted and egged on riots in the hefei area both the nature and 
consequences of his mistakes are extremely serious 
the radio said he had been expelled from the party in order to 
purify it 
the hong kong newspaper ming pao reported recently that wen was 
not under arrest but had to obtain permission to leave campus and 
was writing a selfcriticism an essay that sets out ones thoughts 
and actions and expresses contrition 
so far the 48 millionmember ruling party has publicly 
announced the expulsions of only about half a dozen prominent 
members due to their roles in the protests that were crushed in 
june however in many places party members are being required to 
reregister giving party officials a chance to review their rolls 
and drop any members considered unacceptable 
top party leaders have stressed repeatedly since june the need 
to strengthen party discipline and expel any members who do not 
adhere to the party line 
party membership can be essential to professional advancement 
others who have been expelled from the party include wan runnan 
and yan jiaqi who fled abroad and have helped form an exile 
organization to promote democratic reform in china

construction spending held back by severe 
weather fell 06 percent in december reversing a november gain 
and ending 1989 with the lowest increase in seven years the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said residential nonresidential and 
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 4146 billion in december the lowest rate since 
last junes 1 percent decline 
for the year spending totaled 4147 billion up 12 percent 
from 1988 the increase was the lowest since a 51 percent decline 
in the 1982 recession year spending increased 3 percent in 1988 
residential spending was pushed down 07 percent in december by 
a 28 percent decline in multifamily construction singlefamily 
spending was up 04 percent residential spending represents about 
50 percent of the total 
nonresidential spending was off 43 percent while government 
spending which represents about 20 percent of the total was up 
29 percent boosted by a 93 percent increase in highway and 
street expenditures 
the decrease in december spending offset a 07 percent advance 
in november which followed a 04 percent decline in october the 
novemer increase was revised downward from the 15 percent gain 
originally reported 
for the year residential spending declined 11 percent 
nonresidential gained 24 percent and government spending was up 
38 percent 
in addition to the effects of the unusually cold weather in 
december construction was constrained throughout much of the year 
by high interest rates and fell to a yearly low of an annual rate 
of 4103 billion last july 
but as the fed appeared to succeed in driving down inflation it 
permitted rates to fall gradually in recent months and analysts 
have been saying the lower rates should result in increased 
construction 
residential spending in december totaled a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 191 billion including 1349 billion on 
singlefamily housing and 206 billion on multifamily 
construction 
nonresidential construction totaled 967 billion and 
government spending 911 billion

us district judge a wallace tashima on wednesday said clinics 
and prochoice activists failed to prove in their lawsuit that the 
antiabortion blockades were aimed at all women 
the allegations clearly show that the intent is directed 
at women seeking abortions and not at pregnant women generally or 
at women as a class tashima said in an eightpage ruling 
tashima ruled in september that civil rights law did not protect 
women seeking abortions carol sobel an attorney with the american 
civil liberties union then amended the complaint to allege that 
the blockades violate the civil rights of all women who would be 
discouraged from entering medical clinics offering services besides 
abortions 
plaintiffs confuse effect with motive tashima said the 
class must be based on intent not effect 
ms sobel said she would appeal the ruling to the 9th circuit 
court of appeals this week she also vowed to request an emergency 
stay of tashimas ruling which lifted an order issued in march 
barring the blockades 
i think the judge is wrong ms sobel said youre talking 
about a conspiracy to deprive women of medical care that relates 
only to women 
operation rescue the antiabortion group that staged clinic 
blockades nationwide applauded the ruling saying it affirmed the 
groups argument that its actions are aimed at abortion not all 
women said victor smith an attorney for the group

president bushs proposal for deeper troop cuts in 
central europe was a step in the right direction but it failed to 
go far enough foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said 
today 
in a surprise overture bush proposed in his state of the union 
message wednesday a cut in military manpower in europe to 195000 
troops on each side the previous us bargaining position at 
conventional force negotiations in vienna was 275000 on each side 
its a good sign that things are changing for the better 
gerasimov said in a news briefing some observers note that the 
events in europe run ahead of the slow diplomatic negotiations 
gerasimov criticized the proposal for not going far enough 
you can note in his speech that he needs american troops in 
europe from here to eternity 125000 or about this figure this 
is not a good sign 
we together with les aspin chairman of the us house armed 
services committee feel it must be the ceiling not the floor 
bush said in his speech that he and the united states european 
allies agree that an american military presence in europe is 
essential and that it should not be tied solely for the soviet 
military presence in eastern europe 
gerasimov also complained that the proposal applies only to 
troops in central europe and would leave the united states with 
30000 or more troops in britain greece and other countries in 
europe 
so it comes out that the us is to have 235000 troops 
gerasimov said this will have to be considered at the conventional 
arms talks in vienna he said 
gerasimov also complained that bush seemed to take credit for 
the revolution of 1989 as the american president called it 
he said attempts to show these events as a triumph of us 
ideals and a failure of communism are a relic of the cold war 
he added that the us invasion of panama was further evidence of 
this attitude 
in his speech bush said that the remarkable events of 1989 
validate the longstanding goals of american policy a policy 
based on a single shining principle the cause of freedom america 
not just the nation but an idea alive in the minds of people 
everywhere 
overall however gerasimov repeated that we want to see in 
bushs address a signal to use to the maximum the unique chance of 
1990 to improve sovietamerican cooperation

west european leaders today generally welcomed 
president bushs proposals for troop withdrawals from europe 
but the west europeans stressed that they wanted a continued 
us military presence and britain said it hoped no further cuts 
were planned 
in moscow the soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
gerasimov today called the proposal a step in the right direction 
but he criticized it for failing to go far enough 
you can note in his speech that he needs american troops in 
europe from here to eternity 125000 or about this figure this 
is not a good sign gerasimov said 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said in a statement 
that she attached great importance to president bushs assurance 
that the new figure will be a floor and that no more reductions are 
envisaged 
this will ensure a continued strong american presence in 
europe the statement added 
thatcher aides said bush telephoned her on saturday to discuss 
the proposal we indicated our support the downing street 
statement said 
bush in his state of the union message wednesday proposed that 
washington and moscow cut troops levels in central europe to 
195000 on each side below the 275000 figure being negotiated at 
talks in vienna 
the united states has 305000 troops in central europe and the 
soviet union has 565000 another 30000 us troops in britain and 
southern europe are excluded from the bush proposal 
a us official has said bush sent lawrence eagleburger his 
deputy secretary of state and robert gates the deputy national 
security adviser to present his plan to the leaders of britain 
france west germany and italy 
having secured endorsement from these major west european 
nations bush then called soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to 
inform him of the proposal 
in west germany where most of the us troops are deployed 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher called bushs proposal an 
important step forward west german defense minister gerhard 
stoltenberg called it a balanced combination of disarmament 
policy and unequivocal recognition of the wests defense readiness 
and alliance solidarity 
the enthusiasm reflected the eagerness with which west germany 
is seeking reunification with east germany 
the caution in britain and some of the other nato allies in 
europe underlined anxieties about the prospect of the american 
troops leaving and about german reunification there are 380000 
soviet troops in east germany 
manfred woerner secretary general of the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization said in brussels that the european 
allies offered their broad support in principle 
woerner said the bush plan was consistent with us promises 
to maintain significant military forces in europe as necessary to 
alliance security 
in paris french foreign minister roland dumas called the 
proposal an important step on the road to disarmament bush set 
an objective that takes into account at the same time europeans 
desire for disaramament and their security concerns 
some smaller west european nations followed mrs thatchers 
basically cautious line 
there have to be talks on the withdrawal of troops and i 
oppose a unilateral initiative said belgian foreign affairs 
minister mark eyskens 
last week belgium said it is considering pulling its troops out 
of west germany because of the demise of hardline communist 
leaderships in countries across eastern europe 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek considered a cutback 
to 195000 troops would be the minimum level needed dutch 
television reported 
a dutch foreign ministry statement said the proposed reductions 
were feasible because of the developments in eastern europe 
but stressed the soviets must match the american withdrawals 
norways foreign minister kjell magne bondevik said in a radio 
interview that the presence of us troops in europe is still 
needed we dont see it as a problem if their presence would be at 
a lower level than now

president george bushs concern for the pollution 
in boston harbor ended when he moved into the white house 
complains gov michael s dukakis 
bush made headlines in the presidential race when he chartered a 
boat for a tour of the historic harbor and blamed dukakis for its 
pollution but his new budget unveiled monday leaves out 20 
million that congress had authorized for cleaning up the waterway 
the campaign talk was a fraud dukakis the unsuccessful 
1988 democratic nominee said wednesday 
it was just a lot of political talk dukakis said when 
push comes to shove no money for boston harbor isnt that sad 
the state is under a court order to clean the harbor where the 
city of boston and surrounding towns have dumped sewage for 
hundreds of years it has repeatedly been rated among the nations 
mostpolluted waterways 
in september 1988 bush hired a ferry filled it with reporters 
and supporters and cruised the harbor accusing dukakis of dallying 
while it got dirtier and dirtier 
two hundred years ago tea was spilled in the boston harbor in 
the name of liberty bush had said if tea were spilled in the 
boston harbor today it would dissolve in the residue of my 
opponents neglect and delay 
michael deland chairman of the presidents council on 
environmental quality blamed the omission of funds on the tight 
federal budget if there were surpluses of money around that 
would be one thing deland said but there are not 
back in 1988 bush brushed aside the fact that the environmental 
protection agency had taken three years to act on the states 
requests for help with the harbor saying he was more interested in 
directing attention to what he would do if president 
the 20 million bush left out of his budget would pay for a 
tunnel that would carry sewage to a new treatment plant 
paul levy who heads the agency responsible for the 6 billion 
harbor cleanup said the state will have to try to persuade 
congress to put the 20 million back in the budget 
if congress doesnt approve the money again the bill will go to 
bostonarea residents who already face escalating water and sewer 
costs because the court order requires the state to build the 
tunnel with or without the federal money 
dukakis said he isnt bitter 
thats water over the dam if youll pardon the pun dukakis 
said

west germany would be dealt the hardest 
economic blow by the largescale us troop cuts in europe that 
president bush proposed in his state of the union speech 
bush proposed that us and soviet troops be reduced to 225000 
in europe down to 195000 in central europe because of the 
dizzying collapse of east bloc communist regimes 
about 250000 us servicemen are based in west germany alone 
with another 55000 in britain italy turkey and greece 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher called 
bushs proposal an important step forward west german defense 
minister gerhard stoltenberg called it a balanced combination of 
disarmament policy and unequivocal recognition of the wests 
defense readiness and alliance solidarity 
the colognebased german economics institute reported in a july 
study that west germany earns 5 billion a year from us military 
expenditures it warned that a troop pullout would mean economic 
collapse for regions that are heavily dependent on the american 
presence 
an extensive analysis of the us bases was undertaken because 
of the growing public tendency to see american troops as a burden 
institute director for economic and scientific affairs otto vogel 
said at the time 
there has been increasing support in recent months for troop 
cuts as a way to reduce tensions in europe and move the german 
states closer to reunification now that the communists in east 
germany no longer have a monopoly on power 
east germany is the kremlins most critical military ally and 
about 400000 of the 565000 soviet troops in europe are stationed 
in the country 
the kremlin does not want to lose its frontline bases in east 
germany but it has indicated it could accept a neutral state 
communist premier hans modrow was in moscow meeting with kremlin 
leaders this week but there was no word on whether they discussed 
the extremely sensitive topic of reducing soviet troops in east 
germany 
as they move away from four decades of kremlin domination 
poland hungary and czechoslovakia are pushing for the complete 
withdrawal of soviet troops from their territory none of the three 
are considered nearly as crucial to soviet security as east germany 
west germany is under pressure to remain in nato and keep troops 
as part of its commitment to the western defense alliance the 
troops however are an obstacle to reunification 
last may bush proposed a 275000 ceiling on us and on soviet 
forces in central europe and said negotiations to reach that goal 
should be wrapped up within a year 
before now bush has said he would not support further cuts 
until the current talks were wrapped up but a senior 
administration official said events were running ahead of the 
negotiations

the four blacks who were denied service 
at an allwhite woolworth lunch counter 30 years ago were greeted 
today by a black woolworth vice president before sitting down to a 
breakfast of eggs grits bacon and coffee 
david richmond franklin mccain jibreel khazan and joseph 
mcneil entered the store at 730 am and surrounded by dozens of 
reporters and onlookers ordered from two women who had been 
working there on feb 1 1960 three of the men wore business 
suits khazan formerly ezell blair jr wore a white robe with a 
headband around his dreadlocks 
they were greeted by woolworth vice president aubrey lewis who 
noted that 30 years ago he too would have been denied service 
im proud you had the courage to open the doors for a 
movement lewis said 
while the four waited for their meals some onlookers began 
singing we shall overcome outside the store there was more 
singing directed by the naacp and some bystanders carried placards 
saying feb 1 1960 it seems like only yesterday but it could 
be tomorrow and the only thing thats worthwhile is change 
remembering feb 1 1960 
back in 1960 public buildings in greensboro had separate water 
fountains for whites and blacks theaters had separate entrances 
for blacks who were forced to sit in balconies away from whites 
blacks had to step to the rear on city buses 
when the four all freshmen at north carolina aampt state 
university refused to leave the counter 30 years ago their sitin 
touched off protests in nine states and helped ignite the civil 
rights movement 
we were scared mccain recalled i just wanted a coke and 
a doughnut thats all i wanted 
we did get some encouragement on the first day and we got it 
from quarters you wouldnt ordinarily expect it to come from he 
said there was a little old white lady of oh 75 years of age 
who came over and placed hands on our shoulders and said to us 
boys im so proud of you the only thing i regret is that it 
didnt happen 20 years earlier 
that was really a source of inspiration to us 
geneva tisdale a black working at woolworth that day said she 
never envisioned the scope of the events 
i never thought they were serious she said 
the other counter worker ima edwards agreed saying i just 
thought they came in to try something i didnt see it blossoming 
into this 
ms edwards who is white said that in retrospect the 
demonstrations were worthwhile 
this is something that should be she said no race should 
be discriminated against where they cant come in somewhere to 
eat 
in his book civilities and civil rights duke university 
historian william chafe said the woolworth sitins helped ignite 
the civil rights movement 
the long road that would lead from greensboro to selma to 
black power and beyond had found its starting point he wrote 
selma was the site of an important 1965 march for black voting 
rights 
chafes 1980 book was the subject of a panel discussion at the 
university of north carolinagreensboro on wednesday night the 
start of a fiveday commemoration 
people are coming in from everywhere said hal sieber a 
member of the organizing committee everybodys all charged up 
and ready to go 
following todays reenactment about 400 people marched from 
north carolina aampt state university to the woolworth store where a 
plaque and footprints were dedicated and the name of that section 
of street was changed from sycamore to february one place 
later in the day organizers planned to unveil a sculpture 
marking the event at the university 
an awards banquet and a jazz concert featuring trumpeter dizzy 
gillespie also were scheduled 
before going to woolworths in 1960 the four agreed they would 
be courteous and would not miss any classes they also agreed it 
would be a nonviolent demonstration 
they targeted woolworths because it was a national chain that 
allowed its lunch counters to be segregated only in the south 
the four were prepared to go to jail but police allowed them to 
go back to school that night news about the sitin spread quickly 
across the campus 
the next day more than two dozen male and female students 
showed up at the lunch counter they too were denied service 
on the third day the demonstrations spread to the kress 
fiveanddime down the street 
the sitins quickly became national news gov luther hodges was 
not sympathetic calling the sitins counterproductive and a 
threat to law and order 
crowds began gathering outside the store to watch the students 
hecklers including some members of the ku klux klan taunted 
them 
for several months the owners of downtown greensboro 
restaurants refused to change their whitesonly policy fearing 
integration would drive away white customers 
on july 25 1960 woolworth agreed to allow blacks at the lunch 
counter later accounts reported the chain lost about 200000 in 
business during the sitins

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today that after nine years close to washingtons power center he 
has found power doesnt really bring the fulfillment that many 
think it does 
baker told a roomful of politicians and diplomats at the annual 
national prayer breakfast that inner security and true real 
fulfillment comes by faith it doesnt come by wielding power in a 
town where power is king 
president bush in brief remarks at the breakfast where baker 
was keynote speaker said i am convinced that the 1990s will be 
the decade of the rebirth of faith and hope the rapid 
opening of communist nations in eastern europe helped lead to that 
conviction he said 
bush also said a truly religious nation is a tolerant nation 
we cherish dissent we cherish the fact that we have many many 
faiths and we protect even the rights of disbelief 
baker said he used to think that being a success meant never 
admitting hurt or problems but that changed several years ago he 
said at that time he was having a particularly difficult problem 
and his wife susan helped him pray and see that i really needed 
to stop trying to play god and turn the matter over to faith 
baker a former treasury secretary and chief of staff under 
president reagan described his own religious feelings revealing a 
seldomseen side of a man with a smooth demeanor who usually seems 
to keep his feelings tightly controlled 
baker said he gains strength from prayer and from regular 
meetings for fellowship with a small group of very normal 
guys who just happen to hold positions of power and influence in 
washington 
the group supports one another in trying to live a life of 
faith he said 
baker characterized himself as just one person genuinely 
struggling to put faith into practice in my life 
living in a city of power and politics he said he has learned 
that power of course can be intoxicating it can be addictive 
and few doubt that power tends to corrupt and absolute power 
corrupts absolutely 
over these last nine years i have had opportunities to 
participate in the exercise of more power than i ever would have 
imagined i have felt the weight of responsibility that that brings 
and i have to admit to you as well that i have felt the temptations 
that are attendant to it baker siad 
i found early on that having a position of power really 
doesnt bring the fulfillment that many people think it does he 
said of course it does bring excitment it brings a sense of 
satisfaction when things go well disappointment when they dont 
and it brings invitations to some of the most exclusive gatherings 
in the world 
however he said for someone who likes to go to bed at 930 
at night that is not necessarily a plus

proposed the creation of an interim miniparliament with veto 
power over the ruling council until romanias first free postwar

power participated in talks which the leading body said were aimed 
at giving the opposition a role in the government

participation by all parties it also said the method of 
expanding it will be given the finishing touches during 
continuing talks with opposition groups 
the front leaders said the miniparliament would be composed 
of three members from each party and would have a majorityvote 
veto power over the decisions of the 11member ruling council

frame for the establishment of the interim parliament body

aides during the fourth day of their trial before a military 
tribunal on charges of complicity to commit genocide 
the four are former communist party secretary emil bobu third 
in the ceausescu hierarchy after the dictator and his wife former 
interior minister tudor postelnicu and former politburo members 
manea manesacu and ion dinca

then executed ceausescu and his wife elena in december 
the defendants face a maximum penalty of life in prison

a federal judge today placed irancontra 
figure albert hakim on two years probation and fined him 5000 
the businessman who controlled the money in the scandal agreed to 
hand over to the us government 73 million from the secret arms 
sales to iran frozen in swiss bank accounts 
us district court judge gerhard gesell imposed probation 
following hakims nov 21 guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of 
helping to supplement oliver norths government salary by arranging 
to pay for a 13800 security system at norths home 
the american public has had enough of this soap opera hakim 
said after his court appearance 
hakim is another in a string of irancontra defendants who have 
escaped prison time 
very substantial funds measured in the millions of dollars 
which have been frozen in swiss bank accounts have now been 
released to the united states by you gesell announced 
the amount to be turned over to the government is 73 million 
said mary belcher a spokeswoman for the office of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh she said hakim will retain 17 million 
which he will split with swissbased lawyers willard zucker and 
philippe neyroud 
gesell also said the iranianborn hakim had secured the release 
of david jacobsen a us hostage held in lebanon and is 
cooperating with irancontra prosecutors in a new criminal 
investigative matter 
gesell noted that jacobsen the former hostage had written the 
judge on behalf of hakim the judge said that while others have 
taken credit for freeing the hostage it was hakims conduct that 
actually achieved it 
at the request of the justice department the swiss government 
froze some 78 million held in accounts of the enterprise the 
maze of offshore companies and bank accounts hakim and his business 
partner retired air force maj gen richard secord set up to 
handle money in the irancontra affair the money has accrued some 
12 million in interest 
gesell placed one of hakims companies panamanianbased lake 
resources inc on probation and ordered that the corporation be 
dissolved 
lake resources had pleaded guilty to a charge of theft of 
government property in the diversion of iran arms sales profits to 
the contras 
outside the courthouse hakim said i have been abused by two 
presidents and criticized irancontra prosecutors 
im talking about president reagan and president walsh he 
said referring to the former president and walsh who directed 
hakims prosecution 
our judicial system has been used as a tool by the politicians 
for their own gain said hakim on top of this list of the 
politicians is president walsh and his cabinet known as ic 
independent counsel and his staff 
they accused me of being an arms dealer i am not said the 
businessman 
hakims lawyer richard janis said the prosecution of hakim was 
an abuse after 22 months of indictment and expenditure of 100 
million they brought an indictment that no other prosecutor would 
have taken to court 
irancontra prosecutors filed a sentencing memo monday saying 
hakim has agreed to provide them with testimony in an anticipated 
future case being investigated by a grand jury outside 
washington the prosecutors did not elaborate but called his 
cooperation of significant value 
gesell called hakims assistance to irancontra prosecutors 
exceptional and in sharp contrast to any other of the 
defendants who have been at one time or another before me in 
the irancontra case 
the judge was referring to north secord and former national 
security adviser john poindexter who is scheduled to go on trial 
feb 20 
you are the only one who was not an officer or former 
officer of the us government said the judge indeed you 
were brought in by the us government 
the judge said hakims business interests have been hurt and 
that you have suffered substantially 
the question of who owns the proceeds from the irancontra 
affair has lingered since the scandal erupted in november 1986 
in the secret iran arms sales the us government was paid the 
cost of the weapons it sold to the iranians but the enterprise 
charged iran exorbitant prices for the arms with the difference 
being kept in the accounts controlled by hakim 
several million dollars were diverted to the contras fighting 
the leftist government of nicaragua other money was set aside for 
profits for hakim secord and arms dealer thomas clines 
congressional investigators found some of the money also was 
supposed to be funneled to other covert programs according to 
testimony from north the former white house aide convicted in the 
affair

secretary of state james a baker iii bound 
for highlevel talks next week in moscow today offered soviet 
reformers the full support of the bush administration in revamping 
their political and economic system 
baker told the senate foreign relations committee that the 
democratic revolution sweeping eastern europe could be stalled or 
even reversed if we fail to support the principles that brought 
us this far 
baker who will hold talks next week in moscow with foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze and possibly with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev outlined us foreign policy objectives to 
the committee 
the principal items on bakers moscow agenda are accelerating 
arms control agreements seeking a solution to the war in 
afghanistan between the sovietbacked marxist government and 
usarmed moslem fundamentalist rebels and human rights 
we seek a more democratic soviet union where human rights 
gains are made permanent baker said 
he told the committee the administration would offer technical 
cooperation to assist the soviet perestroika program of 
restructuring the countrys sluggish economy 
in short baker said we seek to probe for points of 
mutual advantage with the soviet union turning areas of conflict 
into areas of cooperation wherever possible in this way we will 
benefit ourselves as well as the reformers in moscow 
his testimony followed an announcement by president bush 
wednesday night in his state of the union address that the united 
states is proposing to reduce us and soviet troops in europe to 
225000 each with a subceiling of 195000 in central europe 
that could mean bringing about 80000 american troops home 
a differing view was voiced by sen jesse helms rnc who 
said gorbachev was a colorful and adroit public relations man 
whose concept of reform excludes freedom helms said gorbachev had 
delivered mig fighter jets to cuba and missiles to nicaragua and 
at home had undertaken 15 strategic weapons programs as part of 
a massive military buildup 
baker sounded a note of caution saying the old world of 
dogmatic dictatorships is on its way out but the new world of 
secure prosperous and just democracies is not yet here it will 
not arrive automatically 
if we fail to support the principles that brought us this far 
we could end up living in a future that resembles the past the 
past of cold war and the conflicts that preceded it he said 
in the text of his prepared statement baker criticized the 
tragic case of china as a place where democratic values were 
suppressed however when he read the statement to the committee 
he skipped a reference to china in speaking of governments that 
try to shut out democratic values 
on specific issues elsewhere in the world baker 
said he aimed in trying to set up middle east negotiations to 
fulfill the legitimate political rights of the palestinian 
people 
here baker gave no clues what the administration sought to 
accomplish for palestinians or if he will be able to get the 
negotiations started 
said there would be no cut in us aid to israel and egypt 
together baker said they are due to receive 51 billion for the 
fiscal year that begins oct 1 that represents about 61 percent of 
the us foreign aid budget

premier georgi atanassov and his cabinet 
resigned today an official source said in a development could 
lead to creation of a new government including opposition figures 
for the first time in more than 40 years 
atanassov was a holdover from the era of disgraced leader todor 
zhivkov and had come under increased pressure to resolve bulgarias 
labor strife 
the resignation of atanassov and his 22member cabinet was not 
announced publicly and the source spoke on condition of anonymity 
also today a spokesman for a reformminded alliance in the 
communist party announced that his faction had given up trying to 
change the party from within and would break away to create a 
socialist party the alternative socialist alliance will formally 
create the bulgarian socialist party at a special congress in sofia 
on feb 11 said spokesman nikolai vassilev 
atanassovs resignation had been widely expected because of 
several personal attacks on him during an emergency communist party 
conference under way it was not immediately known when a new 
government would be named 
the president and communist party chief petar mladenov has 
held out the possibility of creating an interim government to share 
power with opposition groups before elections 
however the proposed government has not been made clear 
the opposition union of democratic forces has said the terms and 
power of such an interim cabinet must be clarified before they 
would agree to participate 
opposition spokesman petar beron reiterated that today but his 
comments were made before the report of the cabinets resignation 
until a new government is formed the country will apparently be 
run by mladenov and a rubberstamp parliament 
atanassov a member of the communist party policymaking 
politburo became premier in march 1986 he survived the nov 10 
ouster of zhivkov apparently because he sided with the politburo 
colleagues who engineered the end of the authoritarian leaders 35 
years in power 
but atanassov was not able to come up with an effective solution 
for bulgarias economic problems or escape the shadow of zhivkov 
now under arrest on criminal charges 
bulgaria has been hit during the last two weeks with 
uprecedented labor stoppages by workers demanding better pay 
demonstrators on sunday demanded atanassovs resignation and a 
government of national accord 
teachers walked out as the congress opened tuesday miners who 
struck last week resumed work wednesday but continued negotiations 
with the government 
doctors struck for one hour tuesday two hours wednesday and 
announced plans to quit working for three hours today 
official media carried a report quoting agricultural workers as 
saying they would strike feb 5 unless the state paid adequate 
prices for their crops 
despite zhivkovs ouster bulgarias communists have given up 
relatively little power compared with their comrades elsewhere in 
eastern europe the party is bolstered by its roots in the nations 
politics and by a relatively weak although growing opposition 
but the emergency congress of the communist party which resumed 
today demonstrated the deepening gulf between the hardline and 
reform camps who favor more drastic action to break with the past 
even before the congress it was clear to us because this is a 
lost congress said vassilev a sofia university philosophy and 
anthropology professor 
we knew who the delegates were and how they were elected he 
added it was quite clear for us that a radical change to the 
left would be impossible 
polands communist party suffered a similar division when the 
most radical reformers split from the mainstream at a congress that 
concluded monday 
vassilev predicted that within three months about 150000 of 
the 980000 communist party members in bulgaria would rally around 
the new party 
but the communist party will not only lose these people it 
will also lose people who do not want to stay in any party he 
said 
the new party will have a socialist orientation vassilev said 
adding we seek our roots in the social practice and achievements 
of the socialist movement

a judge refused today to dismiss charges 
against a pregnant woman accused of abusing her unborn child by 
consuming alcohol in spite of an earlier court order 
at issue in the case is whether the legal system should protect 
fetuses from the actions of their mothers 
judge robert denhardts refusal to dismiss the charge against 
diane pfannenstiel 29 was at the start of a preliminary hearing 
that could last two days 
the defense had argued that the child abuse statutes under which 
pfannenstiel was charged do not apply to fetuses 
albany county attorney cal rerucha alleged in the charge filed 
in early january that pfannenstiel who is four to five months 
pregnant consumed alcohol in an excessive amount which she knows 
will cause serious physical injury upon her unborn child 
but mary beth galvan attorney for pfannenstiel believes 
wyomings child abuse laws dont apply to fetuses and that the 
charges are unconstitutional 
whether or not a fetus is defined as a child is a question for 
the legislature to decide not for us galvan said in an 
interview this week 
galvan had asked denhardt to dismiss the case on grounds of 
vagueness 
but she said she was so intrigued with what prompted rerucha to 
charge pfannenstiel that she has subpoenaed him to testify about 
how he reached his decision 
according to court records the charge against pfannenstiel was 
filed two months after another judge ordered her to remain 
alcoholfree 
that judges unusual intervention followed a previous pregnancy 
that produced a baby suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome a 
leading cause of mental retardation and other developmental 
problems according to court records 
robert horowitz associate director of the american bar 
associations center for children and the law in washington said 
he was unaware of any similar cases that have led to convictions 
that have withstood appeal 
drug use particularly cocaine has led to arrests of pregnant 
women or new mothers in some states crack cocaine use by pregnant 
women has led to several arrests in florida on charges of 
delivering cocaine to newborn babies since the first successful 
conviction in august but that case is still on appeal 
some of those watching the case believe the woman should not be 
prosecuted because of an addiction if one exists 
patricia schene director of the american association for 
protecting children in denver said that rather than prosecuting 
pfannenstiel rerucha should try to help her 
shes as much a victim as the child she said 
pfannenstiel was charged after going to police to have her 
husband charged with battery while she was being treated at a 
hospital a blood test revealed she had a blood alcohol level of 
01 percent galvan said that is level considered at which a 
person is considered intoxicated under state law 
asked if pfannenstiel is an alcoholic galvan replied there 
is no diagnosis in the record that i am aware of 
galvan wondered what would happen if pfannenstiel is convicted 
and sentenced to five years in prison and five months from now 
gives birth to a healthy baby 
she said rerucha will be hardpressed to prove his case 
it requires that an actual injury be shown harm has to have 
resulted she said 
rerucha maintained that prosecutors shouldnt have to wait until 
a child is born with defects 
the damage is done by that time he said in an interview

a judge refused today to delay a death 
penalty hearing for a woman convicted of the murder of her 
6weekold daughter after her attorney said she had lost the will 
to live 
madison county circuit judge andy matoesian said he believed 
paula marie sims was capable of proceeding 
the defendant wants to be sentenced to death and is therefore 
unable to assist in her defense argued mrs sims attorney 
donald groshong she is substantially different since her 
conviction 
mrs sims 30 was convicted tuesday in the death of 6weekold 
heather lee sims 
jurors were to hear further arguments today before deciding 
whether to impose the death penalty or a lesser sentence they 
deliberated about two hours wednesday before finding mrs sims 
eligible for the death penalty 
under illinois law prosecutors may seek the death penalty under 
certain circumstances including cases in which the victim is under 
the age of 12 the killing is particularly brutal or when there 
are multiple victims 
groshong asked today that the sentencing hearing be delayed 
until psychiatric evaluations of mrs sims can be made 
she still maintains her innocence but says i dont have any 
reason to go on i dont have any reason to live whether im 
innocent doesnt matter they can go ahead and execute me 
groshong said 
but matoesian said he has no bona fide doubt as to her 
sanity and denied the request he also denied a defense request 
that a new jury be named for the death penalty hearing 
mrs sims of alton contends a masked gunman abducted heather 
lee last year just as her 13dayold firstborn daughter loralei 
was abducted three years earlier no murder charges have been filed 
in loraleis death 
assistant madison county states attorney donald weber argued 
wednesday that the death penalty was warranted in the april 29 
suffocation of heather because the slaying was planned and the 
crime was cruel brutal grossly ruthless and devoid of mercy and 
compassion 
we cannot say the death of this child was premeditated 
prolonged or torturous groshong told the jury in the pecking 
order of evil smothering is usually considered more merciful 
than other forms of killing 
the jury found mrs sims guilty tuesday of firstdegree murder 
obstructing justice and concealing a homicide in heathers death 
she also faces charges of obstruction of justice and concealment of 
a homicide in the death of loralei 
weber said he thought the jury was strongly influenced by 
evidence mrs sims and her husband robert only wanted male 
babies their son randy who turns 2 today remains in the custody 
of sims 37 who has not been charged in either case 
the simses reported heather was abducted april 29 from their 
home in alton her body was found may 3 in a trash barrel across 
the mississippi river in nearby west alton mo an autopsy 
indicated she had been suffocated and her body subsequently frozen 
loralei was reported abducted june 17 1986 from the simses 
former home in brighton a badly decomposed body believed to be 
loraleis was found a week later 150 yards from the house

president bushs call for faster troop cuts in 
europe drew praise in congress and abroad today but house speaker 
thomas s foley said democrats want a greater commitment at home to 
allow the united states to reclaim our place in the world 
democrats are in agreement that we ought to reduce our troops 
in europe i think everyone sees there is a change in need there 
foley said today on nbcs today show 
the question is how are we going to fight the new battles of 
the new decade foley said the challenges of the next decade 
into the next century are much more here at home 
as democrats were not satisfied with a trend that has seen 
this nation drop from first to sixth in standard of living foley 
said wednesday night in the partys official response to bushs 
first state of the union message 
i am heartened by the proposed troop cut senate majority 
leader george j mitchell dmaine said today he added that 
several democrats had been calling for such reductions for months 
only to be rebuffed by the administration 
on domestic issues mitchell said bush has consistently employed 
goodsounding rhetoric in addressing education and just as 
consistently failed to match those words with deeds it will be up 
to congress to supply the deeds to match the presidents rhetoric 
on education 
gennady gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman said 
bushs proposal for deeper troop cuts in central europe was a move 
in the right direction but did not go far enough 
its a good sign that things are changing for the better 
gerasimov said in a briefing in moscow but he said you can 
note in his speech that he needs american troops in europe from 
here to eternity 125000 or about this figure this is not a good 
sign 
in brussels belgium manfred woerner secretarygeneral of the 
north atlantic treaty organization said bushs plan underscore the 
american commitment to maintain significant military forces in 
europe as necessary to alliance security 
these new steps take account of new political developments in 
the east while remaininig consistent with the needs of the 
alliances strategy of deterrence woerner said in a statement 
the allies are on board white house chief of staff john 
sununu said on cbs this morning 
in his speech wednesday night foley promised that democrats 
who control both houses of congress will work with bush wherever 
and whenever we can but will fight the president when necessary 
to protect the people who go to work and pay the taxes 
he scoffed at bushs call for a meager 2 percent rise in 
education spending and said democrats will battle the 
administration this year on legislation dealing with capital gains 
taxes child care and clean air 
sununu this morning criticized foleys comments on proposed 
education spending calling it a perfect example of the quality 
of the criticism thats come forward you had speaker foley on 
there talking about a 2 percent increase sununu said 
maintaining that proposed spending for new programs is up 6 percent 
to 7 percent 
the time has come for america to help herself to rebuild to 
reenergize to reinvigorate our hopes to gather together our 
talents and to reclaim our place in the world foley said 
wednesday night 
but bushs 11thhour addition of the ussoviet troopcut 
proposal was widely lauded by lawmakers who had been deriding his 
new budget just two days earlier 
just when you thought you had a cold war budget boom said 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo im really delighted theres 
hope 
very positive said sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee 
rep les aspin the democratic chairman of the house armed 
services committee said the president should be congratulated 
for the plan trying to negotiate lower limits on forces deployed 
in europe is clearly a good idea said the wisconsin democrat 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the senate 
armed services committee said troop cuts would lessen tensions and 
pave the way for an eventual peace dividend 
sen patrick leahy dvt said that after hearing the speech 
i felt better than i have in years 
this was the real george bush talking about the real issues 
that concern the american people said sen harry reid dnev 
i hope the people around the president dont try to interfere 
with what hes trying to do 
sen mark o hatfield rore said bushs speech was full of 
bold new initiatives on military forces education and the 
environment 
but many democrats found plenty to criticize about bushs 
domestic agenda 
the capital gains cut is the clearest sign of the presidents 
misplaced pririties said sen edward m kennedy dmass 
trickledown economics is not the way to rebuild americas 
strength investing in america does not mean tax cuts for the 
wealthy 
rep charles rangel dny said bushs agenda contains no 
bold initiatives just tinkering and little to reverse the 
drastic trend to leave behind a vast portion of america 
on social security the presidents position is going to be 
clearly the only acceptable political position saying that 
nothing affecting benefits can be considered said house 
republican whip newt gingrich of georgia 
there was applause for bushs statement that the last thing we 
need to do is mess around with social security but lawmakers 
wondered about such specifics as the budget deficit 
youre for motherhood and apple pie when you oppose cutting 
social security benefits said sen charles robb dva but on 
the budget deficit bushs credibility may take a beating robb 
aid 
bushs announcement of six national goals for improving 
education was praised but rep augustus f hawkins dcalif said 
it wasnt backed up with the genuine commitment of money 
hawkins chairman of the house education and labor committee 
said education took one step forward two steps back in the 
bush message 
and rep john lewis dga said we arent going to do all 
these things without additional sources of revenue

from spain in 1981 should be treated the same as japanese swords 
claiming the weapons used in the 193639 spanish civil war are 
valuable as art 
a lower court had rejected that argument 
a law adopted after world war ii provides for up to 15 years in 
prison for illegal possession of swords and firearms 
but a sword and gun registration law was adopted in 1950 to 
protect culturally valuable objects which must be registered with 
the education ministry a ministry official said 21 million guns 
and swords have been registered for private ownership 
the swords must be japanese and made in traditional ways the 
guns must have been produced in japan before 1867

disaster assistance applications from 
hurricane hugo victims continue to pour into the federal emergency 
management agency at the rate of 100 a day 
what is so amazing is how long it is taking for the public to 
come in for help fema spokesman frank mosco said normally 
following a hurricane we are in and out of a site in four weeks 
five weeks tops 
just monday our sumter office received first applications for 
three destroyed homes and they were all uninsured 
it has been four months since hugo slammed into south carolina 
killing 29 people and causing an estimated 59 billion in damage 
the agency has distributed 450 million in relief funds to 61000 
applicants 
mosco attributes the delay in filing for aid to the widespread 
destruction in rural areas illiteracy and victims unfounded fears 
that their social service benefits would be cut if they received 
disaster relief 
despite the continued requests for aid fema is scheduled to 
close its two field offices in sumter and charleston within a week 
it also will stop taking applications over its telephone hot line 
in a month but the hot line will remain in operation to answer

a hungarian pastor who recently 
risked his life on a mission to romania says the work hes doing 
during a brief stay in the united states is even more important 
the rev bertalan tamas arrived jan 6 for a fiveweek visit 
sponsored by the memorial presbyterian church of grosse pointe a 
detroit suburb he is a pastor of the reformed church of hungary 
and an executive committee member of the world alliance of reformed 
churches 
tamas in an interview monday said his message to americans is 
this although the dictators in eastern europe may be gone the 
struggle to build democracy in the east bloc is just beginning 
americans can sometimes forget i must use this chance to 
describe what happened in eastern europe in the past so it wont 
happen again he said referring to the more than 40 years of 
oneparty rule that devastated the economies of hungary poland 
east germany czechoslovakia bulgaria and romania 
the church whether roman catholic reformed or orthodox is 
one of few stable institutions remaining in the east bloc after the 
demise of the regions communist parties tamas said thus the 
church will play a pivotal role in the transition from 
totalitarianism to democracy 
he cited the roman catholic church in poland which was a major 
force along with the solidarity trade union movement in ending 
communist rule in that country 
another responsibility the church faces is that people expect it 
to provide material assistance as well as spiritual guidance said 
tamas 49 who learned english in great britain 
we need help from our friends in the united states he said 
churches in hungary for example are once again being allowed to 
run schools and hospitals but they cannot do it properly because 
they no longer have the means to do so 
in late december the synod or governing body of the hungarian 
reformed church dispatched tamas to romania which then was in the 
early stages of a violent revolution that ousted dictator nicolae 
ceausescu 
tamas was seeking information about the rev lazlo tokes an 
ethnic hungarian reformed pastor whose arrest in the western city 
of timisora was believed to have sparked the romanian revolt 
rumors that tokes had been executed proved false and tamas found 
him alive and well 
tamas already had been threatened with retribution by the 
ceausescu regime for his role in helping 40000 romanian refugees 
settle in hungary 
because we knew the situation was horrible in romania we took 
the risk tamas said i also felt i had to express solidarity 
with the rev tokes 
tamas plans to travel to new york louisville ky princeton 
nj and decatur ga before returning to hungary on feb 12

governments must not let the dramatic 
events in eastern europe dim their concern for africa and other 
poor regions of the world pope john paul ii said thursday 
there should be no barrier to solidarity among nations he 
told diplomats after an eightday tour of the sahel region the 
monumental changes in eastern europe should not turn attention away 
from the third world and the african continent in particular 
that was a recurring theme on his trip to five countries of the 
impoverished zone just south of the sahara desert 
john paul said in guineabissau that grinding poverty 
compromises freedom in africa 
of an audience in burkina faso the pope asked how would 
history judge a generation that having all the means to feed the 
earths population refused to do so in fratricidal indifference 
he spoke not only to the consciences of rich nations but also 
of the need for cooperation within africa 
when it comes to movement of people and goods of investment 
in training and research and rational planning of agriculture and 
industry understanding among men can no longer be thwarted by 
borders that didnt even exist in the time of their ancestors 
john paul declared in ndjamena capital of chad 
in a thinly veiled reference to the autocratic behavior of some 
african leaders john paul said those in power should be humble 
enough to acknowledge their own errors and the abuse and injustice 
that often result 
it is more important to work for peace and the wellbeing of 
all people than to bolster personal prestige he said 
john paul urged urged african organizations to coordinate their 
efforts for the good of all member nations 
the preparation together of concrete projects will enable them 
to form a common front in the bargaining with donor and lender 
nations and institutions he said 
sustained development in africa requires peace he said 
alluding once again to the role of political leaders in the 
oftenfratricidal conflicts within nations 
i have in mind ethiopia sudan people who are the subject of 
racial discrimination in their own lands and others who suffer from 
endemic ethnic rivalries that sometimes lead to violent 
confrontations the pope said 
in chad john paul returned again and again to the theme of 
reconciliation in the nation of 55 million where more than a 
decade of civil conflict destroyed the economy and produced a young 
generation deprived of regular education 
meeting with moslem leaders at a dusty racetrack under a blazing 
midday sun he said after the trials of the past chadians must 
now concentrate on their own development 
the pope put in a word for human rights which often is at the 
bottom of a poor nations priority list 
it is well to remember that development is measured not only 
in economic terms but in respect for the person in his whole human 
condition he said 
john pauls sixth pilgrimage to africa also included stops in 
cape verde and mali

president fw de klerk is to 
outline his plans for reform friday in a speech that many south 
africans hope will finally signal the end of apartheid and set 
their country on the road to peace 
expectation has ballooned around the world that de klerks 
speech will at least announce the release of nelson mandela south 
africas most famous black leader clearing the way for 
negotiations on solving the nations problems 
de klerk who already has dented the edifice of apartheid has 
pledged to create a new dispensation in south africa whites 
and blacks must solve their differences peacefully and avoid what 
he says could be a race war that would last for 80 years 
but political observers are warning that de klerks speech in 
cape town at the start of parliament on friday wont be the end of 
white rule there are no signs de klerk intends to surrender power 
or accept the democracy that is the goal of all groups fighting 
apartheid 
white rule in south africa is not going to collapse like the 
berlin wall and the communist regimes of eastern europe observers 
say the quest for a solution to south africas problems is more 
likely to resemble the tortured search for peace in the middle east 
and northern ireland 
the government is in full control of the country unrest is 
minimal and the african national congress the main black 
opposition group admits its military campaign against white rule 
has been largely ineffective 
while de klerk does want to ease tensions some critics say the 
president lacks a definite plan and is feeling his way playing for 
time with moderate reforms to blunt domestic and international 
opposition and postpone any major confrontation 
it has not been shown that mr de klerk has either the vision 
or the courage to make this moment on friday a moment for 
historic importance said rev allan boesak an antiapartheid 
leader 
the government rejects any suggestion of black majority rule and 
says the interests of the white minority must be ensured de klerk 
has given no sign of what he wants for the future beyond stressing 
that whites must have veto power in any future state 
black leaders say de klerk must meet a number of basic 
expectations to clear the way for talks with the anc including 
lifting the state of emergency used to suppress dissent release 
mandela legalize the anc and other outlawed opposition groups and 
allow exiled black leaders to return 
critics say that de klerk as leader of south africas afrikaners 
cannot surrender white minority rule and accept black majority 
rule the afrikaners whites of dutch descent have been ingrained 
with a sense of racial superiority for 350 years that makes it 
impossible for them to share power with nonwhites they say 
helen suzman who opposed the national party throughout her 36 
years in parliament said de klerk was elected by the afrikaners 
and his mandate is to protect the whites interests above all other 
considerations 
he would not interpret his mandate for reform as a mandate to 
jeopardize the political position of the white minority or to 
threaten its survival she said in a recent lecture 
ms suzman said she believes de klerk will end the worst aspects 
of the apartheid laws that deprive blacks of rights and excise 
much of the overt brutality inherent in the apartheid system 
de klerk who took office in august has freed several elderly 
black political prisoners and eased restrictions on antigovernment 
protests after years of repression he also has called for repeal 
of the law that allows segregation of municipal facilities 
but the government has said it will not desegregate schools 
hospitals and other public facilities and there are few signs that 
many white south africans are ready to share power or amenities 
with nonwhites 
nontheless the government apparently hopes a moderate stance 
would ease political tension and encourage some black groups to 
take a softer line that could lead to a compromise in which white 
interests will be safeguarded 
the government also is eager to end or weaken the economic 
boycotts imposed by many western nations to protest apartheid the 
boycotts along with domestic economic problems have sent the 
economy into a tailspin and created hard times for many whites 
de klerk hopes to ease the economic crunch by offering reforms 
to ease international sanctions and restore confidence in the 
economy by attracting new foreign investment

president bushs exacting education goals for 
americas schools came under fire today from educators and 
democrats in congress demanding to know where the money would come 
from to make us children the worlds best in math and science 
you cant become the education president by proposing a 
meager 2 percent increase in the education budget said house 
speaker thomas s foley after bush unveiled his goals in the state 
of the union address wednesday night 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said there is a yawning gap between the rhetoric of 
president bushs education speeches and the funding levels he 
offers in his budget 
but education secretary lauro f cavazos in a spirited defense 
of bushs approach said adding another billion and another 
billion is not going to solve the education deficit 
its not a matter of dollars cavazos said at a white house 
briefing 
nevertheless he said his departments proposed 246 billion 
budget for fiscal 1991 is the largest education budget that this 
nation has had and includes a very healthy 62 percent 
increase in discretionary programs 
asked why the overall growth was less than the 3 percent that 
the whole federal budget rose cavazos said his department was 
paying lower interest rates on student loans 
the way that you really become the education president is 
to change the educational system so its a positive system its an 
effective system said cavazos who said real spending on the 
schools surged 26 percent after inflation in the 1980s 
bush in his address unveiled six goals hammered out in concert 
with the nations governors they include slashing the dropout rate 
and making us children the best in the world in math and science 
by the turn of the century 
real improvement in our schools is not simply a matter of 
spending more it is a matter of asking more expecting more of 
our schools our teachers of our kids and our parents and 
ourselves bush said 
some education leaders and democrats were not impressed 
richard miller executive director of the american association 
of school administrators said he was encouraged by the first 
draft of the goals but we want to get beyond rhetoric his 
budget proposal for education is at odds with the goals 
nobody could be against education or providing a home for the 
homeless but there was nothing there except generalities rep 
robert matsui dcalif said after bushs speech 
rep pat williams dmont said american parents and 
students need to have explained to them how is a 2 percent 
increase for the pentagon a major cut while a 2 percent increase in 
education is a major increase 
but sen john warner rva praised the presidents math and 
science goals saying they could give the nation a technological 
edge and an economic edge to compete worldwide 
here are what bush called americas education goals 
1 by the year 2000 every child must start school ready to 
learn 
2 the united states must increase the high school graduation 
rate to no less than 90 percent 
3 in critical subjects at the 4th 8th and 12th grades we 
must assess our students performance 
4 by the year 2000 us students must be first in the world 
in math and science achievement 
5 every american adult must be a literate worker and 
citizen 
6 every school must offer the kind of disciplined environment 
that makes it possible for our kids to learn and every school in 
america must be drugfree 
he unveiled them four months after agreeing with the governors 
at an education summit in charlottesville va to draft the first 
performance goals for the nations schools 
he saluted four of the governors who spearheaded the joint 
effort and who were on hand to watch the speech from the house 
gallery terry branstad of iowa bill clinton of arkansas carroll 
campbell of south carolina and booth gardner of washington 
cavazos has said american pupils achievement levels are 
intolerably low 
he and other experts cite studies showing 
south korean 13yearolds finished first and americans last in 
a math test given to pupils in six countries last year 
fewer than 1 percent of us students take physics and 
chemistry while up to 25 percent of 18yearolds in canada and 
norway take the two subjects for two years each 
nearly 30 percent of american teengers now drop out of high 
school although some return to get their diploma or equivalency 
degree minnesota traditionally has been the only state with a 90 
percent graduation rate

the bush administration stepped up its verbal 
attack on lebanese gen michel aoun on thursday demanding he 
relinquish his remaining hold on power in lebanon and appealing to 
the supreme court to evict his envoy in washington 
however justice william j brennan rejected an emergency 
request in which government lawyers said ambassador abdallah 
bouhabibs continued occupation of lebanons embassy is causing 
increasingly serious adverse consequences for the nations foreign 
relations 
the state department is seeking bouhabibs eviction at the 
request of lebanons new government led by president elias hrawi 
who was elected in november with the backing of the 22nation arab 
league the united states recognized the hrawi government last 
november and has been conducting its business with a 
hrawiappointed ambassador rather than with bouhabib 
aoun who controls lebanons christian sector with about 1 
million residents refuses to recognize the hrawi government and 
continues to hold out with 20000 troops at the presidential palace 
in beirut 
over the past three days his forces have been engaged in fierce 
battles with a small rival christian militia for control of the 
sector dozens have been killed and wounded 
in beirut aoun blamed the united states for the fighting 
america has engineered this collision but we shall surmount it 
soon he said in a statement on his television station he did 
not elaborate 
as for the legal struggle over the embassy in washington aoun 
and bouhabib last week obtained a temporary restraining order from 
us district judge harold h greene blocking the eviction 
a federal appeals court tuesday refused to set aside greenes 
order and on thursday brennan also refused 
judge greene is expected to make his final ruling in the dispute 
this week 
in the emergency request denied by brennan bush administration 
lawyers said greenes restraining order is utterly without legal 
support and intrudes into the core powers of the president to 
receive ambassadors recognize foreign governments and conduct 
foreign relations 
noting that the hrawi government has asked that bouhabib be 
removed the request submitted to brennan said the united states 
considers itself obligated to render that assistance immediately 
in a strong statement regarding the fighting in lebanon the 
state department called on aoun to step aside immediately 
this latest outburst must be laid at the seat of gen aoun 
the statement said it follows his earlier outrageous decision to 
cut the water to west beirut and to clamp down on the press 
gen aoun must realize that his bellicose behavior does not 
advance the interests of the christians or any other community but 
only benefits those who want to see lebanon continue in anarchy and 
turmoil the state department said we reiterate our call for 
gen aoun to step aside and to do it now

defense secretary dick cheney predicted today 
that the soviets will likely withdraw from eastern europe by the 
middle of the decade but warned against any drastic changes in 
us strategy 
i do believe caution is still in order until we have these 
agreements signed sealed and delivered cheney told a 
congressional panel in his first appearance since president bushs 
surprise announcement of deeper cuts in the levels of us and 
soviet combat troops in central europe 
the presidents proposal for the ongoing conventional arms 
control talks in vienna calls for 195000 troops for each 
superpower a reaction to the tumultuous changes in eastern europe 
and the apparently diminishing soviet threat 
the likelihood of a warsaw pact attack into nato these days is 
fairly remote cheney told the senate armed services committee 
the defense secretary said the united states can begin to plan 
for the possibility that the soviets will be out of eastern 
europe or virtually out of eastern europe five years hence that 
the governments of eastern europe will be democraticallyelected 
noncommunist regimes 
i think thats a very real possibility cheney said 
at the white house chief of staff john sununu rejected any 
suggestion that the troopcut plan was intended to prop up a 
politically weakened gorbachev as he faces a critical meeting next 
week of the communist party central committee 
if the cutting of troops would have been an advantage for mr 
gorbachev then mr gorbachev would probably have announced them 
earlier himself thereby getting both the advantage the pressuring 
of the united states to do it and whatever international political 
benefits that come in that direction sununu said so that was 
not part of the consideration 
although bush is calling for a drastic troop reduction 
uncertainty still exists over the final number of us troops and 
equipment that will remain in europe the defense secretary said 
we have not finalized the work within the nato alliance about 
how we will allocate the cuts within the alliance he said 
there are significant questions as yet unanswered about what nato 
strategy will be like in a post conventional forces agreement 
environment 
the troop reduction plan drew praise from the ranking members of 
the senate armed services committee 
i applaud the president for his new proposal said sen sam 
nunn dga the panels chairman it is much more relevant to 
the changes in eastern europe and the budget at home 
sen john warner of virginia the committees ranking 
republican called bushs initiative a bold new move 
cheney reiterated his warning against the united states 
abandoning its plans to modernize its strategic forces noting that 
the soviet union is continuing to upgrade its class of hightech 
weapons 
the defense secretary still faces complaints from lawmakers over 
his 2921 billion military budget 
cries of political foul play surround the proposed list of base 
closures and realignments with many lawmakers arguing that 
significant reductions in bigticket strategic weapons are the 
proper response to a lessening soviet threat 
the budget calls for five b2 stealth bombers at a cost of 55 
billion and an increase of nearly 1 billion in spending on the 
strategic defense initiative to 45 billion 
those totals have raised red flags on capitol hill where the 
chairman of the house armed services committee rep les aspin 
dwis predicted that it was highly unlikely that the 
administration would get what it is seeking 
the budget would continue financing of two landbased nuclear 
missiles with 28 billion to fund railbasing for the 
multiplewarhead mx missile and 202 million for the truckbased 
midgetman missile 
the plan also calls for canceling some 20 small weapons systems 
such as the marine corps v22 osprey and the armys m1 tank in 
an attempt to save 29 billion

mayor bill stirling wants to buy foxes from 
a wyoming fox ranch in order to set the animals free 
but the fur farms owner calls the scheme crazy 
they wouldnt last three days in the wild these foxes were 
born and raised in a cage for generations they couldnt find 
food said jack hendrickson owner of arrow fur ranch outside 
buffalo wyo 
stirling has sponsored a city ballot question to ban the 
commercial sale of wildanimal furs in aspen residents vote on the 
measure feb 13 
stirlings crusade which has fueled a recall campaign against 
him drew the attention last month of dexter butterfield who lives 
next door to the fur ranch in wyoming 
stirling and his wife katharine thalberg founder of the aspen 
society for animal rights visited wyoming at the invitation of 
butterfield who has complained about foul odors and screams and 
yelps from the ranch 
the reality of that fox farm was useful in educating our 
electorate here about the realities of life for a wild animal on a 
fur ranch stirling said this week theyre in these miserable 
little cages all their lives 
then we thought what about freeing the animals 
since then stirling has sent offers to hendrickson seeking to 
buy out his inventory of 68 silver foxes at 50 to 100 per animal 
thalbergs group aims to help defray the cost by selling 100 fox 
futures 
a rocky mountain humane society veterinarian is working with 
wildlife biologists on a release plan stirling said 
id talk to him for 100 per animal but i dont expect to 
hear from him again said hendrickson and he wants me to agree 
not to raise more foxes for a year but i wouldnt even deal

at the academy awards wants an antipornography group to quit 
quoting its founder 
our greatest natural resource is the minds of our children 
walt disney once said 
the greater orlando coalition against pornography used that 
quotation in a pamphlet outlining the groups purpose last week 
the group received a letter from anne nielsen a disney attorney 
asking them to delete any reference to disney from the brochure 
she said the quotation conveys to the public the impression 
that there is an association or connection with the walt disney 
co 
but the coalitions executive director don pinkston says its 
all a misunderstanding and he hopes to settle the issue with disney 
the groups lawyer darryl bloodworth defended the use of the 
quote 
mr disney was a public figure and that simply was a quote of 
a public figure much as the newspaper quotes public figures all 
the time he said 
but disney spokesman charles ridgway disagreed saying the group 
was not a newspaper and the company owns the rights to the name of 
walt disney 
in recent years disney has threatened legal action when it 
believed its property rights over disney names and charaters were 
being violated 
last year a south florida daycare center had to remove wall 
paintings of disney characters the academy awards producers were 
rebuked for using the snow white character without permission and a 
kissimmee gift shop using the name mickies was challenged

east germanys communist premier today urged 
talks with west germany toward an eventual united fatherland 
that would be independent of military blocs and governed by a joint 
parliament in berlin 
the two germanys must work out a common approach to 
reunification to calm the unease of their european neighbors 
premier hans modrow said at a news conference in which he unveiled 
his plan for unification 
the communists beset by a crumbling economy and a damaging 
westward exodus of thousands of east germans until recently had 
opposed talk of reunification 
this week for the first time they endorsed the concept and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev softened his view calling a 
united germany inevitable 
modrow said he could give no time frame for reunification 
because it depends on the pace of european unity and the attitudes 
of germans in both states 
he said he would push for a slower tempo in intergerman 
relations to avoid instability and called for an interim 
confederation with west germany that could work out a measured and 
logical program for growing together 
germany should once again become a united fatherland of all 
citizens of the german nation modrow said responsibility 
caution and understanding are demanded in order to ensure that 
there is never any danger to the lives and wellbeing of 
neighbors 
modrow called for negotiations with bonn soon to devise a joint 
plan on reunification but made clear that he had not previously 
discussed his views with west german chancellor helmut kohl 
reacting to modrows proposal kohl said he was ready to discuss 
reunification steps immediately after a new government takes over 
in east germany following march elections but he rejected the idea 
of military neutrality 
such a proposal contradicts the logic of the paneuropean 
process of unification kohl said at a news conference in bonn 
he said a single german state in the heart of europe could not 
afford to be isolated 
american and west european allies have indicated that they would 
accept reunification as long as germany stays within the nato 
alliance 
but east germany is host to about twothirds of the soviet 
unions 600000 troops in central europe making the state shaken 
by democratic upheaval the kremlins most crucial defense partner 
in the sevennation warsaw pact 
the kremlin has said german reunification must occur within the 
european framework meaning that divisions would have to be erased 
between the two rival military blocs nato and the warsaw pact 
modrow said elections in both germanys would be necessary to 
seat a joint parliament in berlin and he indicated that in his 
view joint executive bodies could also function in certain 
areas 
modrow said both states must step by step proceed toward 
neutrality 
his plan appeared to reject a unity plan offered wednesday by 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher who envisioned 
west germany remaining loyal to nato alliance while making what is 
currently east germany neutral 
reflecting bonns optimism about eventual reunification 
genscher today praised as an important step forward president 
bushs proposal for sharp reductions in us and soviet forces in 
central europe 
bushs proposal wednesday night in his first state of the union 
address to limit each superpower to 195000 troops in the region 
also was welcomed by west germanys defense minister gerhard 
stoltenberg 
he called it a balanced combination of disarmament policy and 
unequivocal recognition of the wests defense readiness and 
alliance solidarity 
in a speech to the evangelical institute in tutzing near 
munich genscher outlined what he sees as a security guarantee for 
moscow and a compromise that could appease washington as well 
genscher suggested that the territory now constituting west 
germany could remain in the north atlantic treaty organization 
while the area east of the elbe river east germany would not host 
any military facilities 
gorbachev acknowledged in talks with modrow on tuesday that a 
single germany likely is inevitable but cautioned that a headlong 
plunge toward reunification could destabilize europe 
 
gorbachevs top adviser on german affairs told west german 
television late wednesday that the soviet union considers 
neutrality the best path to a united germany 
nikolai portugalov told the wdr network that weapons reductions 
already under way in both german states are tantamount to an 
acceptance of military neutrality 
bushs troops reduction proposal would most directly affect west 
germany as about 250000 of the united states 305000 
europeanbased troops are deployed in west germany 
support for union with prosperous west germany has surged among 
east germans in recent weeks as the countrys political and 
economic crisis have deepened weekly prodemocracy rallies in 
leipzig and other major cities have taken on a clear 
proreunification atmosphere recently

east germanys communist premier on thursday 
appealed for negotiations with west germany to forge a united 
fatherland that eventually would be neutral and governed from 
berlin 
west german chancellor helmut kohl welcomed the call to discuss 
reunification but rejected the call for military neutrality 
such a proposal contradicts the logic of the paneuropean 
process of unification kohl said he added that a single german 
state in the heart of europe could not afford to be isolated 
east german premier hans modrow called for a reasonable time 
horizon for reunification to be mutually determined apparently 
hoping to gain control over the galloping pace of events drawing 
the two germanys together 
his announcement marked a turnaround in the communistdominated 
governments position on the german question the east berlin 
leadership had previously resisted reunification efforts as 
premature and destabilizing 
but mounting economic woes and an accelerating exodus of 
thousands of skilled workers to the west are forcing the nations 
interim leaders to address public pressure for a merger with 
prosperous west germany 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev also has softened his view 
on the issue earlier this week he said reunification was 
inevitable 
at a news conference to announce his plan modrow rejected 
suggestions that he was angling to win votes for the communist 
party which is threatened by opposition groups in east germanys 
first free elections set for march 18 
kohl flew to west berlin to meet with east german opposition 
leaders to discuss possible campaign assistance for their challenge 
of the communists he said he would discuss reunification with the 
new government elected in march 
modrow cautioned that german reunification must be carried out 
carefully to avoid stirring up fears among neighboring nations that 
a powerful german state would rise and threaten them 
nothing can occur that runs counter to the process of 
overcoming the division of europe or that would create new 
dangers he said 
he titled his proposal for germany a united fatherland a 
slogan touted repeatedly by reunification advocates at weekly 
rallies in leipzig and other major cities 
germany should once again become a united fatherland of all 
citizens of the german nation he said responsibility caution 
and understanding are demanded in order to ensure that there is 
never any danger to the lives and wellbeing of neighbors 
modrows plan calls for an initial treaty community to draw 
the two german states closer together then a confederation status 
that would create some joint executive and parliamentary committees 
the final step to be endorsed in a national referendum would 
seat a joint parliament and government in berlin and draft a joint 
constitution 
modrow did not make say what would happen to bonn the west 
german capital that has endured a provisional status through 40 
years of hope for an eventual return to berlin 
modrow made clear that the unified german state he envisions 
must be free of ties to both military blocs 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher on wednesday 
proposed a compromise that he suggested would provide a security 
guarantee for the kremlin which depends heavily on east germany as 
its front line against the wests nato alliance 
genscher proposed that the territory now constituting west 
germany remain loyal to nato while the area east of the elbe 
river east germany be militarily neutral 
us ambassador to west germany vernon walters said loyalty to 
nato was one of the conditions for german reunification but he 
left unclear whether it would also include the military integration 
into the alliance of what is now east germany walters made the 
remarks in a speech in stuttgart 
about twothirds of the 565000 soviet troops deployed in 
eastern europe are based in east germany 
likewise west germany is host to most of the 305000 us 
troops stationed in central europe to defend against a possible 
attack by the sovietled warsaw pact 
president bushs proposal wednesday for deep cuts in those 
forces down to 195000 for each superpower drew praise in both 
germanys 
kohl heralded the white house initiative as the right signal 
at the right time and said he considered the call for sharp 
reductions a pathmark to a new european security structure 
east germany also welcomed the proposal and expects it to help 
lead to an agreement at vienna arms talks to reduce conventional 
forces in europe government spokesman wolfgang meyer said

officials records of ice conditions and communications between 
hazelwood and the coast guard 
anchorage superior court judge karl johnstone heard arguments 
this morning on the requests but said he would not rule until 
friday at the earliest jury selection resumed after the hearing on 
the complex arguments 
the coast guard claiming sovereign immunity as a federal 
organization has said it cannot be forced to provide information 
for a state court proceeding 
but hazelwoods attorneys said they need the information for his 
defense and that it has been given to state prosecutors johnstone 
said that before ruling on hazelwoods arguments he would attempt 
to sort out exactly what information had been provided to 
prosecutors 
a companion defense request argued before johnstone today asks 
that information about the sobriety test hazelwood failed after the 
crash be prohibited as evidence if the coast guard is not required 
to provide the details

candidates through peremptory challenges they used six challenges 
wednesday 
those rejected in that manner include a former exxon employee

the department of housing and urban 
development said today it has suspended a california company and 
more than 40 affiliates because of evidence of irregular 
activities 
the companies which together control some 50000 federally 
assisted housing units and are among the largest subsidized housing 
landlords in the country denied any wrongdoing and accused hud of 
acting vindictively 
hud suspended the companies last friday notifying them in a 
letter that department officials made available today it was 
addressed to the santa monicabased housing resources management 
inc but also applies to nearly four dozen related development 
companies 
among the related companies is the parent enterprise associated 
financial corp also of santa monica housing resources management 
is one of the companies that manages properties controlled by afc 
and its affiliates 
the action came as hud at the direction of secretary jack kemp 
continues a departmentwide review prompted by disclosures last 
year of mismanagement and influencepeddling during the tenure of 
former secretary samuel r pierce jr 
the department of housing and urban development has 
information indicating irregularities of a serious nature 
concerning housing resources management incs dealings with the 
government hud assistant secretary c austin fitts said in a 
letter addressed to deane earl ross hrm president the 
department has been informed that hrm and its affiliates are under 
investigation by the government 
an investigation alone is grounds for hud to place a company on 
suspension department officials said the letter said hud also had 
adequate evidence that hrm had been involved in irregular 
activities at properties it manages in oklahoma the district of 
columbia and new orleans 
hud alleged the company had made or caused to be made requests 
for subsidies for vacant apartments that it misused reserve funds 
and security deposits and that it caused a false repair invoice to 
be submitted to the government 
kemp visited the washington property tyler house shortly after 
taking over hud and pronounced conditions at the development 
scandalous fitts letter said hrm had misused reserve funds at 
tyler house 
hud previously had suspended afc and its affiliates from 
hudrelated business in just the washington and oklahoma areas 
afc is controlled by a bruce rozet a prominent democratic 
party fundraiser who is often relied on by congress for advice on 
housing policy afc has specialized in taking over deteriorating 
housing developments and those with major drug infestation 
it has had several disputes with hud over the past decade and 
in late 1987 a hud committee voted to prevent afc and its 
affiliates from buying additional hudassisted properties but the 
committee reversed itself after fitts predecessor former 
assistant secretary thomas demery told the committee he did not 
favor the sanctions

rep gus savage dill said today the house 
ethics committee has dismissed a complaint that he sexually 
assaulted a peace corps worker in zaire 
savage a black chicago democrat blamed allegations against him 
on a racist attack by white government officials and 
whiteowned news media 
the house committee on standards of official conduct said 
wednesday that it had finished its preliminary investigation 
against savage but did not immediately issue its findings and 
refused to reveal its conclusions 
committee spokesman mark davis would not comment on savages 
remarks made in a house floor speech 
savage denied a report in the chicago tribune that the committee 
issued a letter of reproval against him the mildest sanction 
available to the panel a house source with knowledge of the 
investigation also said no letter of reproval was being issued 
the newspaper quoted rep john myers of indiana the ranking 
committee republican as saying the panel clearly disapproves 
of savages actions and believes he used bad judgment 
when the ethics committee finishes a preliminary inquiry it can 
charge a member of congress with specific violations or it can 
simply end the case without proceeding further in ending an 
investigation without charges for example because of lack of 
evidence it can criticize a lawmakers behavior 
in another ethics case the committee said it is dismissing a 
complaint filed against rep roy dyson dmd more than a year ago 
by republicans in his maryland district the panel wrote him a 
twoparagraph letter wednesday saying the complaint had been 
considered and dismissed 
republicans in dysons district asked the committee on sept 26 
1988 to investigate allegations that he violated house rules the 
complaint filed a few weeks before dyson was narrowly reelected 
in 1988 cited the lawmakers fundraising activities and the 
operation of his office 
i particularly urge my black colleagues to publicly stand up 
to this racist attack in order that our white colleagues who 
choose to can stand with us savage said he said that 
sensational exaggerations of the incident exploded on white 
television and in white newspapers and contended he and other 
black leaders have experienced racist viciousness at the 
hands of the white american mass media justice department and 
the fbi 
the committee considered allegations that savage assaulted the 
female peace corps volunteer while on an official trip to zaire 
last march 
the worker contended savage fondled her for more than two hours 
in the back of a chauffeurdriven embassy car in kinshasa the 
capital of zaire according to several government officials who 
confirmed an account originally published in the washington post 
three of savages democratic colleagues reps patricia 
schroeder of colorado matthew mchugh of new york and barney frank 
of massachusetts formally requested the ethics investigation 
believe it or not among these selfappointed guardians of 
personal morality was one who since has admitted keeping and 
prostituting a homosexual savage said as for the other two 
socalled white liberals their sensitivity to racism and their 
respect for fairness must be questioned 
frank dmass has said he is homosexual the ethics committee 
is conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations by a male 
prostitute that frank allowed a prostitution ring to operate from 
his home and that the lawmaker had sex with the prostitute in the 
house gym 
frank has admitted a sexual relationship with the prostitute 
but denied allowing a prostitution ring to operate in his home and 
having sex in the house gym 
dan buck an aide to ms schroeder said he had no comment 
spokesmen for the other two lawmakers were not immediately 
available for comment 
savage said the ethics committee after a preliminary 
examination of witnesses apparently decided that the evidence was 
insufficient even to warrant further investigation not even a slap 
on the wrist 
savage said that if anyone was honestly offended during the 
trip to zaire it was the american state department because i 
have persuasively opposed our neocolonialist foreign policy all 
over africa and in many other third world nations

doubters beware like other weather 
lore punxsutawney phil americas bestknown and bestkept 
woodchuck isnt entirely hogwash according to folklorists 
a great many folk beliefs have a certain logic behind them it 
may not be scientifically verifiable but theyre often not 
completely random and i think this is one of them said erika 
brady assistant professor in programs in folk studies at western

if youre a groundhog or a person and you come out of your 
warm snug haven that youve made for the winter and get fooled by 
the sunlight into thinking its spring youre going to be in 
trouble clark said so it says the groundhog is not fooled 
i think its no coincidence the spring equinox comes about six 
weeks after groundhog day 
the legend actually has roots in christianity groundhog day 
falls on feb 2 also the christian holiday of candlemas when the 
infant jesus first was taken to the temple an old scottish couplet 
claims if candlemas be fair therell be two winters in the 
year

secretary of state james a baker iii proposed 
thursday that world leaders build relations rooted in trust and 
in love and in understanding and said his own life had improved 
when he stopped trying to play god 
baker said he had to learn that god loves me even as i fail to 
become the man that he wants me to be 
uncharacteristically personal baker gave the keynote remarks to 
the national prayer breakfast sponsored by congress he was given a 
standing ovation 
president bush also spoke briefly and vice president dan quayle 
read a new testament passage bush proclaimed his conviction that 
the 1990s will be the decade of the rebirth of faith and 
hope 
baker one of president bushs closest friends and advisers 
usually maintains a genial but reserved demeanor 
he said that during nine years in highlevel administration 
posts he has found that power does not bring fulfullment 
i found early on that having a position of power really 
doesnt bring the fulfillment that many people think it does he 
said inner security and true real fulfilment come by faith it 
doesnt come by wielding power in a town where power is king 
he told the audience of legislators and ambassadors that 
spiritual values are important in the pursuit of world peace 
the bible tells us that where the spirit of the lord is there 
is liberty so my friends i believe that as leaders we can build 
relationships around the world that are rooted in trust and love 
and understanding and i believe that we can go beyond rhetoric to 
discover concrete ways to express this reality 
baker characterized himself as just one person genuinely 
struggling to put faith into practice in my life 
he recounted an instance several years ago when i was really 
struggling with a particular problem he said he found strength 
in praying about it with his wife susan and realizing that he had 
to turn the problem over to god 
susan helped me to see that i really needed to stop trying to 
play god and turn the matter over to faith 
the 59yearold secretary also said he meets regularly for 
fellowship with a group of men he described as very normal guys 
who just happen to hold positions of power and influence in 
washington 
power of course can be intoxicating it can be addictive 
and few doubt that power tends to corrupt and absolute power 
corrupts absolutely 
over these last nine years i have had opportunities to 
participate in the exercise of more power than i ever would have 
imagined i have felt the weight of responsibility that that brings 
and i have to admit to you as well that i have felt the temptations 
that are attendant to it he said 
but power is fleeting he said noting how quickly eminent 
people lose the trappings of prestige when they lose their 
positions 
having a position of power does not bring inner security or 
fulfillment that comes only i think by developing a personal 
relationship with god which for me is personified by jesus 
christ 
baker said his journey of faith began when he started 
reading the bible 
he also talked of the importance of friendship and told how bush 
and his wife barbara had helped him through the painful period 
before and after the death of his first wife mary who died of 
cancer in 1969

the soviet military commandant expressed 
hope thursday that by midfebruary troops could begin returning 
home and authorities could lift a curfew imposed after violent 
ethnic clashes in azerbaijan 
representatives of armenia and azerbaijan prepared to open peace 
talks friday across the soviet union in riga capital of the baltic 
republic of latvia 
a spokesman for the azerbaijani peoples front accused president 
mikhail s gorbachev of caving in to communist hardliners by 
sending troops to occupy baku and added gorbachevs hands are 
now bloody 
lt gen vladimir s dubinyak told the first foreign journalists 
permitted to visit baku since the military seized control of the 
city jan 20 there are many positively inclined forces trying to 
noralize the situation and end the curfew 
he said the 11 pm5 am curfew might be lifted within two 
weeks he said tensions would have to ease further including an 
end to leaflets appealing to baku workers to strike to protest the 
military presence 
at night during the curfew military trucks and armored 
personnel carriers stand at most intersections between baku airport 
and the center of the city soldiers guarding the intersections 
wear helmets and carry automatic weapons 
red flowers mark where azerbaijanis died fighting the military 
intervention 
on jan 13 azerbaijanis attacked ethnic armenians and drove 
them from their homes in baku an oil center and the capital of the 
republic of azerbaijan in the southern soviet union soviet troops 
stormed baku a week later 
the official soviet news agency tass reported the death toll in 
baku alone since the troops moved in at 139 that includes 106 
civilians 28 soldiers and five policemen as many as 498 people 
were wounded tass said 
iran on thursday offered to send doctors nurses and medicine to 
neighboring soviet azerbaijan whose residents are primarily shiite 
moslem like most iranians the offer was reported by tehran 
television monitored in cyprus iran has condemned the use of 
force in azerbaijan 
dubinyak said regular army soldiers making up 5000 of the 
17000 troops now committed to baku could be sent home military 
equipment could be removed from the streets and the remaining 
interior ministry soldiers could patrol the streets without weapons 
dubinyak said he would welcome talks with the azerbaijan 
peoples front a group that defense minister dmitri t yazov has 
said the military is trying to crush as a nationalist movement 
dubinyak said the peoples front has not proposed talks but a 
spokesman for the group interrupted to say such discussions could 
begin any time 
the peoples front spokesman nadchov nadzhavov editor of the 
groups banned newspaper charged that soldiers were sent into baku 
in part to prevent the front from making a strong showing in local 
elections 
the date for the elections is to be set this month and they 
must take place within three months 
i can make the prognosis that they wont leave before the 
elections nadzhavov told reporters he also criticized 
gorbachevs handling of the crisis in azerbaijan saying the 
kremlin leader had given in to reformers by not cracking down on an 
independence movement in lithuania and then had given in to 
communist hardliners by sending troops into azerbaijan 
gorbachevs hands are now bloody he said 
lt gen mikhail p kolesnikov a representative of the soviet 
army serving under the commandant told reporters that the military 
had been affected by the tblisi syndrome 
he said criticism that followed the crushing of a nationalist 
demonstration in the georgian capital on april 9 1989 had 
demoralized the military and hindered decision making 
we saw outrages he said we saw instances of 
bloodletting but we couldnt do anything 
azerbaijani representatives arrived in riga for peace talks with 
a threeman delegation of the armenian allnational movement 
maybe the first steps toward dialogue with the armenians will 
take place we are counting on that the chief azerbaijani 
delegate khikmet khazhizade of his republics peoples front 
group told the associated press 
the talks are sponsored by the baltic council a grouping of the 
three peoples front organizations in latvia estonia and 
lithuania organizers said they hoped the talks could start friday 
morning 
the baltic activists cautioned against expecting quick results 
such talks could help but we need two or three months as the 
problems are very deep said edvin inken a latvian peoples 
front leader who recently visited baku

united states and its allies 
we must always remain on the imams path he said at a 
ceremony beginning a 10day celebration of the islamic revolution 
ahmad khomeini said his father warned that if we show the 
slightest bit of complacency america will deliver its final blow 
against us you the people must prepare for struggle against 
america 
the radio the younger khomeini a leading radical praised his 
fathers successor as spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei for 
treading the same path as the imam 
his exhortation for no compromise with the united states was 
seen as a warning to president hashemi rafsanjani leader of the 
socalled pragmatist faction in iran 
rafsanjani who attended the ceremony khomeinis goldendomed 
tomb in the behesht zahra cemetery seeks better relations with the 
west in order to obtain help in recovering from eight years of war 
with iraq 
the first part of rafsanjanis 5year development plan calling 
for up to 20 billion in foreign investment got parliaments 
approval wednesday over opposition from radicals who want state 
control and no foreign involvement 
tehran television showed throngs at the cemetery chanting 
death to america and death to israel 
iranian officials paid their respects at the tomb and promised 
to safeguard khomeinis ideological legacy the radio said 
at a time when the government was in the hands of the enemy 
the imams coming from a safe place to the center of the danger was 
an act rooted in the immense power of the lord rafsanjani said 
at the graveside the radio reported 
khomeini returned from 14 years of exile feb 1 1979 after 
shah mohammad reza pahlavi was forced to flee ten days later the 
government he left behind collapsed and khomeini proclaimed the 
islamic republic 
rafsanjani said the iranian people have proved that if a 
nation is resolute in its stand and if it has courage and spirit 
it cannot be defeated 
he said recent changes in eastern europe and elsewhere were a 
small example of what the people of iran achieved 11 years ago and 
these popular rebellions are the legacy of the people of iran 
khamenei the nations spiritual leader told another gathering 
in tehran the future belongs to islam the moslems and the 
freedomloving nations of the world the television reported 
in the confrontation with the organizations of the satanic 
powers the west it will be islam which triumphs 
despite the fiery rhetoric this years anniversary of the 
revolution differs from past observances it reflects the more more 
relaxed character of rafsanjanis government formed in august and 
an easing of islamic rigidity 
while khomeini was alive the anniversary was a time of rallies 
to show support for him and of reruns on state television of 
bloody clashes between revolutionary zealots and the shahs forces 
on thursday television showed film of khomeini arriving in 
tehran in 1979 on a chartered air france jet but comedy and 
childrens shows dominated the morning programming 
the official islamic republic news agency said music would be 
part of the celebrations this year for the first time khomeini 
felt good moslems should shun music

the state department announced today a 
proposed 55 million increase in economic assistance for el 
salvador as salvadoran president alfredo cristiani headed into 
highlevel meetings here 
before the formal announcement an administration official had 
confirmed a published report that an aid cut was planned but the 
official figures showed 284 million proposed for el salvador for 
fiscal 1991 compared with 229 million for the current year the 
official was unavailable afterward to explain the discrepancy 
other central american countries however were cut back as part 
of a general reordering of priorities the administration is 
undertaking in light of additional claims on the aid program in 
panama and eastern europe 
military aid to el salvador would undergo a slight increase in 
fiscal 1991 to 914 million from the current level of 846 
million 
the administration has been concerned that congress may impose 
sharp cutbacks on el salvador in response to continuing human 
rights abuses in that country 
bush reiterated his strong support for cristiani during a photo 
session at the white house 
in the face of congressional criticism over alleged military 
involvement in the slaying of six jesuit priests bush praised 
cristiani for arresting four officers and four soldiers in the case 
i know of his commitment to democracy bush said i have 
been very impressed with the courage he has shown in going after 
those who have broken the law in his country he said 
cristiani earlier went to capitol hill for a meeting with key 
house democrats including speaker tom foley dwash majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo and rep moakley dmass head of 
a house task force looking into el salvador 
moakley described the meeting as friendly but said the 
congressmen let him know what our people are thinking about the 
human rights situation particularly the murder of the priests in 
november 
while none of the congressmen threatened directly to cut off 
aid some members told cristiani votes for el salvador aid have 
been diminishing over the years moakley said 
but administration officials believe cristiani may have defused 
a potential rebellion in congress with the arrests a month ago of 
eight army personnel including a colonel who were wanted in the 
killings 
some members of congress are skeptical about the ability of el 
salvadors criminal justice system to punish those responsible 
noting that tens of thousands of politically motivated killings in 
el salvador remain unsolved 
but administration officias said wednesday that any 
congressional attempt to link us aid to a successful prosecution 
of the jesuit priests case probably would not take effect for at 
least a year 
this would give cristiani time to move ahead on that issue on 
negotiating peace with leftist rebels and on restoring vigor to a 
declining economy 
on friday cristiani is to meet with members of the us 
catholic community in an attempt to reassure them his efforts to 
solve the killings of the jesuits are serious 
some of the exasperation of members of congress particularly 
democratic liberals is based on what they perceive to be the 
meager rewards of more than 4 billion in us economic and 
military outlays for el salvador over the past decade 
el salvador has held a number of multiparty elections since 
then but the country seems no closer to a peace settlement with 
the rebels and still has been unable to overcome its reputation as 
one of the most lawless nations in the hemisphere 
on the other hand cristiani with strong administration 
support is convinced that his country continues to be victimized 
by nicaraguan and cuban attempts to support the leftist rebel 
movement 
cristiani discussed that issue on wednesday when he met with 
un secretary general javier perez de cuellar in new york

western european leaders on thursday supported the 
us proposal for significant new troop withdrawals from europe 
but amid hints of anxiety stressed they want a continued american 
presence 
britain said it hoped this was the last reduction planned by 
washington 
the soviet union welcomed as a sign that things are changing 
for the better the proposal by president bush to cut troop levels 
in central europe to 195000 for each superpower below the 
275000 being negotiated at talks in vienna 
but soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov 
complained the plan did not go far enough adding we must 
continue to have as our goal no foreign troops on foreign soil 
it must be the ceiling not the floor said gerasimov you 
can note in his bushs speech he needs american troops in europe 
for here to eternity this is not a good sign 
some analysts said the bush plan signaled the beginning of the 
final withdrawal of american troops from western europe dreaded 
by many of the us allies in nato as well as the departure of 
all the soviets 
i personally would be suprised if the soviets have anything 
like 195000 soldiers left in east germany within the next two to 
three years said francois heisbourg director of the 
londonbased institute of strategic studies 
i think the soviets will be lucky if there is a symbolic 
contingent left a soviet guantanamo he said referring the us 
base in cuba 
in london prime minister margaret thatcher said britain 
attached great importance to president bushs assurance that the 
new figure will be a floor and that no more reductions are 
envisaged 
this will ensure a continued strong american presence in 
europe added the statement from her no 10 downing st office 
thatcher aides said bush telephoned her saturday to discuss the 
proposal and we indicated our support 
bush sent two senior aides to put this plan to the leaders of 
the four major western european powers britain france west 
germany and italy 
the united states has 305000 troops in central europe and the 
soviet union has 565000 another 30000 us troops in britain and 
southern europe are excluded from the bush proposal 
west germany where most of the us troops are deployed hailed 
the proposal defense minister gerhard stoltenberg called it a 
balanced combination of disarmament policy and unequivocal 
recognition of the wests defense readiness and alliance 
solidarity 
west german enthusiasm for troop pullouts by both sides 
reflected eagerness for unification with east germany where 
380000 of the soviet troops on foreign soil are stationed 
two other east bloc nations czechoslovakia and hungary have 
demanded that the soviet forces leave their soil 
other european nato allies are concerned about being dominated 
by a powerful single german state the fears are heightened on a 
continent that was overrun by nazi germany in world war ii 
they are also worried about the united states detaching itself 
from europe as the soviet military threat diminishes with the 
collapse of a string of communist governments in 1989 
belgium and the netherlands followed mrs thatchers cautious 
line 
there have to be talks on the withdrawal of troops and i 
oppose a unilateral initiative said belgian foreign affairs 
minister mark eyskens 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek said 195000 us 
troops would be the minimum level needed dutch tv reported 
both belgium and the netherlands however have said they are 
studying the possibility of withdrawing their forces from west 
germany because of the diminished soviet threat 
some of the smaller nato countries werent all that firm in 
their commitment anyway said mark fielder an analyst at the 
royal united services institute in london now with the bush 
proposal theyll have the best excuse in the world to say lets 
have a race to see who can get out first 
manfred woerner secretarygeneral of the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization said in brussels the bush plan was 
consistent with us promises to maintain significant military 
forces in europe 
french president francois mitterrands spokesman hubert 
vedrine said the bush proposal came at an opportune moment 
accelerating the vienna conventional arms talks 
italy portugal and norway all said the bush proposal was 
welcome as another initiative toward disarmament 
the italian communist party the biggest in the west called for 
an immediate 4 percent cut in italian defense expenditure and said 
italy need not accept a wing of us f16 fighters due to be 
redeployed from a spanish base

the united states is prepared to normalize 
relations with nicaragua if this months elections are certified 
free and fair and if the sandinista government halts its support 
for leftist guerrillas in neighboring el salvador secretary of 
state james a baker iii said thursday 
if we determine that it is free and fair and we determine 
that they have indeed stopped their support of subversion in 
neighboring countries or in other places in latin america then 
wed be prepared to normalize our relations with that government 
baker told the senate foreign relations committee 
baker said however that it was important that the sandinista 
government relent and admit members of president bushs 
congressional observer team to watch election preparations and the 
feb 25 balloting 
so far the 20member team has been denied visas because the 
managua government contends the united states cannot be an 
impartial observer 
without the observer group there its going to be hard for us 
to make the judgments required baker said 
he added that there also must be some period of time during 
which we can satisfy ourselves if the suggestion is made to us 
that they have indeed stopped shipping sa7 sovietmade 
antiaircraft missiles and other miliary equipment to the fmln 
salvadoran guerrillas were going to have to know thats a fact 
before we can begin to normalize 
during a twohour session with the senate committee baker 
outlined budget initiatives the administration is seeking in fiscal 
1991 and reiterated us support for reforms being pressed by 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
baker leaves monday on a trip that will take him to moscow for 
meetings with foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and perhaps 
gorbachev 
we seek to probe for points of mutual advantage with the 
soviet union turning areas of conflict into areas of cooperation 
wherever possible he told the committee in this way we will 
benefit ourselves as well as the reformers in moscow 
primary items on bakers moscow agenda are accelerating arms 
control agreements seeking a solution to the war in afghanistan 
between the sovietbacked marxist government and usarmed moslem 
fundamentalist rebels and human rights 
bakers testimony followed president bushs announcement 
wednesday of a new troopcut proposal in central europe and the 
secretary said it was hoped the troopreduction plan could be 
incorporated into a new conventional forces agreement to be 
concluded this year 
he sounded a note of caution saying the old world of dogmatic 
dictatorships is on its way out but the new world of secure 
prosperous and just democracies is not yet here it will not arrive 
automatically 
members of the senate panel barely mentioned the most recent 
point of foreignpolicy conflict with the administration china 
and baker as he read from his prepared text skipped over a 
sentence referring to the tragic case of china mentioning only 
cuba as an example of governments that try to shut out democratic 
values 
baker also used his appearance to renew an appeal to congress to 
curb its practice of earmarking foreign aid money for specific 
countries saying the practice has led to an 86 percent cut in aid 
to african nations for the current year and sharp reductions in 
help to countries like jamaica that are cooperating with the us 
war on drugs and should be able to expect larger rewards 
and he complained again that we have no flexibility to meet 
unforeseen needs like the 500 million rebuilding program proposed 
for panama 
there baker said what we need to do is throw a little money 
at the problem because were the ones that did a lot of the 
damage

the bush administration is proposing that more 
than half of next years 148 billion foreign aid request be spent 
on strategicallyplaced allies at the expense of the worlds 
poorest countries 
the emphasis on catering to key allies is consistent with the 
longstanding us view that security concerns must be given 
priority over humanitarian concerns in the distribution of aid 
if congress approves the administrations fiscal 1991 foreign 
aid request the largest individual recipients of economic and 
military support would continue to be israel with 3 billion and 
egypt with 22 billion 
those grants accounting for more than a third of us foreign 
aid reflect us interest in maintaining stability in its two 
closest mideast allies 
almost half of the 15 billion proposed for latin america and 
the caribbean would be allocated for three small central american 
countries el salvador guatemala and honduras where the united 
states has been trying to help consolidate stable democratic rule 
in the face of leftist opposition 
these countries accounting for perhaps 2 per cent of the 
population of the region would receive about 673 million in 
economic and military aid 
this equals more than 80 per cent of the total for the 44 
countries of subsaharan africa 
writing in thursdays editions of the washington post the 
president of the african development foundation leonard h 
robinson expressed amazement at the quick congressional approval 
given in 1989 to a largescale threeyear aid program for poland 
and hungary 
where did the 900 million come from he asked why did it 
take only days to secure as an africanist i want to know so do 
the people of africa 
citing the various environmental and economic calamaties which 
have befallen africa in recent years robinson said you have to 
wonder why western nations have not rushed to africas aid with the 
same degree of alacrity witnessed in poland and hungary 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan said thursday that african 
countries often are cut back by an administration when funds are 
needed to help out new claimants on the us aid program 
we raid the accounts of the poorest countries kassebaum 
said during a senate foreign relations committee hearing in one 
key assistance category she said africa was cut back from 99 
million in 1989 to 14 million currently 
the broad outlines of the overall program were released monday 
when the administrations 1991 budget proposal was made public the 
details were disclosed thursday 
among countries with which the united states has military base 
agreements the philippines would receive 649 million in economic 
and military aid compared with 540 million for the current year 
while portugal would get 172 million compared with 127 million 
turkey would receive 598 million in economic and military aid 
compared with the current 515 million greece would get 345 
million in military aid down 4 million from this year greece 
gets no economic aid 
the administration asked congress for 532 million to combat 
drug smuggling with about 80 percent of that going to bolivia 
colombia and peru the total for antismuggling efforts this year 
is slightly under 300 million 
president bush will be traveling to colombia in two weeks to 
confer with leaders from those three countries

monkey love may be blossoming at long 
last more than 18 months after colossus billed as the largest 
gorilla in captivity met a female of the species for the first 
time 
when they were introduced in june 1988 muke pronouced mookey 
was the first gorilla of any kind that collosus had seen since he 
was captured as an infant in the jungles of africa 21 years earlier 
he led a solitary existence at a new hampshire attraction until 
he was purchased by the zoo in this florida panhandle city three 
months before mukes arrival on breeding loan from the st louis 
zoo 
since then the 23yearolds have shared the outdoor gorilla 
compound during the day but did little more than stare across the 
courtyard at one another and tangle in an occasional spat 
they slept in separate cages at night until last week said zoo 
director pat quinn at a news conference wednesday 
love did not fill the air during their first night together 
muke emerged covered with dung 
i guess he just spent the night flinging dung at her quinn 
said 
but quinn is encouraged that colossus who weighs more than 550 
pounds and muke a dainty 300pounder may mate 
the week of sleeping together has awakened primeval desires 
in colossus quinn said colossus is paying more attention to muke 
and she is menstruating regularly something she wasnt doing 
before said jean benchimol general curator at the the zoo 
i think we need to give them some time quinn said once 
they find they can live together theres a good possibility 
they will breed

some inmates of the washoe county regional 
jail went cold turkey thursday and sheriffs department workers 
were forced to cut down on cigarettes under a new strict nosmoking 
policy 
the policy banning smoking in jail facilities and desginating 
only a few smoking areas for employees was intended to provide a 
smokefree and healthy environment in the departments four main 
buildings 
undersheriff dan coppa said a few inmates and workers dont like 
the new rules but crowded working conditions and an overcrowded 
jail have been making it more difficult for nonsmokers to breathe 
what we have found is there is a handsome body of inmates and 
employees that dont smoke and things were getting complicated by 
crowded conditions coppa said we were getting ventilation 
problems and complaints 
the federal centers for disease control reported last july that 
nevada had the secondhighest lung cancer death rate in the nation 
based on 1986 figures the cdc reported nevadas rate was 683 
deaths per 100000 compared to the national average of 521 
the jail built for 458 inmates held 638 thursday when the 
nosmoking policy went into effect following a gradual decrease in 
cigarette sales in the facility to encourage people to start 
cutting back coppa said 
connie brown dispatch supervisor at the sheriffs incline 
village substation has endured restricted smoking areas for more 
than a year ahead of the new departmentwide nosmoking policy 
i have to go outside the dispatch area in the receiving room 
to smoke said mrs brown who has been lighting up for 37 years 
and said she has no plans to quit 
mrs brown said she has gone from smoking about one and one half 
packs of cigarettes a day to about one pack since tobacco use was 
limited in her substation 
nevada prohibits cigarette use in most public access local and 
state government buildings except in designated areas 
the states prison system doesnt have a nosmoking policy for 
inmates some of whom have sued in the past seeking a court order 
requiring their custodians to separate smokers from nonsmokers 
but the lawsuits have been dismissed and prison officials have 
said it would be too much of a burden to separate smokers from 
nonsmokers when deciding which prisoners should bunk together

a soviet cosmonaut took a spin in space thursday 
on a special motorcycle designed for rescuing spacemen and 
officials said the vehicles maiden journey outside the orbiting 
station mir was a success 
flight engineer alexander a serebrov rode the cycle as far as 
30 yards away from the giant station while mission commander 
alexander s viktorenko stayed at mirs exit hatch and monitored 
the cycles operations 
soviet tv interrupted its regular programs several times during 
the day for special coverage of the fivehour spacewalk live 
pictures showed serebrov 45 attached to a tether anchored on mir 
as he prepared to ride the cycle 
a taped report showed the cosmonaut with his left side in the 
sun and right in shadow slowly riding away from mir his image 
growing smaller 
a correspondent emphasized the drama of floating in space while 
connected to mir only by a rope he told viewers in the nighttime 
newscast vremya it was risky and dangerous work 
but tass said the results of the 30yard test ride and three 
fiveyard trips were good its easy operation and good 
maneuverability were confirmed the news agency said further 
tests are planned monday 
its not much of a motorcycle by earth standards it actually 
looks more like a floating armchair weighing 485 pounds with 32 
motors 
the cycle is designed for repairing satellites and rescuing 
spacemen in distress it can rotate and move to a maximum distance 
of 50 yards away from mir 
the device formally known as the cosmonaut movement system is 
similar to the manned maneuvering unit that us space shuttle 
astronauts have used soviet officials say 
the cycle was delivered to mir on dec 6 after two delays it 
originally was scheduled to blast off last april but it wasnt 
ready and a second launching planned for september was scrapped 
because of problems with its electronic docking system 
the 20ton mir was designed to be permanently manned and was 
host to a record yearlong flight by two cosmonauts in 1988 but it 
was unexpectedly mothballed in april because the module and another 
addon were not ready and keeping a crew aboard would have cost 
money when legislators and ordinary soviets were demanding that 
space rubles be spent on earth 
the fourmonth vacancy was only the second time since mir was 
launched in february 1986 that it was unmanned 
mir already is joined with kvant an astrophysics laboratory 
viktorenko and serebrov have been aboard mir since september and 
are scheduled to be replaced later this month by another crew

education leaders and democrats in congress 
decried on thursday a yawning gap between president bushs 
soaring goals for americas schools and the 2 percent increase in 
his education budget 
they asked where the money would come from to meet bushs aims 
of reducing the dropout rate drastically and making us children 
worldbeaters in math and science by the turn of the century 
there is a yawning gap between the rhetoric of president 
bushs education speeches and the funding levels he offers in his 
budget said albert shanker president of the american federation 
of teachers 
rep pat williams dmont said that parents and students 
need to have explained to them how is a 2 percent increase for 
the pentagon a major cut while a 2 percent increase in education is 
a major increase 
education secretary lauro f cavazos defended bushs approach 
insisting its not a matter of dollars 
we could keep on adding another billion and another 
billion that is not going to solve the education deficit 
cavazos told reporters at a white house briefing on bushs six 
education goals 
the way math and science are taught must be radically changed 
he said just putting more dollars into the current system is not 
going to make good mathematicians of students said cavazos 
adding they probably wont be able to add it 
bush unveiled the goals four months after agreeing at the 
education summit with the 50 governors in charlottesville va to 
produce the first performance goals for the nations schools 
the national governors association will not vote on the end 
product until their winter meeting at the end of this month but 
cavazos said the goals have the backing of a governors task force 
on education those governors terry branstad of iowa bill 
clinton of arkansas carroll campbell of south carolina and booth 
gardner of washington attended the state of the union and bush 
saluted them for their role 
we still have a lot of work to do in drafting detailed 
objectives on how to reach bushs lofty goals said cavazos but he 
added that he expects no major changes 
despite his insistence that more money is not needed to meet 
bushs goals cavazos stressed that the education departments 
proposed 246 billion budget for fiscal 1991 is the largest 
education budget that this nation has had and includes a very 
healthy 62 percent increase in discretionary programs 
overall bush sought 500 million or 2 percent more for the 
education department he also requested an extra 500 million for 
head start which is in the department of health and human services 
budget 
asked why the education budget would rise at a slower pace than 
the 3 percent rise in overall federal spending cavazos said his 
department is paying lower interest rates on student loans than it 
once was he denied that aid to college students was being reduced 
the way that you really become the education president is 
to change the educational system so its a positive system its an 
effective system said cavazos who said federal state and local 
spending on schools surged 26 percent after inflation in the 1980s 
bush in his address said real improvement in our schools is 
not simply a matter of spending more it is a matter of asking more 
expecting more of our schools our teachers of our kids and 
our parents and ourselves 
some education leaders and democrats were not impressed 
richard miller executive director of the american association 
of school administrators said we want to get beyond rhetoric 
his budget proposal for education is at odds with the goals 
house speaker thomas s foley commenting after bush unveiled 
the goals in wednesdays state of the union address said you 
cant become the education president by proposing a meager 2 
percent increase in the education budget 
cavazos said that when you compare our students against their 
peers in the industrialized nations of the world we come out at 
the bottom in math and almost at the bottom in science 
we have an attitudinal problem that we have to face he 
added citing surveys that show american students think they are 
good in math when in fact they are mediocre students in countries 
such as south korea who shine in math take the opposite attitude 
underrating their ability 
nearly 30 percent of american teenagers now drop out of high 
school although some return to get their diploma or equivalency 
degree minnesota traditionally has been the only state with a 90 
percent graduation rate the presidens goal for the nation

newly discovered documents about covert attempts 
to discredit the ira in the 1970s contain no evidence of a smear 
campaign against leading politicians prime minister margaret 
thatcher said thursday 
lawmakers who claim they were targets pressed for a full inquiry 
despite the denial on grounds the allegations would not disappear 
otherwise 
the time has come for a full open and honest uncovering of 
these things so that people in northern ireland can know that this 
has come to an end the dirty tricks that were carried on said 
the rev ian paisley a militant protestant leader in the province 
paisley who has been described as a target of smears led 
opposition to british government policy during the 1970s 
for years mrs thatcher has denied allegations by colin 
wallace a former army press officer of a dirty tricks 
campaign against the irish republican army and some politicians 
in a letter wednesday to a lawmaker of her conservative party 
she acknowledged her statements were based on false information 
from civil servants british ministers are not allowed to examine 
papers of former administrations and must rely on facts given them 
by civil servants 
her letter was released one day after her government confirmed 
the existence of a covert operation codenamed clockwork 
orange that fed lies to journalists reporting from northern 
ireland where the irish republican army is fighting to end british 
rule 
mrs thatcher and her defense secretary tom king repeated 
thursday that the documents unearthed in the bureaucracy provided 
no evidence the campaign was extended to politicians 
the prime minister told the house of commons she stands by her 
statement in may 1987 that there was no evidence of misuse of 
information by any member of the security services 
in particular she said there was no evidence of a plot to 
undermine the 197476 labor party government of prime minister 
harold wilson as alleged in spycatcher the memoirs of former 
mi5 agent peter wright 
my own statement of may 6 1987 was not affected by the new 
information nor does the new information provide any evidence of 
attempts to undermine or discredit ministers mrs thatcher said 
wallace says he was dismissed in 1975 four years before mrs 
thatcher became prime minister for threatening to expose the 
campaign 
in addition to his regular army duties wallace says he led a 
secret psychological warfare unit in northern ireland in the 1970s 
his superior officer backed up the statement 
according to wallace clockwork orange began as an attempt 
to discredit the ira through false stories such as a claim the 
guerrillas had soviet rockets armed with unstable explosives and 
was expanded later to smear politicians such as wilson and his 
predecessor edward heath 
tony benn a former labor minister said former prime minister 
james callaghan also was a target 
sir david steel former leader of the liberal party added his 
own name to the list and said a parliament committee should 
investigate 
paul foot said in his book who framed colin wallace that 
wallace was given detailed information from the mi5 
counterintelligence agency that enabled him to make allegations 
about homosexuality bogus bank accounts corrupt earnings and 
communist sympathies 
foot a journalist said the campaign was intended to keep labor 
from being reelected in 1974 and to remove heath and former 
northern ireland minister william whitelaw from top positions in 
the conservative party 
heath and whitelaw had made contact with the ira as part of the 
government effort to solve the problems of the troubled province 
wallace said the campaign also involved preparing forged 
documents to smear the labor party merlyn rees labors northern 
ireland secretary at the time said a proira statement was 
doctored to include his name and suggest he was sympathetic to 
terrorism 
confirmation of clockwork orange came during an announcement 
by armed forces minister archie hamilton of an investigation of the 
defense ministry decision to fire wallace 
the government accused wallace of passing a restricted document 
to a journalist after appealing he was allowed to resign 
wallace took a public relations job but in 1981 was convicted 
of the manslaughter of a friend and served five years in prison 
foots book focuses on that killing and suggests wallace was framed 
a clockwork orange is the title of a novel by anthony 
burgess published in 1962 about extreme forms of mind control in 
a totalitarian state a movie based on it was released in 1971

president bush will invite both nelson mandela 
and fw de klerk to pay separate visits to the white house if and 
when south african authorities free mandela from prison a 
spokesman announced thursday 
bush through his press secretary praised de klerks 
courageous and important steps to end apartheid and move toward 
a democratic and nonracial south africa 
press secretary marlin fitzwater revealed plans to proffer the 
invitations amid news reports that mandelas release after 27 years 
in prison could come as early as friday 
but fitzwater said i have no independent information on his 
release 
mandela 71 leader of the outlawed african national congress 
has been imprisoned for more than 27 years for sedition for 
planning the start of the ancs guerrilla campaign 
de klerk is scheduled to deliver a major address to parliament 
on friday aides have denied reports that he personally met with 
mandela earlier in the week to discuss terms of mandelas release 
they did meet last dec 13 and since then both the white 
minorityruled government and mandelas anc movement have given 
increasingly serious consideration to the possibility of 
negotiations 
fitzwater said in a statement 
the president has been closely following the situation in 
south africa he believes that president de klerk has taken a 
number of courageous and important steps aimed at ending apartheid 
and moving toward a democratic and nonracial south africa 
should mandela be released the president would plan to invite 
both mandela and de klerk separately to meet with him at the white 
house so the president can determine how the us can best help 
south africa move forward toward a nonracial government and 
society 
earlier fitzwater told reporters bush would invite mandela to 
washington for a visit as soon as it is convenient for him 
we will certainly support his release were hopeful he will 
be said fitzwater 
mandelas release is seen as necessary before black leaders will 
enter negotiations 
south africas 5 million whites have maintained control through 
apartheid laws that severely restricted the political and economic 
rights of the countrys 26 million blacks 
but the apartheid system buffeted by international condemnation 
and protests from within has begun to weaken in recent years

sen edward m kennedy proposed thursday a 
fiveyear 139 billion cut in defense spending below the levels 
president bush wants kennedy said the savings should go to 
reducing the deficit and financing domestic programs 
the massachusetts democrat said improvements in eastwest 
relations justify a siphoning of defense dollars into education 
environment antidrug and other social initiatives 
kennedy a senior member of the senate armed services committee 
did not say where the defense cuts should be made he said that 
just as starters he would favor cuts in the strategic defense 
initiative the mx mobile missile and the b2 stealth bomber 
what america needs now is bold leadership on defense not cold 
leftovers from the right wings cold war kitchen kennedy told 
reporters and if president bush wont supply that leadership 
congress should 
kennedy proposed cutting defense spending in fiscal 1991 to 292 
billion in outlays 11 billion lower than bush proposed in the 
budget he released monday 
kennedy said he wanted spending to decline gradually to 274 
billion in fiscal 1995 under bushs plan military spending would 
be 319 billion in 1995 
kennedy said he hoped that his proposed defense cuts would 
permit tax cuts as well as shrink the federal deficit and better 
finance domestic programs

budget director richard g darman called on 
the nations largest senior citizen organization thursday to help 
fight a proposed social security tax cut that he said would 
inescapably threaten benefits 
i would urge you all to consider ever so seriously what really 
is at stake here darman told leaders of the american association 
of retired persons this is not something to play around with 
the administration is fighting a proposal by sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny that would roll back the social security tax 
increase that took effect jan 1 and further reduce the levy next 
year 
the tax was raised from 751 percent of the first 51300 of 
wages to 765 percent with the employer paying an equal amount 
moynihan wants it rolled back to 51 percent eventually 
a principal aim of the proposal is to prevent the government 
from using surplus social security taxes to make the overall 
federal deficit appear smaller than it is 
darman told the aarps 38member legislative council that 
moynihans plan would do nothing to solve the deficit problem yet 
would be inescapably a threat to social security benefits 
he asked the group to draw upon the enormous respect that you 
command that we do not command to lobby congress against the 
plan 
darman was followed to the lectern by social security 
commissioner gwendolyn king who made a promise when she was sworn 
in six months ago to snarl like a junkyard dog if anyone 
threatened social security 
the junkyard dog is going to do a little bit of growling 
mrs king told the group i shouldnt have to remind this group 
how important the trust fund is 
mrs king urged the aarp to speak out strongly against the 
moynihan proposal the aarps legislative council on friday will 
make policy recommendations to the organizations executive 
committee 
im not going to press you but i do want you to know how 
important it is that you not leave me out here by myself that you 
not cop out of this debate she said 
mrs king said that if the payroll tax were reduced its not 
far down the road i can assure you that somebodys going to come 
back and suggest benefit cuts 
the aarp council heard from moynihan who also sought its 
support earlier this week he disputed administration claims that 
his plan would threaten benefits 
the arguments from both sides were politely received but 
council members divided on who is right 
dennis crites a council member from norman okla said 
moynihans plan had helped draw attention to the budget problems 
but he said it develops a life of its own it may be damaging 
lou schwartz of teaneck nj said he likes moynihans plan 
because it would lower the taxes on those who can least afford to 
pay it and open the door to have the people that can afford to pay 
it pay it 
the administration lobbying effort came just one day after 
president bush urged congress to keep hands off social security 
however two republican lawmakers introduced bills thursday that 
are variations of the moynihan proposal 
the two proposals 
by sen robert kasten rwis to reduce social security taxes 
in three steps to 675 percent in 1992 that would mean a 
threeyear tax cut totaling 519 for a highearning worker social 
security surpluses would no longer be considered in calculating the 
federal deficit the 1993 target date for balancing the budget 
would be extended to 1997 
by rep hank brown of colorado senior republican on the house 
ways and means subcommittee on social security to repeal this 
years tax increase take social security out of the deficit 
calculations and require the government to report annually on 
whether the pension system is sound enough to provide benefits for 
future retirees 
browns bill also would increase to 15000 a year the amount of 
wages a person between the ages of 65 and 69 may earn without 
losing any social security benefit present law takes away 1 of 
pension for each 3 of wages above 9360 
kasten said congress is almost certain to at least repeal this 
years social security tax increase he predicted lawmakers will 
reject the politics of fear which he described as allegations 
that cuts in taxes would lead to reductions in benefits

firefighters police officers and health 
workers exposed to the aids virus on the job can get free doses of 
the drug azt in a pioneering program in one california county 
officials said thursday 
orange county officials said they believe it is the first 
organized program nationwide to offer emergency workers access to 
the aidsfighting drug 
health care workers are not the only people who get exposed 
to aids said dr tom prendergast chief epidemiologist for the 
county south of los angeles paramedics police and others who risk 
exposure also should have use of azt he said thursday 
the program implemented in september was discussed by county 
aids coordinator penny weismuller at an aids conference wednesday 
under the program five public safety workers took azt 
immediately after potential exposure to the virus ms weismuller 
said animal studies indicate that infection may be prevented if 
the drug is administered within 96 hours of exposure she said 
the therapy was suggested in august by researchers with the 
national institutes of health and the university of california san 
francisco who have developed azt programs for their healthcare 
workers 
the program is intended for workers involved in incidents which 
would put them at serious risk of exposure if the other person 
turned out to be infected with aids ms weismuller said examples 
would be cases where the worker is actually stabbed by a needle or 
directly exposed to blood 
the first person to take azt under the orange county program was 
a police officer who cut his arm while scuffling with a man ms 
weismuller said blood from a cut in the mans scalp dripped 
directly into a wound the officer sustained during the fight 
the city called us right away which was good because we knew 
this suspect and knew he was aids virus positive ms 
weismuller said the officer took the drug for the recommended four 
weeks and continues to test negative for the virus she added 
the four other workers given azt took it for less than four 
days she said they stopped using the drug after the people they 
were exposed to tested negative for the virus 
anaheim fire chief jeff bowman said thursday the azt program 
must be viewed cautiously 
im very much in favor of it but its not a cureall 
bowman said there are concerns about azt side effects which 
include nausea and headaches and about longterm consequences such 
as cancer he said 
the best thing is prevention bowman said noting that masks 
and gloves intended to prevent exposure to the aids virus have 
become standard gear for paramedics 
the most common type of exposure occurs when workers handling 
needles contaminated with blood from an aids patient accidentally 
prick themselves officials said 
when youre working a car accident in the middle of a street 
at night needles are flying everywhere bowman said 
orange county pays for the azt therapy but asks reimbursement 
from cities or workercompensation plans ms weismuller said the 
drug costs about 200 for the monthlong period 
only about 4 percent of those who are directly exposed to the 
aids virus on the job develop the disease said julie gerberding a 
uc researcher 
orange county population about 22 million had an aids rate 
through november 1989 of 546 cases per 100000 population 
prendergast said that compares to a national rate of 453 cases 
per 100000 he said

the us government radio station voice of 
america informed employees thursday that budget cuts will silence 
six of its 43 language broadcasts on three continents 
we are doing to ourselves what 30 years of soviet jamming 
couldnt do voa director richard w carlson told hundreds of 
broadcasters editors and engineers this is the toughest and 
saddest day of my professional life 
going off the air by april 1 will be the turkish greek 
slovenian lao uzbek and swahili services the 57 employees of 
those services will lose their jobs 
elimination of the six services will save voa 29 million 
officials said 
voa which has been providing news and entertainment to millions 
of listeners since 1942 has been grappling with budget cuts for 
several years since 1987 it has laid off more than 200 people 
shut down five bureaus in the united states and abroad and 
eliminated hundreds of radio hours in various languages 
if we dont get budget relief more cuts could be possible 
said carlson 
carlson said voa and its parent the us information agency 
had decided that amputation of several services was preferable 
to dismemberment of broadcast departments across the board 
the selection of the services to be eliminated was made in 
accordance with a list of priorities that takes into account the 
geopolitical importance of the targeted countries and the 
availability of other foreign media there 
radio free europe the usfunded munichbased radio network 
that broadcasts only to eastern europe has an uzbek service the 
british broadcasting corporation broadcasts in slovenian as well 
as in greek and turkish laos a landlocked impoverished communist 
country is the only one of the six which does not receive foreign 
language broadcasts 
this will cripple our efforts at a time of unprecedented 
change and opportunity carlson said he praised the employees 
for helping fan the winds of revolution blowing throughout the 
world 
the elimination of the slovenian service comes as residents of 
slovenia are leading the surge of reform in yugoslavia but most 
slovenians speak serbocroatian a voa service which continues to 
air carlson said 
voas problems were compounded this week when the 
administrations 1991 budget proposal released to congress mandated 
the addition of a tibetan language service voa officials estimate 
that if they air two hours a week of tibetan programs the new 
service will cost 15 million 
voas operating budget for 1990 was about 170 million and the 
budget for 1991 is expected to be 174 million carlson said this 
includes a 35 percent wage increase and still leaves voa 15 
million short 
after announcing the cuts to the employees carlson read the 
names of each of the employees who will lose their jobs many of 
them have worked for voa more than 20 years

president bush on thursday called el 
salvadors president alfredo cristiani a shining example to all 
of us of democratic commitment as the administration proposed a 
62 million boost in aid to the central american nation 
the state department said the administration is proposing 284 
million for el salvador in economic aid for fiscal 1991 compared 
with 229 million for the current year military aid would rise 
slightly to 914 million from the current 846 million if 
congress approves 
there is concern within the administration that congressional 
skepticism about human rights abuses in el salvador and in 
particular the slaying of six jesuit priests last fall might 
prompt a scaling back of el salvadors aid package officials hope 
the arrest of eight military men in the case by cristianis 
government will diffuse the criticism 
bush sought to make clear thursday that he is squarely behind 
cristiani praising him at a photo session for his diligence in the 
jesuits case 
i know of his commitment to democracy bush said i have 
been very impressed with the courage he has shown in going after 
those who have broken the law in his country and hes been a 
shining example to all of us 
i support him now i will support him in the future and the 
success of democracy in el salvador is a very important thing to 
us to this coutnry 
while bush and cristiani met a small group of protesters 
marched in front of the white house against continued us aid to 
el salvador 
one carried a sign reading kindergentler death squads a 
reference to the rightwing groups linked in the past both to the 
military and to cristianis political party that have carried out 
many killings and tortured leftists in el salvador 
cristiani said his talks at the white house and on capitol hill 
did not focus on the aid question as much as on efforts to restart 
peace talks with the leftist guerrillas battling his government 
however he told reporters any cut in aid by congress would 
send negative signals to the rebels that would impede efforts 
for peace talks 
on capitol hill cristiani met with key house democrats 
including speaker thomas foley dwash majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo and rep jospeh moakley dmass head of a house 
task force on el salvador 
moakley said the congressmen let him know what our people are 
thinking about the human rights situation particularly the 
jesuit killings 
while none of the congressmen threatened directly to try to cut 
off aid some did tell cristiani that votes for el salvador aid 
have been diminishing over the years moakley said

restrictions in violencewracked kashmir thursday and claimed the 
situation was improving but a former chief minister said the 
moslem agitation for secession was far from over 
kashmir is sitting on a volcano said farooq abdullah who 
resigned as chief minister or the states top elected official on 
jan 19 we do not know if it will simmer down or blow up 
abdullah called on the government to initiate talks with 
militants seeking independence for the strategic northern state 
which is claimed by both india and pakistan 
since the government launched a crackdown on the secessionist 
movement jan 20 at least 72 mostly moslem protesters died in 
confrontations with security forces 
on thursday authorities lifted the curfew until evening and 
there were no reports of violence when the curfew was reimposed 
the last two reporters for foreign news media known to be in 
srinagar received letters from a local official ordering them to 
leave the city 
however it remained to be seen whether the orders would be 
implemented with the curfew back in force overnight as it had 
been for the past 12 days everyone in the city of 1 million was 
ordered to stay indoors there were no flights out of srinagar 
virtually inaccessible by road until friday afternoon 
the orders were issued to dilip ganguly of the associated press 
and anil penna of agence francepresse both indian citizens the

the moslem movement for independence of kashmir dates to 1947 
but flared in recent months bolstered by charges that abdullah was 
incompetent and corrupt militants angered by his rule and what 
they called subservience to new delhi threatened to kill him 
abdullah resigned in protest a day after the federal government 
appointed jagmohan a hindu with only one name as state governor 
jagmohan then assumed the administrative powers that revert to the 
governor in the absence of an elected state government and ordered

treasury secretary nicholas brady on thursday 
said he was satisfied with the achievements of the administrations 
muchcriticized third world debt strategy and predicted more 
success in the coming year 
brady said that the first agreement with mexico would be 
signed this sunday and he predicted that another agreement would be 
finalized by midmonth with the philippines 
he said that an agreement with costa rica was expected before 
the end of march and that later in the year debt reduction packages 
could be reached with two of the third worlds largest debtors 
venezuela and brazil 
i am very pleased with the progress that we have made in the 
attempts to alleviate third world debt brady said in answer to a 
question before the senate budget committee i think a pattern is 
beginning to emerge whereby we can deal with these problems 
the administrations debt strategy often referred to as the 
brady debt plan was unveiled by the treasury secretary in march 
1989 it had an initial goal of cutting the commercial bank debt of 
39 countries chiefly in latin america by 20 percent 
the plan envisioned using incentives supplied by the 
international monetary fund and the world bank to entice commercial 
banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of their old debt in 
exchange for guarantees that the reduced debt would be repaid 
critics however said the deal with mexico considered a test 
case for the brady plan produced debt relief far below what had 
been hoped and that other countries were even further from reaching 
agreements with commercial banks 
but brady said the debt plan while setting enormous goals 
had been working well in producing a variety of debt reduction 
packages that will soon be signed 
starting from scratch this past year we now have some of the 
machinery down working rather smoothly so that we dont have to 
reinvent the wheel every time we do one of these transactions 
he said 
on another topic brady acknowledged that the administrations 
proposal to cut the tax on corporate profits envisoned that the 
measure would be enacted by march 1 1990 a goal that senate 
budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn called totally 
unrealistic 
if it does not go into effect until later in the year it will 
reduce by a significant amount the 49 billion in revenues the 
administration is anticipating receiving from persons selling off 
their assets to take advantage of the lower tax rate the 49 
billion represents the biggest revenue measure in the 
administrations 1991 budget which was unveiled on monday 
sasser said that enactment of the capital gains cut would not 
come before september or october at the earliest 
brady said that a delay in enacting the proposal would cut into 
the revenues the administration is counting on to reduce the budget 
deficit and we will have to figure out a way to make up the 
shortfall 
brady refused to answer a reporters question after the hearing 
about where the administration might look to make up the lost 
revenue 
asked by reporters about repeated rumors that he is considering 
resigning brady termed such reports absolutely untrue and 
compared the rumors to recent resignation rumors involving soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev 
i am delighted to be included in the same category as general 
secretary gorbachev brady said

the government said thursday its forces 
recaptured two southern towns yei and lanya lost to rebels of 
the sudan peoples liberation army in a recent violent stepup of 
the civil war 
no word on the claim came from the rebels who have reported 
seizing 12 towns in the south the last few months 
the armed forces general command also announced its troops 
killed 95 rebels in an attack on a base in the upper nile region 
north of equatoria its communique said seven soldiers died in the 
intensive and successful mopup operation but gave no date 
in nairobi capital of adjacent kenya relief workers said 
sudanese air traffic controllers denied landing permission thursday 
to an plane ferrying emergency food to juba the beleaguered 
capital of the equatoria regional that is 750 miles south of 
khartoum 
it seems the civil aviation people in khartoum didnt get 
details of the aircraft said bob koepp of the lutheran world 
federation we got permission and everything 
koepp said the hercules c130 returned to nairobi in the morning 
with its cargo of 15 tons of corn donated by the italian government 
we are at them and hope to fly tomorrow said koepp whose 
nairobi office is responsible for the lutheran groups activities 
in southern sudan 
koepp said that a boeing 707 leased by the lutherans from sudan 
airways was permitted to deliver 30 tons of corn to juba thursday 
the army command announced recovery of yei lost to the rebels 
in december in a statement published by the militarys newspaper 
alkuwat almusallaha 
it did not say when the army recaptured yei 80 miles southeast 
of juba the report said the rebels suffered heavy casualties but 
gave no figures 
mopup operations cleared the areas around yei it said 
the official sudan news agency suna quoted military officials 
as saying government troops on wednesday recaptured lanya after a 
fierce battle 
lanya about 30 miles southwest of juba on the road linking that 
city with yei had fallen to the rebels last month 
the officials were quoted as saying great numbers of rebels 
were killed or wounded and that eight soldiers died 
large quantities of arms and equipment were seized including a 
sovietmade t55 tank and launchers for rocketpropelled grenades 
they said 
suna quoted an official as saying seizure of the tank proves 
the interference of a neighboring country alongside the rebels in 
the fighting in both eastern and western equatoria 
he did not identify the country but was believed referring to 
marxistruled ethiopia frequently accused by sudan of aiding the 
rebels 
the sudan peoples liberation army has been fighting since early 
1983 against the moslemdominated khartoum government for 
administrative and economic reforms in the south inhabited mostly 
by christians and animists 
recent evacuees say that jubas estimated 300000 residents are 
prevented by armed soldiers from leaving 
juba on the west bank of the white nile river is ringed with 
land mines planted by both soldiers and rebels 
the rebels have subjected juba to sporadic artillery bombardment 
and have virtually cut all land routes to the city 
koepp said his organization has 2500 tons of italiandonated 
corn awaiting delivery to juba and expects to receive additional 
food from other donors soon 
only the lutherans have delivered nonsudanese government food 
supplies to juba since khartoum banned relief flights nov 3 after 
an informal ceasefire with the rebels broke down 
lam akol a liberation army spokesman said on wednesday in 
addis ababa ethiopia that relief flights fly at their own 
risk

president bushs proposal for deeper troop cuts in 
central europe was a step in the right direction but did not go far 
enough foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said thursday 
in a surprise overture bush proposed in his state of the union 
message wednesday a cut in military manpower in europe to 195000 
troops on each side the previous us bargaining position at 
conventional force negotiations in vienna was 275000 on each side 
its a good sign that things are changing for the better 
gerasimov said in the regular news briefing some observers note 
that the events in europe run ahead of the slow diplomatic 
negotiations 
gerasimov also complained that bush seemed to take credit for 
the revolution of 1989 as the american president called the 
democratic reforms that have occurred in much of eastern europe 
since last summer 
he said attempts to show these events as a triumph of us 
ideals and a failure of communism are a relic of the cold war 
he added that the us invasion of panama last december was also 
proof of this attitude 
gerasimov criticized the bush proposal for not going further 
you can note in his speech that he needs american troops in 
europe from here to eternity 125000 or about this figure this 
is not a good sign 
we together with les aspin chairman of the us house armed 
services committee feel it must be the ceiling not the floor 
gerasimov said 
bush said in his speech that he and americas european allies 
agree that an american military presence in europe is essential 
and that it should not be tied solely to the soviet military 
presence in eastern europe 
gerasimov also complained that the proposal applies only to 
troops in central europe and would leave the united states with 
30000 or more servicemen in england greece and other countries in 
europe 
so it comes out that the us is to have 235000 troops 
gerasimov said this will have to be considered at the conventional 
arms talks in vienna austria he said

the federal government wants virginia 
military institute to admit women but some cadets said thursday 
that would destroy a proud 150year tradition of discipline and 
unity among the student body 
i kind of felt all along it would be inevitable hoping that 
it wouldnt said tony marro 20 of ilion ny 
the us justice department announced wednesday it would bring a 
sex discrimination lawsuit against vmi if the college part of the 
state university system doesnt agree by feb 20 to admit women 
but state attorney general mary sue terry has said she would 
defend the school if it continues to turn away women 
there are viable defenses to vmis admission policy said 
bert rohrer a terry spokesman if they chose to continue the 
policy she would defend it 
the justice department said its investigation concluded the 
policy violates the civil rights act of 1964 and the 14th amendment 
to the constitution which guarantees every citizen equal 
protection under the law 
the investigation was prompted by a written complaint in march 
from a female high school student who wanted to attend the college 
known for the militarystyle discipline of its uniformed 
cadets though it isnt part of the military 
gov l douglas wilder refused to say whether he supports 
admitting women to vmi 
the ultimate responsibility as to what takes place rests with 
the board of visitors wilder said referring to the schools 
appointed governing body 
the vmi board of visitors next scheduled meeting is march 
2931 well after the justice department deadline said tom joynes 
the schools public affairs officer no special meeting has been 
scheduled joynes said 
vmi officials said it would be inappropriate to comment about 
the federal governments action and referred all questions to 
terrys office 
the school reaffirmed its singlesex policy in 1986 and told the 
justice department in april that coeducation would undermine its 
mission but most cadets oppose the admission of women said 
benjamin dorman a 20yearold cadet 
the system functions better with men only to allow women 
would cause too many changes he said i dont think they could 
cut it physically 
but dorman like many of the other cadets believe the campus 
will soon be coeducational 
i just got clobbered by my roommates for saying what i 
think said jim blankenship a 19yearold sophomore from 
roanoke i think women should come 
but another cadet overheard the comment and yelled as he walked 
away maybe i should buy you a skirt blankenship 
the 1200student college in virginias western mountains which 
offers bachelors degrees and is known for its engineering program 
is one of just two statesupported allmale military schools left 
in the country the other is the citadel in south carolina 
as at military prep schools cadets wear militarystyle 
uniforms and many join the service after graduation the schools 
supporters say instill discipline pride and selfreliance and 
forge bonds among the cadets 
all of vmis cadets live in a threestory dormitory in spartan 
rooms with standard cots shelves and desks they wake to reveille 
and the freshmen called rats by upperclassmen have to keep 
their heads shaved and be ready at any time for inspections 
marro said the unity would suffer if women are admitted 
the whole system takes place in the barracks he said the 
thing with rats coming together as a class i think that would be 
affected if they build a separate barracks for women it will be 
hard to maintain unity 
meantime state sen emilie f miller has introduced a bill in 
the general assembly that would force vmi to admit women 
i would hope that the state would not go to court that we 
would do the right thing she said 
but sen elmon t gray dwaverly and a vmi graduate said the 
state should fight the justice department ive never felt vmi is 
in violation he said

the bush administration will give congress 
some guidelines for writing the 1990 farm bill including ideas for 
stimulating oilseed production but wont introduce legislation of 
its own a senate committee was told thursday 
foreign competition and restrictions in the american farm 
program that discourage crop rotation have caused declines in us 
production of soybeans and sunflowers according to industry 
experts and commodity groups 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter will spell out the 
administrations proposals in an appearance before the senate 
agriculture committee next week said assistant secretary bruce 
gardner 
bushs proposed 1991 budget called for cutting spending on farm 
commodity programs by 15 billion but the administration didnt 
suggest how the reductions would be made 
gardner refused to divulge any of the administrations ideas in 
advance thursday despite complaints from democratic members of an 
agriculture committee subcommittee on production and price 
stabilization who questioned the presidents interest in farm 
policy 
you are going to have a lot to work off of said gardner 
who contended bush is interested in farm policy as much as any 
other president has been 
most recent presidents have introduced their own farm bills 
said sen david pryor dark who noted that bush mentioned the 
issue only in passing during wednesdays state of the union address 
the administration believes the 1990 farm bill should give 
farmers more flexibility to rotate crops from year to year which 
could encourage producers to plant more soybeans sunflowers and 
canola rather than program crops like corn said gardner 
the key word there is flexibility but the question is how to 
achieve it gardner said 
restrictions in the 1985 farm bill discourage farmers from 
planting nonprogram crops while at the same time lower production 
costs in south america and heavy european subsidies have combined 
to cut into the us share of the world oilseed market industry 
experts told the committee 
world trade has leveled off since 1980 causing a 19 percent 
decline in us soybean acreage while soybean acreage inother areas 
of the world especially south americas acreage has increased

the recent surge in heating oil prices and 
record cold makes this the wrong time for the bush administration 
to seek a 25 percent reduction in a program to help the poor pay 
heating bills state officials told congress on thursday 
even the current appropriation of 139 billion for the 1990 
fiscal year is barely adequate to meet the needs of the low income 
home energy assistance program state regulators and community 
activists told a house education and labor subcommittee hearing 
president bush proposed as part of his fiscal 1991 budget on 
monday that the department of health of human services make a 350 
million cut in the aid plan which served 59 million households 
last year administration officials said the energy crisis that 
spawned the program no longer existed 
the aid program began in the wake of rapid increase in energy 
costs in the late 1970s and after reports of the deaths of an 
elderly syracuse ny couple who froze to death in an unheated 
house 
the program provides funds to states for heating and cooling 
assistance and weatherization 
lynda crandall of the michigan department of social services 
told the subcommittee on human resources that high energy costs 
were largely a responsibility of the federal government she said 
new program cuts will increase homelessness and otherwise 
threaten the health and safety of low income citizens 
while michigan stands ready to contribute its fair share the 
federal government must take the lead in solving the low income 
energy assistance problem which results from national economic and 
energy policy she said 
in pennsylvania community activist janet parrish said the 
december cold snap and temporary jump in home heating oil prices 
as high as 162 per gallon worsened backlogs in processing aid 
applications already pennsylvania and other states have struggled 
to compensate for previous program cuts by using state oil 
overcharge funds 
congress needs to take a stand on behalf of the needy said 
dick sievers executive director of midsioux opportunity inc a 
community action group in remsen iowa 
eunice thomas acting assistant secretary at the family support 
administration of hhs said home energy costs did not fluctuate as 
often in the 1980s as in the 1970s and the national crisis has 
long passed 
when temporary price increases occur as in december she said 
the problems were generally confined to a specific area or fuel and 
could be dealt with at the state level

premier georgi atanassov a holdover from 
the era of disgraced leader todor zhivkov resigned along with his 
22member communistcontrolled cabinet bulgarian state radio said 
late thursday 
the resignation was the first by a government since 1947 when 
the communist party consolidated power in postwar bulgaria 
according to the state news agency bta 
the government has been under severe pressure to resolve 
bulgarias labor strife and other economic ills their departure 
clears the way for creation of an interim government to run 
bulgaria until elections this year the communists have proposed 
such a government to share power with the opposition 
the state news agency said the resignations became known 
thursday night during an emergency closeddoor communist party 
congress the government will continue to serve until parliament 
accepts its resignation the agency said no date was given 
the motive adduced for the resignation is the necessity to 
form a cabinet on a broad national basis bta said 
atanassovs departure was earlier reported by an official 
source speaking on condition of anonymity 
delegates to the party congress remained in session and were 
expected to continue meeting into friday 
on thursday they approved moderate reforms before starting the 
secret session to elect the party leadership 
also a reform faction of the communist party decided it would 
split off and form a new socialist party a spokesman said 
atanassov the no 2 man in the government after president petar 
mladenov had come under fire for failing to curb unprecedented 
labor unrest his resignation was widely expected because of 
several personal attacks on him during an emergency communist party 
conference currently under way 
at the congress thursday delegates adopted a new party platform 
that confirmed the relinquishment of the communists monopoly on 
power as approved by parliament last month 
delegates also accepted mladenovs proposal to separate the 
party leaders position from the presidency mladenov currently 
holds both positions and is expected to retain the presidency 
the changes were not enough to keep the party together a 
reformminded faction announced thursday it had given up trying to 
change the conservative party from within and would form its own 
socialist party 
the creation of the bulgarian socialist party will be formalized 
at a special congress in sofia on feb 11 said spokesman nikolai 
vassilev 
it was not clear when a new cabinet would be created but it 
presumably will run the government at least until elections that 
are expected as early as may 
mladenov and other communists have spoken vaguely of creating a 
government of national concord but they have not been specific 
on what powers they might be willing to give up 
the opposition union of democratic forces has said the 
composition of such a government must be clarified before they 
agree to participate 
opposition spokesman petar beron reiterated that thursday but 
his comments were made before the report of the cabinets 
resignation 
atanassov a member of the communist party policymaking 
politburo became premier in march 1986 he survived the nov 10 
ouster of communist party head tudor zhivkov apparently because he 
sided with the politburo colleagues who engineered the end of the 
authoritarian leaders 35 years in power 
despite zhivkovs ouster bulgarias communists have given up 
relatively little power compared with their comrades elsewhere in 
eastern europe the party is bolstered by roots in a century of the 
nations politics and relatively weak opposition 
however atanassov was not able to escape the shadow of zhivkov 
now under arrest on criminal charges or effectively deal with 
economic problems that have led to widespread strikes 
in general bulgaria is suffering the same problems as other 
east bloc countries with centrally planned economies the foreign 
debt is estimated at 11 billion and there have been allegations 
by the opposition of mismanagement of western credits 
vassilev the leader of the reform faction said he had expected 
a party split even before the congress began tuesday 
a similar split occurred this week in poland when reformers 
broke away from the main communist party at a congress that 
concluded monday 
vassilev a sofia university philosophy and anthropology 
professor said his new party will be socially oriented he 
predicted that within three months about 150000 of the 980000 
communist party members in bulgaria will join it 
but the leader of another reform wing in the party economist 
alexander tomov of the movement for democratic socialism was not 
optimistic about the prospects for a breakaway party 
even if the atlernative socialist alliance splits away i am 
almost certain that they will not win not only because they have 
organizational problems but because their basis is a quick 
political and not an economic reform he said

the soviet union is likely to pull all its 
troops from europe by 1995 but the western allies must remain wary 
of the only nation on earth capable of destroying the united 
states defense secretary dick cheney told congress on thursday 
cheney said president bushs new proposal that moscow and 
washington seek agreement on deeper troop cuts in europe than 
previously contemplated would preserve a viable useful 
american military presence on the continent 
bush in his state of the union speech wednesday proposed 
reducing us and soviet combat forces in europe to no more than 
225000 for each side a drop of 50000 from the previous us 
proposal at eastwest troop reduction talks now under way in vienna 
the state of the union address spoke of a us troop ceiling of 
195000 but that number would apply to natos central front 
basically germany the 225000 ceiling would be for all europe 
including us forces in turkey greece italy spain and britain 
bush said that with communism crumbling in eastern europe 
the time had come to swiftly conclude agreements limiting 
conventional strategic and chemical weapons 
in testimony before the senate armed services committee cheney 
said caution is still in order in considering relaxing us 
defenses even though moscow is reducing its military spending and 
is unlikely to initiate an attack on nato territory 
the soviet union remains the only nation on earth capable of 
destroying the united states cheney said adding that even if 
all soviet troops leave eastern europe moscow would retain its 
geographic advantage in the event of a european crisis 
he said it was important not to drop below a certain troop level 
in europe 
sen john warner of virginia the ranking republican on the 
committee sought and received an assurance from cheney that the 
adminstration would not consider going beyond bushs latest 
troopcut proposal in the foreseeable future 
this is the worst possible time to contemplate changes in 
strategy warner said 
cheney estimated that the 225000 us troop level in europe 
could be achieved within a year or two certainly after an 
agreement is ratified but he said the troops would be sent 
elsewhere and not removed from military service 
however sen alan dixon dill pressed cheney as to why the 
bush administration would wait for an arms control agreement before 
reducing us troops in light of moves by american allies to cut 
their forces and pressures in the eastern bloc for the soviets to 
leave 
theyre going to get out of eastern europe whether they like 
it or not without any agreement with the united states dixon 
said theyre going to kick them out and were waiting here to 
do things until we have the agreement 
im not saying strip until were naked im saying do sensible 
things now here in our country even without agreements dixon 
said 
cheney said the administration is not oblivious to the need to 
reduce us forces overseas and has plans to end us operations 
at several foreign bases 
but to ensure the nato alliance and a peaceful process we 
should not unilaterally bring them home until weve got an 
agreement cheney said 
at the white house chief of staff john sununu said bushs new 
troopcut proposal was not intended to prop up a politically 
weakened soviet president mikhail gorbachev as he faces a critical 
meeting next week of the communist party central committee 
if the cutting of troops would have been an advantage for mr 
gorbachev then mr gorbachev would probably have announced them 
earlier himself thereby getting both the advantage the pressuring 
of the united states to do it and whatever international political 
benefits that come in that direction sununu said so that was 
not part of the consideration 
while acknowledging dramatic changes in the political landscape 
of eastern europe cheney said the soviets are continuing to 
modernize their strategic nuclear arsenal and will be more capable 
in the 1990s to adapt new technolgies to weapons systems 
cheney said the pentagon would present to congress within a few 
months a revamped fiveyear plan for troop levels deployments 
weapons requirements and other strategic issues in light of the 
collapse of communism in eastern europe 
among the assumptions used in this planning he said is that 
the soviets will be out of eastern europe or virtually out of 
eastern europe five years hence that the governments of eastern 
europe will be democratically elected noncommunist regimes he 
called this a very real possibility 
remarks to the committee by cheney and gen colin l powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff appeared aimed largely at 
heading off any political momentum toward an immediate radical 
reduction in us military capabilities 
we must not shatter the armed forces powell said we must 
not make them a shadow of strength 
powell said the pentagons latest assessment of the overall 
soviet threat to us security was based on acknowledgement of a 
a dramatic diminution in the possibility of eastwest conflict 
but also an unsettling uncertainty about the future 
it is still too soon to make sweeping changes to strategy 
force structure and posture and modernization he said there 
is simply too much risk in such precipitous change 
powell also said he would stand like a stone wall against 
any pressure for a total pullout of us combat forces from europe 
even if all soviet forces withdrew 
while we will reduce the number of our forces in europe there 
is nothing whatsoever on the horizon that indicates to me that we 
can disengage from the continent entirely he said

the house interior committee chairman rep 
morris udall praised interior secretary manuel lujan jr on 
thursday for reversing several reagan administration policies on 
mining coal from federal lands critics have said the reagan 
policies favored private interests over the environment 
it appears to me that in this area there is a much greater 
concern and responsiveness to the public interest a more open 
attitude and a more balanced approach to environmental and 
conservation issues than has been evident in the previous 
republican administration udall an arizona democrat said in a 
letter to lujan 
udall a tenacious protector of public lands who is in his 13th 
year as chairman of the interior committee was consistently at 
odds with interior secretaries james watt and donald hodel who 
served under reagan 
lujan served on the interior committee while in congress and was 
ranking republican on the interior committee for several years 
we sat side by side for a good number of years udall 
commented thursday we both know well disagree again along the 
way but when an old friend is doing a good job i feel moved to 
tell him 
we have been plugging along for 12 months trying to get people 
to notice that things are different at interior and there is an 
environmental tilt said steve goldstein chief spokesman for 
lujan this is beyond what we expected 
goldstein said that when lujan reviewed some of the reagan 
policies he decided they did not fit into the new environmental 
ethic he and bush wanted for the department 
lujan is doing a pretty good job agreed skip deegans 
coordinator of the surface mining project at the national wildlife 
federation 
but he said you have to put it in perspective under reagan 
they had an agenda to decimate the surface mine regulations 
a lot of it is that they are waking up to the political 
realities that the public is interested in having the environment 
protected said deegans the situation on coal issues was so 
antagonistic during the reagan administration that nothing was 
getting done we were constantly in litigation with the office of 
surface mining 
udall who sponsored the surface mining control and reclamation 
act cited five areas for praise 
improvements in the computerized system designed to prevent 
violators of the act from obtaining additional mining permits the 
reagan administration was put under court order to make 
improvements but never did said deegans 
abolishing a reagan administration proposal to reduce the 
royalty rate paid the government on underground coal it would have 
saved the coal industry money but cost the taxpayers 
reversal of a reagan administration decision that eliminated 
certain fees from the royalty base rate paid on coal that had cost 
taxpayers about 70 million said udall 
disapproval of a proposed amendment to a wyoming regulatory 
program that would have relieved coal companies of having to return 
surfacemined lands to their original contours 
action to stop mining companies from abusing the law that 
allows coal to be taken at a cheaper rate if it the company happens 
to mine it when looking for another mineral in the vicinity 
companies were pretending to be mining principally for cheaper 
minerals in order to get coal said udall

new york stock exchange chairman john j phelan 
jr announced his retirement thursday capping a tumultuous 
sevenyear tenure in which the nations biggest securities market 
grew explosively suffered a devastating crash and struggled to 
recover 
phelan announced the departure effective at the end of this 
year at a news conference in the nyses wall street headquarters 
after the close of the days trading 
he said he had considered retirement for about a year but 
hadnt felt he could leave amid the continuing debate over market 
volatility and the uncertainty raised by an oct 13 minicrash 
i did it because i thought the exchange was in good shape 
phelan said of his decision 
phelan declined to specify what he might do next and no 
replacement was named the nyse board of directors said it named a 
special committee to oversee a transition and help pick a 
successor and said the panel expected to make its recommendations 
in the fall 
there had been rumors for days that phelan might be tapped to 
replace nicholas brady as treasury secretary phelan said he hadnt 
been contacted about a government job and wasnt considering one 
brady has denied that he plans to resign 
phelan is perhaps best known as one of the cool heads at the 
helm oct 19 1987 when the market plunged out of control in a 
selloff that erased 508 points from the dow jones industrial 
average 
the 58yearold chairman and chief executive officer who has 
spent more than half his life in the securities business and took 
the big boards top job in 1984 presided over the most dramatic 
expansion in the nyses history 
since then the value of all stocks listed on the big board as 
it is commonly known as grown from 16 trillion to more than 24 
trillion the nyse ended 1989 with 1721 listed companies making 
it the worlds secondlargest exchange behind tokyo 
since the 1987 plunge the nyse and the securities industry have 
been fighting a slump hurt by investors who fled the market and 
have been afraid to return despite a number of reforms phelan and 
other industry leaders devised to lure them back 
phelan had said previously he didnt expect to be chairman for 
life but he was expected to remain at least until 1992 the 200th 
anniversary of the stock market founded when two dozen traders 
gathered under a buttonwood tree on wall street 
the most contentious issue he has faced recently is the price 
zigzags that have characterized some trading days especially last 
oct 13 when the dow jones industrial average lost 190 points and a 
subsequent session that had an 80point singleday rise 
many traders have blamed the volatility on computerized program 
trading a practice in which millions of dollars worth of stocks 
are traded instantaneously 
phelan has been reluctant to restrict program trading although 
he supported limits on it during times of heavy price fluctuations 
he was one of the first to warn that some kinds of program trading 
could lead to a market disaster 
im convinced there is a cure for intraday volatility or 
intrahour volatility he said thursday im not sure what it 
is but im sure there is a cure for it 
phelan said he considered his main achievement the installation 
of modern trading technology in the exchange where average daily 
volume climbed from about 20 million shares in the mid1970s to 
more than 600 million shares during the black monday crash he 
credited that technology for helping the exchange handle the huge 
volume that deluged the market during the crash 
before he was named chairman and chief executive officer phelan 
served as nyse president and chief operating officer for four years 
and as vice chairman for five years before that

an attorney charged thursday that new information 
points to contra military leader enrique bermudez as the official 
who ordered the killing of a us volunteer building a rural dam in 
nicaragua 
benjamin linder 27 of portland ore died april 28 1987 
when the usbacked rebels attacked the hydroelectric dam in 
northern nicaragua his family contends the engineer was abducted 
tortured and executed but the contras said he was armed and died 
in a firefight between rebel and sandinista government troops 
the family has filed a 50 million wrongful death suit in 
federal court in miami against the contras and their leadership 
including bermudez the contras at one time had a headquarters in 
miami 
this was not just an attack on a dam this was an attack to 
assassinate a man family attorney michael ratner told us 
district judge stanley marcus linder was taken alive and 
executed subsequently and enrique bermudez gave the order 
the charge was based on a deposition from fermin cardenas 
former head of operations for the contras and later given amnesty 
in nicaragua cardenas who died shortly after giving his 
statement said bermudez had ordered linder killed to sabotage the 
dam project and congratulated the patrols commander afterward 
bermudez continues to head the rebel military 
thursdays hearing came on the familys request to amend the 
suit with the cardenas deposition thus making it more specific 
instead of basing it on general claims that the contras routinely 
conducted such raids against civilian workers 
the contras miami spokesman alejandro acevedo strongly denied 
thursday that linder was targeted by bermudez or the contras 
we emphatically reject that acevedo said it isnt our 
custom to attack civilians much less foreign citizens 
he said linder was wearing a military uniform and was with 
sandinista troops at the time of the battle 
bermudez could not be reached for comment a woman who answered 
the phone at his miami residence said bermudez was in honduras and 
unavailable 
the contras in the past have vehemently denied targeting linder 
or intentionally killing civilians painting the lawsuit as an 
effort by people opposed to us policy in central america to 
embarrass the nicaraguan rebels 
but thursday their attorney john kirkpatrick stuck to legal 
arguments aimed at showing marcus had no jurisdiction in a war 
fought on foreign soil and that there was no chance for the 
contras to get evidence to defend themselves 
i find it difficult to believe that nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega is going to subject himself to a deposition by the 
contras kirkpatrick said 
marcus said he had been close to ruling on the jurisdiction 
issue prior to the plaintiffs request to amend the suit with the 
new evidence and would take the case under advisement 
i have struggled with this case for a long time the judge 
told the attorneys there are some very difficult issues 
marcus seemed skeptical of the linder familys suit questioning 
whether there were adequate legal standards to define the crime 
whether the defense would have access to nicaraguan witnesses and 
worrying that the broadbased suit intruded on the executive and 
legislative branches

rebel gen michel aoun failed to crush a 
rival christian force and struck a truce thursday after a threeday 
battle that killed at least 70 people police reported 
the two sides had pounded each other with tank and artillery 
barrages and shells inevitably went astray smashing homes 
schools hospitals and churches 
its a death machine a woman said victims are lying in 
the streets everywhere yelling for help but no one dares approach 
them 
most of the fighting centered on a cluster of government 
buildings in christian east beirut that house the justice and 
finance ministries much of the combat was housetohouse and some 
shellpocked buildings changed hands several times 
police said at least 70 people were killed and 250 wounded since 
fighting began tuesday between aouns soldiers and samir geageas 
lebanese forces the largest christian militia they said hospitals 
were packed with casualties and short of doctors and blood 
aoun who has been dismissed as army commander but clings to his 
command of about 20000 soldiers attacked on tuesday to try to 
gain full control of the 310squaremile enclave north and east of 
beirut where 1 million christians live geagea has 6000 militiamen 
bolstered by several thousand reservists 
aoun was fired by moslem president elias hrawi elected in 
november under terms of an arab leaguebrokered peace plan aimed at 
shifting political power to the moslem majority and ending a 
15yearold christianmoslem civil war that has left 150000 people 
dead 
aoun says the plan approved by parliament in october provides 
no fixed withdrawal timetable for syrias estimated 45000 troops 
geagea has neither accepted or rejected the peace accord but 
has recognized hrawi as president about 22000 soldiers are loyal 
to hrawi 
police said aouns soldiers tried to advance behind a fierce 
howitzer barrage thursday but could not breach militia defenses on 
the southern edge of the ashrafiyeh quarter they said the apparent 
aim was to seize the main lebanese forces ammunition depot in 
ashrafiyeh 
shortly before dusk thursday christian radio stations said aoun 
and geagea agreed to the truce after a telephone discussion to 
begin a truce at 415 pm 
according to police the lebanese forces kept control of the 
ashrafiyeh quarter and port area of east beirut when the agreement 
was reached with secure supply lines to their main bases in the 
byblos region on the 30mile coastal highway north of the capital 
the lebanese broadcasting corp geageas television station 
showed aouns navy armored and air bases north of beirut that were 
captured by the lebanese forces 
aouns channel 5 tv station conceded the loss of the three 
bases claiming militiamen took the families of the officers in 
each base hostage to force them to surrender 
police said aouns forces controlled the eastern and 
northeastern flanks of east beirut and the wooded metn mountains to 
the northeast 
it was not immediately clear who had come out ahead in the 
fighting 
fighting noticeably decreased after the ceasefire 
agreement but we still have intermittent mortar and machine gun 
exchanges in east beirut and its northern suburbs said a police 
spokesman who cannot be identified under standing regulations 
it was the fourth call for a truce since the battle began and 
the first to have an effect 
the united states blamed aoun for the worst fighting in the 
christian zone for nearly a year and said he should step aside 
gen aoun must realize that his bellicose behavior does not 
advance the interests of the christians or any other community but 
only benefits those who want to see lebanon continue in anarchy and 
turmoil the state department said 
thousands of families hid in bomb shelters and basements 
thousands more streamed into moslem west beirut during a lull in 
the fighting figuring they would be safer there 
christian housewife ilham jiha crossed the dividing line from 
ashrafiyeh with her husband and two children 
mrs jiha who compared the battle to a death machine said 
aouns men shelled almost every building in ashrafiyeh several 
people were killed at the entrances to buildings 
president hrawi told all hospitals to treat casualties at 
government expense 
but an official of the saint george greek orthodox hospital in 
ashrafiyeh said the problem is not one of money we dont have 
enough surgeons we dont have enough blood we dont have 
ambulances we dont have enough space the upper floors have been 
shelled

alfonso guerra the deputy prime minister 
told parliament on thursday he had nothing to do with any 
influencepeddling by his brother 
i assume responsibility for each and every one of my actions 
but none of those that may have been committed in my name he 
said 
after the session prime minister felipe gonzalez told reporters 
he also would resign if guerra was forced to quit 
guerra accused the opposition and media during the debater of 
exaggerating the scandal since it arose a month ago 
the reports allege that juan guerra a doortodoor book 
salesman when the socialists formed their first government in 1982 
traded on his brothers name to build a real estate fortune and 
operated from a government office in seville 
gonzalez told reporters the opposition could kill two birds 
with one stone the resignation of alfonso guerra and the 
resignation of felipe gonzalez 
he said he planned to sue a madrid daily that implied the 
cabinet in 1986 knowingly favored juan guerra by approving a 
government subsidy for a real estate company with which he was said 
to be associated 
the prime minister who won a third fouryear term oct 29 
condemned what he called unfounded press reports accusing political 
figures or their family members of corruption he said he favored 
extending influencepeddling legislation which now covers only 
government employees to private citizens 
provincial prosecutors in seville and cadiz are investigating 
some of juan guerras business activities 
socialist parliamentary spokesman eduardo martin toval noted 
that no party officials had been convicted of corruption despite 
numerous opposition accusations the past seven years 
alfonso guerra said he was not aware of juan guerra trading on 
his brothers position during his seven years as the deputy prime 
ministers aide in seville the family hometown 
reports of the scandal have damaged the socialists who have 166 
deputies in the lower house half the 332 allotted after the oct 
29 elections another 18 are vacant pending courtordered repeat 
elections in three districts 
the conservative popular party the largest opposition group 
with 99 seats and the communistled united left with 17 joined 
several smaller regional parties in demanding the deputy premiers 
resignation 
in a 20minute speech alfonso guerra acknowledged the party 
employed his brother from july 1982 to may 1989 but denied knowing 
of any misuse of the seville office 
the deputy prime minister does not have any knowledge that 
that office was used for activities other than those that were 
supposed to take place there the deputy premier told parliament 
he said he never had used his influence to obtain money or 
encouraged juan guerra or anyone else to do so 
from the facts we must conclude that there has been no injury 
to the public interest he said 
guerra denied that he the government or the socialist party 
bore any responsibility for any illegal acts his brother may have 
committed 
as far as the rest is concerned the appropriate 
administrative and judicial bodies must establish if the law was 
infringed by the activities of the private citizen juan guerra 
he said

irancontra middleman albert hakim was placed 
on two years probation and fined 5000 thursday after giving up 
his claim on what prosecutors said was 73 million in armsdeal 
profits now frozen in swiss accounts 
the iranianborn businessman who pleaded guilty nov 21 to 
illegally helping supplement oliver norths government income with 
a 13800 home security system bitterly attacked the government 
after his sentencing 
i have been abused by two presidents hakim said after his 
appearance before us district court judge gerhard gesell im 
talking about president reagan and president walsh he said the 
latter referring to independent counsel lawrence walsh who directs 
the irancontra investigation 
the american public has had enough of this soap opera hakim 
said 
hakim who could have been sentenced to up to a year in jail and 
a 100000 fine on the misdemeanor charge is the sixth person 
sentenced in the irancontra affair no one has been sent to jail 
richard janis hakims lawyer said his case was a monument to 
the hypocrisy of a system that permits individuals to face 
criminal charges after they in good faith carried out the 
requests of their government he called hakim a fall guy a 
term that former white house aide north has used to describe 
himself in the affair 
former reagan national security adviser john m poindexter still 
faces trial on feb 20 
shortly after the irancontra affair erupted in november 1986 
swiss authorities placed a hold on 78 million contained in 
accounts of the enterprise a financial network of offshore 
companies hakim helped set up for use in the affair with interest 
that amount has grown to 9 million 
hakim and two swissbased lawyers working with him are claiming 
part of the money said mary belcher a spokeswoman for the 
irancontra prosecutors office 
he agreed to let the us government have 73 million while he 
will split 17 million with the two lawyers willard zucker and 
philippe neyroud the justice department approved the deal monday 
zucker says he is owed 800000 while neyroud says he is owed 
120000 said belcher 
the us government now will try to persuade the swiss to 
unfreeze the accounts 
belcher said 73 million was all that could be identified as 
iran arms sale proceeds and that we are satisfied with the 
agreement despite the fact that hakim and his lawyers stand to 
collect the remainder 
gesell also placed one of hakims companies panamanianbased 
lake resources inc on probation and ordered that the corporation 
be dissolved lake resources had pleaded guilty to a charge of 
theft of government property in the diversion of iran armssale 
profits to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
according to hakim north and others in the affair the arms 
sales to iran were aimed at winning the release of us hostages in 
lebanon while aid was channeled to the contras to help them against 
the leftist government in nicaragua 
hakim became involved in the contra resupply operation in 1984 
when north enlisted the help of hakims business partner retired 
air force maj gen richard secord 
north said he contacted secord for the contra operation at the 
suggestion of cia director william casey whose agency was barred 
by law from providing military aid to the rebel force reagan 
authorized the idea of keeping the contras in operation hakim and 
secord who later were brought into the iran arms operation as 
well set up the enterprise 
very substantial funds measured in the millions of dollars 
which have been frozen in swiss bank accounts have now been 
released to the united states by you gesell told hakim 
hakim stated in court papers that other participants in the 
affair have become wealthy an apparent reference to north who has 
benefited from fundraising efforts and bigfee speaking 
engagements 
gesell said hakims cooperation with irancontra prosecutors was 
in sharp contrast to any other of the defendants who have been at 
one time or another before me in the irancontra case 
the judge was referring to north secord and poindexter north 
was convicted of three felonies and was fined and ordered to 
perform community service secord pleaded guilty to making a false 
statement in connection with norths security system and was put on 
two years probation 
former hostage david jacobsen said in an interview with cable 
news network that hakim actually believed that he was operating 
with the highest authority given and for him to be put through 
this turmoil to be put into bankruptcy to have his personal life 
destroyed i think thats a real shame 
hakim asserts that only about 13 million from enterprise money 
was transferred to him for his irancontra activities in 1985 and 
1986 much of it for expenses 
although a private businessman who did not have a security 
clearance hakim had access to an astonishing amount of sensitive 
information his lawyer disclosed in court papers this week 
in connection with the irancontra affair hakim received top 
secret communications equipment from the national security agency 
and was made privy to classified intelligence information he also 
was provided with account numbers of cia bank accounts and was 
referred to cia proprietary companies overseas one item of 
classified information which hakim listed in the document is so 
sensitive that government security officers deleted it from the 
court filing

a lawmaker who missed more sessions than 
she attended last year demanded an apology thursday after a 
eightyear incumbent was introduced to her as a newly elected 
legislator and she fell for the prank 
rep ethel terrell issued a news release saying she refused to 
attend house sessions until she received an apology from reps 
jerry bartnik and philip hoffman 
the two promptly apologized publicly to her and anyone else they 
may have offended after expressing disbelief that she had issued 
the statement 
were not here for jokes terrell said later i thought it 
was in very bad taste 
terrell said her fellow lawmakers were able to pull off the joke 
only because impaired vision is among the medical problems that 
keep her away from lansing she declined to further describe her 
medical problems 
the prank was pulled jan 24 a week after d roman kulchitsky 
won a special election to fill a vacant seat house members had 
juggled a few seats and fourterm hoffman ended up sitting between 
terrell and bartnik 
bartnik told terrell hed introduce her to the houses newest 
lawmaker but it was actually hoffman who shook her hand she 
smiled welcomed him and asked him if he had a tough campaign 
not only have hoffman and terrell served together for eight 
years in the 110member house but theyve been on the sevenmember 
corrections committee together for four years also hoffman noted 
hes the only redheaded man in the legislature im not 
unnoticeable i thought she was joking 
terrell who lives in the detroit suburb of highland park said 
later that she was awaiting a personal apology but would resume 
attending sessions 
when my brother democrat approached me i thought he was 
telling the truth i took for granted another legislator was making 
an honest introduction terrell said 
house speaker lewis dodak said terrell was satisfied with their 
statements and would attend session again perhaps next week 
terrell 63 was first elected to the house in 1978 
terrell attended 56 of 119 sessions during 1989 an attendance 
rate of 47 percent average house attendance is more than 80 
percent 
terrell said her office runs efficiently even when shes away 
and that she is constantly in touch 
my voters are satisfied because they know im a conscientious 
worker she said i know they were just as upset about this 
joke as i was 
a little lightheartedness kind of breaks the ice in an 
otherwise serious business if she doesnt have a sense of humor 
im sorry hoffman said 
we certainly didnt mean to offend anyone hoffman said i 
guess if she never comes to session ill never be able to 
apologize

the prosecution asked on the fourth 
day of their trial thursday that the charge against four associates 
of ousted communist dictator nicolae ceausescu be increased to 
coauthorship of genocide 
they have pleaded guilty to complicity to commit genocide and 
admitted supporting ceausescus orders to shoot demonstrators 
during the revolution that overthrew the romanian dictator 
the prosecutor col aurel cosma told the military court 
thursday in requesting the more serious charge it is not 
complicity but coauthorship to genocide 
col andrei nitoiu the court president said the fivejudge 
panel would decide friday whether to grant the request 
lawyers said both coauthorship and complicity are punishable by 
a maximum of life in prison at hard labor but the minimum terms are 
different 
ceausescu and his wife elena who was the second most powerful 
person in romania were convicted in a secret trial of genocide and 
destroying the economy they were executed by firing squad dec 25 
those being tried in the military court are emil bobu 62 
former secretary of the communist party central committee and third 
in the government behind the ceausescus former interior minister 
tudor postelnicu 59 and former politburo members manea manescu 
74 and ion dinca 62 
the trial the first of ranking ceausescu aides has shed new 
light on the last days of his 24 years in power 
paul niculescu mizil the only member of ceausescus politburo 
not under arrest testified thursday that the dictators offer to 
the politburo on dec 17 to resign as communist party chief was a 
trap to discover foreign agents in the leadership 
at the dec 17 meeting ceausescu demanded the resignations of 
postelnicu defense minister vasile milea and chief of security 
iulian vlad for not carrying out his orders to shoot demonstrators 
in timisoara 
milea told ceausescu he had studied the military regulations and 
found nothing to justify the shooting of civilians 
dinca testified earlier that he and four other politburo members 
protested the demand for resignations and he then offered to 
resign it was the first time ceausescu had faced opposition in the 
politburo 
niculescu mizil said that by offering to step down ceausescu 
believed he could identify the agents by noting who did not 
support him 
the people who didnt stand up would be considered like 
traitors he said they would have been killed 
he said the four defendants were among about 15 politburo 
members who stood up some crying and didnt allow ceausescu to 
give up his post cosma the prosecutor said 25 people attended 
the meeting 
prosecutors claim the four defendants could have prevented the 
killing or wounding of nearly 2000 people by asking ceausescu to 
resign instead they supported his order to shoot demonstrators 
niculescu mizil confirmed a shorthand transcript of the meeting 
that said gen ion coman appointed by ceausescu as commander in 
timisoara gave an order to shoot demonstrators there coman is 
said to be under arrest 
a defense lawyer said milea the defense minister was not 
executed after the dec 17 meeting and was not forced out of the 
army 
milea who died dec 22 hours before ceausescu tried to escape 
has become the hero of the revolution there is controversy over 
whether he committed suicide or was assassinated on ceausescus 
orders for refusing to shoot demonstrators 
capt nicolae matei of ceausescus feared securitate secret 
police testified that he heard dinca say for 3000 
demonstrators we shouldnt give up the socialist society we must 
open fire 
matei who is under arrest provided a surreal moment he said 
he was ordered to go from primaverii palace to central committee 
headquarters the night of dec 21 while protests raged in 
bucharest to take two of ceausescus dogs back to the palace

attorney general dick thornburgh asked a 
special court thursday to appoint an independent counsel to 
investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing by former housing 
secretary samuel r pierce jr and other former federal housing 
officials 
the independent counsel if appointed would be asked to probe 
allegations that pierce and other department of housing and urban 
development officials may have violated federal criminal law in 
the administration of the hud moderate income rehabilitation 
program 
in a letter to the house judiciary committee thornburgh said 
the special counsel was being sought to investigate allegations 
that pierce and other hud officials may have committed the crime 
of conspiracy to defraud the united states or any other crime in 
administering that program between 1984 and 1988 
thornburghs formal application to a special court cited reports 
of a widespread perception among developers and local officials 
that funds were being disbursed in a disproportionate amounts to 
projects backed by prominent republicans acting as consultants or 
by former hud officials 
but the attorney general said he found no reasonable grounds 
to believe that further investigation is warranted of allegations 
that pierce lied during congressional testimony when questioned 
last may about political favoritism in the awarding of hud grants 
thornburgh signalled his reluctance to use the independent 
counsel law saying he had very little latitutde in making this 
determination i must apply to the court for an indepedent counsel 
unless i can determine that there are no reasonable grounds to 
believe that further investigation is warranted 
the attorney generals application to the special division of 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia was 
released by the department after the threejudge panel approved 
thornburghs motion to make it public 
pierces successor at hud jack kemp promised to cooperate with 
the investigation once the appointment is made by the special 
court 
this is a tragic situation for all involved kemp said in a 
statement however the department will provide whatever 
cooperation and assistance is required for full and fair 
disposition of this matter 
robert plotkin one of pierces lawyers said we continue to 
believe that mr pierce has not violated any federal laws and we 
are confident that at the conclusion of an independent counsel 
investigation that will be determined 
the attorney generals move came after the justice departments 
criminal division conducted a preliminary inquiry into allegations 
that pierce lied to a house subcommittee when questioned last 
spring about political favoritism in the awarding of grants during 
his tenure in the reagan administration 
the preliminary investigation was triggered last fall by the 19 
democratic members of the house judiciary committee who requested 
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate allegations of 
political favoritism and perjury by pierce 
thornburgh an outspoken critic of the special prosecutor law 
said his decision to seek appointment of an independent counsel was 
compelled by the severe restrictions on his ability to conduct an 
investigation that were placed upon him by statute 
a determination that no further investigation is warranted is 
virtually forclosed despite a review of voluminous 
information compiled by the hud inspector general the house 
subcommittee and justice department interviews with hud officials 
the attorney general said 
such a determination at this time is made especially difficult 
here by the breadth of the allegations and the fact that a number 
of figures central to the alleged conspiracy including secretary 
pierce and his executive assistant deborah dean have declined to 
be interviewed the attorney generals application said 
but thornburgh disclosed that pierce had provided written 
answers to questions the department submitted to him during the 
preliminary inquiry which began in dec 4 
ms dean also invoked the fifth amendment protection against 
selfincrimination in refusing to testify before the house 
subcommittee pierce also took the fifth when called back to 
testify last fall 
we will have no comment at this time until we have an 
opportunity to see the letter which of course we have not 
seen said joseph digenova who represents ms dean 
the attorney general noted that under the law he was barred from 
using the traditional prosecutorial tools such as issuing grand 
jury subpoenas or granting immunity to witnesses to conduct the 
preliminary inquiry 
nor was he able to base a decision to drop the investigation on 
a persons state of mind unless i can determine by clear and 
convincing evidence that the person lacked the requisite state of 
mind for criminal liability 
thornburgh said there was no reasonable basis to continue an 
investigation of the perjury allegations because the questioning by 
lawmakers and the answers pierce gave were too ambiguous 
the attorney general said pierces statement that he did not 
have hands on involvement in the award of moderate 
rehabilitation grants is fundamentally ambiguous which makes a 
perjury prosecution essentially impossible 
the terms is readily susceptible to countless 
interpretations thornburgh said 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the subcommittee that 
investigated allegations of wrongdoing at hud said i welcome 
the attorney generals decision and believe that an independent 
counsel is in the best position to fully investigate and resolve 
questions of possible criminal wrongdoing 
rep bruce morrison dconn called thornburghs decision a 
very important step for those involved in the hud scandal to be 
held accountable by the criminal justice system 
morrison one of two judiciary committee members who pushed the 
drive for last falls congressional request said it was important 
that the independent counsel be authorized to pursue other 
officials too 
pierce was a new york lawyer before taking the secretarys post 
in 1981 plotkin declined to say what pierce is doing now

talks began thursday on withdrawing all 
soviet troops from hungary by the end of the year the state news 
agency mti said 
the delegations headed by secretary of state ferenc somogyi 
from the hungarian foreign ministry and soviet deputy foreign 
minister ivan aboymov will meet for two days 
the talks are aimed at setting a definite timetable for the 
withdrawal we are thinking in terms of this year or into next 
year at the very latest somogyi said in an interview thursday 
night 
concerning a proposal wednesday by president bush to further 
lower troop levels in europe somogyi said his initial impressions 
are that its significant lowering of the foreigntroop level 
ceiling is a positive development from the aspect of the vienna 
talks 
the talks are the second of their kind in eastern europe since a 
wave of democratization started loosening the soviet grip over its 
warsaw pact allies 
the first such negotiations held in prague on withdrawing 
troops from czechoslovakia ended inconclusively in early january 
a second round of sovietczechoslovak negotiations is set for next 
week 
the estimated 50000 soviet troops in hungary and 70000 in 
czechoslovakia are stationed on the basis of temporary 
agreements the kremlin reached with the countries after quashing 
revolts in 1956 in hungary and in 1968 in czechoslovakia 
the call for removing the soviet troops has been echoed through 
the new leaderships of the east bloc in poland solidarity leader 
lech walesa made the appeal to the soviet ambassador although the 
noncommunistled government has not started negotiations 
moscow began reducing its troop presence in hungary in april as 
part of president mikhail s gorbachevs program of cutting 50000 
soldiers from the red army in eastern europe 
while moscow has signaled willingness to discuss the demands 
from prague and budapest for withdrawal it is not clear whether 
the soviets want the pullouts coordinated with cutbacks due for 
agreement later this year at the vienna talks on reducing 
conventional forces in europe 
the hungarian talks will be attended by senior military figures 
from each side mti said

a michigan woman accused of smoking crack cocaine 13 hours 
before giving birth was ordered thursday to stand trial but in 
wyoming a judge dismissed a childabuse complaint brought against a 
woman because she drank alcohol 
in michigans muskegon county circuit court district judge 
fredric grimm ordered kimberly hardy 22 to stand trial on charges 
of seconddegree child abuse and delivering cocaine to her newborn 
baby after he was born but before the umbilical cord was cut on 
aug 20 
in laramie wyo albany county judge robert denhardt dismissed 
a child abuse complaint against diane pfannenstiel saying the 
state did not produce probable cause that her fetus had been 
injured 
pfannenstiel 29 was about four months pregnant when she was 
arrested jan 4 two months after another judge ordered her to 
remain alcoholfree a blood test revealed she had a blood alcohol 
level of 01 percent the level at which a person is considered 
intoxicated under state law 
drug use particularly cocaine has led to arrests of pregnant 
women or new mothers in some states crackcocaine use by pregnant 
women has led to several arrests in florida on charges of 
delivering cocaine to newborn babies since the first successful 
conviction in august but that case is still on appeal 
a grand jury in rockford ill refused late last may to indict 
a young mother for involuntary manslaughter in the feb 4 death of 
her 2dayold daughter who succumbed to oxygen deprivation 
attributed to her mothers alleged use of cocaine during pregnancy 
in a separate case in rockford an unidentified juvenile mother 
was convicted last may of prenatal child abuse for allegedly using 
cocaine a few hours before the birth of her daughter 
about a dozen pregnant women who tested positive for drugs or 
whose newborns had cocaine in their systems have been charged in 
south carolina with criminal child neglect prosecutors say they 
will recommend probation and treatment not jail time for any 
woman who is convicted 
in the michigan case hardy was charged in november after 
voluntarily undergoing treatment for substance abuse she admitted 
smoking crack about 13 hours before giving birth sheriffs 
detective al van hemert testified 
i certainly wish you well but i dont think the court can 
turn its back on the situation and say we dont care i think 
that would be the biggest travesty of all the judge told hardy 
dr dan mikesell testified that hardys son suffered from low 
birthweight poor gastrointestinal functions and frequent spitting 
up in the hours and days after birth at muskegon general hospital 
he said drug screening turned up cocaine in the babys urine 
conviction of delivery of cocaine is punishable up by to 20 
years in prison and 25000 fine while seconddegree child abuse 
carries a top penalty of four years in prison 
the baby and hardys other two children ages 4 and 1 have been 
placed in foster care hardy is free on personal bond 
in the wyoming alcohol case the judge noted that the states 
child abuse statutes require that an injury be demonstrated the 
key as i see it is that the child already has to have suffered 
denhardt said 
dr gary lang a pediatrician testified that studies have shown 
pregnant women who drink excessively are prone to give birth to 
children suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome which is exhibited 
by physical and mental developmental defects but lang could not 
say definitely that the defendants fetus had been injured by its 
mothers drinking 
another judge had ordered pfannenstiel to remain alcoholfree 
following a previous pregnancy that produced a baby suffering from 
fetal alcohol syndrome according to court records

police death squads but said the security forces appear 
increasingly unhappy with president fw de klerks reforms 
de klerk refused to call for such an inquiry in december but 
reversed himself wednesday and named a supreme court judge to probe 
the charges he also asked for a separate inquiry into the death of 
a 20yearold black man found hanged tuesday in his police cell 
antiapartheid groups long have alleged that the security forces 
were involved in the more than 60 unsolved killings of activists 
during the 1980s 
the human rights commission a private group led by 
antiapartheid activists said de klerks reversal illustrated 
clearly that sustained pressure both internally and internationally 
against the system of apartheid continues to have its effect 
it said de klerk was bringing to heel the security 
apparatus but added the erratic performance of the security 
forces suggests that there is disagreement and even rebellion 
against the governments new survivalmotivated policy of 
presenting a clean image to the world 
de klerk has allowed peaceful protests since shortly after 
assuming power last august 
police however recently have resorted to tear gas rubber 
bullets and baton charges to break up peaceful demonstrations 
considered illegal 
police gen herman stadler on tuesday blamed an upsurge in 
unrest on the governments more relaxed attitude toward political 
dissent 
de klerk told top 500 police officials recently that the force 
would no longer fight the governments political battles and should 
stick to fighting crime 
according to reports police morale has suffered since the 
controversy over the purported death squads broke out late last 
year three former policemen have said they took part in killing 
government opponents under authorization of their superiors 
police have denied that assassination squads exist 
but last oct 19 the night before he was due to be hanged 
black former policeman butana almond nofomela swore in an affidavit 
he was part of a police death squad 
armed with the affidavit human rights activists obtained a stay 
of execution so nofomela could help in investigations of death 
squad activity 
nofomela on death row for a killing with no apparent political 
overtones named two former policemen he said also participated in 
the killings 
the men dirk coetzee a white former captain and david 
tshikalanga who is black fled south africa and admitting taking 
part in at least 10 killings 
coetzee is in zimbabwe and reportedly has joined the african 
national congress the main black group fighting south africas 
whitedominated government 
in an interview with the star newspaper of johannesburg coetzee 
was quoted as saying he welcomed a full investigation i hope 
the whole thing will come out into the open now 
nofomela recently pleaded guilty to the 1981 stabbing death of 
black antiapartheid attorney griffiths mxenge arrest warrants 
were issued for coetzee and tshikalanga in the same case 
police meanwhile said thursday that pieter van der merwe a 
20yearold white soldier has been arrested in connection with the 
murders of three blacks who were abducted in a minibus shot dead 
and left at intervals along a highway near klerksdorp a mining 
town 100 miles west of johannesburg 
he was identified as a conscript serving in an army artillery 
brigade 
police gave no indication of a possible motive

the vatican has granted the farflung roman 
catholic archdiocese of alaska permission for six female parish 
administrators to officiate at weddings when priests or deacons are 
not available church officials said thursday 
the national conference of catholic bishops had asked for such 
permission at its november meeting responding to a request from 
archbishop francis t hurley of anchorage 
the bishops in announcing the approval from rome quoted hurley 
as saying the church and canon law are not as rigid as some are 
prone to think 
the catholic church has a history of adjusting to 
extraordinary situations hurley was quoted as saying in fridays 
edition of his church newspaper 
the extraordinary situation in alaska hurley had said was a 
land area bigger than many nations and served by only a few priests 
hurley pilots his own airplane in order to travel the great 
distances between alaskan parishes in presenting his request last 
november he told fellow bishops that bad weather can hold him up 
upsetting longscheduled wedding plans 
officially the vatican congregation for divine worship granted 
permission for hurley to delegate authority for weddings to nuns or 
lay people otherwise qualified knowing how to perform the 
ceremony licensed by the state and so forth 
hurleys newspaper said the ruling in this case applies to five 
nuns and one lay woman currently serving as parish administrators 
in his archdiocese 
the permission applies only to alaska for now for a trial 
period of five years but could be extended to other us dioceses 
in similar situations pending requests to the vatican by other 
bishops 
hurley said there is no intention to take the priest or 
deacon from the scene rather this permission will remove the 
uncertainty that at times hovers over a planned wedding when fog 
rain or snow makes the arrival of a priest or deacon 
questionable

the african national congress on 
thursday canceled plans to produce in public a white defector who 
says he was the leader of a south african death squad 
four hours after former police capt dirk coetzee was scheduled 
to appear at a news conference in harare anc information director 
pallo jordan said the event was called off because of 
circumstances beyond our control 
asked if the guerrillabacked organization had bowed to pressure 
from the zimbabwe government jordan said it would be incorrect 
to put it that way 
he did not elaborate and declined to give further comment 
earlier thursday anc officials said the zimbabwe government 
expressed disquiet over the appearance in harare of coetzee and a 
black former policeman david tshikalanga said also to have been a 
member of a police hit squad authorized to kill antiapartheid 
activists in south africa 
the officials said the two men were to reveal details of 
killings they were involved in and had compiled a dossier alleging 
the activities of death squads were sanctioned by former south 
african law and order minister louis le grange and his successor 
adrian vlok 
a senior anc official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
colleagues met at the zimbabwe foreign ministry late wednesday and 
again early thursday 
there are hurdles we were waiting for a permit from the 
authorities to go ahead he said of the scheduled news conference 
coetzee was in a private suite at a harare hotel and information 
on his immediate plans was not known he was expected to have 
announced a wish to join the anc if given the approval of the 
organizations leaders 
in a brief written notice canceling the news conference the anc 
referred all further inquiries to its external headquarters in 
lusaka zambia 
in the past zimbabwe has allowed the anc to maintain offices in 
harare but denied the presence of armed guerrillas on its territory 
several anc facilities in zimbabwe have been the target of 
bombings and sabotage attacks blamed on south african agents 
coetzee who fled south africa in november has been implicated in 
more than 10 killings including the 1981 death of black attorney 
griffiths mxenge 
the anc says coetzee and tshikalanga allege the widespread 
involvement of south african security officers in unsolved killings 
over several years

soldier was only scratched in the attack and treated on the 
spot the assailant was taken to barzilai hospital in the southern 
israeli town of ashkelon he said 
officials at gazas ahli arab hospital said they treated 
mohammed el batneij 24 a gaza city resident who suffered multiple

also thursday an israeli human rights group said eleven arabs 
were killed by israelis during january matching the lowest monthly 
fatality toll since the palestinian uprising began nearly 26 months 
ago 
an israeli army spokesman said however that the lower toll did 
not necessarily mean the revolt against israels occupation in the 
west bank and gaza strip was over there have been ups and downs 
in the amount and the extent of violence said the spokesman 
maj moshe fogel 
during january israelis killed nine palestinians in the west 
bank and two in the gaza strip according to the israeli 
information center for human rights in the occupied territories

highest monthly toll of the uprising was 44 killed in april 1988

severely beaten in jammala a village 14 miles northwest of 
jerusalem the army confirmed the death and said it was under

a woman was sentenced to life in prison with 
no chance of parole thursday for murdering the second infant 
daughter she reported abducted in less than three years 
a peoria county jury ruled out the death penalty for paula marie 
sims after three hours of deliberation 
the same panel convicted mrs sims on tuesday of firstdegree 
murder obstruction of justice and concealing a homicide in the 
death of 6weekold heather lee whose suffocated body was found 
may 3 in a missouri trash barrel 
madison county judge andy matoesian immediately sentenced her to 
natural life in prison meaning no chance for parole mrs sims sat 
ashen but impassive 
justice was done the prosecutor assistant madison county 
states attorney donald weber told reporters outside the courtroom 
defense attorney donald groshong said he would appeal the 
verdict earlier he argued for a lesser sentence 
natural life does not take into consideration the possibility 
of rehabilitation the fact that all life has worth he said 
but madison county states attorney william haine said mrs sims 
should spend the rest of her life behind bars 
mrs sims 30 of alton had told police heather lee was 
abducted by a masked gunman from her home in the madison county 
city of alton on april 29 a story nearly identical to the one she 
told after the 1986 disappearance of her firstborn daughter 
loralei 
heathers body was found across the mississippi river in nearby 
west alton mo an autopsy indicated she had been suffocated and 
her body subsequently frozen 
thirteendayold loralei was reported abducted june 17 1986 
from the simses former home in the nearby rural jersey county town 
of brighton police found a babys body 150 yards from the sims 
home a week later but no positive identification was ever made 
no murder charges have been filed in loraleis death but mrs 
sims faces trial in jersey county on charges of obstruction of 
justice and concealment of a homicide 
prosecutors argued that mrs sims and her husband 37yearold 
robert had wanted only male babies 
sims who has not been charged in either case has custody of 
the couples 2yearold son randy 
after sentencing haine the countys top prosecutor said the 
investigation into heather lees death remains open 
there will be some other charges filed he said without 
elaborating 
juror john joplin said the panel decided against the death 
penalty in the hope that mrs sims would lead authorities to others 
involved in the crime 
the jury foreman peoria engineer harold william ryan jr said 
jurors didnt buy mrs sims description of the childs abduction 
her story was wellprepared on the witness stand but i guess 
we just didnt believe it ryan said after the sentencing 
the trial was moved to peoria county because of pretrial 
publicity in southern illinois 
under illinois law death penalty hearings have two phases the 
first to determine whether the crime warrants the death penalty 
the second to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed 
jurors on wednesday had found mrs sims eligible for death by 
lethal injection thursdays decision followed additional testimony 
and arguments 
groshong fought unsuccessfully for a delay in thursdays 
proceedings saying his client had lost the will to live and needed 
psychiatric evaluation 
she still maintains her innocence but says i dont have any 
reason to go on i dont have any reason to live whether im 
innocent doesnt matter they can go ahead and execute me 
groshong said 
matoesian said he considered mrs sims capable of proceeding

about 1000 hotel bar and restaurant 
workers and owners marched on the mayors office thursday to 
protest the ban on alcohol sales after midnight he imposed last 
month in the center of the capital 
joining them were dozens of prostitutes in tight jeans who 
complain their trade also is being hurt 
mayor claudio fermin decreed that alcohol sales be prohibited in 
caracass federal district after midnight as an anticrime measure 
the prohibition cuts across the center of caracas with the eastern 
and southern sectors of the city not affected 
its ruined my business how can i tell a client he has to 
leave after hes just sat down with a beer asked joao sosa 
abreu owner of a restaurantbar in downtown caracas 
several bar owners insisted that the liquor curfew has done 
little to fight crime 
theyre clamping down on my business and all it does is it 
makes people go drink up in the hills and shoot each other up 
there sosa abreu said 
national guard and police units in charge of enforcing the 
decree make life difficult for the prostitutes who abound in the 
center of the city at night 
many of the women call themselves dancers and models 
one bar worker carmen guzman complained why should they 
stop me from making a living ive got four kids 
ms guzman said her minimum wage paid by the bar had been cut in 
half to about 25 cents a night 
most women who work in caracas bars as entertainers or barmaids 
can bring home from 70 cents to slightly over a dollar a night 
depending on tips said ms guzman 
bar owners estimate they are losing an average of about 1200 a 
month in business from the prohibition 
the mayor did not meet with the marchers a merchants 
association sent him a letter demanding that the liquor ban be 
imposed at some later hour than midnight but no response was 
received said owners in the march 
during the protest march a dozen metropolitan police in riot 
gear stood guard in front of the municipal palace which contains 
the mayors office 
fermin is the first mayor of the federal district elected by 
direct vote about 70 percent of eligible voters didnt cast 
ballots in the dec 3 election

three men accused of supplying 75 percent 
of the citys heroin were ordered to pay the costs of keeping them 
in federal prison for terms ranging from two to 6 years 
the defendants will be charged 1200 a month in addition to 
91 a month for the cost of supervised probation once theyre out 
of prison 
its the just thing to do said chief us district court 
judge francis j boyle to the extent that a defendant is able to 
pay for it the defendant should be required to 
the men pleaded guilty to a variety of drug charges and were 
sentenced friday by us district judge ernest c torres who ruled 
after reading a presentencing report that found the men able to pay 
the defendants are oscar tillett 38 sentenced to 6 years and 
fined 60000 on three counts of selling heroin luis cepeda 39 
sentenced to 27 months and fined 15000 for selling heroin and 
esteban colon 39 sentenced to 2 years and fined 40000 for 
selling herion and possessing the drug with intent to distribute 
federal prosecutors alleged the men were responsible for 
distributing 75 percent of the citys heroin 
federal judges in providence have ordered defendants to pay for 
their own incarceration a couple of dozen times since the the 
option was opened to them in november 1987 said donald wyatt the 
us marshal in providence 
an attempt to adopt a similar sentencing option at the state 
level failed in the rhode island general assembly in 1988 
opponents including the local chapter of the american civil 
liberties union argued the practice would unfairly take money from 
convicts families 
florida had a similar law on the books from 1979 through 1981 
but it was repealed because annual administrative costs were 
89673 compared to total collections of 7636 over the three 
years

the decision by attorney general dick 
thornburgh to seek an independent counsel investigation of former 
hud secretary samuel r pierce jr and other former department 
officials is the latest development in nearly a year of disclosures 
about reaganera problems at the agency here are highlights 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
pierce the only cabinet member to serve for the entire eight 
years of the reagan administration told congress early in its 
review of the agencys problems that he was not a hands on 
manager and that he took no direct role in contract awards later 
testimony and hud documents however showed pierce intervened to 
assist a north carolina development supported by a former law 
associate and that he personally lifted sanctions against a hud 
lender after being lobbied by former hud secretary carla hills 
numerous other accounts have demonstrated that pierce intervened in 
numerous cases suggesting a more active role than he indicated in 
his initial congressional testimony pierce refused testify later 
citing his constitutional protection against selfincrimination

it was an audit of this program by huds inspector general that 
set off the investigations of pierces tenure the audit said 
former agency officials and developers who hired prominent 
republican consultants won the lions share of subsidies under the 
program the audit also said that many participants had bloated 
mortgages and because of that were receiving excessive subsidies 
costing hud and taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars 
among the gop consultants called before congress was former 
interior secretary james watt who made more than 300000 lobbying 
hud and fred bush who is no relation to president bush but was a 
major fundraiser for his election campaign president bush 
withdrew an ambassadorial nomination of fred bush after gop

questioned the conduct of then assistant secretary thomas demery 
saying many of the recipients of the lucrative subsidies were 
donors to a charity demery helped found but the justice department 
declined to prosecute demery the senate ethics committee also is 
investigating whether new york republican alfonse damato used his

a senior plo official said thursday his 
organization will send a delegation to moscow to ask that jewish 
emigration to israelioccupied territories be restricted 
the plans were revealed after israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir suggested last month that israel needed to keep the occupied 
lands to settle the expected wave of immigrants which israel says 
may total 300000 in the next three years 
azzam alahmed the palestinian ambassador in baghdad told the 
associated press the delegation will include leaders of the 
palestine liberation organizations various factions and members of 
the plo executive committee 
he said the plo leadership which discussed the problem in its 
latest meeting in tunis decided to send the delegation to put the 
request to the soviet leadership no date was mentioned 
israeli officials have said 4700 jews left the soviet union in 
january and 4600 of them came to israel the plo fears the influx 
will eventually change the balance of population in the occupied 
territories 
presently about 70000 jews live in more than 120 settlements in 
the west bank and gaza about 15 million palestinian arabs live in 
the territories seized by israel in the 1967 arabisraeli war 
alahmed did not say exactly what the plo wants the kremlin to 
do to stop the influx 
arab diplomats said the plo wants moscow to pressure washington 
to allow more jews to settle in the united states following recent 
measures by washington to restrict the influx of soviet jews 
alahmed said moscow can take political and administrative 
measures to discourage its jewish population from emigrating to 
israel he did not elaborate 
palestinian officials also have been complaining that soviet 
news media do not give wide coverage to the 26monthold 
intefadeh or uprising in the occupied territories 
they say more coverage would highlight problems that wouldbe 
jewish emigrants could face if they chose to go to the occupied 
territories and discourage such emigration 
in tunis a top soviet diplomat told the plo wednesday that 
moscow shares the same concerns over possible settlement of 
soviet jews in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
soviet deputy foreign minister gennadi tarassov expressed his 
views to the plos executive committee

where hundreds of thousands of people had gathered in tribute 
to them near the us interest section which handles us 
diplomatic affairs in cuba

wednesday by the mexican navy and searched by mexican officials 
who said they found no drugs 
cuba has filed a protest with the united states over the 
incident whcih took place as the freighter crossed the gulf of 
mexico between cuba and mexico

barbarism appears willing to obstruct normal commerce between cuba 
and mexico a cuban official in washington said according to 
prensa latina 
the coast guard ended its attempt to stop the hermann when the 
freighter entered mexican waters 
mexican officials searched the 250foot freighter which is

law enforcement activity 
but cubas ambassador in mexico jose fernandez de cossio said 
in tampico that cuba will file a complaint about the incident with 
the un human rights commission 
the incident prensa latina quoted castro as saying was a 
demonstration of the courage of our people its what i would have 
expected in the face of a yankee attack

harbor authorities saying the hermann owned by the cuban guamar

the dramatic lunch counter sitin 30 
years ago that helped ignite the 1960s civil rights movement 
surprised everyone even the four black participants who reenacted 
it thursday at woolworths 
we were scared recalled franklin mccain one of the four 
college students who staged the first lunch counter sitin on feb 
1 1960 all i wanted was a coke and a doughnut 
if someone had come up behind me and said boo i probably 
would have fallen off the stool said another protester david 
richmond 
when mccain and his three college friends took their same seats 
thursday they were treated like celebrities a black woolworth 
executive greeted them before they sat down to a breakfast of eggs 
grits bacon and coffee 
mccain richmond joseph mcneil and jibreel khazan formerly 
ezell blair jr were surrounded by dozens of reporters and 
spectators when they ordered food from two female employees who 
worked there on feb 1 1960 
woolworth vice president aubrey lewis noted that 30 years ago 
he too would have been denied service im proud you had the 
courage to open the doors for a movement lewis said 
while they waited for their meals some spectators began singing 
we shall overcome outside there was more singing directed by 
the naacp and some bystanders carried placards saying feb 1 
1960 it seems like only yesterday but it could be tomorrow and 
the only thing thats worthwhile is change remembering feb 1 
1960 
one thing that hasnt changed much is the lunch counter which 
looks about the same as it did in 30yearold news photographs 
about the sitin but now black and white customers sit side by 
side on the chrome and red vinyl seats ordering food and 
discussing sports and events of the day 
when the four north carolina aampt state university freshmen 
refused to leave the whitesonly counter 30 years ago their sitin 
touched off similar protests across the south 
during their sitin which began about 4 pm a policeman stood 
near them and slapped his billyclub in the palm of his hand a few 
times but they were not threatened with arrest the store was 
closed at 5 pm a halfhour early and they left peacefully 
we did get some encouragement on the first day and we got it 
from quarters you wouldnt ordinarily expect it to come from 
mccain said there was a little old white lady of oh 75 years of 
age who came over and placed hands on our shoulders and said to 
us boys im so proud of you the only thing i regret is that it 
didnt happen 20 years earlier 
people took us for granted because we were poor youth 
freshmen in college khazan said in america people dont 
really believe young people can do anything to make positive change 
in society 
weve achieved some rights but theres many more rights that 
havent been achieved 
elizabeth koopman an education professor at guilford college 
recalled reading about the protests back in michigan 
it shook the world she said you knew it was coming like 
the berlin wall bursting open 
geneva tisdale who is black was one of those working at the 
woolworths lunch counter on feb 1 1960 she remembers the four 
students coming in that day 
i thought they were joking she said thursday i never 
thought they were serious 
another counter worker ima edwards who is white said she 
didnt see it blossoming into this 
after thursdays breakfast the four went outside where the 
street in front of the store was renamed february one place a 
plaque and their footprints were dedicated to commemorate the 
anniversary 
other events are planned through sunday to mark the occasion 
bill bellow who said he was seated at the counter when the 
students took their seats back on feb 1 1960 embraced khazan 
outside the store 
i was right there in the middle two on each side he said 
i wouldnt leave i told the lady to serve them these kids had a 
right to sit down to a cup of coffee 
bellow 64 said his support for the students did not sit well 
with many of his friends in greensboro they got on my side two 
or three years later he said 
the four said they had targeted woolworth because it was a 
wellknown national chain that allowed its lunch counters to be 
segregated only in the south 
the sitins quickly spread to more than 50 cities in nine states 
all of us were surprised that it spread so rapidly to other 
cities said mcneil six months later it began to wane but we 
hung in and persevered we saw it to the end 
on july 25 1960 woolworth agreed to allow blacks at the lunch 
counter later accounts reported the chain lost about 200000 in 
business during the sitins

mayor david dinkins proposed a record 278 
billion budget thursday and said he had no choice but to seek 550 
million in new taxes and to cut city services to the bone to 
balance it 
the city faces a budget shortfall of 445 million for the 
current fiscal year which ends june 30 and a gap of more than 1 
billion in the 1991 budget said dinkins who took office jan 1 
replacing edward koch 
let me be very plain dinkins said at a city hall news 
conference service reductions are inevitable higher taxes are 
necessary sacrifices will be required on this we have no 
choice 
he said the 226 million in service cuts will include 
eliminating one fire battalion for a savings of 425000 cutting 
45 million in funds for libraries and cultural institutions and 
scaling back training of new math science and computer teachers 
worst of all he said would be a delay in hiring 2708 
additional police officers until sometime in fiscal 1991 the 
department has 26000 officers 
the mayor blamed the citys budget squeeze on falling revenues 
a reduction in aid from washington and a variety of items the 
state requires the city to fund 
under the dinkins budget 180 million in new property taxes 
would be raised homeowners would pay an average 33 a year more 
than they presently do and property taxes on midtown manhattan 
office space would be raised 19 cents per square foot 
a threeyear 75 percent surcharge in the citys personal 
income tax would raise 200 million and cost the average taxpayer 
70 annually 
he also proposed raising city gasoline taxes and a variety of 
other levies depending on the levy to be changed the proposals 
would require action by the state legislature the city council or 
both bodies

the united states on thursday clashed with china 
and cuba at the annual session of the un human rights commission 
after the two communist countries criticized the us invasion of 
panama 
morris abram the us ambassador to the united nations in 
geneva called on the hardline leaderships in beijing and havana 
to test their totalitarian regimes by following the recent 
examples of chile and el salvador and hold elections 
abram criticized china for saying it regretted civilian deaths 
during the us action last december in panama while remaining 
silent on the loss of hundreds of chinese lives at the hands of the 
army in tiananmen square last june 
diplomats expressed surprise at the strength of the criticism 
against beijing because of the bush administrations recent 
conciliatory moves and restoration of highlevel contacts with 
china after washingtons initial outrage at the violent suppression 
of prodemocracy demonstrators 
in a speech to the 43nation commission chinese delegate zhan 
daode said his country was shocked at the largescale armed 
invasion and military occupation of panama by the united states 
the chinese delegation strongly calls on the united states to 
put an immediate end to its acts of aggression and to withdraw 
unconditionally all its troops from panama zhan told the meeting 
the head of the cuban delegation raul roa called on the un 
body to condemn the us action saying the meeting must respond to 
the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms for the panamanian 
people 
this commission can not remain silent in the face of this 
monstrous aggression or of the specious and cynical arguments 
advanced to justify it roa said 
defending the us intervention abram criticized cuba and china 
for saying nothing about the human rights abuses perpetrated by 
deposed panamanian leader gen manuel noriega now in miami facing 
drug trafficking charges 
how do these representatives of china and cuba explain the 
enormous outpouring of support for the restoration of panamas 
rightful rulers he said citing an opinion poll that showed 95 
percent support for the new government of guillermo endara 
when did cuba last have an opinion poll he added 
the united states has said cuba should be placed on the un 
list of countries causing special concern because of their human 
rights record the delegation head at the sixweek meeting in 
geneva is former cuban political prisoner armando valladares 
the human rights meeting which started monday lasts until 
march 9 
in addition to the national representatives on the commission 
the meeting is attended by observers from most other un member 
states and about 150 private rights groups

residents of a neighborhood that was 
devastated by a train derailment and subsequent gas pipeline 
explosion sued southern pacific railroad and the pipeline company 
for negligence thursday 
the suit filed in superior court on behalf of 349 plaintiffs in 
san bernadino alleges negligence and conscious disregard of 
safety by the railroad and calnev pipe line co in the fatal 
accidents said attorney james h davis 
the amount sought for general compensatory and punitive damages 
was not specified davis said 
others named in the suit include the city and county of san 
bernardino the chairman of southern pacific and other individuals 
four people died and 30 were injured on may 12 1989 when a 
freight train roared out of control down a mountain pass and 
derailed throwing rail cars into the neighborhood 
brake failure and a flawed estimate of the load carried by the 
train contributed to the derailment according to testimony at 
federal hearings held last summer 
thirteen days after the derailment an underground fuel pipeline 
near the accident site exploded killing two people and injuring 31 
calnev had examined the pipeline which supplies 90 percent of 
las vegas gas after the derailment and declared it safe 
federal investigators have said they believe either the impact 
of the train accident or heavy equipment used to clean up debris 
from it weakened the buried pipeline ultimately causing it to 
explode 
however testimony during the hearings held by the national 
transportation safety board failed to establish a causal link 
between the two disasters an ntsb report on the hearings is 
pending 
most of the 90 families represented by the lawsuit lived on 
duffy and mcdonald streets davis said a total of nearly 20 homes 
were destroyed in the derailment and pipeline explosion and the 
area remains a total desert he said 
twenty years of my life ive lived there and it all went up 
in smoke nancy fricks a former duffy street resident told a 
news conference thursday and they dont even want to compensate 
us for anything 
she claimed that calnev has offered her 43000 for her lost 
home but she contends it was worth 87000 
other plaintiffs in the lawsuit live on adjacent streets and 
alleged that their property values have dropped and they have 
suffered emotional distress davis alleged 
we were aware there were numerous claimants damaged or injured 
as a result of the derailment responded southern pacific 
spokesman bob taggart he said 200 claims have been settled so far 
and that the railroad remains anxious to reach a mutually 
satisfying settlement of others 
if were unable to do that a jury will decide he said 
calnev spokesman richard kline said the company hadnt seen the 
lawsuit yet and couldnt comment on it but he said the company has 
worked to help residents recover from the accident by providing 
financial and medical assistance and offering to pay market value 
for homes destroyed in the blast 
davis also criticized southern pacific and calnev for what he 
said was their failure to take steps to ensure against similar 
accidents in the future 
southern pacific spokesman robert taggart called the allegation 
irresponsible and inaccurate and said procedures had been 
changed

buy 65 jeeps congressional sources said thursday

appointed next week said the sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity

representatives from the social christian and movement toward 
socialism mas parties the sources said

thousands of gold miners some 
smashing windows and beating passersby rampaged in a remote 
northwestern city thursday against a government order to stop 
prospecting on indian land officials said 
justice minister saulo ramos who arrived under guard at an air 
force base in boa vista about 3000 miles northwest of rio said 
the government is prepared to drive the prospectors off the indian 
lands if necessary 
we will carry out our objective at any cost said ramos in 
a televised interview from the city which is the capital of 
roraima state bordering venezuela and is the main supply point for 
miners 
the government thursday ordered 40000 miners to move off the 
yanomami indian reservation they have illegally mined since 1987 in 
exchange for a 247000acre chunk of virgin amazon rain forest 
bordering it 
environmentalists called that agreement a defeat for the 
9000member yanomami tribe one of the worlds most primitive who 
lost their claim to traditional lands and have no safeguards 
against disease and pollution caused by miners 
early thursday thousands of chanting miners with stones and 
clubs converged on the citys main square demanding a meeting with 
ramos and a new agreement allowing them to mine more amazon 
territory 
the miners took over the business district town hall and 
airport battering pedestrians and breaking windshields of passing 
cars said police capt wellington silva dos santos 
the miners are very agitated and the situation is a powder 
keg said santos by phone from boa vista a city of 43000 people 
globo tv the nations largest network showed riot police with 
submachine guns and clubs pushing back stonethrowing crowds of 
miners from airport landing strips 
the miners contend the santa rosa cooperative 12 miles 
northeast of the mineralrich yanomami reservation was far less 
than what the government agreed to give them three weeks ago 
under the former agreement the prospectors were to receive 
three tracts of national park land totaling 16 million acres 
we were tricked by the government said elton ronehlt owner 
of the gold amazon company and a miner representative it 
promised us one thing and gave us another 
federal police still controlled some 100 clandestine jungle 
airstrips and were supervising the withdrawal of the miners to the 
new area said ovidio de araujo of the justice ministrys human 
rights defense council in brasilia the capital 
but he added force will be used against those miners who do 
not leave the area immediately 
environmentalists warn the miners will spill off into indian 
reservations in neighboring amazon states and decimate other tribes 
the showdown between the miners and the government over indians 
rights came to a boil in early january when international pressure 
prompted the goverment to announce a 4 million campaign to expel 
the prospectors by force if needed 
there are about 220000 native indians left in brazil down from 
an estimated 5 million when the portuguese first landed here in 
1500

the prosecution rested in the assault trial of 
john gotti on thursday after jurors heard members of a gang say on 
tape that they had shot a union official as a favor to the reputed 
mob boss 
the secretly recorded tapes seemed to contradict an 11th hour 
defense suggestion that john f oconnor former business manager 
of carpenters union local 608 might have been shot in the buttocks 
by rival union members may 7 1986 
prosecutors allege that gotti reputed boss of the gambino crime 
family commissioned the irishamerican gang called the westies 
to shoot oconnor because the union official led the trashing of a 
mobaffiliated restaurant being constructed with nonunion labor 
gotti 49 and anthony guerrieri 60 an alleged gambino 
soldier are on trial in state court on charges of assault and 
conspiracy in the nonfatal shooting 
the prosecution rested after the jury heard the tapes bruce 
cutler gottis lawyer said the defense would decide thursday 
night whether to call character witnesses and a tape recording 
expert 
the tapes were recorded at rikers island jail during a visit by 
westies member kevin kelly and his friend larry palermo to 
francis mickey featherstone a former westies leader 
transcripts of the tape the accuracy of which are in dispute 
show that featherstone was the first to mention oconnors 
shooting kelly and palermo were unaware featherstone was an 
informer and that a microphone was hidden behind a picture on the 
wall near them 
featherstone says i knew you guys did it 
kelly refers to westies member joe schlereth identified as the 
gunman in trial testimony by westies informer james mcelroy 
i recommended joe the lather kelly tells featherstone 
joe schlereth you know joe 
at another point kelly says the guy was there and he popped 
him 
when featherstone asks who requested the shooting kelly replies 
it was done for the greaseballs he says the westies 
volunteered their services to gotti at the funeral of gambino 
family underboss frank decicco 
a principal defense tactic has been to challenge the quality of 
the tapes and the integrity of the transcripts 
gerald shargel guerrieris attorney has introduced transcripts 
used in a federal case and made from the same tapes as those heard 
by the gotti jury the state and federal transcripts each contain 
things that arent found in the other 
acting justice edward mclaughlin told jurors that what they hear 
on the tapes and how they interpret it is what counts he said he 
was unsure he would allow them to take the transcripts into the 
jury room during deliberations 
mclaughlin told the jurors they would hear closing arguments 
monday and begin deliberations tuesday

foreign ministers will take place this month to pave the way for 
israelipalestinian talks 
yossi banaharon shamirs office director said israel had not 
received a us invitation for such a meeting 
he said it was not likely to take place before next wednesdays

party rivals opposed to peace concessions 
personally realistically i think it will not happen before 
that i think it will take place shortly afterward during this 
month the timing is not important benaharon said on israel

arens did not reject the idea of a meeting in the near future 
baker arens and egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid 
would attend 
the maariv daily said baker said baker made the call after the 
palestine liberation organization reportedly agreed to us 
compromise proposals concerning palestinian negotiators 
the liberal daily haaretz quoted political sources in jerusalem 
as saying that baker considers the meeting to be the moment of 
truth and wants to come out of it with a date for the start of 
palestinianisraeli talks in cairo 
he will reject any attempt by arens to ask for additional us 
assurances concerning the palestinianisraeli talks haaretz quoted 
the sources as saying 
israel has asked for ironclad us guarantees that the plo be 
kept out peace talks but washington only promised that the plo 
would not participate in negotiations at this stage 
israel calls the plo a terrorist organization and refuses to 
negotiate with it

one of the nations largest subsidized housing 
landlords has been suspended from future government work because of 
a fraud investigation the department of housing and urban 
development said thursday 
hud in a letter to one of the companys affiliates said the 
government has information indicating irregularities of a serious 
nature and that the company and its affiliates were being 
investigated 
the more than 40 affiliated companies are led by associated 
financial corp of california and together control nearly 50000 
units of federally assisted housing afcs president is a bruce 
rozet a prominent democratic fundraiser who in 1988 was a jesse 
jackson delegate to the democratic national convention 
rozet in a statement and additional comments issued through a 
spokesman called huds action pure harassment for political 
reasons that ultimately would harm the lowincome families the 
agency is supposed to serve 
he denied any wrongdoing and vowed to fight the suspension and 
accused hud of taking the action to avoid a hearing scheduled for 
next week on lesser sanctions against an afc affiliate 
meanwhile the washington post said in friday editions that a 
hotel partly owned by rozet wrote off a 30000 debt owed by 
jacksons 1988 presidential campaign under federal election law 
the campaign would have to report the sum either as an outstanding 
debt or as a contribution 
in this case such a contribution would be illegal because it 
comes from a corporation individual contributions are limited by 
law to 1000 per election per candidate 
jacksons campaign reports to the federal election commission 
made no mention of the bill owed to the hollywood roosevelt hotel 
in los angeles and james hewitt a lawyer for the campaign told 
the newspaper that the debt should have been listed 
the newspaper reported that the debt was written off after the 
hotel was able to collect just 45000 of an overall debt of 
75000 and cited an internal memorandum saying the unpaid balance 
was a gift from rozet 
hud general counsel francis keating said afc and its affiliates 
were being investigated by the departments inspector general law 
enforcement sources also said the us attorneys office in los 
angeles was investigating the companies 
those sources speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
charles bazarian a man rozet used as a property scout who later 
was convicted of skimming money a from hudassisted project was 
cooperating with investigators 
but the sources declined to discuss the substance of the probe 
and the los angeles prosecutor handling it lee weidman declined 
comment 
rozet and afc have had a number of runins with hud over the 
past decade including several in the last year and rozet has said 
firstyear hud secretary jack kemp has allowed bureaucrats with old 
grudges against the company to dictate hud policy toward afc 
kemp visited one afc property shortly after taking office last 
year and termed conditions there scandalous kemps top deputy 
also has called rozet and his companies slumlords 
but community leaders in several areas with afc properties have 
defended the company and rozet often is called on by congress as 
an expert on housing policy one of rozets biggest defenders in 
congress is sen alan cranston dcalif for whom rozet has been a 
major fundraiser 
hud announced the suspension in a letter to an afc affiliate 
housing resources management inc which is controlled by rozet 
partner deane e ross 
also affected by the suspension are afc and more that 40 related 
development and investment companies involved in the purchase and 
management of governmentassisted housing and the syndication of 
tax credits developers of such projects receive from the government 
afc speaking on behalf of its affiliate denied that housing 
resources management was involved in any improper activities even 
if those allegations were true afc said a suspension was 
unwarranted because the allegations involved about 35000 
afcs properties generate 80 million a year in rents the 
company said 
the suspension will have no impact on existing properties owned 
and managed by afc and its affiliates but will block the company 
indefinitely from trying to buy or manage any additional 
hudassisted properties or from seeking any new government work 
huds letter was sent to ross on friday and released by hud 
officials thursday 
in addition to the investigation hud said it had adequate 
evidence that housing resources management was involved in 
irregularities involving alleged misuse of security deposits 
and reserve funds at apartment complexes it managed in new orleans 
oklahoma and washington dc 
hud also alleged that the company was involved in requesting 
rental subsidies for vacant units and submitting false repair 
invoices at two oklahoma properties 
among the allegations hud made in the letter was that hrm 
misused security deposit accounts at southgate apartments in 
watonga okla that is the same project involved in the hudrelated 
case against bazarian 
bazarian is serving a sentence on an unrelated bank fraud 
conviction and as part of a plea agreement admitted skimming 
government funds from southgate bazarian is scheduled to be 
sentenced in that case next week

wednesday less than four hours before he was to fly to los angeles 
where he was to visit his daughter before reporting to the federal 
correctional facility at boron calif to begin a fouryear prison 
term for witness tampering and obstruction 
i choose death before dishonor bordallo wrote on another 
placard my loving wife has my message which she will impart 
to the people of guam in due time 
an aide to his wife territorial sen madeleine bordallo said 
the senator had not found such a message 
reporters who attended a farewell party for bordallo earlier in 
the day said he had appeared to be in good spirits 
i didnt think this would happen congressional del ben 
blaz said from washington ricky bordallo always seemed to bounce 
back from his many adversities 
at a busy downtown intersection bordallo shot himself with a 
38caliber pistol while chained to the statue of chief quipuha 
the first chief in guam to adopt christianity dennis said 
he died a short time later of massive brain damage according to 
a spokesman at the guam naval hospital mrs bordallo was 
reportedly with him when he died 
territorial flags were lowered to halfstaff and gov joseph 
ada declared a state of mourning until after bordallos funeral 
which is yet to be scheduled 
bordallo told the pacific daily news in an interview last friday 
that he was facing his prison term with complete serenity 
when a man is innocent his conscience is clear and he is at 
peace with himself bordallo said 
but he also said my own instincts make me believe that i will 
not be coming back from boron alive im not dwelling on how it 
will happen i will be in the hands of people who are masters of 
intrigue 
bordallo was found guilty in february 1987 of getting engineer 
johnny carpio to lie to federal officials about a 60000 political 
contribution from a group of japanese businessmen 
during his trial bordallo admitted accepting money from the 
businessmen but contended the money was a campaign contribution 
carpio was convicted of extortion and bribery and was placed on 
five years probation 
bordallo a democrat served as governor from 1974 to 1978 and 
again from 1982 to 1986 when he was defeated by republican ada

cnn stands by the newsman who reported mikhail 
gorbachev was considering resigning as head of the soviet communist 
party a network executive said wednesday but cnn chief ted turner 
said the report was based on rumor 
other news organizations carried tuesdays report attributing 
it to cnn but turner told an atlanta press club luncheon wednesday 
it was no scoop 
how can you scoop a rumor he said if rumors become 
scoops then every media will have one 
cnn moscow correspondent steve hurst quoted a a wellinformed 
and usually reliable communist party source as saying that 
gorbachev was thinking of stepping down as party general secretary 
but remaining president of the soviet union 
gorbachev on wednesday denied the report 
all this is groundless he replied to a question about the 
report from reporters covering his meeting with brazilian 
presidentelect fernando collor de mello it is in someones 
interest to propagate such things 
cnn on wednesday continued reporting that gorbachev had thought 
about resigning but added that hurst a 12year moscow veteran 
said his initial information could be a trial balloon or just 
a rumor by people opposed to gorbachev rule 
ed turner executive vice president of news gathering for cnn 
said the network was not backing off the story but was continuing 
to report developments 
we believed in hursts source because i have great confidence 
and faith in him said ed turner who is no relation to ted 
turner you go with what you believe is the story he knows when 
he thinks he has a solid story all you can do is trust your 
people

cardinal john j oconnor said wednesday that a 
bishop never condemned gov mario cuomo to hell but instead told 
him his abortion beliefs were contributing to the loss of his 
soul 
auxiliary bishop austin vaughan 62 was quoted by news media 
last week as saying from the albany county jail in albany that 
cuomo was in danger of going to hell if he dies tonight 
vaughan pastor of st patricks church in newburgh was serving 
a 15day jail sentence for blocking the entrance to a planned 
parenthood clinic during an antiabortion protest in albany last 
march 
cuomo considered a potential 1992 presidential candidate has 
said he and his wife accept the roman catholic churchs teaching on 
abortion in their private life but that abortion is a matter of a 
womans own conscience he budgets about 15 million a year in 
state funds to pay for abortions for poor women 
oconnor had refused to comment on the matter until he could 
speak to vaughan in a column published wednesday in the catholic 
new york newspaper the cardinal said vaughan assured him he had 
been misunderstood 
what the bishop told me he actually said was that the governor 
is quite possibly contributing to the loss of his soul to me 
that sounds significantly different from cursing or condemning 
the governor to hell oconnor said 
the cardinal said vaughan said he was well aware that he has 
no power whatsoever to condemn anyone to hell 
he would agree with the governor completely that such an 
unpleasant task is exclusively the prerogative of a much higher and 
wiser power he said 
cuomo responded to oconnors column with a terse twosentence 
statement the cardinal says the bishop was misquoted im glad

a federal appeals court on wednesday 
reinstated a suit by a former los angeles prosecutor who claimed he 
was smeared after objecting to tactics in the twilight zone 
manslaughter case 
gary kesselman who was removed as prosecutor in the case 
against film director john landis sued los angeles deputy district 
attorney lea dagostino several supervisors and district attorney 
ira reiner for defamation wrongful firing and civil rights 
violations over disputes arising from the case 
us district judge dickran tevrizian had dismissed the suit on 
the grounds that the prosecutors were legally immune from suit 
even if kesselman could prove all of his allegations 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals disagreed wednesday 
returning the case to tevrizian for more pretrial proceedings 
landis and his codefendants were acquitted in 1987 of 
involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of actor vic morrow and two 
children on the twilight zone movie set in july 1982 
kesselman who was first assigned to prosecute the case said he 
was removed before the trial at his own request but a supervisor 
said he was removed for cause 
his suit involved testimony by a prosecution witness donna 
schuman that she had disclosed certain information to kesselman 
who had replied that he had planned to conceal it and spring it on 
the defense as a surprise kesselman denied the testimony and said 
she had never given her the information 
after that he said ms dagostino and supervisors in the 
office began a campaign to harass and discredit him 
kesselman now a private lawyer also contended he was fired 
from the office in retaliation for filing the suit the county 
denied it 
his dismissal came shortly after his arrest in 1987 for 
investigation of lewd conduct that case ended in a nocontest plea 
to disturbing the peace 
gregory petersen a lawyer for kesselman said he expected to 
prove that the prosecutor was fired for refusing to go along with 
the program of the offices approach to the case 
john collins a lawyer for the county and the prosecutors whom 
kesselman sued said he hoped the court would find them immune from 
suit for all matters related to presentation of evidence in the 
case

a top soviet diplomat told the plo 
leadership wednesday that moscow shares its concerns over possible 
settlement of soviet jews in the israelioccupied lands 
soviet deputy foreign minister gennadi tarassov expressed his 
views to the plos executive committee soviet diplomatic sources 
in the tunisian capital said the committee has been meeting since 
tuesday on the question of soviet jewish emigration 
tarassov later visited privately with plo chairman yasser arafat 
and reiterated his countrys support for an independent palestinian 
state palestinian sources said 
the soviet official also was to meet with chedli klibi 
secretary general of the arab league who said monday that soviet 
jews were being forced to emigrate to israel against their will 
neither soviet nor palestinian sources said whether tarassov 
made any commitment to control the departure of soviet jews for 
israel 
the soviet union has repeatedly expressed its opposition to 
jewish settlement in the occupied west bank and gaza strip where 
palestinian residents have waged a twoyear uprising against 
israeli rule 
israeli officials have predicted 300000 soviet jews will arrive 
in israeli in the next three years under relaxed soviet emigration 
rules 
arafat has called on the soviet union to curtail the migration 
while iraqi president saddam hussein of iraq has accused the united 
states of closing its doors to soviet jews to force the emigrants 
to settle in israel 
the united states has a global annual immigration ceiling of 
270000 
arafat and other arab leaders fear that expanded settlement of 
soviet and other jews in the territories will make a negotiated 
peace settlement with israel more difficult perhaps impossible 
presently about 70000 jews live in more that 120 settlements in 
the west bank and gaza about 12000 soviet jews arrived in israel 
last year but israeli officials expect the annual number to soar to 
more than 100000 in the next few years 
israel captured the territories in the 1967 middle east war the 
plo hopes to establish an independent state in the territories 
whose populations are overwhelmingly arab

congress is proposing further deep cuts in us and soviet troop 
strength in europe and declaring that time has come to swiftly 
conclude agreements limiting conventional strategic and chemical 
weapons 
today with communism crumbling our aim must be to ensure 
democracys advance the president said wednesday night in a 
state of the union speech that blended his new troop withdrawal 
proposal with a pledge to withdraw the remainder of the us 
invasion force from panama by the end of the month 
in a surprise overture bush proposed cutting military manpower 
in europe to 195000 troops on each side down from the 275000 
figure that was the us bargaining position at conventional force 
negotiations in vienna 
the president said he called soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
earlier in the day to inform him of the offer which already had 
been endorsed by nato allies the move bush said was a response 
to the revolution of 89 in which he said the united states 
stands at the center of a widening circle of freedom

researchers say the dead sea 
was a lively commercial center as far back as 2300 years ago not 
anywhere near like it is today with few boats and only sparse 
settlement along the shores 
the research may also throw new light on the essenes who lived 
in the area casting doubt on the accepted theory that they were 
isolated hermits 
arieh nissenbaum a geochemist said three stone anchors and 
mooring ropes found recently in the dead sea were the first 
datable evidence to support the theory that the dead sea was an 
active place for commerce in the 4th century bc 
he said carbon 14 testing at the weizmann institute of science 
in rehovot on wellpreserved fiber rope fragments left open the 
possibilty that the anchors were from ships sunk in the first 
middle east oil war 
the dead sea was not so dead this is a misleading name given 
to the lake by the british said gideon hadas an antiquities 
authority archaeologist 
according to ancient historians a huge naval battle was fought 
in 312 bc when antigonus the seleucid ruler of syria tried to 
seize control of the trade in asphalt which naturally forms from 
evaporating petroleum he was repelled by the superior archery of 
the nabateans of southern jordan who were backed by egypt 
although there was uncertainty about the date because of a 
100year margin of error in dating nissenbaum said it is possible 
that the anchors are mute witnesses to that battle 
hadas found the 220pound anchors along the western shore of the 
lake which at 1292 feet below sea level is the lowest spot on 
earth 
he said the ropes were well preserved because of the high salt 
content of the water and suggested other remains even wooden 
boats might also be nestling in the seabed 
asphalt which came to the surface in large blocks from fissures 
in the seabed was the prize of ancient traders nissenbaum said it 
was used as mortar for buildings an embalming agent in the 
egyptians mummification process a medicine to treat skin wounds 
and as a bugkiller 
in a new study of dead sea shipping nissenbaum said that up to 
the end of the crusader era there was active boat traffic on the 
lake ships ferried wheat and corn grown in southern jordan along 
the 50mile length of the salt sea to the northern end where roads 
led to jericho and jerusalem 
a large israelite farming community grew at ein gedi on the lake 
shore and hasmonean kings built a series of fortresses in the area 
the dead sea region surrounded by barren mountains and rocky 
desert fell into economic decline after the crusader period today 
the only boats on the lake are a few israeli military patrol craft 
just a few small settlements occupy its shores and foreign 
visitors come mostly to the health spas that promote the curative 
powers especially for those afflicted with skin diseases of the 
dead sea waters and mineralrich mud 
robert eisenman chairman of the religious studies department at 
california state university in long beach suggests todays image 
of the dead sea as a lifeless region may be the basis of a 
misleading view of the essenes keepers of the dead sea scrolls 
traditional theories about the sect portrays them as a small 
isolated community of hermits who sought refuge in a remote 
wilderness but he suggests this may not have been the case 
his 15member surveying and mapping expedition recently 
completed a study of the qumran caves at the northern end of the 
dead sea it was there that the scrolls dating to the second 
century bc were discovered in 1947 
eisenman said his survey explored 282 desert caves along a 
13mile stretch of coast and found pottery as well as other 
evidence of man living in 62 of them he said a 1952 survey found 
only 230 caves in the area and suggested man could live in only 17 
eisenman added that his findings indicated there could be more 
scrollbearing caves in the area and that many more had been 
inhabitated that originally suggested 
there was a lot of habitation he said pointing to pottery 
shards in front of a large cave halfway up the side of a cliff of 
brittle rock shale 
this means it was not isolated like a lot of people think the 
idea of hermetic essenes contemplating their navels in isolation is 
rather peculiar

early in its life cbs news sunday morning 
aired a profile of jazz pianist and educator billy taylor which 
led to a job that made him somewhat of an anomaly in todays 
network television 
sunday morning hired him to regularly chronicle other 
jazzfolk and singers and he pretty much had the field to himself 
until last year when nbcs sunday today hired jonathan 
schwartz for reports that include jazz 
this sunday taylor starts his eighth year on cbs sunday 
program with a report on marcus roberts the pianist for jazz and 
classical trumpeter wynton marsalis 
like more than a few of the people the twotime emmy winner has 
interviewed roberts may not be wellknown to viewers 
but its my job to say well look heres a guy whos 
interesting and they might go and check him out taylor said 
taylor whose betterknown subjects have included ella 
fitzgerald quincy jones maynard ferguson and max roach was 
wellknown in musical circles but also no stranger to broadcasting 
when hired by cbs 
in 1958 he was musical director on nbcs the subject is 
jazz series the band included a pretty good trumpet man name of 
doc severinson 
taylors other air credits a jazz history of sorts on captain 
kangaroo two national public radio series taylor made piano 
and jazz alive musical director on the longago the david 
frost show a cable series several years ago jazz 
counterpoint and several pbs specials 
he stays busy in addition to performing and composing he also 
lectures at colleges and still oversees new yorks jazzmobile 
program which he founded 25 years ago to bring jazz to those who 
perhaps cant afford to pay to hear it live 
he also has recorded extensively including an album last year 
with fellow pianist ramsey lewis 
that taylor landed what has proved to be his longestrunning 
tour in television is due he says to shad northshield and bud 
lamoreaux the first executive producer and a senior producer of 
cbs sunday show respectively 
after his appearance on the program he recalls they said 
would you be interested in doing something along those lines with 
other people for us 
oddly enough northshield hadnt specifically been looking for a 
jazz specialist the program had a classical music critic and it 
occurred to me that we should have somebody who does contemporary 
music he says but we werent specific about the kind of 
music then someone did the piece on him and he was terrific 
taylor credits the two producers and the broadcasts anchor 
charles kuralt with providing the opportunity for features on 
jazz a subject rarely seen or heard on the major networks these 
days 
why so well most people who produce those kinds of shows are 
not as aware as bud and shad taylor says 
but it also helped that the folksy kuralt knew the world of 
jazz he adds 
he plays my straight man taylor says but to be a good 
straight man you really have to know what the answer is 
taylor estimates he averages 14 to 15 jazz features a year on 
the cbs program 
one he chuckles was about nbcs schwartz the son of a famous 
hollywood composer and a radio cult figure here in his wnewam 
sunday show schwartz learnedly discusses and airs the work of such 
singers as frank sinatra tony bennett linda ronstadt and maureen 
mcgovern 
most of those taylor interviews consider him a colleague he 
says and that helps but he also has faced the interviewers 
classic nightmare a subject who is extremely shy withdrawn and 
generally no fun at all 
those can be trying times he concedes you elaborately set up 
a question and think youre going to get a good answer and then he 
just says yeah 
 
elsewhere in television 
another reason to continue living boxing champ mike tyson in 
his second primetime network appearance since barbara walters 
interviewed him will be a referee in the feb 23 telecast of what 
you might call nbcs version of great performances a 
wrestling match between hulk hogan and macho king randy savage 
nbc calls the tiff the main event 
nbc noting that this is its third such gripping event in two 
years quotes tyson as saying he fears neither hulk nor macho man 
and that in fact there arent two men on the planet that i 
cant handle

cartoonists have become the conscience of hong 
kong as they acidly etch the desperation felt by a people destined 
to live under the flag of communist china in seven years 
with politicians bickering and editorial writers anxious not to 
irritate the leaders in beijing comic strips have become one of 
the few platforms where hong kongs fears are expressed with often 
brutal clarity 
just after the crackdown june 4 in beijing on the democracy 
movement cartoonist juan tze drew premier li peng in a bathtub of 
blood 
is it hot enough asked a soldier holding a bucket of 
steaming peoples blood 
after sir geoffrey howe then the british foreign secretary 
told hong kong that britain could not guarantee the territorys 
future larry feign an american expatriate summed up the feelings 
of many 
i dont know who to hate more deng xiaoping or margaret 
thatcher says one of his comic strip characters 
after 149 years of british rule hong kong returns to china in 
1997 although beijing has promised to retain the territorys 
freewheeling economic and social system for 50 years many of hong 
kongs 57 million people lost faith in that promise after the june 
4 crackdown 
many also have little confidence in factionridden local 
politicians says joseph ys cheng a leading educator and writer 
in the colony newspapers also practice selfcensorship in their 
criticism of beijing he said 
people look to comic strips as an outlet for their 
frustrations cheng said their popularity demonstrates that we 
have a solid groundswell of anticommunist antichina feeling 
especially after june 4 
adds feign cartoons appeal to the chinese because you can get 
your meaning across indirectly 
cheng said that only in the last few years have comic strips 
become an important political outlet in hong kong a recent 
exhibition of cartoons at the hong kong arts centre drew 40000 
people over several weeks 
feign and juan are perhaps the two best known cartoonists in the 
colony 
frenetic and balding feign 34 is author of a comic strip for 
the englishlanguage south china morning post called the world of 
lily wong 
for the five years since he moved to hong kong from orange 
county in california with his chinese wife feign has charted the 
lives of lily a smart sexy hong kong woman and stuart wright a 
bumbling but goodhearted american 
stuart wants to marry lily and give her the passport she covets 
but lily isnt in love and so far has refused him through their 
relationship feign explores the often blatant racism inflicted on 
chinese by westerners he also pokes fun at the ways chinese view 
westerners known as devils in cantonese 
a tall man with the comportment of a mandarin official in old 
chinas imperial court juan is more selfconsciously political 
than feign 
he grew up during hong kongs most turbulent times and remembers 
watching the bloody antibritish riots in 1967 from a rickety 
balcony on his tenement home he began drawing comics as an art 
student at the chinese university of hong kong in the 1970s 
he took a page from early 20th century chinese history during 
which cartoons were a popular form of political agitation and 
decided to use comics to fight for hong kongs common man he went 
to work at the chineselanguage ming pao 
my generation is different from my parents said juan now 
33 they came from china and are concerned with basic things like 
food and money we are searching for other things from the 
spirit 
when china recently announced its opposition to a british plan 
to give passports to key hong kong professionals and officials 
juan drew a man sitting on his bed his birth certificate identity 
card and passport scattered beneath him who am i who am i 
the man screamed as his wife snored beside him 
we have an identity crisis in hong kong juan said london 
and beijing are deciding our fate and we cant influence them i 
wanted to describe our feeling of hopelessness 
following the crackdown in beijing juan drew chinese premier li 
peng explaining why tanks were used to put down the rebellion we 
ran out of cars li tells a visitor 
another strip shows an englishman offering hong kong on a fork 
into the drooling mouth of a corrupt chinese cadre be a brave 
chinaman the englishman says 
juan who hopes to stay in hong kong after 1997 has recently 
published a book of his work black goods 
i guess the chinese might call me a counterrevolutionary he 
said with a wry smile im just helping them gather proof 
if juan expresses the desperation of hong kong feign captures 
the absurdity of its life 
living on the cusp of two worlds hong kong chinese and western 
expatriate feign has a unique vantage point 
in the beginning my position gave me a chance to pull off a 
lot of good gags said feign but now as things get serious i 
find it harder to draw its becoming a tragedy

almost every night in a deserted field or on 
a mountainside a charge of dynamite goes off and peruvians lights 
go out 
the sabotage of hightension pylons by leftist guerrillas who 
call themselves ironically the shining path is plunging peruvians 
into darkness and cutting dangerously into the nations industrial 
output 
power rationing has become a daily headache for millions of 
people in lima and other major cities that depend on hydroelectric 
power that is brought over the andes 
lima has a new sound the almost constant hum of thousands of 
portable gasoline generators 
its streets are in almost constant gridlock because traffic 
lights are out restaurants and housewives complain of food 
spoiling because refrigerators arent working 
landlords are slashing rents for the upper floors of highrise 
apartment buildings to entice renters worried about climbing the 
stairs when elevators stop 
since july 28 1980 when the first hightension pylon was blown 
up in the mountains near ayacucho 235 miles southeast of lima as 
president fernando belaunde terry was giving his stateoftheunion 
address 1205 towers have fallen according to the state power 
company electroperu 
a total of 335 were felled last year alone and more than 100 
have been toppled since municipal elections in november when the 
rebels blew up 80 in one week in an effort largely unsuccessful 
as it turned out to disrupt the voting 
the rainy season that lasts from january to may in the highlands 
is making it difficult for repair crews to reach toppled towers 
and electroperu says it does not know how long power rationing 
which began in midnovember will continue 
the whole system is in a shambles said jose dibos of the 
national industrial society we are running into an almost 
continuous situation where power outages have to be accepted as a 
way of life 
the shining path took up arms in 1980 to bring down perus 
elected government and install a peasantworker state patterned on 
the ideas of mao tsetung of china 
the government says more than 17500 people have died in the 
violence and economic costs have surpassed 15 billion 
damage to the electrical system has cost the country more than 
600 million including repairs and lost electrical output 
according to electroperu the company says it costs about 20000 
to replace a tower 
the industrial societys dibos said the electric company has 
been able to maintain a precarious balance only because 
industries are operating at 50 percent of capacity due to the 
countrys economic problems which included 2775 percent inflation 
last year and a 12 percent drop in the gross domestic product 
but he said the damaged power grid is a time bomb that is 
costing industry millions of dollars in lost production and ruined 
materials and equipment 
one of the hardest hit areas is the glass industry whose ovens 
need a continous supply of power to allow for the slow heating and 
cooling required to make glass 
the industrial society says glass production has dropped by half 
its almost impossible for an industrial user to predict when 
he is going to get power and for how long dibos said 
most of the power supplied to lima where a third of perus 22 
million people live comes from electroperus hydroelectric dam on 
the mantaro river in a mountain valley 165 miles east of lima 
three interconnected lines carry power over the andes to the 
coast each passing through guerrilla country one of the three has 
been down since 1987 when electroperu withdrew its repair crews 
after guerrillas burned 10 company trucks and threatened to kill 
workers if they returned 
an electroperu spokesman jose acevedo said repair crews on the 
other two lines know they are being watched 
they watch them from a distance and as soon as they finish 
raising a tower the terrorists come in and blow up another one 
he said 
acevedo said one tower was felled six times before the army 
strung barbed wire and planted land mines around it

the cracking of the communist east bloc has 
opened a path to profound change in us defenses and the fallout 
for military chiefs and soldiers weapons makers political leaders 
and taxpayers is just coming into view 
a revolution in military affairs could be in the making 
says william kaufmann of the brookings institution think tank and a 
frequent consultant to the pentagon 
the precise features of this transformation are fuzzy but the 
direction is clear smaller pentagon budgets fewer troops and a 
shrinking pipeline of new weapons 
the most frequently asked questions now are how radically will 
the military be reshaped and will congress switch defense dollars 
to social programs such as housing and education that were squeezed 
during the reagan administrations military buildup 
military planners already are rethinking traditional defense 
strategies while trying to hold together the north atlantic 
alliance since few now believe the fractured warsaw pact armies 
pose a major threat to western security the glue that has kept 
nato together for 40 years is fear of a surprise soviet invasion of 
western europe with those fears now fading will nato come unstuck 
while even the pentagons biggest supporters in congress see 
more relaxed eastwest relations some caution against assuming 
that democratic reforms and moves toward freemarket economies in 
eastern europe would last if soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
was ousted 
a return to past soviet behavior is the biggest risk we must 
consider in reordering our priorities and restructuring our own 
defenses sen john warner of virginia the ranking republican on 
the senate armed services committee said recently 
even so the new world order means running a newlook us 
military on less money perhaps a lot less president bush 
proposed to congress a slight trimming of defense spending to 292 
billion for the budget year starting oct 1 pressures are great 
on capitol hill to wield an even heavier ax 
the reality is that we must plan on our defense budget going 
down several percentage points every year for the foreseeable 
future says gen colin l powell the top us military officer 
as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
kaufmann says military spending by 1999 should be cut to half 
todays level 
the new austerity in turn translates to tougher times for 
military contractors the arms industry boomed during the reagan 
administration and now employs one in five of the nations 
manufacturing workers and onethird of scientists and engineers 
the boom may not bust but some industry workers and their 
communities already see reason to worry about layoffs and pay cuts 
there can be a dark side to the outbreak of peace ohio gov 
richard celeste said at a special conference of small and 
mediumsize military contractors jan 24 
the jobs of about 200000 ohio residents depend on the defense 
industry other states including california virginia washington 
maryland and missouri are even more closely linked to the health 
of military contractors 
the bright side in the view of many economists and defense 
analysts is that the expected pentagon savings during the 1990s 
could be converted to a peace dividend money to combat 
homelessness build new schools repair old roads and bridges 
intensify medical research combat drug abuse or cut taxes 
the bush administration however sees two holes in the peace 
dividend theory first it says no major savings should be 
expected until new arms control deals are struck and the 
prodemocracy movement in eastern europe gains a firmer footing 
secondly huge bills for correcting mistakes of the past such as 
untold levels of contamination from nuclear weapons plants will 
come due in the 1990s 
defense secretary dick cheney presenting details of the 
proposed 1991 budget said the peace dividend is peace 
meaning the huge military investments of the past have bought a 
more secure international order but that drastically reducing 
future military spending could undermine that security 
that line of thinking and bushs cautious nature will surely 
face a severe test in the democratcontrolled congress where 
debate over spending priorities in light of a retreating soviet 
military menace already is under way 
some of the biggest squabbles are expected to focus on bushs 
desire to preserve the expensive strategic nuclear program the 
presidents 1991 budget adds 900 million for research on the star 
wars missile defense project and spares the multibilliondollar b2 
stealth bomber program and the navys aircraft carrier battle 
groups 
another likely bigticket target for congress is the 
administrations request for 363 million to start building two 
nuclear reactors in idaho and south carolina to produce tritium a 
radioactive gas used to make nuclear warheads critics say tritium 
supplies already are adequate to meet future needs so the 7 
billion or more needed to complete the new reactors is 
unjustifiable 
rep ron wyden dore says the administration may be forced to 
scrap plans to expand the nuclear bomb factories 
this is going to put a much heavier burden of proof on those 
who want to spend for new facilities says wyden who advocates 
opening ussoviet negotiations to ban the production of 
plutonium a key ingredient in nuclear weapons 
perhaps the fiercest fight of all will be over base closings 
bushs budget calls for shutting down or consolidating about 55 
bases cheney offered no estimate of savings but said fewer bases 
will be needed as troop strength is reduced 
the outcome of these debates is likely to influence not only the 
future shape of us defenses but also the fortunes of military 
supply and consulting companies and their hundreds of thousands of 
employees 
there is a shakeout taking place in the industry says 
jacques gansler senior vice president of analytic sciences corp 
a defense contractor 
the prospect of large job losses has given new prominence to 
debate in congress over economic conversion legislation aimed 
at helping defense company managers and workers switch from 
production of military hardware to civilian items 
critics of this approach say the economy can cope without new 
help from the government they note that in the eight years 
following the 1968 peak in defense spending during the vietnam war 
the military budget was slashed 37 percent 
while there was pain and suffering we managed it said 
kaufmann of the brookings institution

president bush led with his high cards 
defense foreign policy and the remnants of the cold war 
democratic leaders praised the president conceded the hand and 
set about changing the subject 
bushs state of the union response to the chain reaction 
revolution of 89 in eastern europe foretells the american 
politics of the 90s 
any president has the upper hand when the issues are national 
defense and foreign affairs and for most of the past generation 
those have been republican issues 
the democrats usually make their case on domestic matters even 
with bushs poll popularity at record highs the voters say they 
think democrats can do a better job in dealing with problems at 
home 
with the eased threat from moscow and the disintegration of its 
satellite bloc democrats think they can shift the voter focus 
beginning with this years election campaign and looking toward the 
presidential elections of 1992 and 1996 
that would put the emphasis on future campaigns on their strong 
suit it would presumably spare their future presidential 
nominees the kind of ridicule gov michael dukakis faced in 1988 
after he was photographed with his helmeted head jutting up from 
the turret of a tank at a campaign reunion bush jokingly thanked 
his 1988 advisers for keeping him out of tanks 
now 10 days into the new session of congress the political 
advantage belongs to bush he won unexpectedly with the senate 
minority he needed to uphold a veto of a bill extending the us 
visas of chinese students a step he said he had taken anyhow then 
came his two major messages of the year the new budget on monday 
the state of the union address to a joint session of congress on 
wednesday night 
leaving budget bogymen and fine print problems for later the 
president issued his surprise call to subtract an additional 80000 
soldiers each from the ussoviet troop cuts in europe that are 
being negotiated 
even democrats who had denounced his budget harmonized in praise 
of that proposal outlined hours after bush had telephoned soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to tell him about it 
that is the kind of diplomatic drama a president can deliver 
the democrats have nothing to match it 
the budget and domestic priorities are politically contested 
terrain nobody is quarreling about troop cuts and the democratic 
upheavals that made them practical work to bushs advantage even 
though the united states was not directly involved in the changes 
that swept eastern europe 
house speaker thomas s foley said the conditions and 
commitments that led to the disintegration of the communist empire 
in europe were the work of presidents congresses and american 
servicemen from harry trumans time 
that counts the democrats in for a share of the credit but bush 
is the major political beneficiary simply because he was president 
when it happened 
so the democratic emphasis is on change at home there are new 
realities to be grasped new challenges to be met and very 
different battles to be won foley said in the democratic 
response to bush 
in the 1990s and well into the next century the central 
challenge for america will be economic not military he said 
the greatest test of our strength will be in our classrooms not 
our missile silos the gravest threat will come not from any 
nations attempt at world domination but from every nations 
complicity in the worldwide destruction of the environment 
those are problems indeed and there are more built into the 
bush budget deficits now soaring federal liabilities later those 
domestic headaches may well rearm the democrats 
but bush is in charge at a time of chain reaction international 
change so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in 
the worlds affairs last spring democrats were complaining that 
he was passively yielding the stage to gorbachev failing to 
respond to moscow peace initiatives he silenced that with his 
first proposal for troop cuts delivered to the nato summit at the 
end of may now bush holds the initiative 
the first round of the 1990 political season is his but only 
the first and its a long season

the 5yearold girl tossed her hair twisted around 
in the chair rolled her head raised her arms stood up and sat 
down again all the while dutifully answering questions from the 
nice lady with the rag doll 
a camera rolled behind a twoway mirror as the two went through 
a delicate procedure that has become vital in prosecution of child 
abuse cases 
the lady told the girl that sometimes unpleasant things happen 
to little children and maybe they could talk about it she pulled 
out a clothed rag doll with hair of yarn and anatomical details 
such as breasts and genitals 
together the child and interviewer pointed to the different 
body parts no no one had ever touched her there said the child 
pointing she was sure despite physical evidence of abuse the 
little girl wasnt talking that day 
in recent years the use of anatomical dolls has grown as more 
child abuse cases are prosecuted but a new study shows that the 
dolls effectiveness in aiding a childs memory may be overrated 
these dolls have become very popular because some 
psychologists believe they do something magical eliciting 
information they otherwise couldnt get at said bruce forman a 
university of miami psychologist but our findings indicate 
thats probably not so 
anatomical dolls became available in the late 1970s and early 
1980s and now are common in social workers and prosecutors 
offices and police agencies the dolls costing up to 75 have 
evolved from crude unclothed figures to lessthreatening more 
realistic ones with underwear and bright clothes 
experts agree that the dolls can help some children tell what 
happened to them especially those who are very young or are 
embarrassed to talk about the incident but the evidence is less 
clear in terms of what interview tool helps get the best 
information from an abused child and what is normal behavior 
clinically many believe the dolls have a place in evaluating 
suspected abused kids that cannot be taken over by another tool 
said mark everson a psychologist and codirector of the clinical 
research program on childhood maltreatment at the university of 
north carolina at chapel hill 
in a study of whether dolls anatomical explicitness would lead 
a nonabused child to act out in a sexually suggestive manner 
everson found that 6 percent of more than 200 children aged 25 
showed fairly clear sexual acts with the dolls during an interview 
even when there was no history of abuse 
in the miami study 45 children aged 8 and 9 viewed a 
12minute film often used in sexualabuse awareness programs one 
group later told what they remembered verbally another by drawing 
pictures and a third with the dolls 
we found no significant difference in accuracy or completeness 
of information recalled forman said the results of the study 
will be published in the journal social behavior and 
personality 
in another study of 32 girls aged 58 the miami researchers 
found that abused girls showed somewhat more aggression and sexual 
play with the dolls if an observer was not in the room than did 
nonabused girls with an adult in the room there was little 
difference between the two groups forman said 
however not all of the abused girls showed increased agression 
and sexual play indicating a need for more research on what is 
normal behavior he said 
from our work we know that children who have not been abused 
display some curiosity about sexual body parts and thats normal 
and healthy when it appears at the appropriate age it is 
important he added that aggression shown by a child doesnt 
necessarily imply a history of sexual abuse 
weve only scratched the surface of how children react there 
are still a lot of questions he said 
although much has been made of the potential for 
overinterpretation of childrens interaction with anatomical 
dolls they have become an integral part of childabuse 
investigations and the prosecution of mass child abuse cases 
videotaped interviews of children with the dolls was among 
evidence used to convict frank fuster escalona in 1985 in one of 
floridas most notorious cases involving the abuse of children at 
a babysitting service in dade county the story was retold 
recently in the tv movie unspeakable acts 
fuster is serving six consecutive life sentences his wife 
ileana was also convicted in the socalled country walk case 
which involved allegations of nude sex games and satanic animal 
sacrifices she served about four years of a 10year sentence and 
was deported to her native honduras 
among defense criticisms was that children had been manipulated 
during the interviews and that using the dolls was inappropriate 
said john hogan lead prosecutor obviously the jury didnt put 
much credence in that 
in california defense attorneys also made an issue of how 
children were interviewed in the mcmartin preschool molestation 
case raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey were 
acquitted last month of almost all charges linked to the alleged 
molestation of 11 children at the nowdefunct school in manhattan 
beach a suburb of los angeles 
mary emmons executive director of childrens institute 
international where the children were interviewed said defense 
attorneys were just doing their job in attacking the methods for 
the most part the methods used by mental health professionals are 
wellstablished clinical methods designed to aid children in 
telling what may or may not have happened she said 
others in the field echo that sentiment 
i have seen some criticism of use of the dolls and frankly 
it all gets blown out of proportion said patricia toth of the 
national center for prosecution of child abuse a nonprofit group 
based in alexandria va 
people latch onto the dolls as if theyre responsible for 
conviction of innocent people toth said i truly dont think 
they have the impact people attach to them dolls in and of 
themselves dont make the case 
at the childrens center in miami run by the dade state 
attorneys office dolls play a prominent role in interviews they 
are primarily used for showing exactly what happened after a child 
has already talked about an incident said teresa pooler an 
assistant state attorney and director of the center 
the center founded in december 1986 after the country walk 
case has about 18 dolls in adult child and toddler size the 
females have vaginas and breasts and the males have penises an 
average of 70 children are interviewed a month 
we use the dolls for demonstrative purposes not for diagnosis 
as to whether something in fact occurred said pooler adding 
children often have different names for body parts and difficulty 
with spatial relationships 
i think anything that can be used to elicit a statement from a 
child is a positive thing she said provided its used 
properly

japanese doctors long regarded as too exalted to 
be questioned are changing their guidelines to give patients more 
information about diseases like cancer and more say in 
lifeanddeath decisions 
under pressure from new patients rights groups the japan 
medical association surveyed doctors about such informed 
consent issues as terminal patients right to stop treatment the 
results showing most doctors willing to open up to patients were 
released in january accompanied by recommendations that doctors 
should give more information to cancer patients and that terminally 
ill patients should have a right to refuse treatment 
ive seen patients with uncurable disease and cancer at final 
stages tied to machines and living in pain and i refuse to be 
kept alive like that said keinosuke miyaji spokesman the 
association for death with dignity whose 7300 members have signed 
wills expressing their wishes in such cases 
if i had cancer i would like to know by all means my own 
experiences with my husband made me think that knowing the truth 
makes a big difference said ayako katsunuma whose husband 
haruo a doctor died of lung cancer five years ago before the 
surgery my husband said he wanted just six more months to live so 
that he could complete unfinished work and he did 
haruo katsunuma asked his doctors for the truth and that 
enabled the couple to make their remaining days together 
worthwhile mrs katsunuma said it also released some of my 
mental suffering hiding the truth must be so stressful for other 
family members 
interest in patients rights has been growing for years and was 
given new impetus by widespread publicity of strenuous efforts to 
treat emperor hirohito whose final illness lasted more than three 
months after his death on jan 7 1989 doctors disclosed that the 
emperor hadnt been told he had cancer 
in a country where doctors were held in awe patients have 
believed they should not bother physicians with silly 
questions doctors generally didnt explain fully the treatment 
they provided or even how bad ailments were 
however in the medical association survey last summer of 1607 
doctors 707 percent agreed they should respect patients wishes 
163 percent urged the legalization of patthe right to die in 
accordance with patients wishes and 73 percent said they must 
always keep patients alive 
nonetheless the medical association said cancer patients should 
be told the truth only if they are strong enough to face reality 
and their cancer is at an early stage and chairman ichiro kato 
said it is not illegal for doctors to agree to let a terminally 
ill patient die they should provide information on the dangers of 
treatment and on alternatives to those who are less ill 
the associations report also said doctors bear no legal 
responsibility when a patient refuses a transfusion for religious 
reasons if the patient is a child and a parent refuses a 
transfusion for the child a transfusion can be given against the 
parents wishes 
while the report said patients could refuse doctors 
suggestions it said that doctors and patients are not equal and 
doctors should take initiative as professionals with specialized 
knowledge and experience 
shizuko kiba who studies terminal care said doctors have 
overwhelmingly focused on medical technology and ignored patients 
feelings medical care is for patients and its purpose 
especially for those at the final stage of their lives should be 
to relieve pain and let them live like humans she said 
when patients asked if they had cancer the leading cause of 
death in japan doctors almost always used to deny it believing 
the truth would hurt the patients morale but patients often 
know that no means yes ms kiba said the important thing is 
communication between patients and doctors through which patients 
can learn the truth themselves naturally 
informed consent requires communication agreed kazumasa 
hoshino a medical professor at kyoto university it is almost 
impossible when a patient steps into the room for the first time 
when we know nothing about each other

when daniel janzen set out to teach people 
to restore depleted tropical forests he didnt think hed be a 
driving instructor 
what im teaching is stuff that is a combination of academic 
things and what we regard as the ordinary things about running an 
ordinary life janzen said during an interview in his university 
of pennsylvania office amid tropical seed and fruit specimens 
popcorn and pepperidge farm cookies 
you spend two hours in the afternoon talking about how to tell 
a beetle from a bug and then an hour and a half on driving lessons 
you mix the biological aspects with the practical aspects 
janzen 50 spends four months of the year teaching biology and 
the rest in costa rica guiding efforts to save its dwindling 
tropical dry forests he also helped raise more than 24 million to 
buy 158 square miles of forests that in july was formally dedicated 
as guanacaste national park 
in october 1988 janzen began training costa ricans to survey 
the parks plant and animal life and to teach others the 
techniques there are 175 species of birds 700 of plants 3140 of 
moths and butterflies and 13000 of insects so the inventory alone 
will take about 10 years to complete 
janzen practices a new field called restoration ecology which 
tries to return areas to their condition before they were damaged 
by humans he hopes to raise 30 million for the national 
biodiversity institute of costa rica among the biggest 
contributors have been the costa rican and swedish governments the 
pew charitable trusts in philadelphia and the macarthur foundation 
which honored him with one of its genius awards earlier this 
year 
the program does not use american volunteers although some of 
janzens students at penn have asked if they could join it he 
refused he said because that would mean fewer costa ricans would 
be involved in the work 
costa ricans develop a feeling of ownership thats the link 
you want you want the members of the society to feel that the park 
is actually theirs so that when its threatened at some later 
time they then feel the threat is a personal threat 
the project got its start in 1985 when costa rican officials 
discovered that the corcovado national park was threatened by about 
1200 gold miners who had caused widespread ecological damage the 
officials asked janzen to find out why the miners had breached the 
parks traditionally respected boundaries he discovered that the 
miners had moved their operations into the forests because they 
felt the land belonged to no one he realized if the countrys 
resources were to be saved costa ricans had to take pride in the 
forests since then costa rica about the size of west virginia 
has devoted more than a quarter of its area to natural parks more 
than any of its latin american neighbors 
janzen a minnesota native has spent more than 26 years in 
costa rica drawn by its diverse plant and animal life helping to 
plan a national park however gave the field scientist a new 
challenge 
as soon as you start planning a park and thinking about its 
biological properties you immediately realize that the real 
challenge is not the biology but the human administration he 
said you cant just put an advertisement in the newspaper like 
you can here and out of the woodwork comes 25 people whove already 
got masters degrees in resource management 
janzen carefully describes his role as a guide my role is 
teaching particular courses and being somewhat of an advisor for 
some aspects of the administration of the park i become part of 
the process of making decisions but i dont make decisions 
those decisions are made by costa rican officials who janzen 
said are very aware of the environmental impact their decisions 
could have an awareness he attributes in large part to the 
countrys size costa ricans cant escape the problems by moving 
as americans once did he said 
janzen credits costa rican president oscar arias with 
encouraging the country to put onefourth of its natural resources 
aside costa rica pretty much understands what they want to do 
they know what the recipe is

a new suggests that combining an antibiotic with 
an overthecounter drug can reduce the duration of travelers 
diarrhea to just an hour from an average of 34 hours with the best 
known previous therapy 
we never dreamed it would work so well it was marvelous 
said dr charles d ericsson who with dr herbert l dupont led a 
team of researchers at the university of texas medical school at 
houston 
the researchers tested five different treatments including a 
placebo or inactive medication among 227 us college students 
who suffered from acute diarrhea while attending summer school in 
guadalajara mexico 
the quickest relief came from combining the antibiotic 
sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim marketed as septra and bactrim with 
the overthecounter drug loperamide marketed as immodium ad the 
researchers said 
subjects took the antibiotic in tablet form twice a day for 
three days and an initial twotablet dose of loperamide ericsson 
said one additional tablet of loperamide was taken after each 
loose bowel movement 
the average duration of diarrhea was an hour or less with the 
combination of drugs vs 34 hours using the previous best therapy 
the antibiotic alone said ericsson in the control group the 
average duration was 59 hours 
less effective were the other three approaches tested a single 
large dose of the antibiotic twoaday doses of the antibiotic 
over three days and the overthecounter drug alone the 
researchers found their findings were reported in the journal of 
the american medical association

silicon microchips implanted into rats 
feet survived a year and linked with nerve tissue a step 
researchers say could in several decades lead to the development of 
bionic limbs 
the goal of this project is to make an interface a direct 
connection between the human nervous system and machines or 
prostheses said greg kovacs a stanford university electrical 
engineer and medical student 
two quartersized radio transceivers one at the stump of the 
severed part of the human body and connected to the chip and the 
other on the outside of the artificial limb could relay 
information by radio kovacs said 
the main challenge for scientists is being able to take the 
signals sent from the brain and interpret and process them into 
information that can be fed into the prosthesis circuits probably 
through a computer such a system is far in the future warned 
kovacs and three colleagues who last year implanted a tiny chip 
between the severed ends of foot nerves in a half dozen rats 
nerve fibers regenerated through holes in the chip and the 
researchers were eventually able to stimulate activity by sending 
signals through the chip 
kovacs said the holes in the chips were small enough that only 
single nerves or small clusters grew in each pathway the chips 
probably will not be useful in reconnecting severed limbs or other 
body parts he said because of the irreversible damage generally 
caused by the cutting

intrigued by stories of two dogs who reportedly 
could sense that their masters were about to have epileptic 
seizures researchers are looking for other dogs who appear to have 
that ability 
if dogs can be trained to give warnings they might make life 
easier for people with epilepsy by giving them time to take 
precautions to avoid injury during the seizure said reina berner 
executive director of the epilepsy institute in new york 
as a result some people with epilepsy could become less fearful 
of having seizures in public and so begin to lead less restricted 
lives she said 
the institute hopes to find three to five dogs who appear to 
have the ability so the animals can be formally tested if it 
appears researchers hope to find out how they do it so other dogs 
can be trained berner said 
the testing would involve monitoring brain waves of a volunteer 
to watch for the signal of an impending seizure and noting if and 
when the dog senses the seizure coming 
berner said she had heard of one dog in washington dc who 
could sense seizures in a girl and had met a second such dog and 
its owner the owner said that while she was taking a shower the 
dog had predicted an oncoming seizure by barking even though the 
animal was outside the closed bathroom door 
both dogs had been trained to work for people using wheelchairs 
she said in addition both appeared able to predict not only grand 
mal seizures which make a person collapse but also complex 
partial seizures in which a person becomes semiconcious and 
lapses into such simple behavior as walking

eastern airlines struggling to rebuild as a 
smaller carrier under bankruptcy court supervision has received a 
50 million infusion to help fund its operations through february 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland on wednesday approved 
easterns request for 50 million to be taken out of escrow funds 
which contain around 600 million raised from recent sales of 
eastern assets 
liflands approval came a day after a committee of easterns 
preferred shareholders advocated the liquidation or outright sale 
of the airline and said a 40 million advance should be enough to 
cover the next month 
easterns management issued a memo to its employees wednesday 
dismissing the preferred shareholders salvo and persistent rumors 
of a possible chapter 7 liquidation 
at wednesdays hearing attorneys representing the preferred 
shareholders raised their estimate of easterns current needs to 
42 million based on new data provided by the carrier but the 
shareholders to whom eastern owes 1175 billion didnt soften 
their opposition to the airlines latest reorganization proposal 
eastern filed a new plan with the court late last week in which 
it proposed to pay preferred holders no more than 10 cents on the 
dollar in the form of new stock previously eastern had promised 
to repay its creditors in full 
we think that a new direction or directions have to be 
explored for this airline robert miller an attorney for the 
preferred shareholders committee said wednesday in a telephone 
interview he said the committee might take further legal action 
but declined to elaborate 
in papers filed tuesday in us bankruptcy court the 
shareholders committee said it had lost faith in easterns 
management because it was cannibalizing the airline by selling 
assets 
frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp 
suggested in a private meeting tuesday with airline analysts that 
he could merge eastern and its sister carrier continental airlines 
according to unidentified analysts quoted in the los angeles times 
and the washington post 
texas air spokesman art kent said wednesday a merger between 
houstonbased continental and miamibased eastern continues to be 
one of a range of possible options that could be considered he 
said lorenzos statements to the analysts were in line with his 
previous public positions 
frank ortis president of machinists union local 702 in miami 
said lifland and easterns creditors likely would object to a 
merger between nonunion continental and eastern 
i cant believe anybody would allow them to do that because 
continental is almost as shaky as eastern ortis said the only 
sensible solution is to sell it to us and let us have a shot at 
having a profitable airline 
in its memo to employees eastern said we expected this type 
of reaction from the preferred stockholders committee they are 
trying to build pressure in an attempt to improve their position 
the memo obtained by nbcs miami affiliate wtvj said 
liquidation was not in the interest of the creditors or eastern 
but some travel agents responded to the latest developments by 
advising customers not to fly eastern 
there could be a lot more people stranded this time said 
agent nancy redlus of sunshine holiday travel in downtown miami 
right now i dont know whats going to happen to the airline 
whats going to happen to them tomorrow 
the machinists union has been on strike against eastern since 
last march 4 it was joined in sympathy walkouts by pilots and 
flight attendants forcing the airline into bankruptcy court 
protection on march 9 the pilots and flight attendants abandoned 
their strikes just before thanksgiving but eastern has rebuilt as 
a smaller carrier and hired mostly nonunion workers to replace the 
strikers 
liflands approval for eastern to withdraw the 50 million was 
the fourth such request granted since the chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceeding began the three previous drawdowns totaled 210 million 
in addition to paying preferred shareholders no more than 10 
cents on the dollar easterns new reorganization proposal also 
calls for paying unsecured crs only 10 percent of their debts in 
cash when the airline emerges from bankruptrotection and another 
70 percent over the following 10 years without interest in return 
for accepting partial repayment texas air would give the unsecured 
creditors 40 percent of easteruity 
under easterns two previous plans unsecured creditors were to 
be rd in full with interest at the completion of chapter 11 
eastern owes the unseccreditors primarily trade suppliers such as 
aircraft manufacturers around 11 billion 
the committee representing unsecured creditors so far has 
reserjudgment on easterns new plan adam harris an the committee 
declined comment wednesday on the shareholders position and 
liflands decision to grant the 50 million 
lawyers represend striking machinists had asked at the hearing 
ithdrawn by eastern be matched by a contribution from texas air

shearson lehman hutton incs new leader plans 
to attack a morale problem at the wall street brokerage but the 
sorry state of the securities industry may prove a bigger obstacle 
to reversing the firms fortunes 
like other brokerages hurt by an industrywide recession 
shearson is extending staff cuts into the ranks of its highly paid 
investment bankers sources at the firm said 
the cuts which one investment banker said could total 50 to 
100 professionals by the end of may or 10 percent to 20 percent of 
the division were initiated before this weeks tumult 
surrounding the resignation of chairman peter a cohen 
on wednesday parent american express co took steps to bolster 
shearsons financial footing amid signs that the travel and credit 
card giant would exert tighter control over the firm 
shearsons newly appointed president and chief executive 
officer howard l clark jr a former american express executive 
said his nearterm goal is to complete an 850 million 
recapitalization program that will preserve the firms credit 
rating 
in a telephone interview clark said that in an effort to 
reassure shearson employees that the turmoil was ending he would 
get out and see the employees and management and retail system i 
will be doing a lot of that 
that would contrast sharply with the tenure of cohen a brash 
43yearold executive who was ousted after simmering tensions with 
american express chairman james d robinson iii boiled over this 
week 
a perception of arrogance on the part of cohen especially 
among the firms 10500 brokers has hurt morale other problems 
including 800 recent layoffs a senior management restructuring and 
slumping business also have jolted the firm clark said he hoped 
that would change 
i think morale is going to improve as the business environment 
improves because weve really compted corrected two uncertainties 
the management leadership question and the capitalization 
andrating he said 
but clark added the basic problem is financial market the 
volatility and cyclicality that affects all firms not just 
shearson 
nine years after acquiring shearson american express removed 
the final highlevel link to the firms past with cohens forced 
resignation tuesday 
analysts predicted that the arrival of the subdued and practical 
clark who turns 46 today could lead to a scaling down of activity 
in fields such as investment banking involving mergers and 
securities underwriting that shearson entered under cohen during 
wall streets expansioncrazed 1980s 
over the next several years you could see a swing back to the 
shearson of old where the main concern was the retail side of the 
business said perrin long of lipper analytical services 
shearsons current trn good part from declines in stock buying 
by individuals mergers and acquisitins and securities 
underwritinge of their size and exposure nos 1 and 2 merrill 
lynch amp co and shearson have been among the hardest hit 
much of the blame on overexpansion shearson grew from a 
midsized retail outfit to a diversified brokerage byquiring 
investment banking firm lehman brothers kuhn loeb in 1984 and 
retail brokerage ef hutton amp co in 1988 
they found out you can be all things to all people but you 
cant always make money doing it said lawrence eckenfelder a 
securities industry analyst with prudentche securities inc 
the first order of business for clark is the sale of about 250 
million in new stock t shareholders it replaces a public offering 
scrapped because of the firms slumping stock price and cohens 
resignation 
under the new plan announced wednesday american express 
eventually would cut its stake in shearson to about 45 percent from 
61 percent enabling it to drop the brokerage fits balance sheet 
american express still would remain shearsons largest stakeholder 
unlike recent layoffs at merrill lynch amp co the investment 
banking job cuts at shearson are being done gradually a shearson 
oicial who requested anonymity cae figure of up to 100 layoffs 
way out of line but said some reductions had occurred 
iear how the changing of the guard at shearson would affect the 
reductions 
merrill lynch earlier this month let go about 70 investment 
bankers or about 10 percent of its force spokesman fred yager 
said the layoffs were effective immediately 
vestment bankers who advise companies on acquisitions and sales 
of stock and bonds are among the most highly paid professionals on 
wall street with six and sevenfigure salaries and bonuses

the national puts opening day fanfare behind it 
today and begins its pursuit of a loyal following of readers for 
all sports seasons 
the countrys only allsports newspaper made its debut wednesday 
at newsstands and in vending machines in new york los angeles and 
chicago after six months in development and two weeks of daily 
tests 
the first 48page issue featured 36 pages of stories and 
statistics a weather map for spectators venturing to games around 
the country and a short list of jock stocks for those wishing 
to gamble their money on more than sporting events 
early sales were brisk and national officials said they were 
pleased with the startup which is costing the papers financial 
backers about 25 million 
publisher peter price and editor frank deford said they were 
optimistic about reaching goals of daily circulation averaging 
200000 plans are to expand circulation of the tabloidstyle 
paper which sells for 50 cents into as many as a dozen more 
cities by the end of the year 
deford a former sports illustrated writer said the owners also 
are considering mailing an earlyevening edition to subscribers 
later in the year so that people who live and work outside major 
cities can get the newspaper 
price said 250000 copies were distributed on the first day and 
that several newsstands in new york reported they exhausted their 
supply within a few hours 
some folks bought a single copy while others bought several a 
man who identified himself as jerry ginsberg of freehold nj 
scooped up eight copies at a penn station newstand and said he was 
betting 4 that in 10 years these will be worth money 
price conceded there was a novelty effect to the firstday 
sales but said he was convinced there was immense demand for 
the paper anyway 
deford said the paper would be so successful someone else will 
probably imitate it by launching a second national sports daily 
the first issue offered what newspaper officials said was a 
representative mix of local national and international sports 
stories hockey and basketball statistics and standings that 
included comments on each team 
but some newspaper people questioned the exclusivity of the two 
stories touted as exclusives in the first edition one in 
which outfielder darryl strawberry said its time for me to 
leave the new york mets and the other reporting florida running 
back emmitt smiths decision to turn professional 
strawberry says that every six weeks said vic ziegel 
sports editor of the new york daily news 
paul anger executive sports editor of the miami herald said 
several newspapers in florida already have reported smith was 
likely to turn pro 
ziegel also noted the new york edition failed to include west 
coast scores 
but the national did offer some unique offbeat features its 
jock stocks listed stock price changes for companies with 
sports affiliations the weather map noted driving conditions at 
game time in various cities 
at a news conference deford said one of the only glitches in 
the first issue was that charleston sc appeared where 
charlotte nc should have been on the weather map the mistake 
appeared in the new york issue but he said it was corrected in the 
other two editions 
each citys issue will be tailored to the local audience the 
first issue had different cover stories in each city with patrick 
ewing of the new york knicks featured in the new york edition 
michael jordan of the chicago bulls in chicago and magic johnson of 
the los angeles lakers in los angeles 
the national is owned by national american sports communications 
lp a partnership that includes price and mexican media baron 
emilio azcarraga 
price said the partnership was prepared to spend 100 million 
over five years to put the paper in the black but may spend more 
and wait longer

midway airlines inc isnt saying what it 
will do now that unwelcome suitor ampcopittsburgh corp has 
received government clearance to acquire a bigger stake in the air 
carrier 
neither is ampco for that matter 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission 
wednesday ampco disclosed that it sought antitrust clearance to 
increase its stake to more than 15 million worth of midways 
common stock 
the filing also noted that midway had rejected ampcos bid for a 
seat on the chicagobased airlines board 
ampco spokesman ronald hasek said the company would have no 
comment beyond what was contained in the fourpage sec filing 
a spokeswoman for midway sandra allen confirmed that midway 
had rebuffed ampcos request for representation on the board of 
directors and that a philadelphia banker had been elected recently 
to fill a vacancy on the board 
but she declined to discuss the antitrust clearance or ampcos 
intentions 
last september ampco a pittsburgh pabased heavy 
manufacturing concern disclosed it had acquired a 96 percent 
stake in midway which serves 51 cities and operates from chicago 
according to ampcos sec filing it made an informal request 
for representation on midways board nov 13 ampco renewed that 
request jan 2 after a midway board member jeffrey h erickson 
resigned 
but on tuesday according to the sec filing midway told ampco 
that its request for board representation had been rejected 
late last week midway electedrank reed president and chief 
executive officer of philadelphias first pennsylvania bank corp 
to fill the vacancy 
ampco said it is considering what action if any it may 
take in response to midways rejection of its request 
ampco also revealed it requested antitrust clearance from the 
justice department and trade commission to acquire additional 
midway stock which would result in ampco holding more than 15 
million in value of common stock but less than 15 percent of the 
outstanding voting securities of midway 
the ampco filing said it received clearance dec 12

special sauce lettuce cheese pickles and onions on a sesame seed 
bun 
mcdonalds in moscow is more than just the opening of another 
hamburger stand its west meeting east capitalism flourishing in 
the heart of communism an american icon dazzling rublepaying 
soviet masses 
it represents a common ground soviets now have something 
thats quintessentially american said harriet kuhr of the 
friendship force of atlanta which pioneered exchanges betweens 
us and soviet citizens 
in a way its one of our imperialistic beliefs that everybody 
wants to be american but they havent been allowed to kuhr said 
thats not necessarily true but it makes us feel good its 
like wow mcdonalds whats next maybe theyll start building 
fords 
the moscow mcdonalds opened wednesday with the most fanfare of 
any of the 11201 franchises in the late ray krocs empire 
the restaurant rang up 30000 meals on 27 cash registers 
breaking the openingday record for mcdonalds worldwide officials 
said 
over 70 billion burgers have been served since kroc flipped his 
first patty 35 years ago and 22 million people in 52 countries eat 
at mcdonalds every day thats more people than live in australia 
and new zealand 
the fascination with a mcdonalds on alexander pushkin square 
named for the father of modern russian poetry went far beyond the 
opening of a business venture however 
it was front page news in the new york times and was featured on 
all american networks the nation somehow found it comforting to 
know that its former cold war foe now is more likely to have beeg 
mak attacks rather than nuclear ones 
its the equivalent of selling russian meat pies in times 
square said ethel dunn of the highgate road social science 
research station in berkeley calif 
at the moment its a novelty but russians are getting used 
to the idea theres something of value to be gained from americans 
its a chance for them to learn something from us 
mcdonalds trained soviet farmers how to increase yields of 
potatoes cattle and lettuce it imported seeds for pickle 
cucumbers and shipped in some things that arent sovietgrown such 
as mustard and sesame seeds 
they also trained their burger flippers to be cheery a stark 
contrast to the dour faces found in staterun cafeterias 
we taught them what fast friendly service means what it means 
to provide clean surroundings and good quality food said gary 
reinblatt senior vice president for mcdonalds of canada its 
going to make the world a smaller place 
some soviets were suspicious of the chipper faces 
i smile to everybody and they say whats wrong why the 
smile said an unidentified worker in moscow they think im 
laughing at them because its very unusual for soviet people to be 
kind and to be polite to everybody 
and not everyone thinks the venture can cut the mustard or lead 
to soviet versions of ronald mcdonald mayor mccheese and the ham 
burglar 
i would be shocked if it works out right said dimitri 
simes a soviet emigre who works for the carnegie endowment for 
peace in washington dc 
theyve had to train people for things they are not 
conditioned to be pleasant efficiesponsible and not steal from 
the kitchen the company or customers simes sai 
to deliver the stuff they need at the restaurant they will 
need reliable transportation it doesnt exist simes said you 
have to overcome so many bottlenecks inherent in the soviet 
system 
a beeg mac sold for 375 rubles more than two hours wages for 
the average soviet thats a fraction of what patrons were paying 
in nearby zelyeny ogonyok or the green light a joint with green 
and gold signs offering meat stew cold meatballs with beads of 
fat cabbage soup and black bread 
but some sociologists said mcdonalds is a tangible sign that 
mikhail gorbachevs policy of overhauling the countrys economic 
system is delivering more goods to hungryrs 
one of the primary concerns of soviet citizens is the food 
supply said louise shelley chairwoman of the department of 
justice law and society at american university 
if the opening to the west increases the ability to feed the 
population its really an important development ms a concrete 
benefit a symbol that there is some economic progress under 
perestroika 
where will it end 
avon is calling at chinas door 
avon products inc said wednesday its cosmetics wibe made and 
sold in china in a joint venture with guangzhou cosmetics factory 
avon expects to have 3000 saleesentatives working in guangzhou

more than four months after putting 
bloomingdales on the auction block officials for federal 
department store inc are now contemplating calling off the sale of 
the 17store highfashion chain 
federated is studying whether there would be more value by 
retaining bloomingdales or by selling it spokeswoman carol 
sanger said wednesday 
federated is bloomingdales parent and the american holding 
company of campeau corp the troubled canadian retailer that 
sought protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankrupcty code on jan 15 for federated and its sister us 
retailing chain allied stores corp 
campeau had set a february deadline for selling the 17store 
chain 
according to unidentified sources quoted in todays editions of 
the new york times federated had received at least three bids for 
tony bloomingdales but most were below federateds 1 
billionplus asking price 
absent a bid for bloomingdales that would be so overwhelming 
that wed have to act on it the decision would be delayed pending 
the construction of an overall reorganization plan for the 
companies ms sanger said 
rumors have been circulating in the retail trade that potential 
bidders were only considering offers of around 800 million 
any sale would be subject to bankruptcy court approval as well 
as the approval of a committee which has not yet been completely 
formed to represent creditors the committee probably could not 
meet until at least midfebruary 
campeau acquired federated in 1988 two years earlier campeau 
acquired the allied chain the acquisitions left the retailers with 
more than 75 billion in debt

its senior management as the troubled institution tries to recover 
from massive losses in real estate loans 
the bank said wednesday that four senior executives had left the 
company including the head of the its boston operation 
the announcement came less than a week after the banks board of 
directors forced out walter connolly as chairman naming h ridgely 
bullock as an interim replacement 
these changes represent a major step in the achievement of our 
recovery plan for the company bullock said in a statement i 
expect theyll have an immediate impact on our goal of 
strengthening credit policies procedures and administration 
the bank said richard driscoll vice chairman of the corporation 
and chairman of bank of new englands boston operation had retired 
at the request of the board of directors 
other executives to leave are m thomas wilson president of the 
boston operation hugh m taylor senior credit policy officer and 
james sweeney executive vice president of real estate lending 
under the new organization bullock will also serve as chairman 
and chief executive of the boston division 
leo breitman who was president of connecticut bank and trust 
co a subsidiary will be president and chief operating officer of 
the boston operation 
earlier in the day bank of new england said it had completed 
the sale of a vehicle leasing business for 350 million a move 
that would give the company an infusion of cash 
the bank said it had sold the us portion of its mccullagh 
leasing to ge capital a subsidiary of general electric co 
the business leases car and truck fleets in the united states 
and canada and bank of new england said it expected to complete 
the sale of the canadian portion next week for around 100 million

earlier this week the bank said it had agreed to sell its 
credit card business to citicorp for 828 million 
bullock said completing the sale of the leasing business 
represents continued momentum in our asset sales plan as we 
aggressively pursue other options to downsize the company and 
improve our capital ratios 
the bank last week was forced to borrow money from the federal 
reserve bank of boston as depositors have withdrawn millions of 
dollars 
tom lavelle a bank spokesman said the money from ge capital 
could help bank of new england avoid returning to the federal 
reserve in the immediate future 
it is a possibility that we would not resort to the fed but 
we will be monitoring it over the next day or two he said

officials in charge of president bushs 
savings and loan bailout getting their second tonguelashing in as 
many weeks on capitol hill are assuring lawmakers they will speed 
up their work 
i share your concerns about getting this job done 
deputy treasury secretary john e robson told critical members of 
the senate banking committee and were going to break our necks 
to see that we get it done 
the officials a week after undergoing criticism from house 
members over the slow pace of their work endured similar 
complaints from the senators wednesday 
act decisively do whats necessary dont be timid said 
sen jake garn of utah senior republican on the senate banking 
committee 
surely surely there must be something you can do to speed up 
the process he said warning that further delay by the 
resolution trust corp will increase costs to the taxpayers 
on wednesday arizonas largest savings institution 
phoenixbased merabank was seized by the federal government the 
action by the rtc made merabank the sixth arizona savings and loan 
to be seized by the government leaving only four operating 
privately 
the rtc has taken over some 350 sampls to date disposing of 42 of 
them however 33 of the resolutions were completed in the agencys 
first three months of operation and only nine since then 
the pace was a little slower than some of us would have liked 
to have seen conceded robson acting chairman of the rtc 
oversight board 
sens donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the banking 
committee and paul sarbanes dmd were particularly critical of 
the administrations failure to fill many of the posts in the sampl 
bureaucracy nearly six months after enactment of the bailout law 
it is impossible to understand how the thrift crisis can be 
successfully resolved with many of the key players not even in 
uniform ready to participate riegle said 
the administration has failed to appoint a new office of thrift 
supervision director two of the five members of the rtc oversight 
board an inspector general for the rtc four of five members of a 
board governing the 12 regional federal home loan banks and a new 
member of the board of the federal deposit insurance corp 
the urgency that was attached to this legislation seems to 
have evaporated with its passage sarbanes complained 
robson said the administration has had some difficulty finding 
candidates whose business activities did not pose a conflict of 
interest also he described the fbi clearance process as 
draconian 
however he said the administration was very close to naming 
a fourth member of the rtc oversight board and said the candidate 
for the agencys inspector general was undergoing background checks 
robson also said if the 50 billion allocated to the rtc proved 
to be inadequate the administration could ask congress to 
reallocate to earlier periods 32 billion earmarked for 
post1992 failures

southern union a texasbased natural gas utility 
has won court permission to complete its 137 million merger with 
metro mobile cts inc 
vice chancellor william chandler of delaware chancery court on 
wednesday declined to block the merger as requested by tcg a 
privately held texas corporation owned by southern union 
shareholder tc griffith 
chandler said tcg had not proved it was likely to succeed with 
its case tcg charged that the merger violated delaware business 
law and that southern union withheld information that could affect 
the value of shareholders stock 
metro a new yorkbased cellular phone company that has a 
propane gas subsidiary is offering 1380 a share for southern 
unions 10145 million shares 
chandler noted in his 28page opinion metros bid offers 
southern union stockholders a significant premium over its recent 
market price 
about a dozen companies had bid for southern union stock but 
only metro wanted the entire company the chancellor said 
metros bid moreover was at a far greater price than any 
other offer and was the only offer to acquire all of southern 
union he said 
there have been no other offers since june 1989 he said 
adding a delay in receiving metros cash offer would be 
injurious to southern union stockholders because of the time value 
of money 
worse still if the merger is enjoined metro has indicated 
that it will probably walk away from the transaction the judge 
said 
southern union based in austin texas has natural gas 
utilities in texas arizona and oklahoma it also is involved in 
oil and gas exploration and production markets gas to interstate 
pipeline systems and users and has substantial real estate 
investments according to the court filings 
southern union and metro are both incorporated in delaware 
in seeking the injunction griffith contended southern union did 
not tell shareholders that the company had a change of winning 
litigation against a new mexico utility winning could increase 
southern unions assets by about 60 million and also increase the 
value of its natural gas reserves according to griffiths request

the government has taken control of merabank 
arizonas largest savings institution in a taxpayer bailout which 
regulators said would be softened by a 450 million cash infusion 
from the thrifts parent 
by coincidence the seizure wednesday occurred while officers of 
pinnacle west capital corp scrambled to rearrange the holding 
companys debt to accommodate extra borrowing for merabank 
agreements to restructure more than 650 million in debt with 
existing lenders were completed 15 minutes before wednesdays 
midnight deadline pinnacle west executives said 
its a done deal its all over said keith turley pinnacle 
west chairman and chief executive officer everything is signed 
sealed and delivered 
turley said the agreement included provision for funds to meet 
pinnacle wests obligation to give merabank a cash infusion of 450 
million plus 12 million in accrued interest he also said it 
avoids the possibility the holding company would have to wind up in 
bankruptcy court 
merabank fell victim to the states realestate slump said a 
lawyer for the office of thrift supervisions regional office in 
san francisco 
basically what they did was go heavily into some of the newer 
riskier investments like construction loans and direct investments 
and land loans for development purposes while a number of 
sampls and banks were doing the same type of thing in arizona said 
bill black the ots district counsel 
at the same time black said arizonas economy was beginning to 
slump 
if you buy a lot and the demand falls what has to happen to 
the price it has to fall he said 
the ots a branch of the treasury department determined that 
the thrift was operating in an unsafe manner and the resolution 
trust corp took over black said 
regulators said all merabank branches will remain open for 
business as usual operating under a new governmentowned thrift 
called merabank federal savings bank deposits will be insured up 
to 100000 per account 
pinnacle west had been seeking a buyer for merabank and 
announced in december that it might have found one but henry b 
sargent jr the companys chief financial officer said wednesday 
that wasnt the case 
we didnt have any prospects of selling merabank but i think 
now that the federal government has taken over they will have a 
prospect of selling it and that is a possibility weve all 
considered for some time sargent said 
sargent said pinnacle west would honor the agreement to inject 
450 million into the thrift by march 31 even though it is in the 
governments hands 
the money will not bring merabank close to its capital 
requirement black said 
on tuesday standard amp poors downgraded the ratings of secured 
debt and bonds of arizona public service co an electric utility 
which is pinnacle wests only profitable subsidiary and pacificorp 
of portland ore closed its phoenix office 
pacificorp offered to buy aps in november on dec 1 it offered 
to buy pinnacle west minus merabank and was rejected 
mike nelson pacificorps director of financial planning said 
he wasnt sure whether the takeover would spark renewed interest in 
pinnacle west 
were still interested in entering into some sort of 
negotiations nelson said 
merabank lost 209 million in 1988 and lost 190 million in the 
first three quarters of 1989 the extent of the red ink triggered 
fears by state utility regulators that pinnacle west might sap the 
vigor of arizona public service while trying to steady its 
staggering thrift 
marcia weeks chairman of the arizona corporation commission 
called the federal action a sad day for arizona but a big relief 
for the utility ratepayers 
under the debt restructuring agreement signed wednesday turley 
said citibank chase manhattan bank chemical bank and morgan 
guaranty bank and trust co went together to provide up to 312 
million in interim financing to satisfy pinnacle wests agreement 
with the otc 
the restructuring agreement includes 624 million of current 
debt and 52 million in letterofcredit guarantees and other 
contingent obligations turley said he said wednesdays agreement 
extends original maturity dates by two years 
as earlier it also pledges aps common stock as security turley 
said he said no aps asset is pledged and that the pledge wont 
affect aps 
however he also said the modified agreements restrict pinnacle 
wests ability to incur new debt or make new investments it also 
institutes certain financial tests that must be met if pinnacle 
west were to pay cash dividends and turley said that made it 
unlikely for the foreseeable future that pinnacle west will be able 
to pay any such dividend 
turley said having reached the debt restructuring agreement 
effectively eliminates the threat of a chapter 11 bankruptcy 
filing an action under which a company secures protection from 
its creditors while undergoing financial restructuring and 
continuing to operate 
black said the 450 million networth agreement wrung from 
pinnacle west on dec 6 reduced the taxpayer cost of the merabank 
collapse far below the estimated 2 billion bailout of lincoln 
savings and loan association of irvine calif 
the government took lincoln away from american continental 
corp another phoenixbased holding company last april 
this is by far the largest recovery the government has been 
able to attain through a networth agreement black said 
pinnacle west bought merabank for 426 million in december 1986 
the year the states real estate market hit the skids 
at the end of last november merabank was 337 million in the 
red and had about 45 billion in deposits in 833000 accounts its 
66 billion in assets placed it 29th nationally in a mid1989 
rating by sheshunoff information services inc an austin texas 
consulting firm 
merabank is the sixth arizona sampl to be seized by the 
government leaving only four operating privately the second 
largest western savings and loan association of phoenix was 
seized in june and put up for sale earlier this month 
kevin shields a spokesman for the rtcs denver office said it 
would take months to prepare merabank for sale 
merabank operates a subsidiary in el paso texas merabank 
texas which was a buyer in the 1988 governmentassisted bailout of 
three texas sampls it got about 670 million from the government to 
acquire state federal lubbock first financial el paso and 
brownfield federal brownfield 
the texas thrifts along with merabanks other holdings in the 
state revert to the governments possession 
merabank is the 32nd sampl failure so far this year an additional 
225 to 295 are likely to fail compared with a record 328 last year 
and 223 in 1988

treasury secretary nicholas brady today urged 
congress to adopt the presidents proposed taxfree family savings 
account as a way to boost americas competitive standing in global 
markets 
brady appearing before the senate budget committee to promote 
the tax aspects of the presidents 1991 budget request said the 
administration felt strongly that the new savings accounts along 
with a proposed cut in the capital gains tax would foster the 
longterm investment needed by us businesses to stay competitive 
an important goal for the 1990s is to increase the rate of 
growth of americas productive capacity brady said more 
saving is needed to finance increases in our productive capacity 
we believe that the federal government should foster an environment 
that is conducive to saving and we have a plan to achieve this 
objective 
the family savings account which bush mentioned in his state of 
the union address would allow an individual taxpayer to save up to 
2500 a year and a family to invest up to 5000 a year with the 
money earning interest taxfree as long as it was held for at least 
seven years 
the administration sees this proposal as the centerpiece of an 
effort to increase personal savings rates and thus expand the pool 
of money available for businesses to borrow to modernize production 
facilities 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn however 
questioned both the savings proposal and the administrations 
renewed effort to cut the capital gains tax saying that both 
measures would lose revenue at a time when the government was still 
facing massive federal deficits 
sasser said the family savings account would provide only a 
minimal increase in private savings while costing the government 
tax revenues 
also appearing before the committee today was michael boskin 
the presidents chief economic adviser both boskin and brady 
defended the bush budget against charges that it relied heavily on 
overly optimistic economic forecasts to reach the required deficit 
target for 1991 
in earlier testimony before the house budget committee boskin 
said the economy is now going through a sluggish period with 
economic growth as measured by the gross national product 
dropping to a barely perceptible 05 percent annual rate in the 
final three months of 1989 
boskin said that although he expects growth to pick up modestly 
in the first three months of this year another quarter of growth 
below 1 percent is possible 
under the grammrudman deficit reduction law two consecutive 
quarters of growth below 1 percent would require lawmakers to vote 
on suspending the deficit reduction targets for 1991 
boskin urged lawmakers not to do so especially if the economy 
is showing signs of an imminent rebound 
a suspension of grammrudman could have very unfavorable 
impacts on financial markets and cause interest rates to rise 
boskin said in testimony wednesday 
budget director richard darman denied the budget ignores the 
movement toward democracy in eastern europe which many lawmakers 
view as requiring less pentagon spending than the 292 billion 
proposed by the administration 
the reality is that this is a budget which proposes a 26 
percent real cut in military spending after taking account of 
inflation in the first year and a 2 percent real cut every year 
thereafter darman said 
robert d reischauer head of the bipartisan congressional 
budget office said the cbo came up with a 37 billion higher 
deficit for the 1991 fiscal year than the bush administration is 
assuming 
cbo put the 1991 deficit at 138 billion without any changes in 
current policy compared with the 101 billion claimed by the 
administration 
reischauer said more than twothirds of the higher cbo figure 
26 billion was a direct result of less optimistic forecasts on 
economic growth and interest rates the other 11 billion came from 
higher expected spending for the savings and loan bailout and such 
programs as medicare 
because of its assumptions the administration needed just 37 
billion in savings to meet the requirement of proposing a budget 
with a 64 billion deficit in the 1991 budget year which starts in 
october down from an expected deficit this year of 1238 billion 
but reischauer said the cbo assumptions would double the amount 
of savings needed by the administration 
congress may adopt either the cbo estimate or the assumptions in 
the bush budget in drawing up its own spending plan but the 
administrations assumptions must be used later in the year in 
determining whether acrosstheboard spending cuts are needed to 
meet the deficit target

japans fair trade commission said thursday its 
international committee was considering applying antimonopoly 
regulations to all foreign companies whose business practices 
affect japan 
japans current antimonopoly law applies only to japanese 
companies and subsidiaries of foreign firms operating within japan 
commission spokesman kazutoshi fujishiro said the commissions 
international committee was to report by midfebruary on the 
feasibility of extending the law to other foreign companies 
the 15member committee was set up two years ago because of the 
increasingly global scale of business activities he added 
fujishiro said small adjustments in some related laws and 
consultation with foreign countries would be needed to extend the 
the reach of japans antimonopoly law beyond its borders 
the newspaper yomiuri shimbun said the commission a watchdog 
body to ensure fair business competition would soon begin 
fullscale preparations for revision of the antimonopoly law 
the revision would indirectly contribute to bringing down the 
high prices of imported goods in japan it said 
the paper said other nations also extend the reach of their 
antimonopoly laws beyond national borders

major us retailers today reported fair sales gains in january 
with some having better luck than others clearing out leftover 
holiday merchandise 
sales at stores open at least a year rose around 5 percent 
industrywide from a year earlier according to estimates by retail 
analysts 
chains specializing in apparel had the best growth while mass 
merchandisers including the nations two largest retailers sears 
roebuck and co and k mart corp tallied increases below the 
industry average 
january is typically a slow time in the retailing trade and the 
month marks the end of the fiscal year for many merchants 
consumers usually have had their fill of spending at christmas and 
some people enter the new year bearing credit card debts that 
discourage them from shopping for awhile 
widespread price cutting and other promotions this past holiday 
season particularly by debtladen department stores desperate to 
raise cash may have left buyers more bloated than usual 
edward johnson a retail analyst at prescott ball amp turben inc 
said the first three weeks of january were sluggish for retailers 
as consumers nursed a bad case of postchristmas spending blues 
but shoppers began returning to stores in the last week of the 
month 
the seasonally adjusted pace of sales quickened in the final 
week to about 85 percent from 48 percent in the first three 
weeks he said 
jeffrey edelman of drexel burnham lambert inc said retailers 
that had the leanest inventories due to brisk holiday business 
generally had the lowest january sales gains the ones stuck with 
excess after christmas pushed hard to move the merchandise to make 
room for spring lines and therefore posted higher sales results 
looking ahead jeffrey feiner a merrill lynch amp co analyst 
said an erosion in consumer confidence lately reflecting 
uncertainty about economic conditions and weakness in financial 
markets portends tougher times for retailers 
weakness in both the housing and financial markets makes the 
outlook for consumer spending in retail stores in our opinion 
likely to be quite sluggish at least over the near term feiner 
said 
the sales reports today were from general merchandise chains 
department stores specialty apparel retailers and others here are 
some of the results 
sears the nations biggest retailer said sales rose 22 
percent in the four weeks ended jan 27 to 217 billion from 212 
billion a year earlier sales at stores open at least a year 
called same or comparablestore sales rose 33 percent 
analysts and store executives attach greater significance to 
samestore tallies because the excitement of new store openings can 
inflate sales temporarily providing distorted results 
k mart second in size to sears reported a 131 percent 
increase in sales to 179 billion from 158 billion but on a 
samestore basis sales were up 31 percent 
no 3ranked walmart stores inc which typically outperforms 
rival discounters said sales grew 24 percent to 184 billion from 
148 billion excluding newly opened stores sales rose 10 percent 
among retailers concentrating on apparel jc penney co inc 
said sales increased 85 percent to 779 million from 718 mllion a 
year earlier samestore sales rose 73 percent 
the specialty apparel retailer the limited inc posted an 11 
percent sales increase to 2856 million from 2567 million while 
sales grew 9 percent on a comparable store basis 
the gap inc another clothing specialist said january sales 
surged 34 percent to 94 million from the year earliers 70 
million samestore sales jumped 24 percent 
dayton hudson corp owner of department stores and the large 
target discount chain said january sales went up 122 percent to 
711 million from 634 million sales at stores open at least a 
year rose 52 percent 
woolworth corp owner of fw woolworth co stores plus 
numerous specialty retailers including the foot locker chain said 
domestic january sales rose 85 percent to 283 million from 261 
million domestic sales were up 45 percent at stores open for a 
year or more

sci television inc avoided being placed under 
federal bankrupcty court protection after a judge in delaware 
approved a lastminute change in the companys debt revision plan 
a lawyer for sci said 
the company now faces a new deadline of monday to complete a 
restructuring of its 13 billion debt 
the denverbased operator of six television stations unable to 
meet interest payments on its debt has been trying to get 
bondholders to accept stock and securities in exchange for their 
507 million in outstanding bonds 
as part of its planned debt restructuring the company specified 
that certain minimum levels of each of three series of bonds must 
be tendered under its exchange offer the requirement already had 
been met on two series of bonds but sci remained short of the 
minimum acceptance level of 875 percent for a third issue 
the company faced a deadline of 430 pm est wednesday to 
certify that it had been tendered or promised at least 875 percent 
of its 100 million issue of 16 percent senior subordinated 
debentures or be placed under bankruptcy protection 
as the deadline approached sci lawyer james l patton jr said 
the company requested that the minimum acceptance level be reduced 
to 85 percent and the judge agreed sci was able to certify that 
it had met the reduced minimum 
but in a statement today the company said that a closer 
examination of the tenders and promises to tender showed that there 
had been some miscounts of tenders received and the nontender of 
securities which sci understood had been offered to be tendered 
and that it had been tendered only 832 percent of the bonds as of 
this morning 
as a result it said the court was informed and has taken no 
action to modify or rescind its previous orders 
sci said it was holding the exchange offer open until noon est 
friday in an effort to get the required 85 percent of the bonds 
the company has been unable to generate enough cash to meet 
payments due on 13 billion in debt incurred when it was acquired 
in 1987 by the entrepreneur george gillett and a group led by the 
buyout specialists kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
gillett owns 55 percent of sci while the kohlberg group owns the 
rest 
under the debt restructuring plan the bondholders will get a 39 
percent equity stake in the company and bank lenders will get 5 
percent gilletts stake will be trimmed to 41 percent and 
kohlbergs stake to 15 percent 
sci television operates stations wsbk in boston wjbk in 
detroit wjw in cleveland waga in atlanta knsd in san diego and

the overseas construction industry 
once dubbed south koreas golden goose is gambling that new 
markets in arab and communist nations will help it overcome a long 
slump 
south korean contractors unfazed by political and regional 
differences with their homeland are eyeing postwar reconstruction 
projects in iran and iraq expanding business in libya and starting 
projects in the soviet union and other socialist nations 
theyre even considering a cooperative venture in siberia that 
would employ workers from south koreas archenemy communist north 
korea 
finally we seem to be coming out of a long tunnel of 
recession said choi jaeyol a government economic researcher 
referring to a surge in south korean overseas construction 
in the past two decades domestic contractors have won 90 
billion worth of contracts overseas earning foreign currency 
needed for the countrys economic development 
but in recent years south koreas overseas construction 
declined severely volume of contracts nosedived from an alltime 
high of 137 billion in 1981 to 16 billion in 1988 
overseas construction volume began to pick up last year 
reaching 24 billion and officials expect business in 1990 to top 
77 billion some of it in socialist and communist nations 
south koreans are expanding their business from laborintensive 
civil engineering to technologyoriented projects such as 
powerplants but they still rely heavily on cheap labor 
south korean contractors abroad hire help from bangladesh 
thailand the philippines and other third world asian nations at 
the end of 1989 42000 foreigners were on korean payrolls abroad 
compared with 24000 korean overseas construction workers 
the south koreans are paid roughly 875 a month while other 
foreign workers earn only onethird of that amount a price edge 
companies say is necessary for them to remain competitive 
officials say libya will emerge as south koreas largest market 
in 1990 with 57 billion of contracts followed by saudi arabia 
with 820 million and iran with 422 million 
last september libya picked up donga construction co of seoul 
as a prime contractor for a 53 billion water project a formal 
contract for the project the largest awarded a south korean firm 
will be signed this year 
south koreans received nearly 80 percent of their overseas 
contracts in the oilrich middle east in the past but saudi arabia 
and other arab nations scaled down development revenues as prices 
for their oil dropped 
choi who works for the governmentcontrolled overseas 
construction association said the recovery pace of south koreas 
overseas construction business depends partly on the ability to 
snare multibillion dollar rehabilitation projects in iran and iraq 
south korea is one of the few countrie able to do business with 
both iran and iraq during the eightyear persian gulf war south 
korea maneuvered to stay neutral between the two 
iran sought south korean assistance in getting usmade jet 
parts for its air force but the seoul government rejected the 
request citing its neutral foreign policy iran retaliated by 
downgrading its ties with seoul to a charge daffairs but restored 
full ties with seoul after the ceasefire 
south koreas rejection of irans request helped it open ties 
with iraq with which seoul had no diplomatic relations south 
korea now maintains diplomatic relations with both arab nations 
kim sungjo a directorgeneral in the construction ministry 
said south korean business in the region would increase as the two 
arab nations push reabilitation projects 
several south korean companies have sent teams of experts to 
tehran to inspect a major petrochemical project at bandar khomeini 
in southern iran abandoned by japans mitsui corp 
iran officially asked south korea to finish construction after 
the japanese conglomerate decided the plant was too damaged by the 
war to be completed 
the iranian project was 85 percent completed before the war 
broke out in 1980 and was originally estimated in 1973 to cost 358 
million by 1981 the cost had swelled to 448 billion 
government sources who asked not to be identified said iran is 
seeking a 3 billion loan from south korea to complete construction 
south korean companies also are pursuing projects in the soviet 
union and other socialist countries with which their 
anticommunist government is improving relations 
seoul has opened full diplomtic relations with hungary poland 
yugoslavia and algeria and established de facto consular ties with 
the soviet union in the last 12 months 
the daewoo group one of the largest korean conglomerates is 
pushing hotel projects in budapest and moscow another 
conglomerate the hyundai group has recently signed a 30year 
contract to develop forest land in eastern siberia 
with approval from the seoul government hyundai plans to hire 
hundreds of communist north korean workers for its develpment 
projects in siberia

walter loeb grew up in a european merchants 
family spent two decades working for big us department stores 
and won acclaim as the dean of retail securities analysts on wall 
street hes retiring but not really 
im calling it a graduation he saidi dont want to stop 
i want to keep going 
the new career the silverhaired bespectacled loeb is starting 
at age 65 will be as a private consultant and newsletter publisher 
in a realm in which he is considered an elder statesman 
one of the hot topics as he peers into the future is the 
prospect for global expansion by retailers shifting political 
winds traversing eastern europe and plans for greater harmony among 
european community countries in 1992 could be a stroke of good 
fortune for forwardthinking outsiders 
if retailers dont think ahead they will not have the 
opportunity because others will do it he said i think that 
unless we get ready it will not ever happen 
some prominent merchants have shown it can be done he said 
they include toys r us inc the gap inc englands laura ashley 
holdings plc and italys benetton group 
there are many examples of companies that have been able to do 
a global distribution of merchandise and i think that this will be 
the case more so in the 1990s he said 
loebs transnational vision reflects is own immigrant 
background he speaks english french german italian and spanish 
i think its a very exciting new topic he said in an 
interview as he was preparing to leave morgan stanley amp co launch 
loeb associates and start a a monthly newsletter 
stores supplying staples that transcend cultural differences 
should have the easiest time venturing from home turf the giant 
toy discounter toys r us is one of the best examples toys are 
toys kids are kids and grandparents are grandparents loeb said 
with retailers worldwide looking toward european expansion he 
said the value of american properties currently for sale has 
fallen because the siren song of foreign markets has diverted 
investor attention 
for instance loeb said the debtencumbered allied stores corp 
and federated department stores inc chains owned by canadas 
campeau corp which are trying to solve their financial problems 
in bankruptcy court may not fetch as much as they might have if 
they were auctioned 
loeb said many widely publicized predicaments in retailing were 
caused by brash developers with no merchandising expertise the 
financial drain of building retail operations largely with 
borrowed money overshadowed the core business of selling goods 
im sad about developments that have been caused by 
developers i believe very strongly that merchants should be 
running the retail businesses loeb said its not a science 
but it is also not easy to be a good merchant 
after the shakeout more stores will be back in the hands of 
retailers loeb predicted 
tomorrow some of these companies will again be smaller 
entities he said entrepreneurs will run them maybe with 
high debt but they will be run on an entrepreneurial basis and 
several will be very successful as a result 
even exemplary retailers will have to adapt in the 1990s as 
consumers save more spend less and redirect dollars toward 
housewares and home improvement i think the consumer is going to 
be very conservative loeb said 
stores appealing to doityourselfers stand to flourish while 
specialty apparel retailers which had been gobbling up market 
share from traditional department stores will have a tougher 
time he said 
personally loeb said he frequents discounters because like any 
savvy consumer he likes a good bargain but he patronizes 
specialty apparel stores when shopping for suits 
i like the service i like the attention and i like the 
quality of the tailoring he said 
friends and acquaintances describe loeb as loyal and 
selfeffacing with a ready sense of humor he takes obvious pride 
in the accomplishments of his three adult daughters and of his wife 
of 31 years phyllis 
professional contacts admire his keen judgment and ferocious 
appetite for work 
underneath an affable exterior he is germanic in work 
habits said isaac lagnado director of research at the 
international council of shopping centers 
loeb was born jan 28 1925 near frankfurt his father karl a 
successful button wholesaler moved his family and business to 
italy in 1936 when nazi germany was in the throes of antisemitic 
political upheaval 
the loebs left italy in 1939 for america they relocated in cuba 
for 18 months while awaiting entry into this country where the 
elder loeb established himself as a wholesaler of costume jewelry 
walter loeb was drafted into the army in 1943 and participated 
in the normandy invasion he was at utah beach on dday 
upon his return to the united states he studied marketing and 
history at new york university and graduated in 1949 
he spent 20 years learning the retail business from the inside 
he worked at an arm of what is now rh macy amp co at may 
department stores co and at allied stores corp 
loeb turned to consulting in 1969 then came to wall street in 
1972 as an analyst with the johnson redbook service he joined 
morgan stanley in 1974 as a senior analystwas named a vice 
president in 1980 and a principal of the firm in 1984 
dubbed the dean of wall street retail analysts by industry 
insiders loeb also has won recognition internationally the french 
newspaper le monde in a 1988 article on a speech loeb made in 
paris referred to him somewhat irreverently as the pope of 
business 
experience in retailing has helped loeb cultivate a rapport with 
store executives that few in his field enjoy it also endowed him 
with special influence among institutional investors he has advised 
i did everything that one does as you grow up in this 
business he said

it was in 1974 that 3m scientist art 
fry sitting through a boring church sermon concocted the idea of 
selfsticking yellow notes that can be removed without a trace 
for use in his choir hymn books 
but it took him four years to convince superiors at 3m that this 
idea would sell commercially two years later in april 1980 
postit notes premiered and america has been stuck on them since 
initial enthusiasm for a piece of note paper with adhesive on 
the back wasnt overwhelming fry said of his battle to persuade 
superiors it was hard to sell the concept that people needed a 
note pad that would sell at a premium price comparscratch paper 
now a decade after the product hit the market many americans 
wonder how they got along without the yelled to ordinary 
ow squares they stick to 
reports folders desks computers telephones and refrigerators 
3m started with two sizes of postit notes 3 inches by 5 inches 
and 1 by 2 available only in yellow today the company says it 
has more than 350 varieties a range of different sizes and colors 
plus many with cartoon characters and messages there are postit 
notes specifically made for taking phone messages marking book 
pages and identifying material to be faxed

grumman corp on thursday reported a sharp drop 
in earnings for the 1989 fourth quarter and year in part because 
of lower sales in its aerospace and electronics sectors 
in a statement the company said it planned to reduce its work 
force by about 1000 by the end of 1990 following 3000 cuts in 
1989 that left the defense contractor with 28900 employees 
an imminent decline in defense spending by the federal 
government because of easing eastwest tensions has been blamed for 
a poor outlook for the defense industry 
for the period ended dec 31 grumman said profits dropped 39 
percent to 148 million or 41 cents a share from 241 million 
or 70 cents a share in the same 1988 period 
sales for the quarter fell 16 percent to 867 million from 104 
million 
for the full year net income was 673 million or 191 a 
share down 22 percent from 865 million or 250 a share in 
1988 sales declined 25 percent to 356 billion from 365 
billion 
grumman said sales from its aerospace division fell 58 percent 
because of winding down of two development programs and delivery of 
fewer production aircraft to the navy 
grummans electronics sales declined 133 percent because of 
fewer test equipment deliveries reduced requirements for grumman 
aircraft and lower revenue from an air force and army joint radar 
program 
even in a nogrowth defense budget cycle there will be plenty 
of business for grumman and others who are efficient reliable 
suppliers of quality products grumman chairman john obrien said 
in a statement 
the statement said grumman has a backlog of 69 billion while 
the proposed 1991 defense budget funds grumman programs at 265 
billion about the same as in 1990

construction spending advanced last year at 
its slowest pace since the 1982 recession the government said 
thursday analysts blamed the weakness on high interest rates 
overbuilding and a sluggish economy 
the commerce department said residential nonresidential and 
government construction spending totaled 4147 billion a 12 
percent increase over 1988 but the smallest gain since a 51 
percent decline in 1982 
contributing to the poor showing was a 06 percent decline in 
december spending which was buffeted by record cold weather over 
most of the country east of the rockies 
spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4146 
billion in december nearly erasing a 07 percent gain in november 
it was the lowest onemonth increase since a decline of 1 percent 
last june 
analysts said federal reserve actions that kept interest rates 
relatively high through most of the year not only made construction 
more expensive but also slowed the economy and thus made sales 
more difficult 
plus you had a number of good years of construction leading 
up to 1989 said david berson chief economist for the federal 
national mortgage association eventually you have all the 
houses and office buildings that you need you run out of pentup 
demand 
because of the lessening demand and the state of the economy 
berson said 1990 at best will be about what it was in 1989 and 
could even fall a little bit 
another factor beginning to worry builders and analysts alike is 
the adverse effect of the savings and loan bailout law on the 
availability of construction financing 
the law limits the amount that savings and loans can lend to 
any one construction company said economist steven cochran of 
wefa group in bala cynwyd pa who added that efforts are under 
way to resolve the problem 
analysts point to widespread vacancies in office buildings as 
evidence of overbuilding in the nonresidential sector which 
continued to grow last year 
nonresidential spending was up 24 percent to 994 billion in 
1989 and 43 percent to an annual rate of 967 billion in december 
residential spending representing 50 percent of construction 
spending was off 11 percent to 1959 billion last year and down 
07 percent in december to an annual rate of 191 billion 
but singlefamily construction picked up 04 percent to an 
annual rate of 1443 billion in december the third straight 
advance after falling for eight months multifamily spending 
which has fallen every month since july was down 28 percent to a 
206 billion annual rate 
the usually volatile government sector rose 38 percent to 84 
billion in 1989 and 29 percent to a 911 billion annual rate in 
december when it was boosted by a 93 percent gain in highway and 
street projects government projects account for about 20 percent 
of construction spending

you probaby wont see any commercials 
about it soon but some livestock producers say they turn to 
woolite to brighten up their sheep for competition 
its designed for wool and theyre wool said marshall 
eaton as he was blowdrying a lamb recently at the 94th 
southwestern exposition and livestock show and rodeo 
we used to use mrs stewarts bluing what your grandmother 
used said eaton an agriculture teacher at tuscola in west 
texas i guess people switched over at least 10 years ago 
whenever woolite came out 
the household wool cleaner was among a number of wellknown 
products used to help junior lamb show entrants look their best 
the fort worth startelegram found 
the newspaper said it found used bottles of woolite and ivory 
palmolive and dawn dishwashing liquids among the containers 
discarded in the sheep barn washing area 
guy reinarz of new braunfels said he first uses a stronger 
soap on his sheep and then i go back with woolite it seems to 
leave the wool a lot softer 
there is nothing to indicate on the products label that woolite 
can turn dingy gray rambouillet lambs into sparkling white show 
creatures 
trust woolite no shrinking stretching fading it says 
it also notes it works on all your fine washables of silk 
wool cashmere cotton polyester 
but bill mcclaran of granbury said he prefers palmolive for 
whitening those dingy lambs 
when you run out of palmolive you use woolite mcclaran 
said 
regardless of what brand they use livestock producers agree 
that it is extremely important to have lambs coats looking their 
brightest when they are led before the sharpeyed judges 
said eaton its a little bit of a beauty contest

the us economy fell sharply in january for the 
ninth consecutive month and at the greatest rate of decline since 
the last recession the nations purchasing managers said thursday 
in a widely watched survey 
the monthly report which substantiated other evidence of an 
economic slowdown contributed to a downward blip in stock trading 
early in the day but it didnt last analysts said it had little 
effect on bond trading 
david wyss an economist for the forecasting firm 
drimcgrawhill inc said the financial markets were too busy 
worrying about the state of the union address last night 
the markets were preoccupied with the implications of president 
bushs proposals wednesday night for troop reductions in europe 
which could lead to a lower federal deficit and in turn lower 
interest rates wyss said 
alan levenson an economist for salomon brothers inc said the 
purchasing survey result was about what the markets expected so 
the reaction was not unusual 
the national association of purchasing management said its 
monthly index fell in january to 452 percent down from 467 
percent in december 
a reading below 50 indicates that the us manufacturing economy 
is declining while above 50 indicates expansion the group said 
the index has been below 50 for the past nine months 
the figures were adjusted to reflect an update of the seasonal 
adjustment factors of the us commerce department that are used to 
calculate the index 
it confirms what weve been saying and whats been obvious for 
a while which is that the economy is slowing down rather 
dramatically wyss said but we dont see signs of recession 
wyss pointed out that a key part of the survey supplier 
deliveries was up in january to 472 percent from 425 percent in 
december the figure shows how fast companies receive goods they 
order an increase means supplier companies are operating at a 
higher capacity 
wyss said this figure is important because it is a component of 
the commerce departments monthly leading indicators the 
governments chief economic forecasting gauge 
however the purchasing group attributed the increase to fewer 
weatherrelated delays in producing and transporting goods 
the groups new export orders figure also continued to show 
relative strength said the group based in tempe ariz the 
seasonally unadjusted export orders index increased to 555 percent 
from 53 percent in december 
the new orders portion of the groups survey fell significantly 
in january the employment component declined for the 11th 
consecutive month and the inventories index was the lowest since 
1986 
the manufacturing economy entered 1990 on a dismal note 
said robert j bretz chairman of the groups survey committee he 
said it was the greatest rate of decline since december 1982 when 
the nation was starting to pull out of the last recession 
he said the groups overall monthly index averaged 489 percent 
for all of 1989 that figure is consistent with real gross national 
product growth of about 22 percent after adding 06 percent to 
reflect the rebound in agricultural output last year from the 1988 
drought he said 
bretz said the index would have to fall below 44 percent before 
it indicates a decline in real gnp 
doug handler an economist for dun amp bradstreet corp said the 
report was weaker than he expected but that other recent 
statistics show the economys manufacturing sector is bottoming 
out in general 
the survey is based on responses from executives who buy goods 
at more than 300 industrial companies

operations for the same period 
meanwhile mcgrawhill inc reported a loss of 983 million for 
the quarter as a result of previously disclosed plans to take 
unusual charges 
gannett said its earnings increased despite a weakening economy 
partly because of the diversity of its holdings 
the arlington vabased company which publishes usa today and 
81 other daily newspapers said it earned 1274 million or 79 
cents a share in the three months ended dec 31 compared with 
1178 million or 73 cents a share a year earlier

up 93 percent from 3645 million or 226 a share a year 
earlier 
operating revenue rose 6 percent to 352 billion from 331 
billion a year earlier 
the company said the latest results reflected a gain on the sale 
of the new mexican in santa fe nm that was offset by operating 
losses of gtg entertainment and costs associated with its plan to 
end its involvement with gtg ventures which produced an illfated 
television show usa today on tv 
the company said advertising revenue from usa today rose 13 
percent for the quarter it did not report earnings results from 
the newspaper but spokeswoman sheila gibbons said it had a

herald philadelphia inquirer detroit free press and san jose 
calif mercury news and operates a growing business information 
services division 
new yorkbased mcgrawhill said its fourthquarter loss was 
201 a share in contrast to earnings of 55 million or 113 a 
share a year earlier 
the latest loss reflects a charge of 152 million after taxes 
reflecting a realignment of operations writedowns associated with 
its data resources and other units the shutdown of its general 
books unit and reserves for severance payments associated with 
staff reductions of more than 1000 positions 
the company said in december that it planned to make those

in seeking to entice americans to save more 
money the white house is tackling a job that has been an 
overwhelming challenge to other american institutions including 
motherhood 
it begins with parents exhorting youngsters to put pennies in a 
piggy bank the lesson is developed throughout schooling the 
challenge is then taken on by banks by companies with payroll 
savings plans and by others 
to some degree all have failed which is why the bush 
administration now wants to attack the problem with tax 
enticements promising not to levy a penny against certain savings 
accounts left to build and age 
savings it is sometimes contended are the reason the japanese 
have gained such economic prominence their high savings rate 15 
percent to 20 percent of income sometimes more finances swift 
industrial expansion 
but using the japanese as a model or european nations which 
recently have saved at a rate double that of americans might not 
work americans are very different people with very different 
habits and approaches to life 
in the past 60 years the only time in which the american 
savings rate came close to recent japanese levels was when 
literally they were forced to save during world war ii payrolls 
were big but there was little to buy 
at the time some officials thought they had stumbled on a truth 
that savings bonds issued by the government and carrying the full 
faith and credit of uncle sam had something to do with it but the 
program faded after the war 
the savings binge ended in fact with the war in the five 
years 19411945 the rate averaged better than 20 percent in 1946 
it dived to 85 percent and the following year to 31 percent 
lower than the current level 
except for those years there has never been a doubledigit 
savings rate the amount saved as a percent of disposable or 
aftertax income the rate has moved up and down but the highest 
was 94 percent in 1973 
moreover the reasons for fluctuations arent entirely clear 
some of the evidence even contradicts pet theories such as that 
economic stability encourages savings 
that wasnt true in the early 1970s when inflation ran wild on 
average the first six years of that decade had the highest savings 
rate of any similar since the 1940s in 1974 the rate reached 93 
percent inflation 10 percent 
that is the second highest oneyear savings rate since world 
war ii was accompanied by the first doubledigit inflation rate in 
modern times it was a tragedy for savers since inflation exceeded 
the rate of interest earned 
it was in the early 1980s that concern steadily mounted in 
1983 the rate dipped to just 54 percent and to 44 percent in 
1985 and from then until last year it remained under 5 percent 
that decline is now seized upon by those who link it to the rise 
in federal budget deficits they could be correct in fact when 
evidence developed last year that it was possible to cut the 
deficit the rate rose above 5 percent 
while the budgetdeficit link might seem a strong one there is 
another school of thought economist edward yardeni and others see 
a connection with an entirely different set of figures demographic 
ones 
according to them the reason for low savings rates since the 
early and mid1980s is the bulge of younger people working its way 
through the economy 
as these people get older and put their bigspending years 
behind them says yardeni they will become savers content to sit 
on the couch and watch television instead of renting cars for ski 
weekends and other entertainment 
there are still more theories 
one thesis is that americans have pensions social security and 
large equity in homes and so have a sense of security that allows 
them to forego saving as narrowly defined 
another why save if inflation is just going to wipe it out 
another in view of recent shenanigans why entrust savings to 
banks and savings and loan associations that will only spend it 
their way 
one more who has money to save

compaq computer corp which has delayed 
distribution of its latest desktop computer because of a faulty 
chip said thursday its quarterly profit slipped for only the 
second time in its eightyear history 
for the threemonth period ended dec 31 the houstonbased 
maker of personal computers had earnings of 7905 million or 
184 per share down 14 percent from 9191 million or 218 per 
share during the same quarter in 1988 
sales totaled 78814 million up 18 percent from 66767 
million in 1988s fourth quarter 
compaq which took just four years to become a fortune 500 
company last posted a yeartoyear decline in quarterly earnings 
in the third quarter of 1984 when profits were 18 million 
compared with 38 million in the 1983 period 
compaq said in november it expected its fourthquarter profit to 
be off because it detected a fault in an intel corp chip causing 
delays in distributing new products said mike swavely president 
of the companys north american division 
engineers found a way to work with the chips several months ago 
but intel contacted compaq last week saying there was another 
problem 
the company said it had planned to ship its new deskpro 48625 
computer feb 1 but the date was set back due to the new trouble 
swavely said the model should be distributed during the current 
quarter 
compaq also blamed the profit drop to a neardoubling of 
fourthquarter research and development costs to 38 million 
increased costs associated with newproduct introductions and to a 
softening us market for personal computers 
for all of 1989 compaq reported earnings of 3333 million or 
777 per share up 31 percent from 2552 million or 630 per 
share in 1988 sales totaled 287 billion up 39 percent from the 
21 billion in 1988 
president rod canion said the introduction of new products 
contributed to the companys success in 1989 
besides the delayed deskpro 48625 the company introduced two 
new desktop computers and notebooksized laptop computers 
sales outside north america contributed 46 percent of compaqs 
revenue for 1989 canion said helping compensate for slowing 
domestic sales of personal computers to support growing 
international sales two new subsidiaries were opened in norway and 
denmark

two big department store companies to pay as much as 20 million in 
deposits to utilities which feared the retailers couldnt 
guarantee payment of bills 
us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr said that if the 
financial condition of the campeau corp retailers federated 
department stores and allied stores deteriorates he would require

made to any of these utilities aug said

administrative costs he said

the bush administration opened a heavy 
lobbying campaign for its initiatives to cut the capital gains tax 
and boost personal savings on thursday with chief of staff john 
sununu accusing democrats of being the party of taxes 
sununu rebuked democrats for failing to join republicans in 
giving bush a standing ovation during the state of the union 
address wednesday night when bush declared the federal budget 
could be balanced with no new taxes 
what i was surprised at last night was how stark the 
definition between the two parties was in terms of the applause 
sununu told a white house briefing 
democrats bristled at sununus attack coming barely 12 hours 
after bush told congress in the nationally broadcast address that 
americans did not send us here to bicker and once again i 
offer my hand to all of you 
i would hope that mr sununu would convince the president to 
reverse his views on opposition to lowering taxes on working 
americans sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate 
budget committee said in reference to a democratic plan to cut 
social security payroll taxes 
meanwhile bush renewed his push for a lower capital gains tax 
by sending it to congress wrapped in a package containing two 
proposals designed to provide tax breaks to middleincome americans 
one would establish socalled taxfree family savings 
accounts the other would allow up to 10000 to be withdrawn 
without penalty from individual retirement accounts to help finance 
firsttime home purchases 
bush at a ceremony at the white house to kick off the lobbying 
effort and send the legislation to congress said his package would 
provide economic benefits for all citizens 
he vowed to work closely with the democraticled congress on the 
package which the administration hopes will help sidetrack a 
politically appealing plan by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
to lower social security taxes 
on capitol hill treasury secretary nicholas brady presented the 
administrations case on the tax proposals to the senate budget 
committee we believe that the federal government should foster 
an environment that is conducive to saving and we have a plan to 
achieve this objective he testified 
but sasser later told reporters that bushs familysavings 
account plan was little more than window dressing and would 
be rejected by congress 
it is simply a crumb that they appear to be tossing in the 
direction of middle class people as a way to cover their flank 
because of administration opposition to moynihans plan to roll 
back last months social security tax increase and to provide an 
additional tax cut next year 
social security taxes rose to 765 percent from 751 percent on 
jan 1 
sununu defended the bush economic proposals and was sharply 
critical of democrats 
the democrats by refusing to stand up when the president 
suggested that you didnt need new taxes was making a party 
statement sununu said 
that ought to make the american public ask whether or not they 
might be trying to tell them that they really still want to be seen 
as the party of taxes he added 
although bush was applauded many times during his state of the 
union address and received standing ovations from all on four 
occasions when he promised to balance the budget with no new 
taxes republicans rose en masse to applaud him democrats 
remained seated 
at the senate hearing brady and michael boskin the presidents 
chief economic adviser were criticized by democrats for presenting 
congress with an unrealistic spending plan which failed to 
adequately attack the budget deficit 
the president and those of you who advise him are guilty of a 
failure of leadership said sen kent conrad dnd we are 
finding ourselves in a weakened position internationally and we 
dont seem to be able to summon the poltiical courage or the 
political will to fashion a game plan that really has much merit 
elsewhere house speaker thomas foley dwash told reporters 
that his party agrees something needs to be done about americas 
plummeting savings rate but rejects bushs tax cut 
the capital gains tax reduction would give people who are in 
the highest 1 percent of the nations income 80 percent of the 
benefits foley said thats not the idea we have about 
encouraging savings 
democrats instead would prefer to talk about individual 
retirement accounts that can be used used to protect up to 2000 a 
year from taxes for later use in retirement or as a down payment on 
a first house 
the administrations family savings account proposal would 
allow couples to save up to 5000 a year and individuals up to 
2500 and not pay income tax on the interest if the deposits are 
held for at least seven years 
the other sweetner in the capitalgains package is a 
proposal to permit up to 10000 to be withdrawn prematurely from 
an individual retirement account without penalty to help finance 
firsttime home purchases 
although bush initially proposed reducing the capital gains tax 
to 15 percent his new proposal would exclude from taxation up to 
30 percent of the capital gain from the sale of an asset held three 
years or longer 
that works out to an effective tax rate of 196 percent for 
taxpayers in the 28 percent bracket

drexel burnham lambert inc agreed to pay 
massachusetts 1 million in a settlement announced thursday the 
latest settlement arising from the wall street firms guilty plea 
to securities fraud charges 
massachusetts became the 41st state to reach such an agreement 
with drexel the amount was the largest settlement ever paid to the 
state in a securities matter according to secretary of state 
michael j connolly 
drexel pleaded guilty last september in us district court in 
new york to six felonies and paid 650 million to settle a range of 
fraud allegations stemming from the governments lengthy 
investigation of insider trading on wall street 
drexel also agreed to dozens of administrative changes and 
unprecedented federal supervision in settling civil charges with 
the securities and exchange commission 
under the settlement with the federal government drexel paid 
300 million in fines to the government and set aside 350 million 
for investors who can prove they were harmed by the firms actions 
those who may be entitled to restitution include people who bought 
stocks in about 20 allegedly fraudulent transactions cited by the 
sec 
the settlement with massachusetts is one of the largest the firm 
has reached with states so far drexel paid illinois about 12 
million and missouri announced a 1 million settlement on wednesday 
with the massachusetts agreement drexel has paid states 
settlements totaling 83 million 
were pleased we were able to settle it and now we can go 
about our business said steven anreder a drexel spokesman 
the 1 million settlement will go into the states general fund 
connolly said 
connolly said the 275000 originally offered by the firm was 
inadequate 
settling with the states relieves drexel of possible litigation 
and frees state regulators from having to investigate the firms 
trading activities from 1984 to 1986 when the sec alleged the 
fraud occurred 
the settlements also generally preserve the firms ability to 
underwrite securities and do other business in the states most 
states can revoke a companys right to do business if the firm is 
convicted or admits to committing a felony drexel abandoned the 
retail stock brokerage business last year 
in massachusetts the agreement includes a stipulation that 
drexel must not solicit any new retail trade without first 
notifying the state securities division and demonstrating that 
compliance procedures are in place 
the firm also cannot sponsor private placements to individuals 
and must work with the securities division to identify any state 
investors injured by the illegal sale of drexel junk bonds victims 
would be entitled to place claims with the 350 million 
compensation fund drexel established 
in addition drexel must hire an independent consultant to 
scrutinize company policies and submit compliance reports hire an 
ombudsman to receive and investigate complaints finance annual 
audits by the state securities division and establish an oversight 
committee to review its internal procedures 
connolly said he did not know whether any massachusetts 
residents were hurt by drexel sales 
drexel has been working with state regulators for the past eight 
months and connolly said officials monitoring the firm during that 
time have given them high marks

previous sessions losses as traders reconsidered the significance 
of a us proposal that the international monetary fund sell some 
of its gold stockpile

trading while energy livestock and crop futures were mixed

the imf sell 4 billion worth of gold to help some third world 
countries make pastdue loan payments 
the treasury department later said the proposal was for the imf 
to mobilize about 12 billion worth of gold that would not 
necessarily mean the metal would be sold on the open market but 
might be swapped for us dollars and other hard currencies in 
deals with governments and central banks 
the haziness of the proposal and the lack of overt support for 
the idea among the imfs 151 other nationmembers were keys to 
thursdays rally analysts said 
even if the united states makes this proposal and even if the 
imf agrees to do it its going to be a long time before they 
actually sell any gold said analyst james steel of refco inc 
anne orten a vice president of deak international inc a large 
dealer of currencies and precious metals said gold traders

back those contracts which pushed the market higher 
sugar futures rose moderately on new yorks coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange in a volatile session where the market rallied

the chairman of a senate panel said thursday 
that he wants to hold hearings into the jurisdictional dispute 
between the securities and exchange commission and the agency that 
regulates the futures industry 
im fully aware of the hornets nest one can hit here said 
sen christopher j dodd dconn about possible opposition from 
farm area congressmen who oversee the commodity futures trading 
commission 
a longsimmering rivalry between the sec which regulates the 
stock and bond markets and the cftc which oversees the nations 
futures markets heated up last year when a federal appeals court 
ruled in favor of the cftc 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals held that financial 
products that contain any aspects of a futures contract should be 
regulated by the cftc not the sec 
sec chairman richard c breeden who testified before dodds 
securities subcommittee of the senate banking housing and urban 
affairs committee thursday has been very vocal about resolving the 
dispute which he says is driving new financial products out of the 
country 
we are the only country in the world that has a separate 
agency to regulate the cash market and the derivative market 
breeden said in response to a question by dodd 
i would very much like to see us debate this issue in this 
congress said dodd i realize its one that will raise some 
feathers in certain quarters but it needs to be addressed 
the subcommittees ranking republican sen john heinz of 
pennsylvania said he supported dodds suggestion for a public 
airing of the issue 
in the past members of committees in both the house and senate 
have been careful not to tred outside their bailiwick as a sign of 
professional courtesy and political expediency despite occasional 
calls to resolve the dispute 
it is still a critical issue said heinz we shouldnt be 
deterred from examining even the most fearful subject politically 
fearful in this case 
heinz added that he hoped dodd will brave the wasps hornets 
and spiders and probably a few snakes as well that are likely 
to crawl out of the woodwork 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals in chicago last summer 
ruled that the sec overstepped its authority in authorizing three 
securities exchanges it regulates to trade in a hybrid financial 
instrument known as a stock basket 
technically called an index participation the product 
resembles a basket of stocks because it allows investors to buy or 
sell something with a value tied to broad stock market indexes 
such as the standard amp poors 500 
but the appeals court held that such products come under the 
cftcs supervision if they have any element of a futures product 
the appeals court refused to rehear the secs arguments and now 
its up to the solicitor general to decide if the dispute should be 
brought before the us supreme court for a possible hearing 
we would defend our exclusive jurisdiction at the same time 
it doesnt mean were against innovative products a cftc 
spokesman said in a telephone interview 
wed like to see some alternative worked out without 
litigation there are a lot of ramifications that have to be 
carefully considered said the spokesman who asked not to be 
named

bob coleman figures his wendys restaurant next 
to chrysler corps jefferson avenue assembly plant will weather 
the factorys closing friday 
he like some of the 1700 workers who will be laid off when 
dodge omni and plymouth horizon production stops has been through 
factory shutdowns before 
it closed down for a couple of weeks before coleman said of 
the plant on detroits east side it wont make too much of a 
difference 
the jefferson avenue plant one of the industrys oldest 
eventually will be demolished and part of the land under it will 
be incorporated into the jefferson north plant now being built 
next to the old plant 
many of the laid off employees will be offered jobs at the 
jefferson north plant in a year and a half or so when training 
begins for workers who will begin production of a new sportutility 
vehicle in late 1992 
and while the jefferson north plant will offer some money for 
the workers in late 1991 its providing income for coleman and his 
employees now 
we have the construction workers the restaurant manager 
said 
when the jefferson avenue plant officially closes with the end 
of its only shift friday afternoon no one is going to look back 
get a little mistyeyed and turn off the light 
hundreds of workers will show up monday and beyond cleaning up 
salvaging some equipment and getting the buildings ready for 
razing the united auto workers union nonetheless says it was 
betrayed by chrysler 
a handpainted sign taped on the door to uaw local 7 across the 
street from the jefferson north construction site takes a swipe at 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca lido said trust me he lied uaw 
local 7 
just over a year ago chrysler closed its kenosha wis 
assembly plant and put 5500 workers on layoff with no new factory 
to employ them it was a move union state and local officials 
decried saying chrysler and iacocca specifically had promised 
that the plant would stay open longer 
the kenosha plant was closed when chrysler moved omnihorizon 
production to jefferson avenue now the company says it cant sell 
enough of the small cars to keep the detroit plant open 
on thursday chrysler announced it would close its st louis car 
plant sept 21 seven months after it cuts production there in 
half the company will lay off 3700 workers in all 
the uaw has contested the jefferson avenue plant closing saying 
the company could have done a better job of marketing or 
redesigning the cars to boost sales 
for months workers at the jefferson avenue plant have walked to 
and from their jobs past a moonscape of barren land slowly being 
transformed into the jefferson north plant 
for some workers like walt harris of detoit jefferson north is 
the future during the time hes laid off and the time he hopes to 
report for retraining he plans to take law classes at wayne state 
university in detroit 
then hopefully ill be back at jefferson north said 
harris who has worked for chrysler for 23 years 
closing an assembly plant is like an hbomb in an automakers 
arsenal as it fights to hold profits in a fickle industry with 
demand for new cars slipping and competition from usbuilt 
japanese models growing its a tactic american companies have 
resorted to increasingly 
since 1987 us automakers have shut down 13 assembly plants 
laying off tens of thousands of workers in assembly and component 
plants 
laid off union workers can qualify for a variety of benefits 
designed to get them up to 95 percent of their takehome pay before 
overtime but some workers like local 7 member eddie jordan a 
veteran at jefferson avenue doubt whether the benefit funds have 
enough money to maintain that level as more workers draw from it 
still he said the jefferson avenue closing is different than 
the others because of the job possibilities offered by jefferson 
north 
the jefferson avenue plant began making cars in 1907 and the 
first vehicle bearing a chrysler nameplate rolled off the assembly 
line 17 years later nearly 9 million cars and trucks have been 
built at the plant 
chrysler spokesman doug nicoll said the company will keep the 41 
acres north of jefferson avenue and incorporate them into jefferson 
north the future of another 104 acres south of the original 
complex is undecided 
chrysler plans other cutbacks in its drive to trim 1 billion 
from its 26 billion budget by 1991 
beginning feb 12 the nations no 3 automaker will cut one 
shift from its st louis car plant putting 1900 people on 
indefinite layoff the company also is indefinitely laying off 
hundreds of workers as part of other production cutbacks nationwide 
some analysts have predicted the st louis factory and some 
canadian plants may have to close entirely or be consolidated to 
cut costs 
the cuts arent unique to chrysler 
general motors corp in midmarch will shut its lakewood 
assembly plant in atlanta putting 2500 workers on indefinite 
layoff the nations largest automaker also is cutting a shift each 
from its doraville ga and linden nj assembly plants 
about 15400 workers will lose or have lost their jobs at 11 gm 
or chrysler assembly plants because of indefinite layoffs between 
january and september

when john j phelan jr was 16 years old he 
spent a summer working for his fathers firm as a runner on the 
floor of the new york stock exchange he hated it 
i thought it was just a frightful place to be he said 
as he grew older phelan changed his mind about the nyse 
working as a specialist on the crowded floor managing the 
trading activity and rising through the executive ranks to become 
chairman and chief executive officer 
phelan announced thursday he would retire at the end of 1990 
after nearly seven years as chairman of the nations largest stock 
exchange 
he guided the exchange through a period of explosive growth 
championed new sophisticated technology and introduced 
controversial safeguards following the 1987 market crash and a 
nearrepeat performance in 1989 
securities industry officials said they were not entirely 
surprised by phelans announcement and praised his tenure 
i think hes been marvelous said alan c ace greenberg 
chairman of the investment firm bear stearns amp co he came from 
the floor he was a specialist he understands the business it 
helped 
weve seen everything from electronic trading pressures to the 
market crash to new products and innovations to congressional 
pressure added wall street veteran jack barbanel president of 
first global asset management inc i think he has done a very 
superb job addressing most of the issues 
speaking candidly in his unabashed new york accent phelan 
tackled difficult issues quickly and publicly including the 1987 
crash computerized program trading and competition from other 
foreign and domestic markets 
after the dow jones industrial average plunged 508 points on 
oct 19 1987 in a disaster compared to the great crash of 1929 
phelan pulled no punches calling it what it was the worst 
market i have ever seen in my lifetime or would hope to see again 
phelan 58 also has come under intense congressional pressure 
to reform the stock market and criticism from some fronts that the 
exchange has not adapted to a competitive threat from fully 
automated markets that can trade all day and night 
he always has had an answer and it usually has been without 
rancor or apologies 
he has been a calm and steadying influence as he steered the 
markets through both good and bad times said rep edward j 
markey dmass who has pressured for market reform since the 
crash often at odds with the exchange 
merrill lynch amp co chairman william a schreyer the nyses 
vice chairman said john phelan will be best remembered for the 
strong steady leadership he has provided for the entire securities 
industry during one of the most turbulent periods in its history 
he has been a voice of reason calm and integrity not only 
guiding the nyses member comunity but providing a broader public 
service by reassuring the investing public as well

the private institute for injury reduction 
said thursday that rearseat lap belts when unaccompanied by 
shoulder belts cause more than 1000 serious injuries a year 
the organization founded by a group of lawyers who specialize 
in representing accident victims urged a campaign by government 
and industry to equip millions of autos with backseat shoulder 
belts 
benjamin kelley the institutes president said that many 
victims of serious lap belt injuries are children because they tend 
to be in the rear seats of automobiles when crashes occur 
the administrator of the national highway traffic safety 
administration jerry ralph curry said his agency is already 
urging auto manufacturers and car dealers to prepare to retrofit 
older cars with rearseat shoulder straps 
under a rule adopted last year by the agency new cars must be 
equipped with rearseat shoulder belts 
curry said he was concerned that the safety institutes report 
may cause parents not to strap their children in while driving 
when properly adjusted seatbelts save lives he said 
kelley noted that last years regulation does not apply to 140 
million older cars on the road 
neither government nor the car industry are vigorously acting 
to see that existing cars are rapidly equipped with safe effective 
rearseat lapshoulder belts kelley said 
the harmful consequences of such indifference are summed up in 
the injury cases we have learned about to date kelley said 
the majority of the victims are children the most common fatal 
injuries are head injuries and internal bleeding 
nonfatal permanently disabling injuries are most often 
spinal cord damage resulting in permanent paraplegia and massive 
trauma to the abdominal organs he said 
kelley said that in a typical crash other passengers in the car 
even those not wearing seat belts tend to be less severely injured 
than a person seated in the rear and wearing a lap belt 
kelley called on manufacturers safety groups and the highway 
safety administration to launch an advertising campaign to ensure 
that all motorists know the hazards of rearseat laponly belts 
especially to children and the benefits of installing shoulder 
belts 
at a separate news conference curry said that while he is 
delighted that kelleys institute is focusing on rearseat 
accidents they are small potatoes compared to the 340000 
annual accidents involving frontseat passengers especially those 
not wearing seat belts 
he advised parents concerned about the issue to obtain a good 
child safety seat and keep their child buckled up 
if the child no longer fits the seat put in a booster seat he 
said 
if that no longer fits place the child in the front passenger 
seat with the shoulder strap fastened he said

standard amp poors corp said thursday it 
downgraded its rating on 400 million of texas air corp senior 
debt because of heavy losses at texas airs subsidiary eastern 
airlines and a new reorganization plan proposed by eastern 
the credit rating agency said the 400 million in texas air 
senior debt remained on its surveillance list with negative 
implications 
art kent a spokesman for texas air at its headquarters in 
houston said the company had no immediate comment on standard amp 
poors action 
on tuesday a committee of easterns preferred shareholders 
suggested the liquidation or outright sale of the miamibased 
airline which has been in chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
since last march 
in papers filed in us bankruptcy court the committee said it 
had lost faith in easterns management because it was 
cannibalizing the airline by selling vital assets 
the preferred shareholders criticized easterns latest 
reorganization plan unveiled late last week which proposes to pay 
them no more than 10 cents on the dollar in the form of new stock 
the new plan also calls for paying unsecured creditors only 10 
percent of their debts in cash when the airline emerges from 
bankruptcy protection and another 70 percent over the following 10 
years without interest 
in return for accepting partial repayment texas air would give 
the unsecured creditors 40 percent of easterns equity 
under easterns two previous plans unsecured creditors 
primarily trade suppliers such as aircraft manufacturers were to 
be repaid in full with interest at the completion of chapter 11 
easterns heavy losses and revised reorganization proposal 
which foresees a reduced cash payout to unsecured creditors will 
result in additional demands on texas airs resources and severely 
constrain financial flexibility standard amp poors said in a 
statement 
the parent company is already paying interest and dividends on 
some eastern secured debt and preferred stock and funded part of 
easterns september pension payment 
the rating agency stressed that texas airs cash reserves should 
prevent any liquidity crisis and that continental airlines its 
other major subsidiary is recovering from earlier financial 
problems 
however standard amp poors said credit strength is damaged by 
easterns continuing difficulties 
the statement also referred to reported remarks tuesday by texas 
air chairman frank lorenzo that a merger of eastern and continental 
is a possibility 
while a combination has longterm potential it would risk 
reversing the substantial progress made at continental the 
agency said 
texas air in a statement issued late thursday said it has 
studied the merger option but no consolidation of eastern and 
continental is currently being planned or being proposed by texas 
air to easterns creditors 
in a related development wednesday us bankruptcy judge burton 
r lifland approved easterns request for 50 million to be taken 
out of escrow to help fund its operations through february 
also on wednesday easterns management issued a memo to its 
employees dismissing the preferred shareholders criticisms and 
persistent rumors of a possible chapter 7 liquidation

centel cellular telephone co has agreed to 
pay 1 million to the government over a 1989 accident in which two 
people died when their helicopter crashed into a radio tower under 
construction in north carolina a federal communications commission 
official said thursday 
chicagobased centel which is not admitting any liability in 
the accident also will conduct a 2year educational safety 
awareness campaign within the cellular industry on antenna marking 
and lighting as part of an fccapproved consent decree said greg 
vogt chief of the commissions mobile services division 
the consent decree resolves an fcc complaint that centel 
allegedly had failed to comply with fcc requirements for tower 
marking and lighting 
the consent decree stemmed from a 1989 collision of a medivac 
helicopter with a tower at coinjock nc that was owned by a 
centel subsidiary the commission said two people in the 
helicopter were killed 
following an investigation of that accident and another 1989 
incident involving a centel tower in portsmouth va the fccs 
field operations bureau cited centel for possibly violating fcc 
rules 
vogt said the consent decree which was issued tuesday 
resolves any pending sanctions that we might impose on centel for 
the violation of our rules 
however centel will have to pay 1 million within five days and 
conduct an education campaign within the industry to make sure 
other licensees know their obligations to light towers during 
construction vogt said 
there has been some concern at the commission that licensees 
havent been diligent enough to make sure their lights are on and 
working both during construction and afterwards he said 
two civil suits claiming wrongful deaths also were filed in the 
north carolina case vogt said

the securities and exchange commission is 
conducting an inquiry into a 400 million charge that first 
interstate bancorp reported dec 7 for loan losses mostly at its 
texas subsidiary the bank has disclosed 
first interstate said sec staffers made an informal inquiry 
last month requesting and receiving documents from the bank 
holding company the nations 10th largest 
the 400 million writedown against fourthquarter profits 
followed a similar 350 million charge the bank took in the third 
quarter for losses at its arizona bank 
last week first interstate reported a fourthquarter loss of 
3443 million because of problems at the texas bank the former 
allied bancshares which first interstate acquired in early 1988 
first interstate revealed the sec inquiry in a filing related to 
its plan to issue 75 million new shares of stock to bolster its 
capital which was depleted by the writedown 
the wall street journal said the inquiry likely was aimed at 
exploring whether first interstate had violated disclosure laws by 
not reporting its texas problems more promptly 
the journal also reported that federal regulators have placed 
first interstates arizona unit under strict supervisory controls 
and that first interstate may need regulatory approval to continue 
paying its 75 cent quarterly dividend 
the banks filing also contained a warning that the big losses 
may not be over 
as a consequence of general economic conditions in the 
operating regions of the corporations subsidiary banks 
particularly the southwest united states however there can be no 
assurance that further substantial additions to the corporations 
allowance for loan losses will not be required the filing said 
first interstate is the nations 10th largest bank holding 
company with 58 billion in assets the bank has been trying to cut 
costs through layoffs and selling businesses outside of its core 
consumer and business banking divisions because of the arizona and 
texas losses 
the banks problems also led to an announcement last month that 
longtime chairman and chief executive joseph j pinola would be 
succeeded as operating head of the company by president edward 
carson on june 1 
in his 12 years as first interstates chief pinola pursued an 
agressive expansion policy that backfired in the southwestern 
banking losses

smithkline beecham thursday cut the price of 
its popular high blood pressure drug dyazide by 11 percent one day 
after its sole generic competitor removed its version of the drug 
from the market 
the pharmaceutical giant said the move was in response to a 
request by us rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house 
energy and commerce investigations subcommittee who feared some 
patients wouldnt be able to afford the brandname drug 
smithklines move effective saturday will lower the price from 
about 36 cents a capsule to an estimated 32 cents company 
spokesman jeremy heymsfeld said 
bolar pharmaceutical co incs generic version had cost about 
25 cents a capsule he said a typical patient takes one capsule a 
day 
bolar recalled their capsules wednesday following disclosures 
that the company allegedly gave false test data to the food and 
drug administration for its version of dyazide 
it is a welcome gesture in the direction of price equity 
dingell said in a statement responding to the price cut dingell 
had said wednesday that if smithkline did not cut the price the 
fda should consider requiring smithkline to reformulate the drug so 
it would be easier to copy 
frederick kyle president of smithkline beecham 
pharaceuticalus said the decision to cut the price took into 
consideration the needs of stockholders employees and patients 
we recognize that for some patients the unavailability of a 
generic version will represent an increase in their health care 
expenditures to help minimize the impact we are decreasing the 
price of dyazide kyle said 
in 1988 the first full year of generic competition for dyazide 
sales in this country were 153 million a 52 percent drop from 
1987 
the fda said patients taking bolars generic drug should 
continue taking the drug until their prescription runs out and 
arrange with their physicians to take another medication 
last spring vitarine pharmaceuticals of springfield gardens 
ny took its version of dyazide off the market after it admitted 
cheating on fda tests

concentration in california texas florida new york and 
pennsylvania mccaw said

percent interest in mccaw cellular

don simpson and jerry bruckheimer the 
producers of top gun and beverly hills cop signed an 
exclusive fiveyear deal with paramount pictures to make at least 
five films the studio announced 
the terms of the partnership were not disclosed but the 
arrangement is likely to make simpson and bruckheimer the most 
successful movie producers in hollywood in the 80s also the most 
highly compensated 
furthermore the pair will enjoy the independence to make any 
movie any way they want 
they paramount put up the money we put up the talent we 
meet at the theater simpson said wednesday

312 million 1986s top gun 351 million and 1987s 
beverly hills cop ii 281 million 
their only flop was 1984s thief of hearts the two have 
produced films for paramount for the last seven years 
the deal was struck after months of negotiations with paramount 
and other studios simpson and bruckheimer said they also
