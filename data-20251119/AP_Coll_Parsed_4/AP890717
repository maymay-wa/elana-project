the bush administration is willing to accept an 
increase in the wage ceiling on which the hospitalization part of 
social security taxes is levied a way to raise taxes with raising 
tax rates a congressional source said monday night 
the extra revenue would be aimed at easing but not completely 
eliminating the income surtax on elderly americans with high 
incomes that finances catastrophic health insurance coverage for 
medicare recipients 
in a closed session with the house ways and means committee 
administration tax experts said one option in a package of changes 
proposed by rep fortney h pete stark dcalif chairman of the 
committes health subcommittee would be generally acceptable 
according to this source who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified 
that option would increase the wage base on which the 29 percent 
payroll tax for medicare coverage is levied from 50700 to 60000 
in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 and make state and local 
government employees subject to the tax for the first time no 
medicare tax is paid on income earned over the ceiling 
the tax is split by employer and employee each paying half or 
145 percent 
someone making less than 50700 would see no increase in the 
medicare portion of the social security tax paid someone making 
60000 or more would pay 26970 a year more 
starks package included an alternative leave state and local 
government employees out and raise the ceiling to 90000 the 
administration does not favor this the source said 
the surtax 15 percent of the underlying tax liability has 
prompted many protests to congress especially from people who have 
arranged duplicating private insurance coverage it can range up to 
800 for about 5 percent of the 33 million people eligible for 
medicare 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee and a major architect of the catastrophic health insurance 
program that took effect in january 1988 had been backing a 
reduction in the surtax with no reduction in benefits on the 
grounds that it was too heavy and would build unneeded surpluses of 
2 billion to 4 billion in a few years in the trust fund for 
catastrophic coverage 
but on july 12 bentsen said new figures from the congressional 
budget office showed there would be no surpluses after all that set 
off informal discussions on capitol hill and with the administration 
on some other way to ease the surtax burden

a judicial review of the canadian aviation safety 
board investigation into the 1985 crash that killed 256 americans at 
gander newfoundland has found no need for more public inquiry a 
newspaper said tuesday 
sources at the safety board and department of transport said the 
review ordered in march by transport minister benoit bouchard 
generally exonerates the boards professional staff investigators 
the toronto globe and mail reported 
the investigators found that a thin layer of ice reduced the 
lifting capacity of the wings of the arrow air jet causing it to 
crash on takeoff on dec 12 1985 
the newspaper said the review was written by justice willard 
estey a former supreme court of canada judge and is due to be 
released friday 
it quoted sources as saying the report gives no credence to the 
bomb theory that has been widely promoted by four dissenting members 
of the ninemember board the newspaper says 
the dissenters had accused the boards investigators of 
withholding evidence they suggested a coverup by canadian and us 
agencies had sought to hide what they argued was a terrorist attack 
on the aging dc8 which was ferrying us troops home for christmas 
after a peacekeeping tour in the middle east 
the globe and mail quoted sources as saying estey rejected the 
dissenters allegations as being gossip and innuendo and that he 
concluded no useful purpose would be served by a public inquiry 
no evidence of a bomb has ever been presented although the 
dissenters say its absence demonstrates the wideranging nature of 
the coverup 
safety board chairman ken thorneycraft refused monday to discuss 
esteys review he said he was unaware of its findings but he added 
he had always been confident that any independent assessment of the 
agencys investigation would conclude it had been conducted 
thoroughly and had reached reasonable conclusions 
there are always some things that could have been done 
better thorneycraft said but it will be nice when it esteys 
report does come out 
critics of the icing finding most recently the us airline 
pilots association have accused the board of fabricating evidence 
in an effort to blame the pilots of the plane both pilots six 
other crew members and all 248 us servicemen on board the jet died 
in the dec 12 1985 crash the worst ever in canada 
the globe and mail also reported that les filotas one of the 
dissenters who wrote a minority report rejecting the icing finding 
tried to get in touch with estey during his review 
it said filotas sent a fivepage letter to estey in which he 
postulated that arrow air may have been involved in 
armsforhostages exchanges conducted secretly on behalf of highly 
placed individuals in the american administration and that if so 
there would have been strong motivation for attempts to confound 
aspects of the investigation 
the letter obtained through the access to information act 
suggests the unsubstantiated link could also have been a motive for 
targeting air arrow for a terrorist attack the paper said 
it said estey returned the letter dated april 2 unread to 
filotas 
estey due to return from vacation thursday is expected to be 
present at the news conference at which his report will be formally 
released

the federal government agreed monday to examine 
the results of the upcoming 1990 census and adjust them if necessary 
to correct a historical undercount of minorities and innercity 
residents 
under a settlement worked out over the past 10 days and announced 
in us district court the commerce department and the census 
bureau agreed to create an eightperson panel to review census 
methods and advise the secretary of commerce whether blacks and 
other minorities are accurately counted 
the agreement was reached in a lawsuit brought last november by 
new york city and joined by two states and several cities with large 
minority populations 
it has potentially farreaching implications and could influence 
how federal money is distributed as well as the boundaries of 
congressional districts which are determined by population 
this is a civilrights issue not a money issue said city 
corporation counsel peter l zimroth the money is secondary what 
we want is the most accurate count there are people in this country 
who are not brought into account they are losing representation 
under the arrangement accepted by us district judge joseph m 
mclaughlin the panel of statisticians and demographers will examine 
the results of the 1990 census and recommend to the commerce 
secretary whether the numbers need to be adjusted 
following the nationwide head count the census bureau will 
conduct a massive followup survey sampling 150000 households 
nationwide to determine whether the final tally should be adjusted 
in a suit joined by new york state california los angeles 
chicago houston dade county fla and several civilrights 
organizations new york city charged that the counting methods of 
the census bureau commonly undercounts blacks hispanics the 
homeless and illegal aliens 
zimroth said the agreement potentially means many millions of 
dollars for the city in federal funds lost because of the 
undercounting 
according to the city the 1980 census missed as many as 500000 
people or 6 percent of the citys population the city estimates it 
has lost as much as 52 million annually in federal funds beginning 
in 1980 
stephen hart a justice department lawyer said the 1990 census 
is going to be taken in the normal fashion and the commerce 
secretary will then hear the advisory panels recommendations and 
decide by july 15 1991 if adjustment is needed 
while 99 percent of everyone living in the country is counted as 
many as 7 percent of the nations blacks are overlooked said hart 
the census bureau was looking at methods to reduce the undercount 
caused by people not responding to questionnaires or not cooperating 
with neighborhood canvassers 
the problem is that the initial census is very flawed 
zimroth said 
speaking at a city hall news conference mayor edward i koch 
said the agreement was a great victory for the city and added 
the impact is money 
mondays agreement removed a motion by the city for a preliminary 
injunction that could have stopped the 1990 census however a 
motion for a permanent injunction that could prevent the census 
bureau from using the 1990 count should the federal government not 
abide to the terms of the agreement remained in place 
the agreement essentially reverses a position taken earlier by 
the commerce department parent agency of the census bureau 
census officials aware of criticism that they missed 1 percent 
to 2 percent of americans in 1980 and as many as 5 percent of 
minorities had been studying methods of making an adjustment in 
1990 including a postcensus survey to be used to evaluate the 
count itself 
the commerce department however announced last fall that no 
adjustment would be made in 1990 that agency cited concerns that no 
survey could be as accurate as the actual head count and said that 
it was worried that adjusting the figures would lead to even more 
lawsuits and jeopardize public confidence in the results of the 
count 
at that time barbara bailer who had been in charge of the census 
program studying the undercount resigned in protest of the 
decision bailer who now heads the american statistical 
association could not be reached for comment on the new agreement

the market for bicentennial trinkets is slack and 
the streets are clean again but france and its leaders are still 
basking in the glow of their wild bicentennial weekend 
until the final moment the plans to mark the french revolutions 
200th birthday brought waves of criticism 
the skeptics said paris would be a nightmare of gridlock a 
whacky parade friday night would be a disaster and the entire show 
constituted an attempt to glorify socialist president francois 
mitterrand 
on sunday mitterrand entoned royally what counts is the 
result 
parades and fireworks in the center of paris attracted the 
capitals biggest crowds since the city was liberated from the nazis 
more than a million parisians tens of millions of french 
people and hundreds of millions of television viewers in the entire 
world saw on this occasion an image of france particularly rich in 
symbols premier michel rocard said in a message to the chief of 
the countrys bicentennial mission historian jeannoel jeanneney 
also watching were more than 30 world leaders including 
president bush they came to paris for the annual summit of the 
worlds seven richest countries and to attend the bicentennial 
festivities 
mayor jacques chirac and other conservative leaders snubbed the 
parades but even rightist newspapers usually hostile to mitterrand 
saluted the commemorations in rapturous style 
the triumph of the revolution the conservative daily le 
figaro said in a banner headline in a frontpage editorial it 
described friday nights show as colossal superb and solemn with 
humor as well 
the parade along the champselysees a flight of imagination 
created by advertising specialist jeanpaul goude offered 
everything from african drummers to scottish pipers to the florida 
aampm marching band moonwalking in the style of singer michael jackson 
in a reminder of the price of freedom hundreds of chinese 
studying in the west marched to solemn music with headbands showing 
the chinese characters for the french revolutions watchwords 
liberty equality fraternity 
by sunday as festivities grew old the crowds on the 
champselysees also thinned and slowed down 
everybodys worn out said maguelone fallot who wasnt 
having much luck selling her bicentennial keepsakes on the famous 
avenue 
these things are expensive she said pointing to her 23 wig 
in the blue white and red of the french flag and a 15 
bicentennial tie 
the capitals street cleaners in their bright green suits were 
out early sunday morning to clean up the confetti and other trash 
the bicentennial ceremonies began thursday with dramatic readings 
from the declaration of the rights of man with the visiting 
presidents and prime ministers in attendance 
that evening the leaders joined mitterrand for an inaugural 
concert at the new opera bastille built where a revolutionary mob 
stormed the royal bastille prison on july 14 1789 
the attack is viewed as the beginning of the french revolution 
friday morning saw frances traditional military parade showing 
more might than ever this year with screeching fighter planes 
rumbling mobile missiles and ranks of military academy graduates 
saturdays fireworks were chiracs contribution a 45minute 
display with 170000 rockets 
however the most distinctive part of the weekend binge was 
goudes parade named the marseillaise after frances national 
anthem but offered as a salute to the tribes of the globe 
the gamble was without doubt a little crazy but it was won 
the daily le monde wrote in an editorial saturday it said the 
surprising and original parade did not give the idea to say 
the least of a chauvinistic and xenophobic france 
goudes afterparade commentary was simpler ill try to do 
better next time

ethnic turks fleeing bulgaria are daily 
arriving by the thousands and though offers of housing jobs and 
marriage await the immigrants authorities fear a prolonged exodus 
may prove overwhelming 
since may when bulgaria first started deporting ethnic turks and 
then gave passports to others who wanted to leave 135000 have 
crossed into turkey according to officials in this border city 
so far a wave of ethnic solidarity has allwed turkey to smoothly 
absorb the influx 
the 1millionstrong turkish minority in bulgarian has been 
subjected to a government assimilation campaign that forces them to 
adopt slavic names bans the use of turkish in public and restricts 
their moslem religious rites 
each day about 3500 people pour in and within a few days most 
leave for jobs and new homes or move in with relatives who emigrated 
several decades ago said the provincial governor unal erkan 
a refugee camp of white conical tents set up on a treeless plot 
next to the railroad station has become a way station there 
representatives of employers from around the country meet with 
immigrants seeking work 
hayrettin aydin came from the black sea port city of giresun to 
hire 10 workers for his mining company we saw these people 
arriving with their few belongings on the tv news we were moved we 
wanted to help he said 
he struck a deal with two young men in their 20s one of them 
ercan kurtulus said as long as we have a job and a place to stay 
we dont care what or where there is no going back to bulgaria 
companies offering jobs to the immigrants say most of them are 
skilled workers and that ethnic turks who settled here before 
established a reputation for hard work 
turkey with a population of 55 million has a 16 percent 
unemployment rate but in most areas there is a shortage of skilled 
workers welders fork lift operators and electricians are in demand 
but there is a dark side to the hiring story some companies have 
fired native workers to replace them with labor from bulgaria 
thinking they can get them cheaper union leaders say the 
government has pledged to stop the practice by fining the companies 
involved 
this is a very sensitive matter said necdet kilic a leader 
of the bulgarian immigrant community we dont want resentments 
and bad blood between the people here and the immigrants 
aid to the refugees comes in many forms on a bulletin board at 
the edirne camp there are letters offering to marry widowed or 
single women among the immigrants one recent offer came from hasan 
camci 75 who was looking for a suitable mate 
at one corner of the camp next to the water fountains a local 
barber gives free haircuts to new arrivals boys get free 
circumcision an islamic practice banned by the bulgarians 
turkeys workers in europe home for the feast of sacrifice one 
of islams two major holidays have contributed the equivalent of 
187000 officials said 
some people bring a crate of tomatoes others a few freshly 
baked pies said gov erkan 
some 400 trucks transport immigrants and their belongings from 
the border to other parts of the country taking advantage of the 
summer season local authorities have thrown open boarding schools 
and university dormitories to arrivals as temporary shelter 
but ethnic turks who immigrated earlier and settled mainly in 
western parts of the country play the biggest part in the aid effort 
in the low income sefakoy district of istanbul where earlier 
arrivals from bulgaria number 9000 out of a total population of 
17000 some families have taken in as many as 40 immigrants 
zulkar ozturk a 50yearold retired bus driver has 14 guests in 
his threeroom apartment his retirement salary equivalent to 110 
monthly barely buys enough bread and potatoes for the group 
the exodus is expected to continue until bulgaria closes the 
border to protect its economy from labor shortages 
turkey is demanding that bulgaria agree to talks for an 
immigration agreement that would allow ethnic turks to dispose of 
their property and get compensation for benefits such as accumulated 
social security so far turkey says there has been no positive 
response from sofia 
turkish officials believe the exodus will keep up until bulgaria 
closes the border to protect its economy from labor shortages 
the moment the harm they are causing us is less than the harm 
they are causing themselves economically the border will be 
closed said a foreign ministry official on condition of anonymity 
western diplomats and journalists say many towns and villages 
where ethnic turks have lived are nearly empty and fields remain 
unharvested earlier this month bulgaria issued a decree empowering 
authorities to conscript civilians to work in emergencies 
threatening the economy

randall dale adams refuses to let bitterness 
spoil his enjoyment of freedom even though he served 12 years in 
prison and came within three days of being executed for a murder he 
didnt commit 
i hate what happened said adams 40 freed in march from a 
texas prison after an appeals court set aside his conviction but 
each day is like being granted another day to walk upon the earth 
and bring peace to my family 
if i did hold feelings of bitterness or revenge i will ruin 
whatever future i do have if you come within three days of being 
executed you better know who you are and you better throw your 
animosities out the window 
adams was convicted in the 1976 shooting death of a dallas police 
officer the case was documented in the film the thin blue line 
which questioned the testimony of prosecution witnesses including 
david ray harris who is on death row in texas for another killing 
in the film harris virtually confessed to the 1976 shooting 
adams bears no hatred toward harris saying i wish him no 
harm but i wish him no luck in life 
after the movie was released a state appeals court overturned 
the conviction and texas authorities dropped the murder charge 
instead of retrying adams who moved to columbus ohio 
the film proves beyond a shadow of a doubt i did not receive a 
fair trial he said its like watching a bad dream or the last 
chapter of the twilight zone 
in his 3 months of freedom adams has lectured and appeared on 
television shows such as 60 minutes donahue and 
geraldo he is planning a speaking tour on college campuses this 
fall while he mulls job offers 
this is a case and a story that must be held before the public 
i want to live my life one day at a time and take the hurt out of my 
familys eyes as much as possible adams said in new york on 
thursday the same day he addressed a cincinnati seminar on the 
death penalty 
despite his experience adams favors capital punishment although 
he thinks lethal injection is more humane than the electric chair he 
faced i would not want to look like yesterdays bacon he said 
any future books or movies hinge on the outcome of a lawsuit he 
filed in june against errol morris the producer of the the thin 
blue line 
while he was in prison and the movie was being made adams 
accepted a nominal fee of 10 and would have received payments 
morris said would have been in the neighborhood of six figures 
if a tv movie or book were forthcoming 
adams suit which he called an injunction asked the courts to 
declare that he owns his story his attorney randy schaeffer said 
a settlement has been reached but the papers have not been signed 
im perfectly happy to discharge him from the agreement and 
give him the rights back if thats what he wishes morris said 
from his cambridge mass home to say that the rights to his 
life story were purchased lock stock and barrel for 10 is not 
true i didnt become involved in this movie to make money i wanted 
to right a terrible injustice in the courts 
morris said no one was paid to appear in the 1 million movie he 
has appeared at a benefit for adams in ohio and has donated the 
film for screenings he still has 100000 in debt from the film 
they talk about it like its batman or ghostbusters ii i 
think its unfortunate this happened morris said of the lawsuit 
for his part adams said he didnt want to appear ungrateful for 
morris part in freeing him from prison but he wanted a legal 
declaration so there would be no dispute about who owns the story 
rights 
it got blown out of proportion just let my family have the 
right to say yea or nay on any future project im not suing errol 
morris 
i still consider him a friend and a basic part of my family i 
am not asking for any money or royalties i am asking him to stand 
still until we have this issue settled

the worlds seven industrial giants agree on broad 
plans to clean up the global environment fight drug trafficking and 
ease the debt burden of poor nations but they are leaving it to 
others to fill in the details 
president bush and the other leaders sunday ended their twoday 
summit earlier than expected and congratulated themselves on how 
well they had worked together 
the summit in my view was a clear success bush told 
reporters at a news conference on the manicured grounds of the us 
ambassadors residence in paris 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney attending his fifth 
conference said it was the one that achieved the largest degree 
of consensus 
it was a splendid summit gushed firsttime participant 
sousuke uno japans embattled prime minister 
and britains prime minister margaret thatcher dismissed 
reports she had been snubbed by the french whose birthday bash for 
the 200th anniversary of their revolution coincided with the summit 
indeed i have received every attention she insisted 
the leaders talks held annually since 1975 to examine the 
economies health were nearly overshadowed by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev who sent a surprise letter urging more 
eastwest cooperation on economic issues 
bush said the letter addressed to french president francois

attorney general dick thornburgh is headed 
toward a confrontation with congress over lawmakers insistence that 
they can disapprove plans to reorganize justice department offices 
the dispute was sparked by the fbis decision this spring to 
downgrade its butte mont field office despite lawmakers 
objections congress then banned any further reorganizations in the 
department before sept 30 
the disagreement reflects traditional efforts by lawmakers to 
preserve federal facilities in their jurisdictions as well as 
concern in the executive branch over what thornburgh regards as a 
serious separationofpowers issue 
the justice department is refusing to promise lawmakers it will 
abide by their objections to reorganization plans that in turn is 
drawing threats by congress to extend the prohibition into the next 
fiscal year 
such a move could further delay thornburghs plan to merge 14 
organized crime strike forces into local us attorneys offices an 
idea that is opposed by a number of lawmakers 
justice department spokesman david runkel said thursday the house 
and senate appropriations subcommittees insistence on the power to 
disapprove reorganization runs afoul of a 1983 supreme court ruling 
that onehouse congressional vetoes were unconstitutional 
it is our intention to work things out with the congress and 
not have things come to a stalemate runkel said but there are 
certain prerogatives of the executive branch there is concern that 
if we are not diligent enough these prerogatives will be eroded 
rep neal smith an iowa democrat who chairs the house 
appropriations subcommittee that oversees justice department 
spending said congress will tie thornburghs hands unless he heeds 
lawmakers objections to reorganization plans 
there isnt anything to work out smith said either they 
are going to follow the custom or we will write in language when we 
pass appropriation legislation that they cant do anything 
under an informal procedure worked out after the 1983 supreme 
court decision administrative agencies give congressional 
committees 15 days notice of any reorganization plans 
smith said his subcommittee only rarely disapproves of such 
plans but government agencies have by and large abided by those 
legislative decisions 
but recently congress has objected to fbi plans to downgrade the 
butte mont field office to a satellite office and merge the 
savannah ga field office with the agencys atlanta field office 
the fbi says it will save 12 million over five years by 
transferring many of the 50 employees stationed in butte to salt 
lake city 
the senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees the justice 
department disapproved the plan to close the butte field office 
after objections were raised by montanas two senators democrat max 
baucus and republican conrad burns 
but the fbi went ahead with its plans in butte 
not only were lawmakers enraged by the breach of a custom but 
some legislative feathers were ruffled when first word of the 
decision was received by a republican member of the subcommittee 
sen warren rudman of new hampshire instead of its chairman sen 
ernest hollings dsc said congressional staffers who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
congress then voted the ban on further reorganization this year 
thornburgh in a recent speech to the american bar association 
accused congress of attempting micro management of executive 
departments 
he said the temporary reorganization ban illustrates at its 
worst the kind of difficulty that occurs from such attempts he 
said 
meanwhile opponents of thornburghs plan to close 14 organized 
crime strike forces are eyeing the dispute as a possible opportunity 
to tie the attorney generals hand according to one congressional 
source 
opponents contend that closing the strike forces will make the 
justice department less effective in fighting organized crime 
if they are going to play hard ball says one congressional 
staffer we have the final way we can play harder ball

the president of the american cancer society 
today called for a guerrilla war to extend cancer therapies to 
the poor and minorities who have the highest death rates in the 
country from the disease 
though survival rates for many cancers have increased 
dramatically the poor and minorities are not reaping the benefits 
because they are too poor to get early and adequate cancer 
treatment said harold p freeman cancer society president 
for these americans a diagnosis of cancer is most often a 
needless death sentence freeman said in introducing a report 
based on hearings the society held along with the national cancer 
institute and the centers for disease control in may and june 
the cancer society says that in general half of cancer patients 
are expected to survive their disease however americans living 
below the poverty line have a cancer survival rate 10 to 15 percent 
below that for other americans freeman said 
the society estimates that 178000 people with cancer who might 
be saved through early diagnosis and treatment will die this year 
the regional hearings found that poor americans are forced to 
accept substandard health care services and make extraordinary 
sacrifices to obtain and pay for the care the report said 
based on the findings of this report we need to declare a new 
kind of war on cancer a guerrilla war that will tear down the 
economic and cultural barriers to early and adequate cancer 
prevention diagnosis and treatment and dramatically increase 
cancer survival rates for all americans freeman said 
the society distributed its report to president bush 
congressional leaders and health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan 
the cancer society also said it is committing 28 million for 
national demonstration programs in harlem miami and oakland 
calif to develop cancer education and detection programs for the 
poor the funds also will be used to support local education and 
research activities targeted to the poor nationwide 
poor people endure greater pain and suffering from cancer than 
other americans the report said 
because they lack access to quality health care their cancer is 
more likely to be diagnosed in advanced stages when treatment 
options are more limited and survival rates are lowest it said 
the poor also are less aware of the warning signs of cancer and 
the medical system discourages preventive health care which means 
patients often wait until their health problems are unbearable 
before they seek treatment the report said 
for the 37 million people who have no health insurance and do not 
qualify for medicaid the emergency room becomes their entry to the 
health care system they are often referred to hospital outpatient 
clinics oriented more to teaching than to caring for patients the 
report said 
fewer than 45 percent of those living below the federal poverty 
level are eligible for medicaid the report said patients are often 
driven into poverty to get treatment for their disease but for many 
poor and nearpoor people a stigma against public assistance 
prevents them from applying for benefits it said 
the poor are also dumped in public hospitals that serve the 
medically indigent and seldom have any continuity of care a major 
problem with cancer since the disease often requires longterm 
treatment the report said

a lucrative consulting business as a registered 
foreign agent helped fuel the lavish lifestyle of craig j spence 
the flamboyant lobbyist now under investigation in washingtons male 
prostitution scandal 
justice department records show that spence a former television 
reporter with political connections in the orient was paid 
thousands of dollars by japanese business and political interests in 
the 1980s to open the right doors in washington for his clients 
spence 48 has been linked by the washington times to a 
homosexual prostitution ring that is under investigation by us 
attorney jay stephens and the secret service 
the times citing credit card records reported that spence spent 
as much as 20000 a month on male escort services run by the ring 
which was raided by police in february it also quoted unidentified 
male prostitutes and others as saying spence had his house bugged 
while spence has been unavailable for comment on the allegations 
repeated calls to his home have gone unanswered justice 
department records reveal that he earned fat fees from the japanese 
for arranging seminars and hosting luncheons and dinners 
during the early years of the reagan administration in 
particular spence cultivated top political appointees leading 
academics military officials journalists and members of congress 
often entertaining them at the expense of the japanese 
spences major client was the policy study group a nonprofit 
research and information group based in tokyo and headed by motoo 
shiina a leading member of the ruling liberal democratic party 
the study group financed by japanese business interests and 
affiliated with the party agreed in july 1979 to pay spence roughly 
8000 a month for an unlimited period plus travel and other 
business expenses 
in a sixmonth period in 1982 for instance spence received 
48000 from the group 
in exchange spence agreed to conduct research projects on 
political economic issues and arrange meetings and seminars to 
discuss issues as requested by the foreign principal 
from all accounts spence did his job for his handsome salary 
hosting lavish parties and arranging seminars on serious topics such 
as trade and economics 
spences seminars at local universities frequently featured 
wellknown speakers james lilley now the us ambassador to china 
delivered two speeches in 1980 one entitled problems of offshore 
china oil 
others attending spences seminars included sen john glenn 
dohio gaston sigur a former assistant secretary of state dimitri 
simes a respected academic and soviet expert philip geyelin 
former editorial page editor of the washington post and now a 
columnist for the newspaper and victor kamber a political 
consultant 
spence also arranged trips to japan for a number of wellknown 
people including television correspondent eric sevareid who spoke 
on the mood in america former ambassador robert neumann and 
karl inderfurth former deputy staff director of the senate foreign 
relations committee and now an abc television correspondent in 
moscow spence himself had worked for abc in the 1960s before 
developing his consulting business 
not everyone was keen on spences association with the japanese 
although many believed they might benefit from having him provide an 
entree into japanese business and political circles former us 
attorney joseph digenova for example went to japan with spence in 
hopes of attracting business as a private attorney in tokyo 
but veteran journalist sarah mcclendon who was paid 400 by 
spence to write a profile of an administration official said she 
was upset in january 1982 when she learned spence had listed her on 
his foreign agents form 
she said in a letter to the standing committee of correspondents 
in the senate that she decided not to write more profiles after 
learning one she had completed had been forwarded to tokyo 
that was not the end of spences association with the japanese 
in 1986 spence provided services to the japan external trade 
organization he was paid 2000 in may 1986 for drafting and 
editing a speech documents show 
but that relationship ended and by july 1987 spence was no 
longer a registered foreign agent

paul adams says he has james watt to thank or 
blame for the spotlight the lowkey inspector general at the 
department of housing and urban development finds himself under 
these days 
news is driven by personalities adams said last week i 
think absent jim watt this thing would have been quickly forgotten 
hes such a controversial individual a lightning rod 
adams finds himself ensnarled in controversy as the problems at 
the multibilliondollar agency during the reagan administration come 
under scrutiny by congress the justice department and new hud 
secretary jack kemp 
adams and his investigators and auditors reported several years 
ago on many of the abuses now under investigation some of those 
doing the investigating particularly members of congress say adams 
should have done more to bring attention to the problems 
he dismisses such criticism and implicitly blames members of 
congress for ignoring his semiannual reports to the house and 
senate which summarized the findings of the major audits 
in hindsight people can say you should have been screaming and 
beating on the table adams said in an interview we dont have 
crystal balls were not solomons in this process i have to 
develop the facts and present them and let other people make the 
decisions thats how the process was designed to work 
it took a voluminous report on a rehabilitation program 
administered by hud to get the work of adams and his staff noticed 
the april report said inflated rents were costing hud millions of 
dollars and that former department officials and influential 
republicans like former interior secretary watt were able to win 
much of the funding for projects 
since then virtually all of the departments major programs have 
come under scrutiny and many have been found to have been 
mismanaged defrauded or seemingly affected by influencepeddling 
adams has been a busy man appearing before congress meeting 
with kemps staff to suggest reforms and dealing with a deluge of 
media requests for his time and reports 
suddenly the scores of reports compiled in his four years as the 
agencys inspector general are being taken seriously 
i think what is occurring today is bearing out our position 
he said when asked whether the attention had brought him any 
satisfaction im not sure i would refer to it as a personal 
satisfaction but i think there is certainly an organizational 
satisfaction and a recognition of the hard work the staff has done 
he credits kemp for revived morale at hud which suffered funding 
and staff cuts in the reagan years 
and he blames the laissezfaire style of former secretary samuel 
pierce for poor agency management and accounting that allowed the 
abuses and is likely to cost the government 2 billion or more 
one fear adams has about the current focus on hud is that the 
role of influencepeddling will obscure what he believes is the 
greater issue the money thats out there 
in the audit of the moderate rehabilitation program auditors 
found hud was in many cases paying developers too much in rent 
subsidies 
the subsidies should be adjusted because over the life of those 
subsidies the 15year life is about a halfbillion dollars in 
overpayments he said 
at 51 adams already has 33 years as a government worker under 
his belt he had planned to retire at the end of last year but 
decided to stay on to complete the audit of the rehabilitation 
program he now plans to ride out the current controversy for a 
while and retire at the end of this year

a major new reference by the agriculture 
department shows that the soviet union has about 15 billion acres 
of agricultural land spread among huge farms that dwarf most 
american enterprises 
for example the average size of stateowned farms in the soviet 
union is almost 40000 acres collective farms operated 
cooperatively by families average nearly 16000 acres each 
in all the soviet union in 1985 the most recent figures 
tabulated had 22690 state farms and 26660 collectives no 
figures were available for private plots 
according to usda estimates for last year the united states had 
999 million acres in about 216 million farms virtually all 
privately owned and operated as family enterprises those averaged 
463 acres each 
the new booklet published by the departments economic research 
service is the first revision of statistics for eastern europe and 
the soviet union since 1983 said nancy j cochrane who coordinated 
the project 
new tables have been added on farm structure for selected 
countries and these reflect some of the recent wave of reforms in 
the soviet union and eastern europe 
no comparisons are made between those countries and the united 
states however and many of the units are in the metric system for 
example hectares are used for land area with one hectare equal to 
247 acres production is in metric tons of 2205 pounds each and 
per capita consumption in kilograms of about 22 pounds each 
besides the soviet union seven eastern european countries are 
included bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany hungary poland 
romania and yugoslavia albania was omitted 
official statistical sources of the countries were used as the 
primary source of information along with some supplemental sources 
however cochrane noted that data on albania were too scarce to 
include 
the 129page booklet shows some of the many changes and 
differences that have occurred in agriculture in the soviet bloc 
since 1965 
in the past it was a common practice for all the countries 
except yugoslavia to distinguish between two types of socialized 
farms state and collective or cooperative 
this system has been changing in many of the countries since 
the early 1970s cochrane said in the booklets introduction 
bulgaria has abolished the system altogether in favor of 
agroindustrial complexes 
she added some of the distinctions between state and 
cooperative farms have been blurred in all the countries wages for 
example are increasingly linked to productivity even on the state 
farms 
in addition to the socialized agriculture each country permits a 
certain amount of private farming except for yugoslavia and poland 
it involves mostly small plots usually half a hectare about 125 
acres allotted to collective farm members state farm employees 
and certain other individuals 
the private plots make up 27 percent of the arable land in the 
soviet union as much as 13 percent in bulgaria and hungary and 14 
percent in romania 
despite its small share of the arable land the private sector 
in these countries can contribute as much as 25 percent to 35 
percent of gross agricultural output cochrane said plotholders 
tend to specialize in laborintensive lines of production such as 
livestock products and fruits and vegetables 
agriculture in yugoslavia and poland is dominated by small 
privately owned farms in 1985 those accounted for 77 percent of 
the arable land in poland and 80 percent in yugoslavia and their 
shares of gross farm output were 78 percent and 69 percent 
respectively 
private farms in both countries are very small averaging less 
than 5 hectares or about 12 acres in poland and only 25 
hectares or a little more than six acres in yugoslavia 
the booklet agricultural statistics of eastern europe and the 
soviet union 196585 sb778 is available for 8 per copy from

the transportation department and a 
congressional committee are looking into the increasing sales of 
us airlines stock to foreign carriers 
foreign airlines already have gained minority interests in 
america west hawaiian continental and delta airlines and klm 
royal dutch airlines has a 400 million share in the planned 
takeover of northwest airlines by a california investor 
its a phenomenon thats coming on like a train sen john 
mccain rariz said friday at a senate commerce science and 
transportation committee hearing prompted by the northwest takeover 
bid the committee is considering a bill by mccain and committee 
chairman wendell ford dky to require transportation department 
approval for all airline acquisitions 
the proposed takeover of northwests parent company nwa inc by 
wings holdings inc headed by los angeles businessman alfred 
checchi would be the first leveraged buyout in the airline 
industry other investors including the dutch airlines are 
involved in the deal with checchi 
ford said the trend of investors looking to take over healthy 
airlines is very disturbing he said it could lead to newly 
acquired major carriers selling international routes delaying 
purchase of new aircraft cutting corners on safety or forcing wage 
reductions to meet the demands of new owners 
he said foreign investments in airlines are developing without 
any formal government policy review 
jeffrey n shane assistant transportation secretary said the 
department already has sufficient power to head off undesirable 
takeovers with its fitness review process a takeover that 
doesnt pass likely wont take place shane said because investors 
will back out 
but shane acknowledged growing concern in the department about 
foreign investments in us airlines the department last week sent 
a letter to checchi asking several questions about the degree of 
foreign involvement in his plans to take over northwest 
the law limits foreign ownership of airlines to 25 percent and 
does not allow more than onethird of the board membership to be 
foreigners 
but shane said control not share of ownership is the critical 
issue 
ansett airlines of australia has a 20 percent interest in america 
west a subsidiary of japan air lines owns 20 percent of hawaiian 
airlines scandinavian airlines system controls 9 percent of 
continental and swissair recently acquired 5 percent of delta 
shane said 
theres nothing inherently wrong with these acquisitions 
shane said but the worry is when foreign airlines exercise more 
control than us airlines 
shane said the proposed klm investment in northwest has the 
potential of giving the dutch carrier which is partly government 
owned a strong say in northwest affairs since it will hold 68 
percent of the equity in the airline 
even though klms voting stock would only amount to 5 percent and 
it would have only one member on the northwest board can we say 
it wont be in control shane asked 
he said foreign airlines could use their interest in us 
carriers to gain a foothold in us markets

a governors race and a handful of legislative 
sessions this fall are expected to give an early preview of the 
statelevel warfare predicted next year in the wake of the supreme 
courts abortion decision 
the high courts ruling this month handing states greater 
authority to restrict abortions has thrust the emotionally charged 
issue into the new jersey statehouse race and promises to make it a 
major factor in many of the 36 governor slots at stake next year 
the ruling also has galvanized antiabortion lawmakers across the 
country with the earliest battles expected in pennsylvania 
illinois florida and several other states with legislatures 
scheduled to meet this fall 
burke balch state legislative coordinator for the national right 
to life committee said a wide range of proposals to restrict 
abortion will come before legislatures starting in september 
what weve seen here is an unshackling of the state 
legislatures he said but the assumption that youre 
suddenly going to see all sorts of states automatically enacting 
protective legislation is an oversimplification of the challenges we 
face there are not a lot of states that are locked up for either 
side 
the national abortion rights action league will try to stave off 
antiabortion offensives this year at the state level and will plan 
a more aggressive strategy for 1990 said nancy broff the groups 
political and legislative director 
in new jersey naral plans to make abortion a central factor in 
the gubernatorial race between reps james florio and jim courter 
florio a democrat has said he would veto websterlike restrictions 
while courter an antiabortion republican has backed off and said 
he would not lobby the legislature for restrictions 
new jersey is among five states also including california 
connecticut massachusetts and vermont where state supreme courts 
have ruled that abortion rights are guaranteed by the state 
constitution and in florida a doctorlegislator who performs 
abortions has suggested amending that states constitutional privacy 
clause to add reproductive rights 
but for the most part the ball is in the antiabortion court 
lawmakers in pennsylvania plan to have a series of bills ready when 
the legislature returns sept 18 from its summer recess 
rep stephen freind who has led abortion fights in the state for 
a decade said he intends to introduce measures to outlaw 
sexselection abortions fetal tissue experimentation and fetal 
transplants also he wants to require spousal notification require 
waiting periods except in medical emergencies and require extensive 
informed consent that includes a description of fetal development 
other states are considering similar restrictions balch said 
some of the proposals have been struck down previously by the 
supreme court or vetoed on grounds of earlier high court rulings 
but freind said a lot of things will be coming back now that 
was the old court and this is the new court the court is saying you 
can regulate abortion and restrict it and in some cases outlaw it 
as long as there is a rational basis for doing it 
the 1989 legislative outlook in other key states 
florida gov bob martinez says he will call a special session 
this fall to deal with abortion however this does not guarantee a 
change in law because the legislature is considered about evenly 
split 
illinois the legislature returns in october to reconsider bills 
vetoed by the governor antiabortion lawmakers are planning an 
offensive 
minnesota the legislature returns in september for a special 
session that gov rudy perpich wants to limit to a property tax 
proposal committee leaders could thwart efforts by antiabortion 
forces who are in the majority 
louisiana the state house overwhelmingly approved a resolution 
asking prosecutors to enforce antiabortion laws passed before the 
supreme courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion the new orleans 
district attorney asked a federal judge to reinstate a law that 
makes abortions illegal 
texas gov bill clements says if there is a special session 
before the legislature returns in january 1991 he would consider 
adding abortion to the agenda the body is in special session now 
but is expected to leave this week without taking up abortion

maine lobstermen are laying three times as 
much bait and scientists have even tried raising lobster larvae in 
test tanks but the harvest of the tasty crustaceans hasnt 
increased in 20 years 
marine biologists from the university of maine and bigelow 
laboratory in west boothbay are conducting a 10day research cruise 
next month and hope their detailed probe of breeding grounds will 
help explain the inability of lobstermen to increase the annual 
catch 
the lobstermen some of whom have volunteered to assist 
biologists as they map the ocean floor are hoping the investigation 
will lead to bigger catches 
lobster production is vital to maines economy not least because 
of its contribution to tourism 
we want to make sure that resource is around a thousand years 
from now its so much a part of our income our history and our 
art its just incredibly important to us said dave dow director 
of the lobster institute a trade organization affiliated with the 
university of maine 
the harvest of the bugs as they are affectionately called by 
lobstermen has remained at about 21 million pounds per year during 
the past two decades despite legal scientific and practical 
measures to increase it 
biologists at the cutler marine hatchery have coaxed thousands of 
lobster eggs to grow at a quickened rate in warmwater tanks and 
then stocked coastal waters with the immature larvae 
state legislators have gradually increased the minimum size 
limit hoping more females would mature and reproduce 
and lobstermen have worked harder they haul about triple the 
number of traps they put out 20 years ago but the lobsters have 
refused to take the extra bait according to the lobster institute 
in next months cruise five scientists aboard the research 
vessel argo maine will survey four major lobstering sites in the 
gulf of maine 
they will use sonar to determine the sea bottoms 
characteristics search for and count larval lobsters scuba dive to 
survey lobster densities shelter sizes and abundance of predators 
and sample ocean bottom sediment for invertebrates 
the investigation could affect where lobstermen set their traps 
as well as plans to stock coastal waters said dave cousins a 
lobsterman from south thomaston 75 miles northeast of portland 
university of maine marine biologist robert steneck one of the 
project leaders has sought for eight years to explain the static 
harvest 
his theory operates on the premise that something in nature 
limits our productivity out there dow said 
the limiting factor could be the amount of suitable habitat the 
lobsters can live in the amount of food available for the 
creatures or the ecological balance of lobsters and their 
predators dow said 
the lobsters go through three planktonic or swimming stages 
before they are ready to settle on the sea bottom and the suitable 
bottom habitat is distributed in patches along the shoreline 
if mother nature because of the way she works the tides and 
currents doesnt allow delivery to the appropriate habitats thats 
going to be important for the overall production dow said 
the publics appetite for lobster is matched by the appetites of 
various marine creatures he said 
theres a million lobsterseeking missiles waiting for those 
little fellows to hit the bottom these little fellows are 
subject to thousands of attacks a day 
large codfish have been found to contain up to a dozen lobsters 
when they are cut open dow said

two cubanborn women lead the crowded field of 
candidates to succeed the late us rep claude pepper in an 
election that is revealing how the district has changed since pepper 
began representing it in 1962 
the republican party enjoying an unprecedented 108 majority in 
floridas congressional delegation wants to make it 118 by winning 
the aug 29 special election democrats believe a victory could 
start a comeback and boost their chances of unseating republican 
gov bob martinez in 1990 
pepper was an oldstyle liberal who won 14 terms in the house 
district by emphasizing social programs benefitting the elderly for 
many years the dominant group in his electorate 
while the district still includes many older people half the 
residents now are hispanics mostly refugees from castros cuba and

here are excerpts from the communique issued sunday 
by the seven leaders of the richest democracies at the end of the 
15th economic summit 
these summits have permitted effective consultations offered 
the opportunity to launch initiatives and to strengthen 
international cooperation 
growth has been sustained by focusing policies on improving the 
efficiency and flexibility of our economies and by strengthening our 
cooperative efforts and the coordination process in the medium 
term the current buoyant investment seen during this period should 
pave the way for an increased supply of goods and services and help 
reduce the dangers of inflation the outlook is not however 
without risks 
until now the threat of inflation in many countries has been 
contained thanks to the concerted efforts of governments and 
monetary authorities but continued vigilance is required and 
inflation where it has increased will continue to receive a firm 
policy response so that it will be put on a downward path 
all our countries share the responsibility for the sound 
development of the world economy over the medium term deficit 
countries have to play a key role in global adjustment through their 
external adjustment and increased exports surplus countries have to 
contribute to sustaining global expansion trough policies providing 
favorable conditions for growth of domestic demand and imports 
it is important to continue and where appropriate to develop 
this cooperative and flexible approach to improve the functioning 
and the stability of the international monetary system in a manner 
consistent with economic fundamentals 
the decline of saving in some of our countries in this decade 
is a cause of concern we recommend policies to encourage 
saving and remove hindrances where they exist 
world trade developed rapidly last year yet protectionism 
remains a real threat we strongly reaffirm our determination to 
fight it in all its forms 
we shall help developing countries by opening the world trading 
system and by supporting their structural adjustment 
we urge developing countries to implement sound economic 
policies a vital factor will be the adoption of financial and 
fiscal policies which attract inward investment and encourage growth 
and the return of flight capital 
we urge banks to take realistic and constructive approaches in 
their negotiations with the debtor countries and to move promptly to 
conclude agreements on financial packages including debt reduction 
debt service reduction and new money we stress that official 
creditors should not substitute for private lenders our governments 
are prepared to consider as appropriate tax regulatory and 
accounting practices with a view to eliminating unnecessary 
obstacles to debt and debt service reductions 
decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect 
the earths ecological balance we will work together to achieve the 
common goals of preserving a healthy and balanced global environment 
in order to meet shared economic and social objectives and to carry 
out obligations to future generations 
environmental protection is integral to issues such as trade 
development energy transport agriculture and economic planning 
therefore environmental considerations must be taken into account 
into economic decisionmaking 
we encourage the world bank and regional development banks to 
integrate environmental considerations into their activities 
international organizations such as the oecd and the united nations 
and its affiliated organizations will be asked to develop further 
techniques of analysis which would help governments assess 
appropriate economic measures to promote the quality of the 
environment 
the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is alarming and 
calls for prompt action 
we are committed to maintaining the highest safety standards 
for nuclear power plants and to strengthening international 
cooperation in safe operation of power plants and waste management 
and we recognize that nuclear power also plays an important role in 
limiting output of greenhouse gases 
deforestation also damages the atmosphere and must be reversed 
preserving the tropical forests is an urgent need for the world 
as a whole while recognizing the sovereign rights of developing 
countries to make use of their natural resources we encourage 
through a sustainable use of tropical forests the protection of all 
the species therein and the traditional rights to land and other 
resources of local communities 
temperate forests lakes and rivers must be protected against 
the effects of acid pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen 
oxides it is necessary to pursue actively the bilateral and 
multilateral efforts to this end 
we condemn indiscriminate use of oceans as dumping grounds for 
polluting waste 
we express our concern that national regional and global 
capabilities to contain and alleviate the consequences of maritime 
oil spills be improved we urge all countries to make better use of 
the latest monitoring and cleanup technologies 
the drug problem has reached devastating proportions we stress 
the urgent need for decisive action both on a national and an 
international basis we urge all countries especially those where 
drug production trading and consumption are large to join our 
efforts to counter drug production to reduce demand and to carry 
forward the fight against drug trafficking itself and the laundering 
of its proceeds 
accordingly we resolve to take the following measures within 
relevant fora 
give greater emphasis on bilateral and united nations programs 
for the conversion of illicit cultivation in the producer countries 
support the efforts of producing countries who ask for 
assistance to counter illegal production or trafficking 
strengthen the role of the united nations in the war against 
drugs through an increase in its resources and through reinforced 
effectiveness of its operation 
intensify the exchange of information on the prevention of 
addiction and rehabilitation of drug addicts 
support the international conference planned for l990 on cocaine 
and drug demand reduction 
strengthen the efficiency of the cooperative and mutual 
assistance on these issues 
convene a financial action task force from summit participants 
and other countries interested in these problems 
we have accepted the invitation of the president of the united 
states to meet next year in the united states of america

twenty years after the first moon 
walk the apollo 11 crew called for further exploration of the lunar 
surface and mars but another astronaut said a bold new program is 
unlikely soon 
neil armstrong buzz aldrin and mike collins at a ceremony 
sunday commemorating the anniversary of their spectacular liftoff on 
july 16 1969 expressed their hopes for a rejuvenated space program 
on thursday the anniversary of the landing they will join with 
president bush for a celebration outside the national air and space 
museum in washington dc 
there bush will deliver a speech on space policy some are 
pressing him to announce a return to the moon while others are 
pushing for an exploration to mars many scientists are suggesting a 
joint ussoviet exploration for either option 
bush said in paris on sunday he was weighing different ideas 
at cape canaveral armstrong told 6000 flagwaving space 
workers and their families sunday that they should allow ourselves 
just a touch of pride a touch of satisfaction that we were 
participants and witnesses to the birth of a new human era 
he said historians in future centuries will identify the 20th 
century as the time when the human species broke the bonds of 
gravity that had heretofore bound them to this planet 
in brief remarks aldrin who walked on the moon with armstrong 
and collins who remained in lunar orbit in the command ship looked 
to future space exploration 
one of these years and i hope it wont be too long this 
country will decide to press on again far out into space perhaps to 
the planet mars collins said 
aldrin said nasas freedom space station to be assembled in 
orbit in the mid1990s should serve as a stepping stone to a manned 
lunar base and human flights to mars 
he called president john f kennedys commitment to the moon 
landing goal 28 years ago a starters gun for our pioneering giant 
leap for mankind 
were not yet ready for that go again but perhaps we are at 
the starting line prepared to take our marks or get set aldrin 
said 
following the ceremony the astronauts rode in a 
20milemotorcade from the space center to cocoa beach where they 
attended a luncheon in their honor an estimated 10000 people lined 
the route to cheer the spacemen and to take pictures 
for armstrong aldrin and collins the ceremony was the second 
stop on a weeklong sentimental journey that began saturday with a 
visit to the marshall space flight center in huntsville ala where 
their saturn 5 rocket was designed 
in huntsville on sunday apollo 12 astronaut alan bean had a more 
pessimistic view of space exploration in the near future 
bean the fourth man to walk on the moon said that until the 
soviet union decides to put a man on the moon or take some other 
such step americans will be complacent about their space 
achievements 
sometime something will happen where well say maybe wed 
better catch up but that wont happen today bean said 
bean who walked on the moon on nov 19 1969 and later flew 
aboard skylab 3 for 59 days in 1973 said he didnt want to see 
another 1960sstyle space race 
id rather have space cooperation id think that would be much 
better for the earth he said

for the european economic community the paris 
summit of the worlds major industrialized nations is a coming of 
age for a participant once viewed as a gatecrasher at these annual 
events 
the summit that ended sunday asked the eec to coordinate a 
sustained western effort to bring food to poland and trade 
opportunities to hungary to reward these nations for pushing through 
democratic and economic reforms 
this is the recognition of the increased weight and importance 
of the eec in world affairs said claus ehlermann the spokesman 
for eec commission president jacques delors who represented the eec 
at the threeday summit 
the eecs executive commission has attended the annual meetings 
of the leaders of the united states canada france britain west 
germany italy and japan since 1977 but to date the summits have 
largely ignored the eecs role as the worlds largest trade bloc 
instead they focused exclusively on ways to harmonize the 
economic and monetary policies of the worlds seven major 
industrialized nations 
but in a declaration on eastwest relations issued saturday the 
summit asked the eec to organize within weeks a meeting of western 
nations interested in helping poland and hungary 
sundays final communique praised the european monetary system 
for having brought monetary stability to europe stressed that the 
eecs plan for a borderless eec by 1992 will lead to more trade and 
welcomed the communitys recent initiative to improve trade links 
with the noneec nations in europe 
on all these points the eec was mentioned by name 
by comparison the communique issued after the 1988 summit in 
toronto mentioned the eec only once in an annex paper 
for the eec paris in 1988 is a far cry from london 1977 when 
the eec first joined the sevennation summits as an observer 
despite objections by thenfrench president valery giscard destaing 
the french leader felt the eec was pushing its way onto the world 
stage for no good reason he boycotted the summits opening dinner 
to protest the presence at the table of theneec commission 
president roy jenkins 
at later meals giscard destaing rejoined his counterparts as 
jenkins was relegated to eat with the foreign ministers who always 
meet in the margin of each summit 
referring to the eecs growing economic clout in recent years 
the psychological climate has changed delors told reporters of 
the eecs new stature at the summit 
the eec is no longer what it was five years ago the seven 
summit nations have paid tribute to the ems european monetary 
system and its stability 
delors is the key driving force behind the eecs single market 
project that is rapidly nearing its dec 31 1992 implementation 
date 
he also is pushing for economic and monetary union among the 12 
eec states that would give them a central bank and eventually a 
single currency 
delors told reporters it was only natural for the eec to 
coordinate western food aid for poland and trade assistance to 
hungary saying as europeans we have special duties to other 
europeans 
in 1988 the eec signed a trade and cooperation agreement with 
hungary and czechoslovakia and is negotiating similar accords with 
other east european nations including the soviet union 
in the case of hungary delors said the focus of western aid 
should be on more trade opportunities through joint ventures 
the food aid program for poland called for by the paris summit 
could last as long as two years delors said and eec external 
relations commissioner frans andriessen said it could be fully 
underway as early as this autumn 
poland suffers from shortages aggravated by a poor distribution 
system that encourages hoarding drives up prices and fuels 
inflation 
delors said poland will not get an emergency food aid package 
the plan will include food but will also show polish officials how 
to establish and maintain a distribution system to avoid food 
deficiencies and control inflation 
there will be no manna from heaven coming down but we do want 
to help delors said

conductor herbert von karajan the 
brilliant and revered maestro who stirred millions with his music 
and inflamed passions with his stormy life is dead at age 81 
he was perhaps the worlds most honored prolific and wellknown 
conductor 
karajan who resigned as conductor of the berlin philharmonic on 
april 24 after 34 years died sunday at his home in anif near 
salzburg said albert moser the president of the salzburg festival 
austrian television said the cause of death was heart failure but 
festival organizers could not confirm it 
the conductors membership in the nazi party during world war ii 
and his volatile temper made him a figure of controversy throughout 
his life 
but fellow musicians adored his artistry and his more than 800 
recordings sold 150 million copies the most by any conductor 
karajan resigned from the berlin philharmonic during a dispute 
over his contract but cited health reasons for his decision he had 
long been ill and severe back pain made it difficult for him to walk 
unaided to the podium 
despite his illness karajan had regularly attended rehearsals 
for the festival austrias largest cultural event and was to have 
conducted the opening opera on july 27 moser said 
a black flag hung from the festival building on sunday and 
austrian television said celebrations that were to follow the 
premier had been canceled 
american conductor erich leinsdorf referring to karajans 
resignation said i think he must have died from the frustration 
of his recent experiences he died a psychological death 
karajan himself once said when i can no longer make music 
then i no longer want to be 
his sometimes stormy marriage for life with the berlin 
philharmonic was one of the most highly publicized deeply analyzed 
and perhaps least understood relationships in the music world 
salzburgs most famous son after wolfgang amadeus mozart karajan 
was described by friends as a shy introverted somewhat solitary 
man detractors called him arrogant and greedy 
karajans membership in the nazi party in world war ii caused him 
to be banned from performing for two years and forever boycotted by 
some jewish musicians 
violent demonstrations marred his first us tour with the berlin 
philharmonic in the 195455 season 
but nobody disputed his genius karajan a 40year devotee of 
yoga and zen buddhism often conducted with his piercing blue eyes 
closed insisting it helped him establish a psychic bond with the 
orchestra 
i am much more with the musicians if i have my eyes shut 
karajan was quoted as saying in helena matheopoulos 1981 book 
maestro 
american singer jessye norman in paris for frances bicentennial 
celebrations said in a statement herbert von karajan always 
rolled out a magic carpet for us the singers it was enough for us 
to take our place and with him our musical work took on another 
dimension 
born april 5 1908 in salzburg the son of a doctor karajan 
made his debut at age 5 when he played mozart on the piano at a 
charity concert 
i set the goal for myself very early on not to fritter away one 
minute of my life and ive achieved that karajan said in 1983 
a thirst for adventure often put karajan at the controls of jets 
fast cars and racing yachts he climbed mountains and skied down the 
snowy summits near the swiss resort of st moritz where he kept one 
of his three homes 
karajan who considered arturo toscanini his idol studied in 
vienna but forged his career in germany where his first engagement 
was at the stadttheater of ulm 
at 27 he went to aachen and became germanys youngest general 
music director 
friends said karajan joined the nazi party to avoid the wrath of 
adolf hitler and his henchmen who expected party membership of the 
top cultural figures under their rule 
but karajan was among the celebrities accused of collaboration 
after the war and was forced to submit to a twoyear ban on 
performing imposed by the allies 
in 1946 karajan became conductor of the vienna symphony 
orchestra in 1948 he began conducting at the salzburg festival 
in 1955 he was appointed conductor of the berlin philharmonic 
through the years karajans temper led to a number of feuds with 
leading singers and runins with the media which he accused of 
portraying him unfairly 
in later years karajan had to fight off illness on several 
occasions and reportedly needed painkilling injections between 
pieces at some concerts because of displaced discs digging into his 
spinal cord 
severe back pains increasingly reduced the number of karajans 
appearances however salzburg festival officials said he had been 
regularly attending rehearsals for verdis opera the masked 
ball with placido domingo 
karajan is survived by his third wife the frenchborn eliette 
mouret and two daughters isabelle and arabelle 
funeral arrangements were pending

a roman catholic priest suspended for forming 
the unauthorized africanamerican catholic congregation is 
considering starting a second church as well as a school day care 
center and housing for the homeless 
the rev george a stallings jr was quoted in the washington 
post today as saying the new church would be called the umoja temple 
he said he is looking for a 25acre site where he can build a 
permanent facility for his new africanamerican church known as the 
imani temple 
stallings told the post he plans to build a school day care 
center administrative offices temporary housing for the homeless 
and permanent housing for senior citizens on the site 
on sunday about 2500 people attended services at the imani 
temple which stallings contends is a brand of catholicism that 
better serves blacks 
after the first services on july 2 stallings was suspended by 
the roman catholic archdiocese of washington from leading mass or 
performing catholic sacraments 
stallings accuses the church of failing to address the needs of 
its black parishioners he wants to form an africanamerican 
catholic rite which he says would still be part of the catholic 
church 
last week 13 black catholic bishops asked stallings to abandon 
his movement saying they deplored his separation from the unity 
of the church 
but stallings told his congregation sunday that he is following 
gods direction and god didnt tell me what bishop i should be 
listening to

the fourth man to walk on the moon 
doesnt expect more moon walks soon because of americas complacency 
toward space discovery 
apollo 12 astronaut alan bean 57 said sunday he doubted that 
bold space initiatives would arise out of the 20th anniversary of 
the apollo 11 mission which put the first man on the moon 
but bean speaking at huntsvilles space celebration 89 said 
that doesnt bother him 
its americans way to go hard at a goal then stand back and 
savor that and not go hard at it all the time he said back in 
the days of apollo i thought we would have done much more by now 
but i didnt stop and think that is not the american way 
bean who walked on the moon on nov 19 1969 flew aboard skylab 
3 for 59 days in 1973 and has trained astronauts spoke a day after 
apollo 11 astronaut edwin buzz aldrin addressed the huntsville 
celebration 
aldrin had called for putting men on mars within 20 years 
i hope its as fast as buzz is talking about it bean said 
but he doubts it 
people feel right now that even though we are not no 1 in the 
world in space that if we really wanted to be and really made an 
allout effort like we did with apollo we could be no 1 said 
bean who noted specifically that soviet endurance experiments in 
space had far outstripped us efforts 
until the soviet union decides to put a man on the moon or take 
some other pridethreatening step bean expects little change in 
americans attitudes 
sometime something will happen where well say maybe wed 
better catch up but that wont happen today bean said 
when that day comes bean hopes for space cooperation between the 
united states and soviet union 
id think that would be much better for the earth said bean 
who is retired in houston and spends his time painting space scenes

soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in an extraordinary 
entreaty to the host of the western economic summit came knocking 
at the door just as capitalist club members were about to conclude 
another harmonious session 
they did not ask him in whatever the momentum of gorbachevs 
economic restructuring president bush said western leaders 
recognize that moscow has a long way to go before it will sit at the 
elite groups table 
francois mitterrand the socialist patrician who is president of 
france and host of the economic summit that ended this past weekend 
plans to write gorbachev a polite reply to the soviet leaders 
suggestion that moscow participate more directly in global economic 
discussions 
our perestroika is inseparable from the policy tending toward 
full and entire participation in the world economy gorbachev 
wrote mitterrand 
the obstacles are enormous it isnt only that the soviet economy 
is weak the western nations have bad years after all rather it 
is that the soviet system lacks economic depth or maturity 
its currency the ruble is not traded internationally a fact 
which isolates the soviet union from foreign trade and monetary 
relations that are the heart of the western economic system a 
country that will not accept its own currency at hotel checkout is 
not ready for membership in the g7 the western thinking goes 
g7 which stands for group of seven is a club of 
likeminded wealthy nations who speak the same monetary and trade 
language if anything gorbachevs letter seeking to link up the 
soviet economy with the united states france britain canada 
italy japan and west germany is a plea for acceptance in the 
economic arena 
the soviet union belongs to the second world of communist nations 
struggling to keep pace with rising consumer demands not a single 
one of the eastern bloc states can claim a vibrant economy 
theres an awful lot that has to transpire in the soviet 
union before moscow can claim a position in serious international 
economic discussions bush said at a windup news conference on 
sunday yet he was encouraging toward gorbachev 
we would welcome any movement by the soviet union towards 
marketoriented or western economies he said theres no 
question about that and theres nothing begrudging about our saying 
that i dont expect mr gorbachev to sit as a member at next years 
summit 
british prime minister margaret thatcher wished the soviets 
success in their reforms but i dont see the time she the soviet 
union will join us because of her having become a great 
freemarket economic success 
others were equally skeptical 
their economy is a basket case said a key bush 
administration analyst theyve never given aid to the third 
world their aid to the third world comes on military tracks 
reflecting a moment and after being assured he would not be 
identified the official lowered his voice and opined they dont 
have any pricing system its just poignant 
tanks and rockets are not the kind of aid the seven summit 
members have in mind for hungary and poland as they strive to 
transform their economies to something resembling the free market 
another cornerstone of the weekend summit was a plan to help third 
world nations reduce their enormous debts the analyst suggested 
this was simply beyond the reach of the soviet system 
gorbachev wrote that he saw points of convergence on how to 
resolve the third world debt crisis but he offered no specifics 
there was discussion among the western leaders as to whether 
gorbachev was just mischiefmaking seeking to grab a headline in 
the midst of the summit i cant say that never occurred to us 
bush acknowledged ruefully 
yet the leaders concluded that the gorbachev note reflected an 
honest interest in internationalizing the soviet economy for years 
soviet leaders have been interested in obtaining hard currency from 
the west for trading purposes and in obtaining western technology 
not available from its communist trading partners 
nuclear arms space technology and the soviet unions very size 
long ago gave moscow geopolitical status gorbachevs attempt to 
extend his countrys standing to the economic front is a long reach 
however and not until he launched his perestroika campaign of 
economic restructuring could discussions with the west be taken 
seriously 
gorbachevs overture was the main topic of discussion when the 
seven leaders had dinner saturday night so it was taken seriously 
here 
people concluded that it was just one more manifestation of the 
changing world were living in bush said 
this marks the first time that the leader of a country that 
contests the economic systems of the seven shows himself as an 
interlocutor not as an opponent italian prime minister ciriaco 
de mita told reporters sunday

washington attorney thomas root said he 
doesnt know how he passed out during his 800mile flight down the 
east coast and blamed his bullet wound on a gun he said discharged 
when his small plane crashed in the ocean 
in an bedside interview published today in the washington post 
root denied he had been attempting to commit suicide and said he 
has become the victim of innuendo as his story mushroomed 
im shocked i cant understand why this story has blown up 
beyond the admittedly unusual circumstances to end up being a 
frontpage story like this said root listed in stable condition 
sunday at hollywoods memorial hospital 
after the fourhour flight on autopilot thursday the crash into 
bahamian waters and his rescue by air force parajumpers roots 
survival was called miraculous but the subsequent discovery of a 
gunshot wound to his abdomen led to suspicion he hadnt meant to 
survive 
as i was swimming around out there hurting a lot i was 
thinking about my family and that i wasnt going to see them 
again he told the post and i say that to say that i dont 
think i have the ability nerve or stupidity to take another life 
mine or anyone elses 
root said he did not know what had caused him to pass out during 
the flight but confirmed federal investigators account of his 
losing oxygen possibly from carbon monoxide leaking into the cabin 
refuting reports that he was put on a list of suspected drug 
smugglers by federal authorities after trips to the caribbean the 
36yearold alexandria va resident also said he had never dealt 
in drugs and had never even taken his plane outside of the united 
states 
root talked saturday with a national transportation safety board 
air safety investigator and an fbi agent ntsb investigator andrew 
alston said he didnt have reason to dispute roots version of 
events but that investigators in several places will try to 
determine whether evidence matches roots story 
alston said investigators were questioning roots claim he 
doesnt remember the gunshot which initial tests indicate was at 
very close range 
root has suggested that a 32caliber smith amp wesson revolver he 
kept loaded in the glove compartment fell out and fired when his 
singleengine cessna ditched 
root said the gun could not have fired earlier in the flight 
because he would have lost too much blood before the plane dived 
but capt james rahman the coast guard flight surgeon who 
treated him soon after the crash said root showed symptoms of 
peritonits which he said would prove he was shot at least two hours 
before the plane hit water 
roots explanation will be checked in further tests and 
discussions with firearms experts and the guns manufacturer alston 
said

national teaching credentials will be offered 
in 29 fields to qualifying educators a national education group 
said today in a move aimed at boosting professionalism in the 
classroom 
the guidelines released today are the first major step toward 
achieving high and rigorous standards for what teachers should 
know and be able to do said james a kelly president of the 
national board for professional teaching standards 
the certificates will be given to teachers who qualify through 
essays interviews performance and other means the group said 
no one has ever tried to do something like this in a profession 
this size with so many builtin constraints kelly said 
the 63member board chaired by former north carolina gov james 
hunt is scheduled to start awarding the voluntary certificates in 
1993 
the nations 25 million teachers may apply for certification if 
they have a bachelor of arts degree and at least three years of 
experience 
teachers will be evaluated on their knowledge of their subject 
their competence in teaching techniques and their understanding of 
child development according to the guidelines released in chicago 
copies also were made available in washington 
the national board proposed three years ago by the carnegie 
forum on education and the economy is made up of teachers 
government officials business leaders and representatives of higher 
education 
through the voluntary certificates the board aims to increase 
teacher professionalism upgrade childrens learning environments 
and spur improvements in teacher training 
the credential also is expected to make teaching a more 
attractive career option and give teachers a chance to move into new 
roles requiring particular expertise 
certified teachers may also command better salaries but kelly 
said that will depend on local authorities 
the board has always said we want our certificates to be 
recognized he said in an interview but its not the boards 
business to say how each school district and private school should 
recognize certified teachers 
kelly said the board will not limit the number of teachers it 
certifies and does not anticipate the credential being restricted to 
an elite group but he noted that not everyone who tries will 
pass this is not a matter of mailing a transcript to the state 
capitol and getting a license back by return mail 
evaluation methods may include multiple choice tests essays 
interviews simulated lesson plans and parent conferences and 
observation of the teachers at work the board report said 
a typical evaluation could involve asking a music teacher to 
bring a videotape of an orchestra rehearsal or asking a teacher to 
come to an assessment center to defend his or her methods kelly 
said 
the board plans to issue certificates in 29 fields including 
early and middle childhood music art foreign languages physical 
education special education vocational fields and subject areas 
such as math science social studies and english for different age 
groups 
it is unclear whether the board will eventually offer more than 
one level of certification a concept opposed by the national 
education association 
the 2millionmember nea and its 700000member rival the 
american federation of teachers each have seven seats on the 
national board 
aft president albert shanker a longtime backer of national 
teacher certification said the guidelines prove skeptics were wrong 
when they said the task was impossible we can be proud that we 
have come so far he said

jennifer cole a spokeswoman for the national right to life 
committee called turners decision to air the prochoice program 
but not a prolife film very irresponsible journalism

showing eclipse of reason a film showing the results of a 
24week abortion

a congressional research agency says the us 
steel industry has returned to normal levels of profitability 
and ending import quotas in place the past five years would have 
little overall impact 
the effect of the quotas has declined substantially and the 
vast majority of them are now going unfilled the general 
accounting office said in a report released sunday while 
expiration of the quotas might effect the market for a few 
individual steel products it would likely have little impact on 
the market as a whole 
twenty separate quota agreements covering steel imports from 29 
countries are due to expire sept 30 president bush is expected to 
announce a new steel policy soon after he returns from the paris 
economic summit 
senators from states with agricultural and other major exports 
have been campaigning against the quotas those from steelproducing 
states have been urging a fiveyear extension the white house is 
reportedly weighing proposed two and fouryear extensions 
the gao report said the major cause of the industrys plight when 
the quotas were adopted in 1985 was the recession earlier in the 
decade a situation made worse by a surge in imports and the soaring 
value of the dollar

currency traders relieved from the anxiety of 
possible interest rate hikes in the united states actively bought 
dollars today sending the currency sharply higher against the 
japanese yen 
stock prices declined on the tokyo stock exchange as volatile 
interest rates and uncertainties in japanese politics before this 
weekends parliamentary election sidelined many investors dealers 
said 
the dollar closed at 14153 yen up 203 yen from last fridays 
close of 13950 yen it opened at 14085 yen and moved in a range of 
1408514155 yen 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which fell 5639 points on friday shed another 11855 
points or 035 percent to close at 3345622 
traders said the dollars strength followed its upward trend in 
new york on friday but the renewed strength of the us currency 
was largely because of economic indicators released in washington on 
friday 
players are buying back the dollar because last weekends 
economic indicators somewhat relieved the market from worrying that 
us interest rates would go down said a dealer at a major 
commercial bank speaking on condition of anonymity 
the us commerce department reported friday the nations retail 
sales fell 04 percent in june while the labor department said its 
producer price index of finished goods dropped 01 percent last 
month 
another dealer said the fact that the leaders of seven major 
democracies at the economic summit in paris did not discuss currency 
issues also motivated dollarbuying 
it was as if saying they approved the current level of exchange 
rates said the dealer also speaking on condition of anonymity 
securities dealers said uncertainties over the political 
situation in japan sidelined many investors 
with this little trading there is not much we can do about it 
except wait for investors to come back said ichitaro watanabe a 
dealer at nikko securities co 
volume traded on the first section of the tokyo exchange was 
estimated at 260 million shares 
recent media polls show public support for japans governing 
liberal democratic party has fallen behind the japan socialist 
party the second largest party an election for half of the 252

democrats who have only recently gotten 
over the shock of the resignation of house speaker jim wright are 
fighting to keep the congressional seat he held for more than 34 
years 
three republicans and one libertarian are among the eight 
candidates on the ballot for the aug 12 special election to fill 
the house seat wright first was elected to in 1955 no primaries 
will be held 
were taking the attitude this is a new campaign said david 
rucker a spokesman for republican candidate laraine bethke as 
republicans we think the playing field is very level 
the district that includes most of fort worth long has been a 
democratic stronghold but republicans have fared well in recent 
elections last week eight democratic judges citing a changing 
political climate defected to the republican party 
wright stepped down as speaker and resigned his house seat last 
month amid an ethics investigation that turned up 69 instances of 
alleged rules violations 
the longtime congressmans popularity remained high in his 
district even after he announced his resignation may 31 and all of 
the candidates have been careful not to criticize wright 
dennis sheehan the tarrant county democratic party chairman 
says the democrats are the only contenders because the voters of 
district 12 dont like the way the republican party railroaded jim 
wright out of office 
republican leaders disagree 
it was the democrats who threw jim wright out of congress 
said steve hollern the gop county chief if they had been willing 
to put their neck on the line to save him they could have kept him 
but the democratic congress was not willing to do that 
the special election is to fill the rest of wrights term ending 
in january 1991 a runoff is expected in late august or september 
because no candidate should win 50 percent of the vote 
wright and both party chairmen have declined to endorse a 
candidate 
among the democrats are three fort worth attorneys george 
petrovich jim lane and pete geren 
lane was endorsed by the tarrant county central labor council 
aflcio which represents about 28000 workers 
geren a former aide to sen lloyd bentsen has been endorsed by 
the democratic congressional campaign committee and enjoys the 
backing of martin frost the senior us congressman from north 
texas 
the other democrat is bill turner who owns a fence store 
sheehan said none of the democrats are carbon copies of wright 
its impossible for anyone to step into his shoes theyll have 
to establish their own credentials sheehan said 
republican candidate dr bob lanier a physician whose syndicated 
television show on health matters is broadcast in 40 markets has 
been endorsed by us sen phil gramm and texas gov bill clements 
in addition to lanier and ms bethke a former aide to us rep 
dick armey private investigator jim hunter is running as a 
republican 
robert buckingham jr manager of an oilchange garage has filed 
as a libertarian candidate 
the shock of the events involving wright has worn off said 
sheehan voters are now focusing on the reality that somebody must 
go to congress to represent this district and they want somebody 
who will work as hard for the district as wright did for 34 years

most bastille dayrelated events honored the 
french revolution but at a funeral mass in manhattan for louis xvi 
marie antoinette and other victims celebrants deplored it 
instead of the marseillaise a gregorian chant was heard saturday 
at st anns church where 125 people prayed for the repose of the 
souls of aristocrats and clerics 
let us pray to god that there will never be another french 
revolution said the rev karl a claver who dwelt in his sermon 
on the revolutionaries fundamental and violent hostility towards 
the catholic church shown by the killing of paris archbishop 
the guillotining of nuns the closing of churches and the 
persecution of priests who refused to swear loyalty to the 
revolutionary government 
and he told the worshippers some of whom called themselves 
monarchists that the french revolution ushered in such dangerous 
practices as civil marriage secularized education and the 
separation of church and state 
the memorial for the revolutions victims was held instead of the 
traditional latin mass which is said every saturday at st anns 
out of all the voices extolling the virtues of the french 
revolution there should be that catholic voice saying yes there 
may have been valuable things accomplished but lets look at the 
atrocities said one of the mass organizers joseph patalano 22 
a technical writer for shearson lehman hutton 
at least one of the organizers saw a direct link between the 
french revolution and the latin mass 
were here trying to preserve a tradition that many people in 
the church are trying to suppress said john zmirak a graduate 
student at louisiana state university 
modern secular ideology was born in bloodshed rather than in a 
bloodless plebiscite zmirak said declaring it a truth that the 
culture is trying to suppress

there are some cracks in the souths support for 
another super tuesday regional primary in 1992 but most of the 
southern legislators at their annual convention appeared ready to 
give it one more try 
the southern legislative conference meeting in baltimore through 
wednesday was instrumental in convincing state legislatures in 14 
of the 15 states that make up the association to join a regional 
primary held march 8 1988 only west virginia refused to go along 
super tuesdays architects had hoped it would result in the 
nomination of a more conservative presidential candidate but the 
winner last year was jesse jackson and michael dukakis eventually 
held sway 
still a majority of southern states appear to be ready to join 
another regional vote in 1992 
rep robert c hunter of north carolina has been named to head a 
special panel charged with recommending whether a regional primary 
should be held in 1992 and if so whether some alterations should 
be made 
hunter said sunday he favors another regional primary 
super tuesday accomplished most of the goals we had in mind 
it was never designed to elect a southerner that was never the 
primary purpose i think what we have to do is look beyond 1988 
he said 
hunters view was shared by us bob graham dfla who told the 
legislative conferences executive committee sunday that super 
tuesday was the most constructive change that occurred in the 
presidential process of 1988 
he said the regional primary forced presidential hopefuls to pay 
attention to the south and its concerns as never before and at the 
same time boosted interest in the electoral process among southern 
voters 
graham warned that to return to the regions hodgepodge of 
primaries and caucuses stretching from march to june would be 
disastrous for the region and the nation 
southern political opinion about the regional primary is not 
unanimous however 
already arkansas has tentatively decided not to participate in a 
1992 regional primary the primary has many opponents in missouri 
and may be in some trouble in alabama kentucky texas and maryland 
virginia placed a sunset provision in its primary law that 
automatically returned the state to its traditional caucus method of 
selecting delegates to the nominating conventions 
lawmakers said that georgia florida louisana mississippi 
north carolina oklahoma and tennessee still favor the regional 
approach 
hunter said he was not especially concerned about possible 
defections adding if a few states dropped out it wouldnt kill 
super tuesday 
graham agreed the one legitimate criticism of super tuesday 
was there may have been too many states frankly if the states that 
leave are the border states i dont think that would be a bad 
development

limits the operation

restrict abortion in his speech which focused on the growing costs 
of medicare but told reporters afterwards that he feels very 
good about the ruling 
sullivan said of the ruling by returning this question to the 
states for their action that is the position we wanted 
the national medical association previously has endorsed roe vs 
wade the 1973 supreme court decision legalizing abortion the group 
is expected to reaffirm its support of roe vs wade later this week 
sullivan the only black cabinet member stirred concern among 
antiabortionists in thenpresidentelect bushs camp last december

why should we look at problems which are esoteric when we have 
things that are disproportionately affecting blacks he said

prime minister benazir bhutto and 
indias rajiv gandhi met for more than two hours today and discussed 
the threat of a nuclear arms race between the south asian rivals 
the prime ministers told reporters there are obstacles to warm 
relations between the traditionally hostile nations 
gandhi who left pakistan 17 hours after he arrived said nuclear 
weapons is one of the bigger problems between our two countries 
since a predominately moslem pakistan was carved out of 
hindudominated india in 1947 the two nations have gone to war 
three times 
although india has successfully tested a nuclear device each 
country denies widespread reports that it has nuclear weapons 
gandhi 44 said a stumbling block to resolving the nuclear 
tensions between the countries is the pakistan armys control over 
pakistans nuclear program something ms bhutto denied 
ms bhutto 36 said we do not believe in nuclear proliferation 
we believe in peace global peace regional peace 
both gandhi and bhutto are the offspring of past leaders of their 
respective countries the two met for the first time during a south 
asia summit hosted by pakistan in december 
during that summit india and pakistan signed an agreement not to 
attack each others nuclear facilities 
pakistan has offered to open its nuclear facilities to 
international inspection but ms bhutto said her country will not 
do so alone india rejects the idea 
gandhi arrived in the pakistani capital sunday to colorful 
10foot banners and a ceremonial 19gun salute he was kept from 
viewing about 300 protesters from the disputed kashmir region 
indias only predominantly moslem state kashmir is claimed by both 
nations 
we are not against india and pakistans rapprochement but we 
dont want their friendship at our cost said one protester 
sultan mahmood chowdry of the azad moslem conference 
the protesters said they wanted the fate of the region resolved 
through a plebiscite in line with a 1949 united nations resolution 
but the two leaders said they favored a 1972 agreement signed by 
gandhis mother indira and ms bhuttos father calling for a

scientists aboard the exxon valdez are 
collecting samples of the gooey blue substance still oozing from the 
damaged ships cargo tanks preventing its passage through 
california waters for repairs 
the research team which arrived sunday after the valdez was 
moved into calmer seas off san diego is sampling the contents of 
eight torn cargo tanks and several more torn ballast tanks at 
various depths 
the sampling and testing of the materials will take about a week 
said coast guard lt larry solberg 
a coast guard lab has concluded the material which has appeared 
near the valdez since its arrival off san diego one week ago 
consists of plankton and other microorganic compounds mixed with 
traces of alaskan north slope crude 
the valdez was towed 2500 miles from alaska where it caused the 
nations worst oil spill in march about 11 million gallons of crude 
spilled into prince william sound when the tanker struck a reef 
march 24 
though all of the discharges spotted near the crippled tanker 
since friday were small and dissapated quickly state wildlife 
officials disagreed with exxon officials assessement there was no 
potential hazard to marine life posed by the spillage 
meanwhile the valdez was towed about 35 miles to calmer seas 
sunday to relieve ocean stress on the ships increasingly exposed 
steel framework 
the tanker was about 43 miles northwest of point loma and 14 
miles northeast of pyramid cove 
battered by heavy swells two more steel plates wrenched off the 
vessels hull over the weekend bringing to seven the number of 
plates dangling from the ships bottom 
the plates need to be cut off so the valdez can pass through san 
diego harbors 40footdeep channel en route to a dry dock at the 
national steel and shipbuilding co for an estimated 25 million in 
repairs

troops today patrolled a tense region of the 
republic of georgia to prevent new outbreaks of ethnic violence 
after rioting in which 14 people were killed at at least 127 
injured soviet news reports said today 
the fighting broke out saturday night and lasted into early 
sunday in the black sea city of sukhumi capital of the abkhazian 
autonomous republic tass said the region is administered by 
georgia 
said tarkil ideology secretary for abkhazia said abkhazians 
were protesting a decision by the georgian government to restrict 
the number of abkhazians enrolled at the citys branch of tbilisi 
state university 
abkhazians outnumbered by both georgians and russians in their 
homeland have protested alleged discriminiation in the past 
georgia also decided to separate the sukhumi branch from the 
other campuses tarkil said in a telephone interview from sukhumi 
900 miles south of moscow 
the abkhazian side is against this it is inadmissable to 
divide a university according to nationalities tarkil said 
adding that a commission from the national parliament also opposed 
the division of the university 
tarkil said that the fighting raged over a large part of the city 
and involved not only students but all segments of the 
population 
the tass report said measures are being taken to render help to 
those wounded to restore public order and tranquility the 
situation is now being controlled by police and troops of the 
interior ministry which runs the national police force 
tass said sunday that 11 people died and 127 were hurt in the 
weekend fighting it did not specify the nationalities of the 
victims or give their names the georgian news agency gruzinform 
today said the death toll was at 14 
in the clashes stones sticks firearms and cold steel were 
used said a joint report by tass and grunzinform 
gruzinform said police and military units were patrolling the 
city and adjoining areas the situation is tense an employee of 
the news agency said in a telephone call 
the senior official in georgia communist party first secretary 
givi gumaridze rushed to abkhazia along with law enforcement 
officials seeking to restore order 
party and government officials appealed to the population to be 
rational and responsible and assist law enforcement authorities in 
stabilizing the situation the report said 
abkhazia a region of 535000 people lies along the black sea 
coast in the caucasus mountains of the southern soviet union 
adjacent turkey abkhazians in the region number 91000 
the weekend fighting is the latest in a series of ethnic disputes 
and other unrest since mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 
bringing a greater tolerance of dissent 
the ruling communist partys central committee is to meet 
sometime this month to discuss the nationalist problems that have 
accompanied gorbachevs reforms 
in march demands by abkhazians for independence sparked clashes 
with georgians and led to nationalist rallies by georgians in the 
republics capital tbilisi 
in april 20 people were killed when troops armed with sharpened 
shovels crushed a proindependence rally in tbilisi that incident 
is under investigation by a commission of the national parliament 
the neighboring republic of azerbaijan and the nagornokarabakh 
autonomous republic also have been the scenes of bloody ethnic 
clashes as have the republics of kazakhstan and uzbekistan in 
recent weeks 
in uzbekistan uzbeks attacked minority meskhi turks in late may 
and early june killing 100 people the minority was resettled there 
from georgia during stalins rule 
native residents in kazakhstan rioted against ethnic groups from 
the caucasus mountains in june they complained the settlers 
received preferential treatment in housing and other benefits 
like the largely armenian population of nagornokarabakh which 
is seeking to be free of administrative control of azerbaijan the 
abkhazians have been seeking autonomy from georgia 
nagornokarabakh has been placed under the administrative control 
of moscow but abkhazia is still administered by georgia

nobel laureate alexander solzhenitsyn in his 
first major american interview in 10 years says he wont return to 
his homeland until his new epic is available in every bookstore in 
the soviet union 
since leaving the soviet union and arriving in cavendish vt 
with his family in 1976 solzhenitsyn has written more than 5000 
printed pages in russian of an epic called the red wheel 
covering the period surrounding the russian revolution of 1917 
one of the novels of the series august 1914 is being 
published in english this week by farrar straus amp giroux 
he said in the july 24 edition of time magazine that to return 
home before the red wheel is available to soviet citizens would 
make him sort of mute time said he is now preparing the final 
pages of the work 
no one would know where i stood i would have expressed 
nothing once people read it then we can talk he said 
but he noted that the major stumbling block to going home is the 
pending charge of treason against him for his writings 
on another topic solzhenitsyn said he was amazed when people 
give him and his books labels such as antisemitic chauvinistic 
xenophobic and nationalistic 
it is quite extraordinary the extent to which i have been lied 
about he said some people distort things consciously others 
just dont take the trouble to check their sources he said it 
is remarkable and it makes me ashamed of journalists no one ever 
gives any quotes 
the 70yearold solzhenitsyn who won the nobel prize for 
literature in 1970 said public opinion about him is varied in 
europe but monolithic in the soviet union and united states 
in the soviet union i can understand it it is due to the 
politburo he said but in the us fashion is very important 
if the winds of fashion are blowing in one direction everybody 
writes one way and with perfect unanimity it is perfectly 
extraordinary 
he said he has chosen to remain silent about the major changes in 
the soviet union and the communist world because his focus has been 
on his work 
was i going to interrupt my work and start acting as a 
political commentator i didnt want to do that i had to finish my 
work i am over 70 years old and age is pressing on me

the 200 volunteers were out to count 
dolphins but the big marine mammals seemed to be as interested in 
the people as the humans were in them 
we had one come up so close to the boat i couldnt photograph 
him with the telephoto said lisa e bowen of tallahassee fla 
he came right up and looked at me but i couldnt get him on 
film 
she was among volunteers in 30 boats who spent the weekend 
searching for atlantic bottlenose dolphins along a 25mile stretch 
of georgia coast from the south carolina line to st catherines 
island 
theyre trying to help scientists see if the population recovers 
from an outbreak of a stillunidentified disease that killed about 
half the dolphin population off the eastern united states in 1987 
and 1988 
the volunteers reported 1100 sightings but many animals may 
have been counted more than once the weekend effort was the first 
of 40 such surveys planned over 10 years by a conservation group 
the dolphin project 
volunteers try to photograph each animal they see and hope to 
build a catalogue to identify individuals by coloring and markings 
on their dorsal fins 
i know of no effort of this magnitude that has ever been done 
anywhere said charles potter collections manager for the 
smithsonian institution a dolphin expert who has worked with the 
project 
its outstanding he said the federal government could 
never get this many people out there observing it just doesnt have 
the resources 
the project will help monitor part of the populations recovery 
today we had reports of dolphins coming up to boats so close 
people could touch them said beau cutts president of the 
conservation group which has headquarters in marietta 
these are wild dolphins they seem to exhibit as much interest 
in men as we do in the atlantic bottlenose dolphin 
the first survey was from 5 miles offshore to 8 miles inland up 
creeks and in marshes 
some boats found themselves amid dolphins than they could record 
on the written reports

a shipment of 10 endangered black rhinos 
arrived special delivery from africa aboard a jumbo jet doubling 
the population of rhinoceroses in the united states 
the oneton beasts landed sunday at dallasfort worth 
international airport in the rear of a boeing 747 the animals are 
destined for zoos and ranches where they will be bred as part of an 
international conservation program 
one of the females is being taken to la coma ranch near mcallen 
owned by calvin bentsen where it will join 400 other exotic 
animals including a male black rhino named macho 
i told him about it yesterday and he got all excited joked 
bentsen 63 a cousin of us sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
one of the rhinos broke a horn during the trip from harare by way 
of frankfurt west germany several became dehydrated and were 
doused with water inside a cargo terminal before being examined and 
sprayed with an insecticide to kill any diseasecarrying ticks 
theyre a little tired said veterinarian sherri huntress of 
the dallas zoo which is receiving a pair of the animals 
veterinarians were most concerned about the condition of a 
pregnant rhino which apparently experienced only normal stress zoo 
officials said 
in addition to bentsen and the dallas zoo the fort worth and 
milwaukee zoos and the lee bass ranch in southern texas are each 
getting a pair of rhinos and san diegos zoo is getting one 
habitat destruction and poaching have put the animal on the verge 
of extinction their horns sometimes sell for as much as 4500 
apiece desired as dagger handles and in medicinal potions 
before the shipment only eight black rhinos were in the united 
states 
there are believed to be fewer than 3000 southern black rhinos 
in the wild in 1970 there were more than 60000 inhabiting the 
grasslands marshes and forests of africa 
bentsen said while in 1960 he shot a black rhino in kenya he 
wouldnt do it now 
a true hunter would never shoot an endangered animal bentsen

texas officials responding to president 
bushs hint the next economic summit could be held in his adopted 
state describe the prospect in glowing terms 
texas is a state of international importance and for the 
president to bring the leaders of the free world to his home state 
is a brilliant idea gov bill clements spokesman reggie bashur 
said sunday 
bush asked sunday in paris if he might bring the leaders of the 
seven richest democracies to texas said thats a distinct 
possibility he quickly added however its too early no 
decision has been made 
the president speaking to reporters at the end of the 15th 
economic summit said the fact that secretary of state jim 
baker is from houston and im from houston and commerce 
secretary bob mosbacher is from texas should have nothing to do 
with where the next summits going to be and there has been no 
decision 
bush born and raised in new england moved to texas after world 
war ii and entered the oil business he owns a house in 
kennebunkport maine and stays in a hotel when in houston but he 
maintains houston as his voting residence 
another president from texas lyndon b johnson used to delight 
in showing off his lbj ranch to foreign visitors in the 1960s but 
never held any formal summits in the state 
back in the lone star state officials already are jostling for 
the site 
i think thats a great idea said texas house speaker gib 
lewis noting his hometown of fort worth would be a super city 
for the summit 
the hints bush dropped about the roots he shares with baker and 
mosbacher were not lost on houston officials 
lt gov bill hobby put a plug in for his hometown theres no 
better place than houston to discuss economic initiatives its a 
great city and president bushs hometown 
mayor kathy whitmire said she had already been thinking about the 
summit 
we had considered that he bush will be hosting the economic 
summit and we were hoping that he would consider bringing the summit 
to his hometown since houston is such a major international city 
and since we are involved in a strong economic recovery now mrs 
whitmire said 
she said the main benefit to the city would be the international 
exposure 
i am going to be pursuing this issue with secretary mosbacher 
and secretary baker because i think they share my view that houston 
would be a natural 
houston chamber of commerce president eileen crowley said she 
knew of no organized effort to attract the international economic 
summit to houston but added that bush may have provided all the 
incentive the city needed sunday 
given an opening like that lets not let the opportunity go 
by she said im sure well be talking about it

security forces have arrested three members 
of the main opposition party for a recent bombing at a government 
oil refinery that killed three people the chief of military 
intelligence said today 
authorities said three people were killed and two others wounded 
when a box in a package exploded at the syriam refinery on the 
northern bank of the rangoon river on july 7 
three national league for democracy youths have admitted their 
responsibility for the blast at syriam intelligence chief brig 
gen khin nyunt told a news conference 
khin nyunt said he was convinced the syriam bombing was connected 
to a bomb explosion at rangoons city hall on july 10 the 
governmentrun radio rangoon said three people were killed in that 
attack 
khin nyunt said no arrests have been made for that bombing 
the national league for democracy is the largest and most popular 
opposition group to emerge from a national uprising for democracy 
which the army brutally crushed last year 
the general said the youths identified as than zaw moe kyaw 
thiu and nyi nyi u confessed to the refinery bombing at the news 
conference he showed what he said were their photographs and party 
identity cards 
the bomb caused no damage to the refinery one of only two in the 
country 
he identified the mastermind of the bombing as moe thiha an 
organizer for the national league for democracy and said he 
remained at large 
he charged that moe thiha received explosives training from the 
rebel karen national union an ethnic minority group battling for 
greater autonomy from the government 
apparently referring to aung san suu kyi the general secretary 
of the opposition party khin nyunt said a party leader had made 
indirect suggestions that the military is responsible for the 
recent bombings and insinuations that the military was after her 
life 
in fact we are worried that she might fall and hurt her toe 
even because we will be blamed for any harm to her he said 
now it is obvious who is behind the recent bombing and plans to 
disrupt law and order in the country he added 
authorities have banned public demonstrations under martial law 
declared since the army cracked down on a huge nationwide movement 
for democracy in september 
khin nyunt said restrictions on expression and movement of the 
political parties would be lifted step by step depending on 
security conditions 
an election would definitely be held in may and full freedom 
will be given for the final party campaigns he said 
the national league has criticized the governments refusal to 
talk with opposition groups and expressed doubts that the military 
would hand over power

norway accepted an explanation from the 
soviet union today that no fire occurred aboard a nuclear submarine 
that belched black smoke 
but norwegian officials complained that the soviets should have 
reported what they called a defect in the ships nuclear power 
system that forced it to the surface of the barents sea on sunday 
soviet defense minister dmitri yazov said the smoke that appeared 
to come from a fire on board the alfa class submarine was the 
exhaust from the ships diesel engines the tass news agency 
reported 
there were no accidents or other emergencies the soviet news 
agency quoted yazov as saying 
we have to believe them on that arild isegg a norwegian 
defense ministry spokesman said norway will take note of it 
but oslo still wanted a written explanation 
two earlier soviet submarine accidents occurred off norway since 
april 
foreign ministry spokesman bjoern kanavin said the source of the 
smoke was beside the point and that norways main concern was 
the danger of radiation 
the soviets have indirectly confirmed that there was a problem 
with the reactor and in that kind of situation we want to be 
informed kanavin said 
the alfaclass ship was spotted pouring smoke from its 
observation tower sunday and was being towed by a soviet tugboat 
said erik senstad another defense ministry spokesman 
in response to a diplomatic query foreign ministry spokesman 
oeyvind nordsletten said soviet officials told norway on sunday that 
the smoke was part of an exercise and that the submarine had never 
been in trouble 
today yazov said the submarine had been on a combat training 
mission and was shifting its power load to a battery when one of 
the cells was shortcircuited 
the submarine surfaced its diesel engines were fired and 
produced the exhaust tass quoted him as saying 
norwegian television showed the submarine cruising swiftly under 
its own power and reported no outward signs of an accident 
the ship was sighted by the norwegian research vessel mariatta in 
the barents sea about 75 miles east of the norwegian town of vardo 
and north of the kola peninsula it was 30 miles north of soviet 
territorial waters 
senstad said the submarine may have reached a soviet northern 
fleet base on the kola pennisula today norway had no information of 
casualties on board or damage to the ships reactors 
alfa class submarines are powered by two nuclear reactors cooled 
by liquid metal and have auxiliary diesel engines they are capable 
of carrying nucleartipped torpedoes and antisubmarine missiles as 
well as conventional warheads 
the norwegian insitute for radiation hygiene reported no traces 
of radiation in preliminary tests of samples taken near the site of 
the incident 
foreign minister thorvald stoltenberg summoned soviet ambassador 
alexander v teterin late sunday and said it is entirely 
unsatisfactory that norway had not been warned 
defense minister johan joergen holst was quoted by the verdens 
gang newspaper as saying he is worried about the operations and crew 
training aboard soviet submarines sailing off northern norway

about 200 people gathered among the damp weeds in a 
monastery graveyard today to hold the first public requiem in the 
soviet union for czar nicholas ii who was shot by bolshevik guards 
in 1918 
police using loudspeakers repeatedly ordered participants to 
leave the unofficial prayer meeting in moscows donskoi monastery 
but the warnings only made the worshipers sing their russian 
orthodox hymns louder 
organizers said the service reflected a recent resurgence of 
monarchism among soviets who have less fear of persecution and 
arrest for their views 
a brass band stumbled through god save the czar and orthodox 
priests who conducted the service eulogized the czar and his 
murdered family as real russian martyrs 
in july 1918 soldiers acting on bolshevik orders shot nicholas 
and 10 members of his entourage including his wife and children 
nicholas born in 1868 abdicated in march 1917 as revolutionary 
discontent swept russia 
personally said father vadim one of the priests conducting 
the service im moved to tears that the children were also shot 
that they were subjected to terrible humiliation spat upon and 
slandered 
many worshipers came purely out of sympathy for the royal 
victims said one of the meetings organizers vladimir anishchenko 
but anishchenko a member of the unofficial commission on the 
remains of the russian imperial family said there are lots of 
monarchists here 
the commission is calling for the remains of the royal family to 
be given christian burials in the peter and paul fortress in 
leningrad the traditional resting place for the romanov royal 
family he said 
police and city officials who tried to disperse the prayer 
meeting drew angry protests from the crowd 
youre a russian too you should understand one woman 
shouted at a policeman 
im warning you again the policeman said through a 
megaphone stop this meeting and disperse the organizers will be 
held responsible 
the main response was the repeated russian orthodox chant of 
god have mercy 
when the police eventually allowed the meeting to continue an 
old woman said with a smile god has triumphed in the end 
many worshipers carried thin candles and redwhiteandblue flags 
of the provisional government that ruled russia between the 
overthrow of the czar in march of 1917 and the bolshevik takeover in 
november of that year 
russian monarchists are just beginning to organize said 
anishchenko whose tshirt showed the doubleheaded eagle of the 
imperial crest 
monarchists have already contacted grand prince vladimir 
kirillovich the ranking member of the romanov royalty who lives in 
england he just came back to life when he heard about our 
activity anishchenko said 
in april soviet screenwriter and former policeman geli ryabov 
publicly claimed to have found the royal remains including the 
czars skull in a pit in the ural mountains city of sverdlovsk 
the commission has since collected more than 10000 signatures on 
an appeal to the supreme soviet to have the bones certified and then 
given a proper burial anishchenko said

the holy see and predominantly roman catholic 
poland today reestablished full diplomatic relations the first 
time the vatican has forged such ties with a warsaw pact nation 
the announcement by the vatican and polands staterun news 
agency said relations cut by the communists who took power in 
poland in 1945 are at the level of ambassador 
in warsaw stefan staniszewski spokesman for the polish foreign 
ministry said the announcement is a very important fact that 
crowns a long process of normalization of relations between the 
state and the church 
polands bishops in a statement said a proper development of 
relations will influence the realization of citizens rights in 
poland and open a new field of church activities with benefits for 
the whole society 
the statement said relations will also increase polands prestige 
in the arena of international politics 
negotiations had been going on for some time and polishborn 
pope john paul ii indicated recently that an agreement was near he 
disclosed a week ago that he intended to send an envoy soon but did 
not say when 
the polish government has been eager to reestablish the ties to 
boost its standings at home and abroad in the past some polish 
bishops were reportedly reluctant to do this fearful that the 
polish government would seek to go behind their backs and deal 
directly with rome on churchstate issues 
a major hurdle was cleared in may when the polish parliament 
enacted three bills establishing the legal status of the catholic 
church 
in april polands communist authorities reinstated solidarity 
after a sevenyear ban and agreed to allow the free trade union 
movement representation in parliament as an opposition party 
solidarity was formed during a summer of labor unrest a year 
after john paul was elected to the papacy he has been an outspoken 
defender of the union 
in elections last month that were polands freest in four 
decades solidarity candidates won all but one of the seats they 
were allowed to contest 
todays announcement said the agreement takes effect immediately 
it said the decision was taken in consideration of the noble 
tradition of links through the centuries between the holy see and 
the polish nation 
john paul has noted that the holy see has relations with 117 
countries and that ties with poland would benefit both sides 
during his last visit to poland in june 1987 the pope said the 
lack of diplomatic ties with such a catholic country was something 
abnormal and could be harmful to the country 
there was no immediate announcement on the name of the vatican 
envoy but there has been speculation it could be archbishop gabriel 
montalvo a colombian who is papal nuncio or ambassador to 
yugoslavia 
yugoslavia which is nonaligned is the only communist country 
in eastern europe with vatican ties the vatican also has full 
relations with communist cuba 
the last papal ambassador to poland left warsaw on sept 5 1939 
at the outbreak of world war ii after a series of highlevel 
visits the two sides agreed to establish permament working contacts 
in 1974 
vatican officials said recently they expected the papal envoy 
could be named next month raising speculation that the nuncio might 
take up his post around the anniversary date of sept 5

two top nbc executives promised to withstand 
pressure from selfappointed tv censors who oppose controversial 
programs and mount campaigns aimed at advertisers with tactics one 
called new mccarthyism 
specialinterest groups many led by fundamentalist christian 
ministers that urge sponsors to avoid programs considered 
objectionable present a significant worry to the network nbc 
entertainment president brandon tartikoff told television reporters 
this weekend 
what you become concerned about is a sort of new mccarthyism 
where certain parties are out there speaking for what i think is a 
minority viewpoint in terms of what is acceptable network fare 
tartikoff said 
robert wright nbc president and chief executive officer said 
the network would be sensitive in its programming decisions during 
the coming season but would not shy away from hot topics 
our position is we will continue to look for and develop 
controversial issues wright said 
specialinterest groups campaigned with some success against 
nbcs nightingales saturday night live and roe vs 
wade among other shows 
nbc was unable to sell all available advertising spots for the 
critically acclaimed but highly controversial movieoftheweek 
roe vs wade because of its focus on abortion rights 
the nervousness is not on our part tartikoff said its on 
the part of the advertisers theyre caving incredibly quickly 
in response to advertiser defections nbc added 10 staff members 
to its standards department tartikoff said the network also was 
conducting a study to examine whether critical specialinterest 
groups truly represent a change in the majority of viewers values 
tartikoff did not admit that the series nightingales was 
canceled because of interestgroup pressure the series about a 
group of student nurses who spend a lot of time in sexy lingerie or 
chasing doctors was criticized by real nurses their writein 
campaign caused some sponsors to withdraw their commercials 
i dont think there was anything up for contention on our fall 
schedule that got eliminated because of these groups he said 
while admitting that he was concerned about getting the new fall 
schedule started without any problems 
wright said the network would pay special attention to 
programming for the coming season and that we will be a little 
more reserved than we have been 
but tartikoff seemed less willing to accommodate amateur critics 
what im telling you is that theres a brush fire burning out 
there and im trying to put it out he said and i think if we 
put it out then we can go about our business 
tartikoffs reference to mccarthyism linked critics efforts to 
the 1950s communist witch hunts staged by thensen joe mccarthy

bystanders did nothing as two toddlers lay 
drowning in a swimming pool said an emergency official who was able 
to save one of the children 
fire capt ca beasley pulled the two girls from the pool sunday 
morning tiffidie anne mcgough 15 months old was dead at the 
scene officials said 
her 2yearold half sister taffidie was given emergency 
treatment and was in critical condition today at texas childrens 
hospital said hospital information coordinator tina foster 
beasley told the houston chronicle that two men were standing by 
the pool at the apartment complex when he arrived they told him 
there were dolls or dogs in the pool 
regardless of what they thought they were i cant imagine 
anybody standing there looking at two kids in the pool beasley 
said they would be better off out of the pool no matter what 
officials believe someone at the scene must have called emergency 
officials 
the children had apparently wandered into the pool while their 
mother dozed in a nearby apartment the newspaper reported 
i dont understand why they didnt try to save the children 
said tammie patterson mother of the two girls and i wish i knew 
who it was 
patterson 20 said she learned her children had fallen into the 
pool when an unknown man knocked on her door 
i flew right past him down the stairs and by the pool and 
both of my babies were lying there she said 
taffidies grandfather who asked that his name not be used was 
stunned when he heard that onlookers had not tried to save the 
children 
its hard to imagine somebody would do that he told the 
chronicle id help a dog if he were drowning 
district attorney john b holmes said he knows of no law that 
would impose criminal sanctions against someone who failed to come 
to the childrens aid

a delegation of senior officials headed to western 
siberia today to negotiate with striking coal miners whose protest 
spread to other industries strike committee spokesmen said 
as many as 100000 workers in the coalmining region about 2000 
miles east of moscow formed a strike committee late sunday marking 
a new stage in their struggle for greater economic autonomy from 
central authorities in moscow said committee spokesman valery 
serdtsev 
president mikhail s gorbachev and premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
sent the miners a telegram overnight saying they were familiar with 
the strikers demands and were sending top aides to the region said 
serdtsev in a telephone interview from prokopievsk 
the official media had not reported the appointment of the 
delegation by midday today but has said the mining minister has been 
traveling to cities in the region in an effort to end the strike 
serdtsev said the miners had been told they would meet tonight 
with politburo member nikolai n slyunkov chairman of the communist 
partys socioeconomic commission stephan a shalayev chairman of 
the allunion council of trade unions and deputy premier lev a 
voronin who is also chairman of the state committee for material 
and technical supply which oversees the nations industry 
the delegation was to meet with representatives of the strike 
committee in prokopievsk 
the labor unrest that began in one siberan town on tuesday and 
spread rapidly throughout the region is the biggest challenge to 
kremlin control of the economy since gorbachev assumed power four 
years ago 
the communist party daily pravda said there are only small 
islands of tranquility in the region 
the situation is changing from hour to hour and mines that 
were quiet yesterday unexpectedly stopped working today the 
newspaper sovietskaya rossiya reported on sunday 
the western siberian region is one of the nations most important 
coal areas and it supplies fuel and coke used to make steel 
since gorbachev came to power he has shown greater tolerance of 
dissent and public debate and has sought to restructure the stagnant 
and shortageplagued soviet economy most of the unrest since then 
has been sparked by ethnic disputes in the nonrussian republics of 
the soviet union 
but western siberia is in the russian heartland and those 
involved in the unrest are workers the supposed backbone of the 
proletarian state 
moreover the miners are demanding greater autonomy from moscow 
echoing demands heard from such nonrussian republics as lithuania 
estonia latvia armenia georgia and moldavia 
the newspaper socialist industry said the coal strike had spread 
from the mines to other major enterprises in several cities it said 
mining minister mikhail i shchadov rushed from city to city seeking 
to end the strike 
party and government officials on the municipal level were 
reportedly backing the strikers 
local authorities think the demands are fair and are supplying 
the workers with water and kvas a russian nonalcoholic beverage 
said valery legachev a member of the strike committee in the city 
of prokopevsk 
miners from two more cities anzherosudzhinsk and belov joined 
strikers saturday the trade union newspaper trud reported on 
sunday all miners were said to be on strike in prokopevsk 
novokuznetsk kiselevsk leninskkuznetsk osinniki kemerovo and 
berezovski 
legachev said strikers in prokopevsk had 41 demands 
the most important were that the mining ministry give miners and 
local officials greater control of the industry including more 
rights in setting production rates and the rights to sell excess 
production for foreign currency to be used for social services 
other demands include greater concern for the environment such 
as curtailing openpit mining higher salaries for medical workers 
lower prices at canteens and stores operated at the mines better 
housing and recreational facilities and improved working conditions 
in the shafts 
trud put the number of strikers at 100000 pravda said 80000 
in kiselevsk 17 nonmining enterprises struck in solidarity with 
the miners and legachev said the situation was similar in 
prokopevsk 
the region generally produces about 132 million tons of coal a 
year its average output has dropped by 1 million tons since the 
strike began and has cost the economy about 38 million trud said 
the strike began tuesday in the city of mezhdurechinsk where 
miners were demanding higher wages safer working conditions and 
increased supplies of food and medical care 
those miners returned to work thursday but the strike spread to 
other cities

katzrin israeliannexed golan heights ap industry minister 
ariel sharon called on the government today to eliminate plo 
chief yasser arafat to end the palestinian uprising and revive the 
middle east peace process 
in the occupied gaza strip soldiers today blew up the homes of 
two palestinians suspected of fatally stabbing an israeli building 
contractor on friday the army said 
speaking to reporters in this small israeli town on a strategic 
plateau captured from syria sharon renewed his demands for strong 
steps to end the 19month palestinian uprising which has claimed 
the lives of 565 palestinians and 36 israelis 
we have to stop using slogans dishing out promises and handing 
out tranquilizers the time has come to deal with terror and 
violence sharon said 
i think we are in a war its a different kind of war but a 
war he said the most important thing is to restore law and 
order to bring an end to terror and violence called the intefadeh 
arabic for uprising 
sharon a member of prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing 
likud bloc said the government also must eliminate the heads of 
the terrorist organizations first of all arafat 
unless this is done he said i do not see any real possibility 
of arriving at peace or starting a peace process 
it was not sharons first threat against the chief of the 
palestine liberation organization on jan 28 he said on israel 
radio there will be no peace as long as arafat lives 
sharons tour of the golan annexed after its capture from syria 
in 1967 came as the cabinet faced its toughest political crisis 
which sharon prompted by proposing a list of hardline amendments to 
the governments peace initiative 
a 61yearold retired general sharon is also a former defense 
minister who spearheaded israels 1982 invasion of lebanon to rout 
plo guerrilla strongholds from that country 
he was forced out of the post in 1983 when an israeli inquiry 
commission found him indirectly responsible for the slayings of 
hundreds of palestinians by israelibacked forces in the sabra and 
chattilla refugee camps in beirut 
but recently sharon has made a comeback his most notable gain 
came july 5 when he forced shamir to accept as likud policy a list 
of preconditions to the prime ministers peace initiative 
shamirs plan calls for holding elections in the occupied 
territories to elect palestinians to negotiate limited selfrule 
with israel and sharons chief condition was that any vote be 
delayed until the end of the uprising 
the conditions triggered a cabinet crisis when the centerleft 
labor party responded last week by threatening to leave the 
government unless it was made clear that likuds hardline stance 
was not government policy 
the homes of the two 16yearold palestinians were destroyed in 
gaza citys shajaiya quarter after the two were arrested for 
allegedly killing 64yearold zalman yosef schlein in the southern 
israel town of gan yavne 
the two confessed to planning and carrying out the murder with 
a nationalist motive the army said in a statement 
the two nahed yusef radwan gundiah and mohammed mahmud ayed 
hamdiya also allegedly confessed to belonging to groups associated 
with fatah arafats mainstream faction of the plo the army said 
at least 20 people were said to have lived in each house and the 
noise of the explosions could be heard across gaza city arab 
reporters said

china today denounced the seven leading 
industrialized nations for their gross interference in calling 
on chinas communist leaders to end their crackdown on participants 
in the prodemocracy movement 
the strongly worded response mirrored earlier chinese reaction to 
sanctions individually imposed by some of the seven including the 
united states and france after the chinese army violently crushed 
the movement on june 4 
president bush has suspended all military sales to china 
the government also protested that its embassy in paris was 
attacked for the second time since the crackdown and that the 
bicentennial parade in the french capital last week included chinese 
prodemocracy students 
a frontpage editorial in the communist party newspaper the 
peoples daily called on the group of seven to follow a foreign 
policy based on economic and strategic considerations and not by 
judging other nations 
the actions taken by the chinese government have in no way 
offended the west or any other country it said the problem 
arises simply because certain countries out of their own likes and 
dislikes and their sense of value have in a broad scope directly 
damaged chinas interests and dignity with words and deeds 
the editorial said the nearsighted practice of keeping china 
away from the world community may not only undermine world peace and 
stability but hurt the interests of the western countries as well 
for years china crafted its own foreign policy with a heavy 
ideological content but in the past decade it has shifted to a 
policy based on practical interests it has shed its isolation of 
the 1960s and early 1970s and exchanges in education culture 
science and sports have become routine 
most important foreign investment and technology are now 
critical to its ambitious goal of doubling national income by the 
year 2000 but the editorial said foreign withdrawal of investment 
would only encourage a spirit of selfreliance 
the group of seven the united states great britain west 
germany italy france japan and canada included their comments 
on china in a communique issued at the end of their paris summit 
this weekend 
we urge the chinese authorities to cease action against those 
who have done no more than claim their legitimate rights to 
democracy and liberty it said 
hundreds of people were killed when the army attacked unarmed 
civilians june 4 in clearing central beijing of prodemocracy 
protesters thousands have been arrested nationwide since and the 
official media have reported 12 executions directly linked to the 
protests 
official chinese news reports on the summit did not mention the 
portion of the communique dealing with china but the peoples daily 
editorial was read on the radio and the official xinhua news agency 
issued a full english translation 
the editorial did not quote from the group of seven statement 
but said it made unwarranted charges based on the seven nations 
socalled values 
these groundless charges which only represent gross 
interference in chinas internal affairs are certainly unacceptable 
to the chinese government and people it said 
it also reiterated government warnings aimed at hong kong 
residents who support the mainlands prodemocracy movement the 
british colony reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
you carry out your capitalism and we carry out our socialism 
and neither side should poke its nose into the others affairs it 
said hundreds of thousands of hong kong residents have protested 
the crackdown and some have helped smuggle mainland fugitives to the 
west 
we advise those people not to lift a rock only to crush their 
own feet the editorial said cryptically

carolina beaches and waters in the past two weeks an official said

may have been from an unsuccessful air drop by smugglers said james 
mcgivney agent in charge of the drug enforcement administration in

it was a vessel that kicked them the bales off or an air drop that 
went bad we dont have any indication that either a vessel or an 
aircraft sank he said

drop them to be picked up by others 
some of the bales were found on beaches while others were picked 
up offshore by charter fishermen mcgivney said he didnt know how

the government said today it must have 
a formal letter from the united states requesting the release of an 
american photographer who was captured after entering the country 
with guerrillas 
tony obrien who was on assignent for timelife inc was 
arrested june 8 in kabul at a hideout used by the moslem guerrillas 
who are trying to overthrow the sovietsupported government 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said the afghan 
government has decided in principle to release the 43yearold 
photographer 
but we will need a letter from the american government 
requesting us to release mr obrien amani said we hope the 
american consular officer who is in town is carrying such a letter 
which should also authorize her as the representative of the 
american government 
renny smith from the us embassy in new delhi arrived in kabul 
on sunday to oversee obriens release 
mrs smith said she would not comment on the afghan demand 
i was told everything was ok in fact i have booked myself to 
return on tuesday she said 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
afghan government appeared to be using obrien in an effort to force 
the united states into issuing a statement that could be construed 
as recognizing president najibs government as legitimate the 
united states supports the rebels 
a french photographer and an italian photojournalist captured by 
government forces were freed last year but only after their 
governments formally requested their release and dispatched senior 
officials to kabul 
the clemency pleas by the french and italian governments were 
widely publicized by kabul as a show of official international 
recognition 
the united states withdrew its ambassador from kabul in protest 
after soviet troops entered afghanistan in 1979 to prop up a 
faltering marxist government the us embassy closed in january in 
the final days of the soviet withdrawal 
other major western nations also closed their embassies citing 
fears of rapidly deteriorating security after the soviets left 
the afghan government said last month it had decided to release 
obrien who is from santa fe nm in response to a personal 
request to najib from palestine liberation organization chief yasser 
arafat

here is the text of the speech 
president bush delivered monday at the pieterskerk the church of 
st peter 
the netherlands is an old friend an honored ally of the united 
states and the friendship between our nations is older than the 
american constitution and the united provinces were one of the 
models that our founders looked to in creating a nation from 13 
sovereign states and its a pleasure to visit leiden a city whose 
very name has symbolized for centuries dutch determination and the 
struggle for freedom against the forces of occupation 
and for americans too leiden is a special city a place where we 
trace our origins so many of the individuals who shaped the modern 
world walked the cobbled streets of leiden and it was here that 
hugo de groot known to the world as grotius the father of modern 
international law studied in the nation that is today the home of 
the international court of justice 
and it was here that rembrandt lived and worked and created a 
world of beauty that moves us still today 
and it was here to leiden that the pilgrims came to escape 
persecution to live work and worship in peace in the shadow of 
pieterskerk they found the freedom to witness god openly and without 
fear and here under the ancient stones of the pieterskerk the 
body of john robinson the pilgrims spiritual leader was laid to 
rest 
and it was from this place the pilgrims set their course for a 
new world in their search for liberty they took with them lessons 
learned here of freedom and tolerance and the pilgrams faced the 
dangerous passage but carried on the winds of hope they arrived 
and in the rocky coast of new england at the edge of a wild and 
unsettled continent they planted the seeds of a new world a world 
that became america 
and today as when the pilgrims left this city a new world lies 
within our reach our time is a time of great hope and a time of 
enormous challenges the new world we seek is shaped by an idea an 
idea of universal appeal and undeniable force and that idea is 
democracy the power of the democratic idea is evident everywhere 
in the halls of government in the hearts of people around the world 
in the words of victor hugo no army can withstand the strength 
of an idea whose time has come and ladies and gentlemen 
freedoms time has come 
we the people of the united states and the people of the 
netherlands are fortunate the freedoms that others are struggling 
for are freedoms that we enjoy 
but freedom never comes without struggle and no struggle is 
without sacrifice 
the americans and the dutch both know that the cost of freedom is 
high and thats why both of our nations are partners in an alliance 
of free nations that spans the ocean that the pilgrims crossed our 
alliance the nato alliance connects two continents unites a 
hemisphere 
but what connects us isnt merely a fact of geography ours is an 
alliance forged on common values rooted in a shared history and 
heritage and a common kinship and culture as well we are part of 
the commonwealth of free nations 
almost two months ago i came to europe to celebrate the fruits 
of our alliance four decades of peace and prosperity and freedom 
at the time of natos founding amid the airlift to a besieged 
berlin few would have prediced a peace so strong and lasting here 
in the netherlands and elsewhere some people expected war to come 
again within their lifetime instead the nato era has brought the 
longest period of peace that europe has known in the modern age 
and let me assure you americans know that to keep the peace in 
europe is to keep the peace for america and today the atlantic 
alliance formed to contain the threat of soviet expansionism is 
creating new opportunities to ease tensions to build a new world 
to build an enduring peace 
and thanks to natos strength and unity we now have the 
opportunity to move beyond containment to integrate the soviet 
union into the community of nations thanks to natos steadiness of 
purpose and its commitment to maintain strong deterrent forces the 
way is now open to real reductions in the level of arms that has 
long cast a shadow over this continent the most heavily militarized 
on earth 
in seizing these opportunities reaching that new world depends 
on the unity and strength of the entire alliance not on the actions 
of one nation alone 
the revival of the western european union in which the 
netherlands played a vital role the growing cooperation on security 
issues between west germany and france british and french resolve 
to modernize their own nuclear forces each of these developments 
is a sign that europe sees the wisdom of sustaining the collective 
strength that has kept the peace 
the lesson of our postwar experience is this strength has kept 
us safe and has created opportunities for change and from these 
opportunities we can create a new era of enduring peace 
let me say clearly a stronger europe a more united europe is 
good for my country its good for the united states of america and 
its a development we welcome a natural evolution within our 
alliance the product of true partnership 40 years in the making 
this trend toward closer cooperation isnt limited to collective 
security alone around the world countries are now recognizing that 
no nation no nation can prosper in economic isolation and thats 
why we look forward to the single european market and the more 
integrated european community

jury selection began today in a civil trial 
arising from the 1983 korean air lines disaster in which a jumbo jet 
strayed into soviet air space and was shot down by a soviet fighter 
plane killing all 269 people aboard 
families of passengers killed in the shootdown of flight 007 are 
seeking to prove in court that the airliners crew engaged in 
willful misconduct 
the international civil aviation organization concluded flight 
007 had been off course for nearly 5 hours before it was destroyed 
us district court judge aubrey robinson is presiding at the 
civil trial which he told a pool of 36 prospective jurors will last 
three to four weeks a sixmember jury and three alternates are to 
be chosen from the pool of district of columbia residents 
lawyers for the families said they expect to present about 10 
witnesses several of them korean air lines crew members who flew 
the northern pacific route of the illfated flight 007 lawyers for 
the airline said they may present nearly two dozen witnesses 
including as many as 11 employees of the federal aviation 
administration 
lawyers for the families suggest in court papers that crew 
members aboard the boeing 747 knew shortly after leaving anchorage 
alaska on the last leg of their journey that because of an error 
they made before takeoff they were operating without a reliable 
inertia navigation system the three computerized devices aboard the 
aircraft were the primary means of navigating the flight 
instead of temporarily aborting the flight to reprogram the 
system the crew may have decided to navigate the flight without it 
in clear violation of proper piloting procedure say the families 
lawyers 
crewmen aboard some previous flights that had been aborted had 
been disciplined 
the plaintiffs contend that willful misconduct by the jets crew 
makes the airline liable for damages in excess of the 
75000perpassenger limit normally permitted under international 
agreement 
the us government said the plane was lost due to a navigational 
mistake and that its pilot did not know he was over soviet 
territory the soviet union contends the plane intentionally flew 
its course to photograph sensitive military installations 
the jumbo jet was flying from new york to seoul south korea 
when a soviet military jet attacked it over sakhalin island a site 
of soviet military installations 
rep larry mcdonald dga who was the chairman of the john 
birch society and 60 other us citizens were among the victims 
kal says the only inference that can be drawn from the assumed 
deviation from a normal flight path is that the crew was negligent 
in failing to notice it had gone off course the judge said in a 
ruling last november that negligence may not be the only explanation 
a failure to notice that the flight was offcourse at point a 
or point b or point c might be evidence only of negligence 
said robinson but a failure to notice that the flight was 
offcourse at point a and point b and point c is susceptible to 
a different interpretation 
that different interpretation is that the crew was aware of 
its deviation but elected not to report it and take corrective 
action suggested the judge 
robinson found sufficient evidence for a conclusion that the crew 
of flight 007 knew the navigation system aboard the plane was 
unreliable

on his european odyssey today vowing to end eastwest divisions and 
predicting that ultimately whatever the odds freedom will 
succeed 
bush said soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev already is moving 
in our direction coming our way and he urged the kremlin to chart 
a course that brings itself into the community of nations 
bush spoke hopefully of the prospects for political and economic 
reforms throughout eastern europe in a speech delivered in this 
historic north sea city where rembrandt worked hugo grotius 
formulated theories of international law and the pilgrims sought 
exile before sailing for the new world 
the challenge we face is clear bush said we must work 
together toward the day when all of europe east and west is free 
of discord free of division 
thousands of cheering dutch people lined bushs motorcade route 
through leiden waving american and dutch flags a banner strung over 
the route read leiden is georgeous other handheld signs 
criticized us policy in central america and demanded that abortion 
be kept legal 
bush joked later im not sure about some of those signs i saw 
coming in it reminded me of my own university however 
bush toured an exhibit of pilgrim artifacts and was presented 
with a partial family tree showing he is descended from at least two 
pilgrims who lived in leiden before embarking for the new world in 
the 1620s 
bush arrived in the netherlands the last stop on his 10day 
european tour after visiting poland and hungary and attending 
economic summit talks in paris where the seven richest industrial 
democracies received a gorbachev proposal for integrating the soviet 
economy with that of the west 
saying that dramatic changes were under way in eastern europe and 
the soviet union bush cited gorbachevs letter as only the latest 
example of the soviets moving in our direction 
tracing the rebuilding of western europe from the rubble of world 
war ii he said that the other europe the europe behind the 
wall endured four decades of privation and hardship persecution 
and fear 
said bush 
today that other europe is changing the great wheel is 
moving once more our time the exciting time in which we live is 
a time of new hope the hope that all of europe can now know the 
freedom that you all in the netherlands has known that america has 
known and that the west has known 
our hope is that the unnatural division of europe will now come 
to an end that the europe behind the wall will join its neighbors 
to the west prosperous and free said bush making the first 
visit to the netherlands by any american president 
he said poland and hungary are moving at the forefront of 
political and economic reform traveling farther over the past year 
than anyone in the west once thought possible 
delivering the last major speech of his european trip bush spoke 
before several hundred people in pieterskerk the church of st 
peter a huge cathedral dating to the early 12th century after 
conferring with leaders in the hague the nearby seat of the dutch 
government 
he received an ovation at the conclusion of the speech 
the president said that during his visits in eastern europe he 
heard new voices full of new hope theirs were the faces of 
pilgrims on a journey fixed on the horizon on the new world coming 
into view 
and they know as we do that ultimately whatever the odds 
freedom will succeed he said 
leiden is the community where religious dissidents from england 
took refuge before they sailed seeking freedom in america the 
remains of the rev john robinson a pilgrim leader is buried in 
the cathedral where bush spoke 
here in leiden where the pilgrims dreamed their new world let 
us pledge our effort to create a new world in europe whole and 
free a new world now within our reach he said 
in this nation where protecting the environment is a major issue 
bush noted that the economic summit leaders focused for the first 
time this year on such problems as global warming acid rain and 
ocean pollution 
bush said pollution respects no national boundaries its time 
for nations to join forces in common defense of our environment 
he said the united states will do its part 
bush delivered his address after receiving a 21gun salute at an 
airport arrival ceremony in amsterdam and having tea with queen 
beatrix at noordeinde palace at the hague and meeting with prime 
minister ruud lubbers 
the netherlands the first nation to establish ties with america 
in 1782 is a staunch nato ally that braved fierce public opposition 
in agreeing to accept the basing of nucleartipped cruise missiles 
in 1985 the missiles were never deployed as a result of the 1987 
ussoviet treaty abolishing the mediumrange weapons 
bush held nearly an hour of talks at the parliament with lubbers 
whose centerright coalition government collapsed in may over the 
financing of an environmental cleanup campaign and was thrown into 
a caretaker status pending elections sept 6 
dutch politicians described bushs visit as a pat on the back 
for a loyal nato ally the president returns to washington on 
tuesday 
at a postsummit news conference sunday bush admitted he didnt 
object when the gathering was cut short after three days with the 
cancellation of a farewell dinner 
were kind of running out of gas bush said ill tell you 
its been a vigorous experience in physical fitness for me when 
the summit and his participation in the french bicentennial were 
coupled with the earlier stops in eastern europe 
bush hailed the outcome of the summit and said its firstever 
focus on environmental problems was a watershed 
the final summit communique called for decisive action to 
save rain forests the atmosphere and the seas lakes and rivers 
saying species were endangered and societies threatened by damage 
but it offered few specific proposals on how to accomplish these 
goals 
the document addressed a number of bush initiatives including 
aid to eastern europe and endorsement of the administrations third 
world debt plan it also offered a general endorsement of his call 
for help for hungary and poland

two former ptl aides charged with evading 
487000 in federal income taxes had several hundred thousand 
dollars more in questionable income the government did not 
challenge an internal revenue service agent testified today 
irs agent charles f mauney an expert in taxevasion cases 
testified that david and james taggart did not report more than 
400000 in taxable income for the years 1984 and 1985 
mauney who was questioned by government prosecutor david brown 
testified that the irs did not challenge more than 320000 in ptl 
payments to the defendants for those years the defendants are also 
charged with similar violations for the years 1986 and 1987 a 
topic expected to be taken up as mauneys testimony continues 
there has been some testimony or documents in this trial which 
purport to account for some of these payments mauney said 
the government decided not to challenge these items 
a lot of these items are questionable he said if i was 
doing a civil examination i would not allow them 
the taggarts accused of taking more than 1 million in ptl money 
to bankroll their extravagant lifestyle were fired by the tv 
ministry following the resignation of ptl founder jim bakker 
defense attorney ben cotten has not ruled out an appearance by 
bakker who was the defendants boss and close friend during the 
years the taggarts were charged with evading 487000 in income 
taxes 
bakker and richard dortch his former top deputy at the 
nowbankrupt television ministry are scheduled to go on trial in 
charlotte aug 28 on 24 counts of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy 
us district judge robert potter gave the jury the day off 
friday the prosecution is expected to rest its case today after 
about two hours of additional testimony 
the taggart brothers joined ptl in the late 1970s as piano 
players within a few years david 32 was promoted to bakkers top 
personal aide and james 35 became ptls interior decorator 
both were fired when jerry falwell took over at the television 
ministry when bakkers resigned in march 1987 following revelations 
of the jessica hahn sexandmoney scandal 
following a 16month grand jury investigation into ptls 
operation under bakkers leadership the taggarts were charged with 
tax evasion and conspiracy last december 
prosecutors accuse them of diverting more than 11 million in 
ptl money to their own use by taking large cash advances and by 
using blank ministry checks to pay off their personal credit card 
bills 
beginning july 5 testimony from dozens of new york shopkeepers 
and friends of the taggarts showed the defendants went on spending 
sprees in the most exclusive stores in manhattan florida 
california and europe the purchases included a 96000 ring and an 
85000 diamond and sapphire pin 
prosecutors charge the taggarts used money donated to the 
taxexempt religious organization to buy a 640000 condominium in 
the exclusive trump tower new york skyscraper on fifth avenue 
on thursday the assistant manager of a charlotte bank testified 
the taggarts combined net worth grew from 171000 to nearly 17 
million from 1984 through 1987 
if convicted the taggarts each face a maximum sentence of 25 
years in prison and fines of up to more than 1 million 
for about seven years david taggart served as bakkers personal 
aide for all but a short time in 1983 when he left ptl for several 
months older brother james was an interior decorator whose firm was 
paid more than 12 million over three years by ptl

the worlds major industrial democracies must work to maintain an 
open trading system to preserve sustained economic growth and our 
progress at this recently concluded economic summit in paris brought 
us closer to a more coordinated and common approach across a wide 
spectrum of critical global issues 
the key is concerted action bringing the collective strength of 
the west to bear on our common concerns concerns like the 
environment global warming acid rain and pollution of the worlds 
oceans these are problems that know no borders that no line on a 
map has the power to stop pollution crosses continents and oceans 
and its time for nations to join forces in common defense of our 
environment 
the united states of america will do its part a little over a 
month ago in the united states i announced a series of sweeping 
changes to our clean air act changes meant to ensure that every 
american in the space of one generation will breathe clean air 
and shortly after i get back to the united states after i return 
home we will send our clean air legislation to congress and last 
week in poland and hungary i announced initiatives to work with 
those two countries to combat their pollution problems the next 
step is clear we must together take concerted action to combat 
this common problem clean up our environment for oursevles and for 
our children 
and the summit underscored the fact that its time we take the 
next step in solving the debt problem to encourage conditions for 
global growth that will benefit the industrialized nations and the 
developing world alike we must make progress on this because its 
more than a matter of economic development democracy is at stake 
freedom can nourish the barren soil of poverty just as the 
pilgrims landed upon a desolate rock and laid the foundations of the 
freedom and prosperity that we know today economic and democratic 
development go hand in hand and the steps weve taken towards a 
common strategy on debt will sustain a favorable climate of growth 
and for the flourishing of democracy in the developing world 
and theres eastern europe let me explain the approach that i 
take towards reform in eastern europe we will never compromise our 
principles we will always speak out for freedom but we understand 
as well how vital a carefully calibrated approach is in this time 
of dynamic change 
the soviet union has nothing nothing to fear from the reforms 
that are now unfolding in some of the nations of eastern europe we 
support reform in eastern europe and in the soviet union and were 
seeing dramatic changes general secretary gorbachevs recent letter 
two days ago to the economic summit is only the latest example of 
the soviets moving in our direction coming our way 
ive said it many times that i want to see perestroika succeed 
i want to see the soviet union chart a course that brings itself 
into the community of nations and my visits these last two months 
demonstrate how closely the united states is linked to europe for 
half a century america has been deeply involved in the future of 
this continent and us involvement will be a strategic fact in the 
next century as it has been for this one 
we will play a constructive role in eastern europes economic 
development in the development of political pluralism and in 
creating an international climate in which reform can succeed and 
that is why americas relations with the soviet union are so 
important 
improved relations with the ussr reduce pressure on the 
nations of eastern europe especially those on the cutting edge of 
reform 
the new world we seek is a commonwealth of free nations working 
in concert a world where more and more nations enter a widening 
circle of freedom 
in the pulpit here at pieterskerk one year after peace was 
restored in europe winston churchill spoke to the people of leiden 
the allies had triumphed over tyranny the occupation was over 
after six years of war and devastation churchill said the great 
wheel has swung full circle europe then stood at the threshold of 
a new era an era whose hope churchill expressed in a single 
simple phrase let freedom reign 
and we all know what followed 
half of europe entered that new era and half of europe found its 
path blocked walled off by barriers of brick and barbed wire the 
half of europe that was free dug out from the rubble recovered from 
the war and laid the foundations of free government and free 
enterprise that brought unparalleled prosperity and a life in peace 
and freedom 
and the other europe the europe behind the wall endured four 
decades of privation and hardship and persecution and fear and 
today that other europe is changing

equator at 98 degrees west longitude nearly due south of central 
texas the satellite has been located at 108 degrees west longitude

a passenger ferry capsized in the jamuna 
river near dhaka and at least 60 people were feared drowned police 
said monday 
the ferry was carrying at least 70 passengers when it capsized 
during a sudden rainstorm sunday near manikganj about 35 miles 
northwest of dhaka police said 
we have reports that 10 people swam ashore and the rest are 
missing said a police official at manikganj who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
abdul kader an official who helped in the rescue said it was 
unlikely any more survivors would be found 
the river was very fast at the point the boat sank so it was 
difficult for anyone to survive even if the person knew how to 
swim he said the rainstorm which lasted 30 minutes whipped 
up high waves as the boat went down 
bangladesh is crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers and ferries 
are a popular means of transport ferry accidents are common during 
the summer monsoon which lasts from july through september

the chairman of a house panel investigating the 
department of housing and urban development said today that the 
departments handling of a firm represented by former hud secretary 
carla hills was remarkable in its laxness 
rep tom lantos dcalif referred to a ninepage letter from 
president reagans hud secretary samuel pierce to drg funding 
corp lifting restrictions that had been placed on drg for 
violations of department rules 
when you read this letter you will share my pained amusement 
lantos told mrs hills now the governments top trade official 
during questioning before his government operations subcommittee on 
employment and housing 
the restrictions were lifted after mrs hills who was employed 
as a lawyer for drg from 1981 to 1984 met with pierce and other hud 
officials on the companys behalf 
what came out of the meeting was one of the most remarkable 
developments of mr pierces eightyear tenure lantos said 
this is a devastating letter recounting all of drgs flaws 
breaches noncompliance irregularities and then concludes but we 
will lift the requirement that you preclear loans he said 
lantos said he couldnt understand why the department after 
enumerating all of the problems with drg dropped a previous 
requirement that drg business be cleared through hud before 
continuing 
mrs hills said the preclearing policy was hurting drgs 
business because it was slow and cumbersome and was threatening to 
put the company out of business 
she said pierces letter was very tough and she advised her 
client you are going to have to be more careful than careful 
from now on 
mrs hills who was hud secretary under president ford during the 
mid1970s said she saw nothing inappropriate in representing drg as 
a client after she left office 
my dealings with hud were purely in my capacity as a lawyer 
representing clients to the best of my ability on the merits of 
their case she told the subcommittee 
mrs hills returned to government service earlier this year as 
the bush administrations us trade representative 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he doesnt want to 
see federal support of housing programs suffer because of the 
influencepeddling and other problems during the reagan 
administration 
the topic is sure to come up wednesday when the house takes up 
the fiscal 1990 spending bill for hud and other agencies including 
the department of veterans affairs 
congress has fallen far behind schedule in its consideration of 
the spending bills for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 the house 
was supposed to pass all 13 of them before the july fourth recess 
but only two have cleared so far 
foley now hopes to pass the rest of them by the august recess 
three are scheduled for this week with the agriculture and foreign 
operations bills slated for action in addition to the hud bill 
the senate last week began consideration of a state department 
authorization bill 
among the debates the bill is expected to draw this week are 
whether the united states should continue talks with officials of 
the palestine liberation organization who have past links to 
terrorism and whether the white house should be barred from using 
other countries to carry out deeds that the administration itself is 
barred from doing such as what happened in the irancontra scandal 
after dealing with foreign affairs the senate is expected to 
turn to the american heartland with a rural development bill the 
legislation would earmark federal money for loans to rural 
businesses upgrading rural water and sewer systems and provide aid 
to rural schools and hospitals 
also negotiators from the senate and the house continue efforts 
to forge a compromise bill to bail out the savings and loan industry 
the housesenate conference has tentatively agreed to adopt the 
most stringent features from the separate legislation passed by each 
chamber in hopes of preventing a recurrence of the current troubles 
which are costing taxpayers tens of billions of dollars 
the two chambers were still wrestling last week with differences 
over how to finance the thrift industry bailout and how to structure 
the new regulatory system 
how to prevent flagburning will be discussed as a house panel 
continues hearings on ways to overcome a supreme court ruling that 
upheld the legality of flagburning as a form of political protest 
constitutional experts and veterans groups are scheduled to testify 
this week before the constitutional law subcommittee 
the house ethics committee which took a breather after its probe 
forced the resignation last month of speaker jim wright is expected 
to meet this week to consider the case of wrights chief accuser 
rep newt gingrich of georgia 
gingrich now the no 2 republican in the house is accused of 
violating house rules when he formed a partnership to promote his 
book with people who had an interest in legislation the ethics 
committee has not yet decided whether to launch a formal inquiry 
into the matter

a jesuit priest who publishes a newsletter on 
china said monday he holds little hope for the countrys future 
until the demise of aging conservative leaders who are behind the 
crackdown on dissent 
im not very optimistic said rev yves nalet who puts out 
the jesuitfunded china news analysis its very rare to have an 
elderly leadership with a good vision of the future they are afraid 
of death 
nalet a 42yearold frenchman and two other priests are 
continuing a rich history of jesuit scholarship on china with their 
newsletter published twice a month in this british colony 
one of the traditional works of the jesuits is to try to 
understand what is happening in the society where you live nalet 
said 
he noted that the jesuits a roman catholic order founded in 1534 
by ignatius loyola has been interested in chinese culture since the 
time of matteo ricci 15521610 the brilliant jesuit scholar who 
became a court official during the ming dynasty some members of the 
order learned classical chinese and became mathematicians and 
astronomers to the countrys emperors 
the jesuits who write china news analysis each have a doctorate 
in chinese studies they subscribe to scores of newspapers and 
periodicals from china that form the core of their research 
nalet said their publication which first appeared in 1953 has 
about 800 subscribers including embassies schools and government 
agencies 
the demand for news and views about china has shot up since the 
events of the spring when a studentled movement for democratic 
change in beijing captured the imagination of the world 
the government led by a group of aging revolutionaries called 
in the military to crush the movement and ordered a crackdown on all 
dissent moderate party chief zhao ziyang was sacked and replaced by 
jiang zemin the littleknown party head of shanghai 
my impression is that jiang zemin doesnt have much power 
naley said in an interview in his office the only base he has is 
that hes backed by deng xiaoping the 84yearold senior leader 
of china 
the political situation is in a period of transition until the 
elder leaders die said nalet who believes that no real change in 
the country can occur until a new generation takes control no 
obvious successor to the aging revolutionaries has emerged however 
meaning the likelihood of a continuing power struggle 
nalet also is pessimistic about chinas economy which has 
quickly grown in the past decade under dengs policy of 
modernization and opening to the outside world 
behind the facade of party unity raw power struggles have 
always existed the latest episode has shattered forever the myth of 
a party united in the pursuit of modernization the july 15 
edition of the newsletter said 
the private sector that mushroomed under dengs policies may be 
hit hard by the latest political campaigns that have attacked 
western ideals i dont think many people will want to start a 
business of their own its too dangerous he said 
nalet said that many of zhaos economic advisers who favored 
reforms have lost their jobs in the crackdown so we are going to 
go back to a centralized planned economy 
rural enterprises that also grew rapidly recently may find it 
difficult to get raw materials if the government decides to take 
strong measures to ensure critical resources go to staterun 
factories he said that would exacerbate an already serious 
unemployment problem in the countryside 
the jesuit scholar in reviewing the events in beijing said the 
democracy movement was too early and went too far 
communist china is only 40 years old and the aging 
revolutionaries who still wield power responded to the movement by 
saying we have built a country we have built a party and we 
dont want to see this disappear 
he expressed hope that the democracy movement may have started 
a new vision among the chinese how long it will take to come 
back is another question

a large square on the trade fair floor guide was 
marked japan but only three small japanese stalls could be 
found 
the italian institute for foreign trade was not at its assigned 
booth nor was the association for british commerce in china twelve 
thai companies a papua new guinea exhibit and a large west german 
economics ministry exhibit also were missing 
instead several dozen stalls at the beijing international fair 
were occupied by chinese exhibitors filling in for foreign companies 
that backed out at the last minute either in protest or nervousness 
over last months violence in beijing 
the 10day trade fair which opened friday was beijings first 
since the army crushed student protesters and supporters in street 
fighting killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of people 
according to the fair catalogue prepared in advance the east 
bloc countries china and south korea debuting at a chinese trade 
fair were expected to dominate with relatively few western 
exhibitors 
but even fewer westerners showed than expected and even several 
east european companies stayed away out of nervousness those 
westerners who came kept a low profile 
right now were not talking to the press said a woman at the 
booth for the uschina industrial exchange inc one of two 
american exhibitors 
there was some question of to be or not to be said a 
representative with the czechoslovak company technopol which was 
exhibiting a wide range of equipment including industrialsized 
kitchen appliances 
but he said i have no feeling that its dangerous to be here 
it was terrible what happened but im sure more people die in a 
year in new york city than died in the city of beijing in the 
clashes he refused to give his name 
its better for us frankly that they didnt come he said 
of the absentees we dont have so much competition 
the official chinese media have publicized the fair as an example 
of how life in beijing and relations with foreign countries 
supposedly have returned to normal they have not mentioned those 
who stayed away 
chinese reports also have been silent about one prominent 
participant south korea 
ten south korean companies filled half of one large hall at the 
china international exhibition center in a step forward for the two 
countries newly formed trade ties although china still recognizes 
north korea and has no diplomatic ties with seoul it announced last 
year it would pursue trade with capitalist south korea 
fair brochures did not mention south korea but listed its 
companies under the umbrella korean trade promotion corp 
thousands of chinese wandered among the nearly 3000 exhibits on 
sunday and monday but few seemed to be there to do business 
people come to look around not to buy said a college 
student who said her father was working at the center and gave her a 
ticket tickets were needed to get in but none were on sale all 
were distributed by work units to employees as perks 
young men with blue work trousers rolled halfway up their legs 
and women with children examined a sporty black daewoo racer car 
parked in the south korean section look it has seat belts one 
boy shouted few chinese cars do 
technopols exhibit also was a big draw when the company began 
demonstrating its kitchen equipment by mixing and baking dozens of 
rolls soon well have something to eat joked one passerby 
but the biggest attraction seemed to be a bank of samsung tv sets 
on which western music videos flashed dozens craned to watch as 
madonna pranced and sang like a virgin

china on monday accused france of continuing to 
interfere in its domestic affairs by allowing chinese students to 
march in the bastille day parade in paris 
hundreds of chinese students wearing headbands with the chinese 
characters for liberty equality fraternity rode bicycles in 
the parade friday they carried a banner saying we carry on 
during a meeting with the french ambassador charles malo a 
foreign ministry official called it an attack by insinuation 
against the chinese government 
the official noted the students participated in a celebration 
that was attended by dozens of heads of state and broadcast live to 
many countries thus creating a very bad impact throughout the 
world 
he also said france has repeatedly taken actions unfriendly to 
china but did not elaborate 
china repeatedly has criticized france for giving refuge to 
leaders of the crushed prodemocracy student movement among them 
wuer kaixi 
the foreign ministry official also said a group of youths 
attacked the chinese embassy in paris on friday smashing 
secondfloor office windows and prying away a copper doorplate 
it was the second time china has protested an incident at its 
embassy in france china says a group of people occupied the embassy 
june 29 and harassed the staff 
relations between the two nations have been strained since troops 
put down the student movement on june 34 killing hundreds 
perhaps thousands of people france froze contacts at all levels 
two days later 
attache jean poncet said regular contacts up to the ministerial 
level continue but they are not always pleasant contacts 
on friday the french community in beijing marked the 200th 
anniversary of the french revolution with a brief ceremony that 
contrasted sharply with the festivities in paris 
the french embassy originally planned an allnight party with 
bands and orchestras dancing buffets and fireworks in the citys 
diplomatic section instead about 200 of beijings french community 
attended a onehour ceremony at the embassy 
malo read the first two articles of frances first declaration of 
the rights of man and the citizen but he didnt speak and 
didnt mention china at all poncet said the document approved 
by the national assembly in 1789 upholds the rights of all people 
to freedom and equality 
we didnt feel it was right to hold a larger celebration 
poncet said explaining the embassy didnt want to invite chinese 
officials 
not because of the persons themselves but because they 
represent chinese institutions he said

white residents are seeking what 
blacks in many southern cities spent decades fighting for a voice 
in their government 
only 15 percent of the 1300 residents of friars point a 
mississippi delta hamlet are white blacks fill all five positions 
on the board of aldermen the last white alderman charles wilson 
lost a bid for reelection in june 
why should the rights of a white minority be any different than 
the rights of a black minority asks john yount who started a 
petition drive asking the board to create four wards one with a 65 
percent white votingage population with a fifth alderman to be 
elected at large 
under a ward system yount said i dont know if a black man or 
a white man will be elected out of our district but at least he 
would be accountable to us 
yount said he passed the petition among about 80 percent of the 
nearly 200 whites in friars point and received only 20 signatures 
there is little opposition to a ward system but some question 
whether it should be drawn along the racial lines proposed by yount 
i dont see mathematically no way that we could draw a 
line putting all of the white people in the district and come up 
with a 65 percent ward said mayor james washington who is black 
theres no way 
but washington added that he and the board favor a ward system 
town attorney hunter twiford said monday he had prepared a 
recommendation for changing the town government to a ward system and 
may present his proposals to the board tuesday night the board then 
must decide whether to order a demographic study for drawing up the 
wards 
if the board does vote to change it would have to get us 
justice department approval under the voting rights act of 1965 
which requires prior approval of all election changes in mississippi 
friars point was founded in the early 1830s by john friar who 
came ashore by flatboat from st louis the northern mississippi 
river town prospered for about 50 years in the days of the steamboat 
until railroads took over then became a mostly white farming 
community 
in the late 1940s mechanization pushed black field hands into 
town looking for work and whites gradually became the minority 
about 150 whites live in a sliver of suburbia nudged against the 
mississippi river levee by larger black neighborhoods blacks work 
for whites rarely vice versa 
yount says the ward system is the whites only chance of getting 
representation and that theyll go to court if necessary 
were not trying to decrease the authority of the board said 
yount 42 who manages the main office of a farming operation in 
nearby marks if wilson had been reelected this past time this 
would never have come about we have houses there we have property 
there we want to be involved in city government

an opposition lawmaker was charged with 
espionage monday for allegedly receiving 120000 from north korea 
and running for public office on the order of communist agents 
in the most serious such case in south korean history the agency 
for national security planning said suh kyungwon was turned over to 
prosecutors who have 30 days to produce the indictment needed for 
trial 
if convicted suh 52 could face the death penalty 
suh aide pang yanghyun who also was charged with espionage is 
accused of being the middleman in suhs alleged transactions with 
the pyongyang government 
the intelligence agency said suh received a total of 120000 on 
14 occasions between april 1985 when he was allegedly recruited by 
north korean agents and december 1988 
the intelligence agencys evidence included photographs bank 
records a north korean passport it said suh used a memorandum he 
allegedly wrote for communist agents straw slippers from a hotel in 
pyongyang and paper on which he allegedly wrote code words for north 
korean agents 
the evidence also included notes intelligence agents said suh 
made during a meeting with north korean leader kim il sung 
outlining kims ideas for unification 
ahn ungmo deputy director of the security agency said suh ran 
for the national assembly as a member of the leading opposition 
party for peace and democracy suh did so on secret orders from 
north korea which had given him campaign funds ahn said 
suh won a seat in the national assembly under direction from 
north korea passed secrets to pyongyang and staged various 
antigovernment activities ahn said 
the leading opposition party for peace and democracy expelled suh 
as a member after he was arrested june 28 and it has accused the 
government of harassment and political sabotage for the questioning 
of party members 
the leader of the party kim daejung turned down two requests 
to be interviewed by intelligence agents saying he had nothing to 
add to the investigation that authorities cannot learn elsewhere 
suh a farmer and dissidentturnedlawmaker surrendered june 25 
after first telling party leaders he had illegally visited north 
korea in august he was arrested june 28 on charges of violating 
national security 
south korea forbids unauthorized trips to north korea 
maintaining that dialogue on unification must be conducted through 
official channels 
the case is the most serious of its kind since the peninsula was 
divided at the end of world war ii because of the alleged frequency 
of suhs contact with north korea and the political overtones 
in 1949 shortly after the new government took office some south 
korean legislators were accused of pronorth korea activities in 
the early 1970s a lawmaker was investigated for communist activity 
also monday news reports said immigration controls have been 
tightened to block foreigners from entering south korea to 
participate in a peace march aimed at unification 
about 100 foreigners including about 30 americans were expected 
to enter the country for a july 2027 international grand peace 
march for the reunification of the korean peninsula authorities 
said the march would be stopped 
immigration procedures were tightened at all ports of entry and 
police were checking hotels for marchers already suspected to be in 
south korea according to seoul newspapers 
south korean law prohibits foreigners from engaging in political 
activity and in the past those breaking the law have been detained 
and deported

business sales were virtually flat in may while 
inventories rose 07 percent the government said monday leading 
some analysts to predict further production cutbacks during the rest 
of the year 
the implication is that production is going to slow some more 
in the second half of year said economist bruce steinberg of 
merrill lynch capital markets in new york 
it could imply a small inventory correction in the second 
half said james annable an economist at the first national bank 
of chicago 
when not accompanied by increases in sales rising inventories 
often prompt manufacturers to cut back production until stockpiled 
goods are sold resulting in a loss of jobs 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots climbed to a seasonally adjusted 7769 billion in may 
after a 08 percent rise in april 
the pace of business sales on the other hand hardly moved 
rising a minuscule 002 percent to a seasonally adjusted 5179 
billion sales had risen 20 percent in april after holding steady 
in march 
the may business activity produced a slight increase in the ratio 
of inventories to sales it was 15 meaning it would take 1 months 
to exhaust inventories at the may sales pace the ratio was 149 in 
april and 151 in march 
analysts noted the buildup was most felt in the retail area 
where the economy has slowed the most as the federal reserve 
tightened credit to contain inflation inventories were up 09 
percent compared with a sales decrease of 01 percent 
im starting to wonder whether retailer inventories are getting 
out of hand said michael niemira an economist at mitsubishi bank 
in new york the numbers suggest theyre growing a little too 
fast 
the automobile industry which has seen swollen new car 
inventories already has reduced production at some factories 
commerce said auto inventories rose 09 percent in may while sales 
dropped 18 percent from april 
but even without the automobile category inventories rose 09 
percent in may 
other major inventory increases were noted at department and 
clothing stores steinberg said overall general merchandise 
inventories rose 22 percent 
all categories showed increased inventories in may however 
in addition to the 09 percent increase in the retail area 
manufacturers backlogs were up 06 percent while wholesalers 
buildup was 08 percent inventories were 81 percent above may 1988 
wholesalers registered the only sales increase in may up 05 
percent manufactuers sales fell 02 percent and retailers were 
down 01 percent sales rose 82 percent over may of last year

a review of cardinal jozsef mindszentys 
case by the communist authorities is raising hopes he will be 
declared innocent of treason and other trumpedup charges on which 
he was convicted 40 years ago 
the world watched in disbelief in 1949 when hungary subjected him 
to the kind of show trial josef stalin used so often in the soviet 
union there were allegations the roman catholic prelate was drugged 
into submission 
mindszenty was released during the uprising of 1956 and fled to 
the american legation in budapest which later became the us 
embassy he remained there for 15 years before being granted safe 
passage to rome 
the reform movement sweeping hungary already has resulted in the 
rehabilitation of imre nagy the premier executed for leading the 
uprising aginst stalinism 
church officials hope the same will be done for mindszenty who 
died in vienna in 1975 at age 83 his rehabilitation would vastly 
improve the climate for a visit to hungary by pope john paul ii 
scheduled for september 1991 
the rehabilitations have started said the rev ervin 
szepesdi chief aide to cardinal laszlo paskai current leader of 
the hungarian church 
he would not give further details a possible reflection of the 
matters sensitivity referring instead to reports in official media 
last week that the review was under way 
mindszentys case became a symbol of the cold war and religious 
persecution in the soviet bloc its resolution presents several 
difficulties including the allegations of drugging and reports that 
important documents have disappeared 
lavvenire the newspaper published by the italian bishops 
conference said thursday the long suffering of the primate of 
the hungarian church remains in the history of the country as one of 
the most grevious wounds inflicted on the nations christian 
tradition 
the cardinal was appointed to the primacy with the communist 
governments asseent but tension between church and state grew and 
he was arrested at the end of 1948 
in february 1949 mindszenty was sentenced to life in prison for 
high treason after confessing almost certainly under the effect of 
duress or drugs to most of the charges against him protests came 
from around the world 
at the us mission he lived in a thirdfloor apartment until 
the vatican worked out the departure arrangement in 1971 its 
efforts to gain his freedom were complicated by mindszentys desire 
to be cleared before leaving 
the decision of pope paul vi to remove mindszenty from the 
primacy of the hungarian church in 1974 was followed by improved 
relations between hungary and the vatican 
mindszenty regarded himself as a sacrifice to a thaw in the cold 
war writing in his memoirs he became an unwelcome guest of the 
americans because i stood in the way of the policy of detente 
last week the official news agency mti quoted paskai as saying 
in a letter to the government he believed the review of mindszentys 
unlawful conviction would increase the governments credibility 
and promote national reconciliation 
premier miklos nemeth responded by confirming that the 
hungarian government had requested the prosecutor general to review 
the penal procedure against mindszenty the agency said 
there has been no indication of how long the review would take 
about half the 106 million people in hungary are catholics but 
many no longer practice the faith

robert muthiah left his home in 
northern sri lanka and bicycled 170 miles to colombo to escape 
recruitment into a tamil militia that is supported by indian 
peacekeeping troops 
residents say the eelam peoples revolutionary liberation front 
which controls the government of the northeastern province is 
preparing for another round of fighting with rival militias by 
forcing tamils to join its ranks 
hundreds of tamil youths have fled the region claiming the group 
was picking up men from their homes shaving off their hair and 
eyebrows and forcing them to undergo training at military camps 
it is not safe for me at home any more said muthiah 25 who 
registered at a relief center set up for the tamils near colombo 
tamil groups assisted by indian peacekeeping troops have been 
cordoning off villages and searching every home for young men 
i do not want to join any movement he said i just want to 
live in peace with my family 
another tamil youth mylvaganan mathyvathanan 17 said he jumped 
off a jeep taking him to an army camp and made his way to colombo 
from his village in the northern district of jaffna he said he 
complained to indian soldiers about the forced conscription but 
they just turned away and were not interested 
at least 386 men registered last week at the center which 
provides them with food and a place to sleep hundreds of others 
have visited but have not registered because they do not want to 
reveal their identities 
the liberation front admits it is recruiting youths for a civil 
volunteer group but denies using force 
but the recruitments have been stepped up since may when a rival 
militia the liberation tigers of tamil eelam opened talks with the 
government 
the two groups have been bitter rivals since the liberation front 
accepted a 1987 peace accord aimed at ending the tamil secessionist 
war the tigers rejected the accords offer of limited autonomy and 
continued fighting for an independent tamil nation 
the accord was sponsored by neighboring india which sent in 
troops to enforce a surrender by the tamil groups the indian 
soldiers have aligned with the liberation front and hold joint 
patrols with its members to ferret out the tigers 
we have reports that the abductions are done with the 
connivance of the indian peacekeeping forces says foreign 
minister ranjan wijeratne i have taken up this matter with the 
indian high commission embassy who have said they will look into 
the charge 
indian officials in colombo deny the charge but the new delhi 
government has said it supports the liberation front government and 
views the tigers talks with colombo with suspicion 
wijeratne says also that the provincial government was not 
authorized to raise a volunteer force 
the civil volunteer force should come under the direct 
authority of the inspectorgeneral of police and recruitment 
training and issuing of arms should be done by the deputy 
inspectorgeneral of police in charge of the northern region he 
said 
both posts named by wijeratne are controlled by the federal 
government in colombo 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
live mostly on the north and east tamil militants including the 
liberation front and the tigers started fighting for an independent 
nation in 1983 claiming they were discriminated against by the 
sinhalese who form 75 percent of the population and control the 
government and the military 
at least 9000 people have been killed in the separatist war the 
victims include at least 800 indian soldiers and many tamils who 
were caught up in the fighting between the two groups

eleven years after a 400acre landfill 
loaded with radioactive and chemical wastes was closed by its 
operator dust is flying as the company tries to stop more waste 
from seeping into groundwater and a lake 
bulldozers are piling tons of dirt and clay atop the 22 burial 
trenches which residents call poison pits at us ecologys landfill 
in an effort to put a tight lid on the facility just west of town 
eventually there will be a 4footthick layer of dense clay over 65 
acres 
were trying to stop rain water from going down and carrying 
waste away from the site said mark bowen site manager were 
installing clay caps on the trenches that will cut the water seepage 
by more than half 
by eliminating water from entering the trenches we hope to 
stop the escape of waste buried in them he said 
after two decades battling the company residents of sheffield a 
town of 1000 people 60 miles north of peoria are cynical about 
claims the landfill will be stabilized unconvinced of their safety 
and weary of the fight 
they say that tritium a radioactive form of hydrogen and 
solvents pesticides and poisons escaping into underground water and 
seeping into trout lake cant be stopped by simply piling new clay 
atop the trenches the buried wastes include highly radioactive 
plutonium and uranium about 100 pounds in all 
trout lake is off limits to fishing swimming or any recreation 
because of the dump 
the dump was closed in 1978 when the state refused to allow the 
operator then called nuclear engineering co to bury waste in a 
new trench the state said tritium gas was leaking and the ground 
was too sandy to prevent wastes from migrating away from the site 
leased from the state 
the company put the keys to the gate on the table in one of the 
sheds and sent us a telegram saying we have finished our work at 
the site since you own it its yours again said clifford 
weaver a lawyer who represented the state 
the state filed a 97 million lawsuit charging the company had 
broken its 99year lease and demanding that it remove the 
radioactive wastes 
ten years of litigation produced an agreement from the company 
which became us ecology inc in 1981 to spend 8 million for 
immediate maintenance and longterm care of the facility 
a second state lawsuit demanding exhumation of chemical wastes 
remains active 
weve fought the dump for 100 years it seems said jay 
langford a pharmacy owner and member of a citizens group opposed to 
the dump they wont stop the leaking it will leak some more and 
they will buy another farm to keep it on their property 
as part of its agreement us ecology purchased a 170acre buffer 
zone around the dump 
langford said the clay cap is only a smoke screen 
they are just so deceiving they are willing to let it ruin all 
our lakes streams and water supplies who cares if they put a 
beautiful cap on it its whats underneath thats the problem 
langford said 
beautician robin hewitt said she uses bottled water because water 
from the towns well smells like rotten eggs and chlorine and is 
pure rust coming out of the faucets 
the landfill trenches hold 76 million cubic feet of buried 
wastes 
us ecology says exhumation of the waste is unnecessary would 
take 15 years and cost 500 million which would bankrupt the 
company 
the caps should be finished by the end of august and then 
well start preparing the soil seeding it and building fence 
said mark cade company spokesman 
cade said no danger is associated with the dump 
the fact is this site has never been unsafe cade said 
this is not a serious problem its a perception problem they say 
this is a horrible place but i cant find the horrible place

the cornerstone she said 
the first lady said historians know when the cornerstone was laid 
and who did it but absolutely no one knows where 
she added we decided that was one uncertainty we could live 
with the white house is currently getting a facelift that 
involves scraping off its many layers of paint and restoring the 
original stonework 
mrs bush spoke at the future site of the american school of the 
hague at this point the school is still a dusty construction site 
with concrete forms 
the inscription on the stone reads the american school of the

amsterdam its very small 
touring the museum mrs bush stopped to scrutinize the van gogh

the united states has offered to pay up to 
250000 per person to families who lost relatives when the uss 
vincennes shot down an iranian airliner in the persian gulf last 
year the state department said today 
but richard boucher a department spokesman said washington will 
only turn over the money if the tehran government names an 
appropriate intermediary to disburse the funds 
of the 290 people killed on iran air flight 655 july 3 1988 250 
were iranians 
in general the us plan calls for washington to pay the 
families of each fulltime worker 250000 while the families of 
others will receive 100000 
boucher said the united states is not bound under international 
law to compensate the victims families but former president reagan 
promised such payments would be made on humanitarian grounds 
washington has contacted officials in india italy pakistan the 
united arab emirates and yugoslavia to have them relay the offer to 
victims families in those countries although the countries have 
yet to respond boucher said the united states is confident the 
offer will be accepted 
the same offer has been communicated to the government of 
iran he said unfortunately during the past year the government 
of iran has ignored repeated efforts by the united states to obtain 
information from the families of the iranian victims 
boucher said the us government is ready to make payments to the 
families so long as the government or iran permits an appropriate 
intermediary to distribute the funds to the families an 
intermediary is necessary because the united states does not have 
diplomatic relations with tehran he said

the war on cancer has brought improved 
therapies for americas middle class and affluent but the disease is 
too often a needless death sentence for the poor the american 
cancer society president said monday 
for the 37 million americans who do not have health insurance and 
do not qualify for medicaid a cancer diagnosis usually comes when 
the disease has advanced to a stage where little can be done except 
control the pain said harold p freeman cancer society president 
the combination of cancer and poverty is indeed a lethal 
combination said freeman chief of surgery at harlem hospital in 
new york 
the chance of getting cancer and dying from it is 
disproportionately higher among poor americans regardless of 
race freeman said in introducing a report based on hearings the 
society held along with the national cancer institute and the 
centers for disease control in may and june 
he called for a new kind of war on cancer a guerrilla war to 
break the economic and cultural barriers that prevent the poor from 
getting early cancer diagnoses and adequate treatment for the 
disease 
the cancer society says that in general half of all cancer 
patients are expected to live for at least five years after 
diagnosis however only 35 percent to 40 percent of cancer patients 
who live below the poverty level can expect the same the society 
says 
the society estimates that 178000 people with cancer who might 
have been saved through early diagnosis and treatment will die this 
year freeman estimated that half or more of them are poor 
the cancer societys regional hearings found that the poor must 
make extraordinary sacrifices to pay for health care and that these 
americans find the healthcare system insensitive and intimidating 
cassandra middleton a 26yearold cancer victim from johns 
island sc who testified at one of the hearings and joined cancer 
society officials at mondays news conference summed up her 
experience with the medical community they made me feel poor i 
know i am but they made me feel it too 
middleton described the bureaucratic maze she had to navigate to 
become eligible for medicaid and other public health assistance 
only about 45 percent of those living below the poverty level are 
eligible for medicaid 
for most of the people who have slipped through the holes of the 
social safety net the hospital emergency room becomes their entry 
to the health care system but suspicion of cancer even a lump in 
the breast does not qualify as a medical emergency and poor 
patients with symptoms but not in a lifethreatening crisis 
generally are not treated freeman said 
one of the key problems he said is that cancer prevention 
efforts have failed to reach poor americans because the education 
programs are unrealistic they are not relevant and they are not 
spoken in the language of the people they are trying to reach 
the result is a belief among the poor and uneducated that a 
diagnosis of cancer is a silent death sentence freeman said 
there is a pervasive sense of fatalism in the poor and this leads 
to an overall feeling of powerlessness 
the cancer society presented the report as a national call to 
action and gave it to president bush congressional leaders and 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
for its part the cancer society said it is committing 18 
million for national demonstration programs in harlem miami and 
oakland calif to develop cancer education and detection programs 
for the poor the group recently allocated an additional 1 million 
to support local education and research activities targeted to the 
poor nationwide 
freeman said the society has made no policy recommendations to 
congress or the bush administration but he said the american 
healthcare system has to be relooked at the society may make 
specific recommendations after its national board meets in november 
he said

china denounced the seven leading industrialized 
nations monday for their gross interference in calling on 
chinese authorities to stop the crackdown on participants in 
prodemocracy protests 
instead the government made clear it plans to continue rounding 
up anyone involved in the seven weeks of protests for freedom 
democratic reform and cleaner government a report in the communist 
party newspaper the peoples daily said those who surrender will 
get lenient treatment 
all hesitation is useless it said surrendering 
thoroughly confessing and doing meritorious work is the only 
way out for all criminals 
the strongly worded message to the group of seven echoed earlier 
chinese reaction to sanctions individually imposed by some of the 
seven including the united states and france after the chinese 
army crushed the protests june 34 
the foreign ministry expressed great regret over the paris 
summits statement which it said violates the most basic 
criterion of diplomatic relations 
china absolutely cannot accept this said the statement read 
on state tv 
a frontpage editorial the peoples daily called on the group of 
seven to consider chinas global strategic importance and 
potential as a market 
the nearsighted practice of keeping china away from the world 
community may not only undermine world peace and stability but hurt 
the interests of the western countries as well it said 
the actions taken by the chinese government have in no way 
offended the west or any other country the problem arises simply 
because certain countries out of their own likes and dislikes and 
their sense of value have in a broad scope directly damaged chinas 
interests and dignity with words and deeds 
the group of seven statement it said made groundless charges 
which only represent gross interference in chinas internal 
affairs 
the seven nations the united states great britain west 
germany italy france japan and canada included their comments 
on china in a communique issued at the end of their summit 
we urge the chinese authorities to cease action against those 
who have done no more than claim their legitimate rights to 
democracy and liberty it said it also urged the world bank to 
postpone examining new loans to china 
more than 200 civilians were killed by official count in the army 
attack on protesters and supporters western intelligence sources 
said up to 3000 may have died thousands have been arrested 
nationwide and at least 12 have been executed 
the foreign ministry lodged a separate protest with france for 
having allowed chinese students in paris to march in fridays parade 
for the bicentennial of the french revolution the students carried 
a large banner reading we carry on in implied support for 
their beijing classmates 
china called the march an attack by insinuation on its 
quelling of the protests and demanded france stop interfering in 
chinas internal affairs china filed two earlier protests with 
france since june 4 for allowing several chinese fugitives to enter 
the country and not stopping a protest at its embassy in paris 
for years china crafted its own foreign policy with a heavy 
ideological content but in the past decade it has shifted to a more 
hardnosed policy based on practical interests foreign investment 
and technology are now key to its modernization program 
but the peoples daily said foreign sanctions would only 
encourage a spirit of selfreliance 
it also warned hong kong residents who try to help the mainland 
democracy movement that they should not lift a rock only to crush 
their own feet the british colony reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
in other developments the partys central disciplinary 
inspection commission issued a strong warning against corruption by 
party members in staterun factories and businesses in a 10minute 
report that opened the national television news the commission 
ordered party officials to raise the ideological quality of party 
members and impose stricter discipline 
beijing city officials announced monday that they had expelled 77 
party members since january for corruption and shanghai announced 
three expulsions 
other local governments have announced hundreds more to try to 
convince the public that the party is cleaning up its ranks

president bushs plan for cleaning up the 
nations air is unlikely to meet its goal of eliminating unhealthy 
levels of urban smog by the year 2000 the main author of a new air 
pollution report to congress said monday 
the report by the office of technology assessment which advises 
congress on scientific issues said even if all known methods of 
pollution control are used many cities will remain above federal 
limits for smogcausing ozone by the end of the century 
it said residents of the most polluted cities los angeles new 
york and houston may have to live with unhealthy levels of smog 
for another 20 years or more 
bush said last month in proposing a sweeping revision of the 1970 
clean air act that his measures would mean the vast majority of the 
approximately 100 cities currently in violation of ozone limits 
could gain compliance by 1995 the president said all cities would 
be within the limits by the end of the century 
the office of technology assessment study which was begun two 
years ago did not specifically analyze the bush proposal but 
robert friedman the reports main author told a news conference 
the administrations forecast was probably too rosy 
i dont see how theyre going to do it he said i hope we 
are wrong and they are right but i fear that will not be the case 
he said in an earlier interview that between 30 and 45 cities 
probably will still be in violation of the ozone standard by the 
year 2000 even if all available antipollution technologies are 
used among these are atlanta dallas san francisco washington 
dc boston baltimore and st louis he said 
the report did not include a complete list of cities and their 
prospects for compliance 
ozone is formed when hydrocarbons from car exhaust and other 
sources mix in sunlight with nitrogen oxides released by the burning 
of fossil fuels such as petroleum 
ozone is beneficial in the upper atmosphere where it filters the 
suns rays but closer to the ground ozone turns into choking smog 
that some scientists believe could cause permanent lung damage by 
limiting the lungs ability to ward off infection 
the ota study said that each year about 21 million people are 
exposed during outdoor exercise to ozone levels above the federal 
standard each of them for about nine hours a year on average 
about onequarter of these people live in los angeles 
though experts disagree about the level of danger that ozone 
actually poses to the population a large portion of the american 
people live in places where ozone concentrations far exceed those 
known to be completely safe the study said 
the white house is expected to unveil later this week full 
details of its clean air proposal which was announced june 12 in 
outline form draft legislation incorporating bushs proposals has 
been circulated on capitol hill in recent days 
friedman said lack of detail in the original administration plan 
made it impossible to fully explain why bush believed more gains 
against urban smog are possible than foreseen in the ota study 
the environmental protection agency said in a written response to 
the office of technology assessment study that it did not take into 
account the administrations assumption that state and local 
governments would take their own antipollution measures to 
supplement the federal measures proposed by bush 
the epa said an administration bill would include strong 
enforcement and compliance provisions to see that nonfederal 
activities are implemented and succeed 
among the most effective means of curbing ozone are reducing 
gasolines evaporation rate modifying gas station pumps to trap 
escaping vapors and tightening controls on facilities that treat 
store and dispose of hazardous wastes such as chemicals and sludge 
the ota said the cost of employing all available technologies 
nationwide would be between 44 billion and 78 billion a year by 
the mid1990s and between 88 billion and 13 billion per year a 
decade later

us marshals service director stanley morris said about 62 
percent of those sought were considered armed and dangerous but 
that all the arrests were made without a shot being fired 
stop targeted 840 fugitives arrested 456 and filed detainers on 
155 already jailed on other charges a total of 229 remain atlarge 
people get tired morris said in an interview when asked why 
the program ended before all the suspects were arrested 
eight weeks is a long time our experience is thats about 
the length of time you can run an operation like this without people

edge

officials lauded the cooperation between federal and local agencies 
of those arrested 172 were wanted for crimes in the district of 
columbia 154 in baltimore and 130 in suburban maryland and virginia

the 500 million stealth 
bomber flew for the first time today soaring above the southern 
california desert on a twohour flight aimed at keeping congress 
from scrapping historys most expensive warplane 
the b2 designed to evade enemy radar was arrayed with 
reflective material to allow test personnel to keep track of the 
plane and its two pilots 
the sinisterlooking black jet raced down an 11000foot runway 
at the secretive air force plant 42 at palmdale and lifted off at 
637 am with two f16 fighter jets giving chase through the still 
and cloudless desert sky 
it landed here at 830 am after performing test maneuvers over 
the mojave desert the plane landed perfectly on the runways center 
line at edwards where the space shuttles land after returning from 
orbit 
the batwinged bomber 69 feet long with a 172foot wingspan 
quickly rolled to a stop without a wobble or waver idled for 
several minutes and then taxied into a hangar the b2 will remain 
at edwards for further tests 
the planes landing gear remained down during the flight as is 
standard practice on test flights in case of malfunctions 
b2 test pilot bruce hinds later called the bomber a very 
nimble aircraft and said it made a rock stable landing hinds 
said the plane handled much the same way it had on a flight 
simulator and called it an enjoyable plane to fly 
the stealth bombers only previous flights have been on a 
computer flight simulation air force and northrop officials say no 
other aircraft has been tested more thoroughly without having been 
flown 
the flight was seen as vital for the future of the bomber which 
is already 18 months behind schedule at a budgeted price of 500 
million each the air force wants 132 of the planes it is the 
most expensive warplane in history 
a key congressional committee voted to withhold further funding 
until the plane proves itself in the air 
if that plane doesnt fly the debate is over senate armed 
services committee chairman sam nunn said friday it is far too 
expensive to be a stealth taxi 
as the plane took off this morning the star spangled banner 
was sung on the runway by alis clausen a member of the staff of a 
local cable tv station air force capt tess taft unfurled the stars 
and stripes which was held by a tearful linda tokish 
thousands of civilian stealth watchers gathered among the 
tumbleweeds outside the palmdale plant shouted here they come 
here they come as the great flyingwings dark shadow passed 
over great god exclaimed northrop employee les holland 
im shaking my legs are shaking it was going right over my 
head said shari cutler who came with her four children 
it feels great it feels just fantastic a lot of work has gone 
into this millions of man hours with people working seven days a 
week 24 hours a day we feel just great said air force col 
douglas kennett 
i was overcome with emotion i was so thrilled when i saw the 
wheels go up im just so excited to know that its up there now and 
i pray that it lands safely taft said 
this represents the technology of tomorrow said maj pat 
mullaney it gives us the opportunity to stress deterrence it 
represents a new generation of technology and its the way youre 
going to see airplanes look tomorrow 
the bombers maiden flight had been scheduled saturday but a low 
fuel pressure gauge reading aborted the flight 
after the flight was canceled workers checked the aircraft and 
discovered a problem in a device called the heat exchanger in the 
bombers fuel system the problem was fixed but no other details 
were available said air force lt col jerry fergeson 
the b2 is designed to carry nuclear bombs and along with the 
conventional b1 replace the air forces aging fleet of b52 
bombers that have formed part of the us nuclear deterrent since 
the 1950s 
socalled stealth technology combines advanced materials and a 
special shape to create a plane undetectable by enemy radar though 
the bomber is still being developed stealth fighters have operated 
several years

droughtreduced crops and higher market prices 
have helped cut sharply the governments investment in surplus farm 
commodities an agriculture department report showed monday 
the departments commodity credit corp had 135 billion 
invested in price support loans and actual inventories as of may 31 
that included 91 billion in loans outstanding and 44 billion in 
governmentowned commodities said the report by keith bjerke the 
cccs executive vice president 
a year earlier on may 31 1988 the ccc had a total investment 
of 231 billion including 143 billion in loans oustanding and 
88 billion in inventories 
the ccc finances various price support operations of the 
department including those for wheat feed grains rice tobacco 
cotton soybeans dairy products honey and sugar 
in the case of the major grain crops the 1988 drought reduced 
production and pushed up prices that reduced the need for price 
support loans and forfeitures which means the ccc takes over 
ownership of crops when farmers opt not to repay the loans 
when market prices are high enough its usual for farmers to pay 
off the loans and use or sell as they choose 
the farmerowned grain reserve which enables wheat and feed 
grains to be stored and kept off the market under government loan 
until prices rise enough to trigger their release consisted of 287 
million bushels of wheat valued at more than 1 billion as of may 
31 the report said 
corn and other feed grains in the reserve totaled more than 103 
billion bushels valued at 257 billion 
the total value of commodities acquired by ccc in the first eight 
months of the fiscal year that began last oct 1 was 172 billion 
the report said in the same period of 198788 ccc acquired 
products valued at 962 billion 
net losses to ccc totaled about 352 billion through may 31 the 
report said compared with a loss of more than 10 billion in the 
same eight months of 198788 the decline was mainly due to the 
smaller volume of grain moving into ccc inventories and reduced 
payments to farmers

the berlin philharmonic on monday 
mourned the death of herbert von karajan its former conductor for 
life and the salzburg festival where he was to perform this 
month held a minute of silence 
tributes abounded for the austrianborn maestro who died sunday 
of heart failure at age 81 
the berlin philharmonic which he quit in april after a stormy 
relationship for three decades said karajan had stamped his 
orchestra with his own inimitable style 
west german chancellor helmut kohl sent a telegram to karajans 
widow praising the maestro for his more than 30 years with the 
berlin philharmonic 
kohl said karajan helped continue berlins reputation as one of 
the worlds leading cultural metropolises we thank him for that 
in austria salzburg festival president albert moser called for a 
minute of silence for karajan during rehearsals and gave a brief 
speech a spokeswoman said 
karajan was to have opened this years festival july 27 with 
giuseppe verdis opera a masked ball with placido domingo 
in a statement the festival directorate said it mourned karajan 
who made a substantial mark on the festival and it had not yet 
determined who will replace him 
festival organizers confirmed reports that karajan died of heart 
failure at his home in anif outside salzburg said the spokeswoman 
who commented on condition of anonymity 
no funeral plans were announced the austria press agency 
reported it would take place in anif exclusively for family members 
but no date was given salzburg festival organizers said they could 
not yet confirm the report 
british opera director john schlesinger who had been preparing 
the verdi performance with karajan said the show will go on but 
karajan will be sorely missed 
the death of maestro von karajan is a terrible blow for all of 
us we had been working together on un ballo in maschera for more 
than a year with great enthusiasm and close collaboration 
schlesinger said from salzburg 
karajan who conducted at the salzburg festival since 1948 was 
its sole artistic director in 195660 and had been on the 
directorate since 1964 last year he resigned from the body but 
continued to conduct during this years festival 
riccardo muti musical director of la scala in milan told romes 
il messaggero newspaper in ravenna 
we have lost the most important conductor of our time the last 
great maestro of the romantic era karajan did not leave heirs but 
in reality we are all his heirs some more some less muti said 
the west german newspaper die welt said karajan was perhaps one 
of the last great aesthetes of the music scene a man with 
heightened sensitivity for a tone with color for a seamless 
transition for music that seems as if it comes from the heavens 
the widow of wilhelm furtwaengler who karajan succeeded as head 
of the berlin philharmonic said karajans death marks the end of 
an epoch in concert halls 
he was especially brilliant in conducting anton bruckner and 
richard strauss i have never heard such a brilliant don quijote 
than when he conducted it two years ago in berlin said elisabeth 
furtwaengler 
but karajans wealth love for publicity and what some viewed as 
vanity have also irritated many critics 
the london times said of karajan on monday he was the greatest 
orchestral trainer of our century and maybe of all time he was an 
egomaniac a bully and a ruthless opportunist he received far 
more adulation sold far more records made far more money than any 
other classical musician

president bush nearing the end of a 
diplomatic pilgrimage across europe declared monday that western 
resolve and the dramatic changes in the soviet bloc have made 
possible a new world free of discord between east and west 
the soviets are moving in our direction coming our way 
declared bush in a speech delivered in this historic city from which 
the pilgrims embarked on their voyage to the new world 
bush delivered the address in a centuries old church here after 
flying to amsterdam from paris and the weekend economic summit with 
the seven richest nations of the west the president was homeward 
bound tuesday after his 10day fournation trek across europe 
he said his journey through poland and hungary demonstrated anew 
that even in the europe behind the wall the dream of freedom for 
all europe has never died 
bush said the surprise letter that soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev sent the summit nations seeking to link his faltering 
economy with the west was only the latest example of the soviets 
moving in our direction coming our way 
the soviet union has nothing to fear from the reforms that are 
now unfolding in eastern europe said bush 
i want to see the soviet union chart a course that brings 
itself into the community of nations said bush speaking in the 
pieterskerk where the spiritual leader of the pilgrims john 
robinson is buried 
bush said the dream of freedom is alive today in warsaw in 
gdansk in budapest and yes across the soviet union 
the challenge we face is a very clear one we must work 
together toward the day when all of europe east and west is free 
of discord free of division he said 
bush also had tea with queen beatrix and conferred with dutch 
leaders at the hague the seat of government 
thousands of cheering dutch people lined his motorcade route 
interspersed with demonstrators decrying us policy in latin 
america and carrying signs demanding that abortions be kept legal 
stepping from his limousine and waving to the crowd bush was 
escorted by prime minister ruud lubbers into pieterskerk which 
dates to the 12th century 
the president toured an exhibit of pilgrim artifacts and received 
a partial family tree tracing his own lineage to at least two of the 
religious dissidents who lived here in the early 1600s after fleeing 
persecution in england 
today he said as in 1620 when the pilgrims left this city a 
new world lies within our reach 
the new world we seek is shaped by an idea an idea of 
universal appeal and undeniable force and that idea is democracy 
he said 
bush claimed the strength of the north atlantic treaty 
organization had kept us safe while also creating opportunities 
for change in the eastwest division 
thanks to natos strength an unity we now have the opportunity 
to move beyond containment to integrate the soviet union into the 
community of nations bush said outlining his hopes for deep cuts 
in arms levels across the continent 
our hope is that the unnatural division of europe will now come 
to an end that the europe behind the wall will join its neighbors 
to the west prosperous and free bush said on the first official 
visit to the netherlands by an american president 
bush recalled that winston churchill in a postwar speech in the 
same church had welcomed the triumph of freedom over tyranny with 
the words the great wheel has swung full circle 
half of europe emerged from the war and laid the foundations of 
free government and free enterprise that brought unparalleled 
prosperity and a life in peace and freedom said bush 
the other europe the europe behind the wall endured four 
decades of privation and hardship persecution and fear 
but now he said the great wheel is moving once more 
in poland and hungary bush said he heard new voices full of new 
hope theirs were the faces of pilgrims on a journey fixed on the 
horizon on the new world coming into view 
and they know as we do that ultimately whatever the odds 
freedom will succeed he said 
leiden was also home to the painter rembrandt and grotius the 
father of international law 
bush called it a special city for americans and a place 
whose very name has symbolized for centuries dutch determination 
in the struggle for freedom against the forces of occupation 
he said the united states and the netherlands were partners in 
an alliance of free nations that spans the ocean that the pilgrims 
crossed 
the visit was a boost for beleaguered dutch prime minister 
lubbers whose rightcenter coalition government collapsed in may 
over environmental issues and is facing elections sept 6 
the lavish praise for the dutch came against the backdrop of the 
small countrys stalwart support of us and nato defense strategy 
the netherlands overcame disarmament impulses to agree to accept 
nucleartipped us missiles in 1985 
as it turned out the missiles were never put in place the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty signed by former 
president reagan and gorbachev in 1987 eliminated the need for them

scientists are working on a safetoeat nearly 
invisible coating made from milk that could extend the shelf life of 
fruit and vegetables the agriculture department said monday 
attila e pavlath a chemist with the departments agricultural 
research service said tests are concentrating on a film based on 
casein a milk protein a small amount of vitamin c is added to help 
protect against browning 
pavlath who works at the agencys research laboratory in albany 
calif said in a report released here that small pieces of sliced 
and peeled apple dipped in the coating stayed fresh for several 
days unprotected pieces shriveled and turned brown within a few 
hours 
the scientists want to make the film thinner a process that 
might take two more years pavlath said 
films that the tongue cannot feel and the taste buds cannot 
detect also could be made from protein in soybeans corn and 
wheat the report said 
some people who like fresh produce dont necessarily want to 
spend time in their kitchen washing slicing peeling pitting and 
paring pavlath said its part of the trend toward buying food 
that is ready to use and easy to store 
a successful coating would allow more types of produce to be 
presliced and packaged such coatings may have other potential 
uses perhaps for keeping fillings in pizzas or preventing pies from 
soaking the crust 
unlike waxes on cucumbers or other edible coatings such as the 
skin on sausages new films could be modified to add flavors or 
colors to standard fare pavlath said 
one possibility he said would be fresh sliced pears protected 
with a somewhat thicker protein coating flavored with red cherries

different people remember different things about 
the democratic national convention that opened a year ago tuesday 
but everyone at least seems to remember that it happened in atlanta 
that makes officials of the georgia capital happy as they try to 
sell their city as the site for the 1994 super bowl and the 1996 
summer olympics 
there arent many physical reminders left of the fourday 
convention that nominated massachusetts gov michael dukakis as the 
partys presidential standardbearer colorful banners on light 
poles and some nicely paved sidewalks in the convention district 
but some remember the convention and dukakis speech as the high 
point of the democratic campaign 
there are very few things i have been involved in that have run 
so smoothly or so triumphantly said mayor andrew young who 
chaired atlanta 88 the nonprofit group that organized the 
convention if we could have kept running the campaign we might 
be running the white house 
atlanta 88 president bobby kahn remembers dukakis triumphant 
entry into the omni arena on the final night to the tune of neil 
diamonds coming to america but even better he recalls we 
got out of the omni on time 
that saved labor and insurance costs and helped bring the event 
in 500000 under budget atlanta 88 spent 145 million most of 
it from a special hotelmotel tax 
other memories are less pleasant and more immediate 
the the court system is still dealing with some of the 1200 
misdemeanor cases filed against antiabortion protesters who came to 
capture a share of the conventions limelight 
last week randall terry head of the antiabortion group 
operation rescue returned to atlanta on a book promotion tour and 
was arrested on warrants stemming from the protests terrys 
attorney said he thought the warrants had been vacated the activist 
was freed on bail 
also before the courts is a lawsuit against actor rob lowe 
stemming from an incident turing the roundtheclock partying that 
occupied some of the 4210 delegates 13500odd journalists and 
thousands of other hangerson convention week 
lowe is accused of seducing a teenage atlanta girl and then 
persuading her to have sex with another woman while he taped it with 
his home video camera fulton county prosecutors are considering 
criminal charges against lowe who denies wrongdoing 
bad publicity has been turned to good advantage in one case 
the uproar over the small size of the omni hundreds of 
delegates and reporters were locked out one night when fire marshals 
declared the place overcrowded added impetus to efforts to build 
the georgia dome 
the dome an enclosed stadium designed to hold 72000 people is 
to be located next door to the omni and the world congress center 
an atlanta architect was chosen last week to build it 
construction of the dome is considered essential to the citys 
bids for the 1994 super bowl and the 1996 summer olympics 
the convention put atlanta on the map again for many people said 
chamber of commerce official barry king whos been lobbying the 
international olympic committee for the games 
it proved to the world we could do it that atlanta was a 
capable city a modern town and not a burnedout cinder from 125 
years ago king said referring to civil war images

teachers will be rigorously tested on their 
specialty teaching techniques and knowledge of child development 
under a voluntary national certification system outlined monday by 
an independent panel 
with its new national credential to be offered in 29 fields 
starting in 1993 the national board for professional teaching 
standards says it hopes to dispel the myth that any modestly 
educated person with some instinct for nurturing has the requisite 
qualifications to teach 
the private group said it hopes that the system will also lead to 
improved teacher training and ultimately to bettereducated 
children 
this process will push the renewal of american education a big 
step closer to reality former north carolina gov james hunt 
chairman of the 63member board said monday in releasing the 
guidelines 
the nations 25 million teachers will need a bachelor of arts 
degree and at least three years of experience to apply for 
certification according to the new blueprint 
board president james a kelly said professions such as medicine 
and law took decades to set standards for practitioners he said the 
teacher standards board formed in 1987 will compress the process 
into five years because we want to influence the quality of the 
enormous influx of new teachers needed during the 1990s 
the new credential is expected to help draw more and better 
people into teaching and help teachers move into new roles as 
mentors curriculum specialists and other positions requiring 
expertise or extra responsibility 
certified teachers may also command better salaries but kelly 
said local authorities will have to determine that the board has 
always said we want our certificates to be recognized he said in 
an interview but its not the boards business to say how each 
school district and private school should recognize certified 
teachers 
the national board was proposed three years ago by the carnegie 
forum on education and the economy in a report called a nation 
prepared teachers for the 21st century many were skeptical that 
its mix of teachers government officials business leaders and 
higher education representatives could succeed at what they said was 
a highly controversial task with uncertain potential to improve 
education 
albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers 
and a longtime backer of national teacher certification said the 
criteria laid out monday prove the skeptics wrong 
they said it couldnt be done but we did it shanker said 
we can be proud that we have come so far 
mary futrell president of the national education association 
called the guidelines an important step down the long road toward 
developing a national teaching certificate that can be supported and 
embraced by all teachers 
the two teacher unions each have seven seats on the board and 
have been active in developing the certification process 
the board said the 29 fields for which it plans to issue 
certificates include music art foreign languages physical 
education special education vocational fields and subject areas 
such as math science social studies and english for different age 
groups 
still to be completed is an evaluation system that is 
professionally credible publicly acceptable legally defensible 
administratively feasible and economically affordable for the 
teacher candidates hunt said these assessments will be 
stateoftheart and go far beyond the pencil and paper assessments 
used for state licensing today 
among the potential assessment methods described monday were 
multiple choice tests essays interviews simulated lesson plans 
simulated parent conferences documentation of performance and 
observation by trained examiners in the workplace there will be no 
limit on the number or percentage of teachers certified 
a typical evaluation could involve asking a music teacher to 
bring a videotape of an orchestra rehearsal or asking a teacher to 
come to an assessment center to discuss and defend alternative 
instructional methods kelly said

a chinese firm monday granted an american camera 
company the right to lease 60 million square feet to third parties 
for 25 years 
the concord camera corp signed the agreement in hong kong with 
the wan kong economic development corp of baoan county 
under the unusual agreement concord based in rahway nj will 
sublease manufacturing space and supply labor to corporations which 
want to set up operations in china 
jack benun chairman of concord declined to say how much the 
deal was worth he also said his company had yet to determine how 
much it would charge for space in the planned industrial park to be 
used mostly for light industry 
the deal appears to be an attempt on chinas part to regain the 
confidence of western investors following the bloody june 34 
crackdown on a movement for freedom 
over the weekend the official china news service quoted a 
chinese official from hainan province as saying china wanted to go 
ahead with another project that also allows a foreign firm to lease 
space to foreign investors an official at the hong kong office of 
that firm kumagai gumi the japanese construction giant said 
monday the firm had no comment on the chinese report about the 
yongpu port 
in recent weeks hong kong newspapers have said conservative 
chinese officials whose have gained power as a result of the 
crackdown had criticized projects such as these the officials were 
quoted as saying the projects were tantamount to selling chinas 
sovereignty to foreigners 
to increase confidence of potential investors benun said 
concord was planning on incorporating an insurance company to 
guarantee all assets in the area he said his firm had yet to work 
out the details 
benun said his chinese partner would approve any investor as long 
as they met the environmental guidelines of baoan county 
he said he secured the deal during a visit of top officials from 
baoan county to new jersey several weeks ago the basis of the deal 
he said was concords sixyear relationship with the county 
concord began producing cameras in baoan in 1983 and has gone 
from occupying 10000 square feet of space to its current production 
facilities of 240000 square feet it employs 2000 chinese 
benun said concord makes about 4 million cameras a year 55 
percent of which are sold in the united states and 45 percent of 
which are sold in europe and asia 
benun said he did not believe the recent turmoil in china would 
affect his investment 
its our belief that with six years under our belt and with the 
local authorities having always delivered what they promised there 
should be no reason why anything should change benun said 
he said the area fields and mountains located about 15 miles 
from hong kong would be ideal for hong kong investors 
ive seen it and its as far as the eye can see he said 
its equal to 1333 football fields 
he estimated an initial investment at about 600 million but he 
said his company was not obligated to put up the full amount 
concord had 18 million in sales in 1988 and cleared a profit of 
23 million benun said

the commander of israels air force said 
monday that israel was concerned about the reported introduction of 
surfacetosurface missiles in lebanon saying it could trigger a 
dangerous new arms race 
lebanese military sources in april reported iraq gave six frog7 
missiles to christian forces as a deterrent against syria which has 
been bombarding beirut with as many as 400 shells daily 
the sovietdesigned missiles can carry a warhead of 1200 pounds 
for more than 40 miles enough to reach damascus from beirut 
maj gen avihu binnun said he was unable to confirm that frog 
missiles were in the hands of christian militias but he said even 
if they were israel would not intervene at this stage 
we have so many problems around our own borders let us not 
intervene in such a mess over there as well he said 
however the air force commander said there was concern that if 
the christians got such a weapons system other militias would 
acquire them as well ultimately posing a threat to israel that 
could prompt preemptive action 
we are worried about frog missiles in lebanon because we are 
worried about the arms race that will start up there he told 
reporters at israel air force headquarters in tel aviv 
we are not worried about the christians launching them against 
us we are worried that if the christians have them then the shiites 
would like to have them and the plo would like to have them then 
well have some that might be pointed against us 
such an arms race he said could lead to a point where we will 
have to intervene if they get into the hands of those who might 
launch them against us 
binnun noted syria had mounted a naval blockade of christian 
harbors in lebanon to prevent missiles being shipped from iraq 
which is an arch rival of syria 
there has been no official comment but israeli commentators have 
expressed growing concern that an israelsyria naval or air clash 
could occur in lebanon even though the two countries have a shared 
interest in keeping iraqi missiles out of beirut 
saying a clash could result if the israeli navys freedom of 
action was restricted the maariv newspaper said in an editorial 
last week this is a dangerous and sensitive political and military 
situation that compells the israeli government to take a stand and 
perhaps action 
binnun 48 an exfighter pilot who fought in the 1967 and 1973 
middle east wars defended israeli air raids in lebanon which often 
result in civilian casualties 
if we had not hit plo bases then we would have them much more 
often on our northern border binnun said 
he said the air force never operated on the basis of a single 
intelligence source in selecting a target and that several agencies 
had to approve each strike also he added a final ok was obtained 
from the highest possible level presumably the prime minister 
or defense minister 
in addition pilots risked their lives and aircraft by flying low 
and limited the number of bombs they dropped so that the possibilty 
of hitting civilians would be lessened 
i believe that no air force that i know in the world would have 
taken so many precautions against hitting civilians he said 
we are really very sorry about every one who is being injured 
or who dies in any attack who is innocent but they guerrillas use 
the civilians to hide behind and we cannot stop fighting them 
because of that binnun said 
in eight air raids this year most against plo targets israeli 
forces killed eight people and wounded 67 according to reports from 
lebanon in 1988 128 people died and 356 were wounded in 25 air 
raids some victims were civilians but no breakdown was available

portauprince haiti ap haitis most popular radio station 
went back on the air monday resuming regular broadcasts that were 
interrupted for three weeks by strikers who alleged a shift in the 
stations political orientation 
the director of the roman catholic station radio soleil the rev 
arnaux chery hired a new staff to replace employees who were fired 
or went on strike june 26 
it makes me laugh when people say radio soleil is all 
through chery told listeners monday morning 
regular live broadcasts of religious and news programs had been 
replaced by music and prerecorded programs since the strike began 
strikers had protested the firing of the program director and an 
alleged conservative shift in orientation 
the station has encouraged the poor to fight social injustice 
and it played a crucial role in the downfall of the duvalier 
dictatorship in 1986 
but since april haitis conservative conference of catholic 
bishops began firing station employees including some of the most 
popular reporters it appointed chery as station director in an 
apparent move to check the influence of radical priests and 
employees 
in several declarations the bishops accused the fired staffers 
of insubordination and reaffirmed the goal of radio soleil to 
evangelize through education information and entertainment 
the haitian press club on july 5 protested the firing of news 
editor venel ramarais and said the moves were part of a general 
plan to destabilize the haitian press 
during the last months of dictator jeanclaude duvaliers rule 
radio soleil was the only station broadcasting news duvalier fled 
to exile in france in february 1986

prime minister rajiv gandhi blamed sri 
lankas president monday for the stalemate on the withdrawal of 
indian troops from the island nation 
gandhi said president ranasinghe premadasa has not responded to 
an indian proposal for discussions on drawing up a timetable for the 
departure of an estimated 40000 troops 
the troops were sent sent to disarm tamil guerrillas under a 1987 
peace plan designed to give the minority group limited autonomy 
he has refused to talk gandhi said upon his return from a 
sixday visit to pakistan the soviet union and france 
an indian government spokesman said that in sri lanka over the 
weekend tamil guerrillas killed seven indian soldiers and two other 
clashes left three guerrillas and 10 civilians dead 
such clashes previously were routinely reported in sri lanka but 
premadasas government imposed censorship july 6 citing security 
concerns that coincided with a growing estrangement with india 
premadasa has demanded that the indian soldiers in his country 
withdraw by july 29 the second anniversary of a peace pact that 
dispatched the force 
gandhi has said such a quick withdrawal could spawn even more 
violence in sri lanka at least 9000 people including nearly 1000 
indian soldiers have been killed in the tamil separatist war that 
started in 1983 with attacks on the sinhalesedominated government 
and sinhalese civilians 
the indian troops were invited to sri lanka by premadasas 
predecessor president junius r jayewardene who signed the 1987 
peace accord 
premadasa who took office in january opened talks this summer 
with the most powerful tamil guerrilla group the liberation tigers 
of tamil eeelam he subsequently called for a speedy indian 
withdrawal 
premadasa is sinhalese like 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people tamils who comprise 18 percent say they face sinhalese 
discrimination in jobs education and use of the sinhala language

syrian gunboats seized a ship carrying 
vegetables to the blockaded christian enclave monday and escorted it 
to the syriancontrolled port of tripoli in north lebanon a 
military spokesman said 
syrian and christian gunners dueled with tank and howitzer fire 
in and around the capital and israeliallied militiamen shelled 
palestinian guerrilla positions in south lebanon 
a spokesman for christian army commander gen michel aoun said 
the syrian gunboat intercepted the vessel 15 miles off the christian 
port of jounieh 12 miles north of beirut tripoli lies 50 miles 
north of the capital 
the spokesman identified the seized ship only as the peterm he 
said he had no information on its nationality owners or tonnage 
the syrian navy previously stopped several cargo vessels headed 
for the beleaguered enclave apparently to search them for arms the 
ships were all allowed to continue on course the spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity 
artillery explosions jolted both sides of divided beirut as the 
syrian army and aouns mainly christian troops continued a 
confrontation that dragged on with no solution in sight 
thousands of civilians huddled in basements and underground 
shelters as howitzer mortar and tank fire showered the city syrian 
gunners enforced a blockade of the 310squaremile christian 
enclave home to 1 million people and christian forces fired back 
police reported one person killed and 15 wounded raising the 
overall toll to 419 killed and 1688 wounded since the shelling 
began march 8 
in baghdad iraqi president saddam hussein blamed syria for 
failing to end the 14yearold civil war which has killed more than 
150000 people syria backs the rival moslem cabinet of salim hoss 
that has existed since aoun became head of a christian cabinet last 
september 
it is crystal clear that the syrian regime is the main party 
responsible for the destruction of lebanon and the dispersion of its 
people he said in a speech marking the 21st anniversary of the 
baath socialist partys rise to power in iraq syria is ruled by a 
rival faction of the party 
he reiterated his support for aoun in the current fighting 
saying iraq remains committed to saving lebanon from this syrian 
tyranny and oppression 
the syrians have demanded a ban on iraqi arms shipments to aouns 
army and the removal of sovietdesigned frog7 missiles they claim 
aoun has acquired from iraq with their range of nearly 45 miles 
they are capable of hitting the syrian capital damascus 
police said gunners of the south lebanon army militia shelled 
newly established palestinian positions in the hills of baslaya six 
miles east of sidon port no casualties were reported 
maj gen antoine lahd commander of the 2500strong militia 
said on the voice of the south radio that he would shell sidons 
refugee camps of meih meih and ein elhelweh if guerrillas do not 
withdraw from the baslaya area no deadline was set 
the syrians have maintained the siege on the christian sector 
despite repeated calls by the arab league for a ceasefire and an 
end to the blockades 
the siege started one week after aoun blockaded illegal ports run 
by syrianbacked moslem militias south of beirut to recoup 100 
million in customs dues lost annually 
druse warlord walid jumblatt a staunch syrian ally retaliated 
by shelling the christian enclave syrian troops later joined the 
bombardment sealed off the enclaves land exits and blockaded its 
sea outlets with artillery fire 
syria keeps 40000 soliders in lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate from the arab league the christians with 20000 troops 
say the syrians betrayed their mandate by siding with the moslems in 
the civil war and should leave

the 5yearold girl who lost her left hand 
when a bomb exploded at a k mart store is learning to make necklaces 
and hair bows with an artificial hand her mother says 
the hightech prosthetic hand came as an early birthday present 
for erin bower who turns 6 on tuesday 
erin received the electrically powered hand at medical center 
prosthetics in houston last week and is participating in a 
threeweek training program to help her use it 
i dont think shell ever forget this birthday its because of 
her hand she loves her hand erins mother maureen said in a 
telephone interview with the indianapolis star 
mrs bower planned a birthday celebration for erin who was 
injured april 17 when a bomb went off as she picked up a package of 
toothpaste at the k mart store in castleton the case remains under 
investigation 
mrs bower said that when erin put on her electrically powered 
hand for the first time she said mommy i wish i could have my 
other hand back 
i said erin i do too mrs bower recalled she said 
its too bad we just cant grow one i told her i wish we could 
but we cant then erin said well this arm isnt bad i like 
this arm too 
erin undergoes two hours of therapy a day to learn how to use the 
hand which is activated by nerve impulses in erins left arm the 
electrical current released by those muscles is picked up by 
electrodes in the artificial hand causing it to move as erin 
desires 
mrs bower said the therapy has been fun for her daughter they 
know she loves artsandcrafty kind of things shes made bead 
necklaces shes made hair bows so shell learn to tie shes 
played cards they have a bow and arrow with a plunger at the end 
and shes learned to do that 
mrs bower has been told it will be at least six months before 
erin starts using her artificial hand with the same confidence and 
reflexes as the old one 
she said the training program has also helped her daughter 
mentally because she sees other children who have lost limbs

norway said monday the soviet union failed to 
report a mishap on a nuclearpowered submarine and that its late 
account did not respond to norways concern about radiation 
soviet defense minister dmitri yazov said norwegian observers 
were mistaken in reporting a fire aboard the submarine sunday in the 
barents sea east of norway according to the soviet news agency tass 
it quoted yazov as saying there was a short circuit in a battery 
cell in the vessels nuclear power system that forced the sub to 
surface and switch to auxiliary power 
its diesel engines were fired and produced the exhaust yazov 
said there were no accidents or other emergencies 
there have been two accidents involving soviet nuclearpowered 
submarines near norways coast since april with one claiming 42 
lives and the norwegians were angry about the soviet response in 
the third incident 
whether there was smoke from a fire or from a diesel engine is 
really beside the point said foreign ministry spokesman j bjoern 
kanavin our main concern was danger of radiation 
the soviets have indirectly confirmed that there was a problem 
with the reactor and in that kind of situation we want to be 
informed 
norways ntb news agency said that after the norwegian observers 
reported trouble aboard the alphaclass submarine soviet suthorities 
told the foreign ministry there was no threat of radiation 
preliminary norwegian tests showed no signs of contamination 
norwegian officials said the submarine on monday reached a base 
of the soviets northern fleet base on the kola pennisula under its 
own power 
defense ministry spokesman arild isegg said norway accepted 
yazovs explanation on the origin of the smoke 
it may sound plausible that the smoke came from a diesel motor 
starting up but we wonder why they didnt just tell us that from 
the beginning isegg said 
the soviets initially denied there was anything wrong with any of 
its submarines 
foreign minister thorvald stoltenberg told reporters sunday the 
soviet delay in advising norway of the mishap is unacceptable 
he also used that phrase when the the soviets did not report a a 
fire aboard an echo iiclass sub that was 70 miles off norways 
coast in the norwegian sea no casualties were reported in that 
accident 
a soviet mikeclass submarine caught fire and sank april 7 in the 
norwegian sea and 42 crewmen perished 
on sunday a norwegian vessel spotted smoke from a soviet sub and 
reported the vessel was 75 miles east of the norwegian coast in the 
barents sea and 30 miles north of soviet territorial waters 
defense ministry officials in oslo said the smoke could indicate 
a fire stoltenberg summoned the soviet ambassador immediately to 
show the seriousness with which norway viewed the incident 
kanavin said as a diplomatic question i dont think this will 
be pursued much further in the short term but in the long term it 
stresses the need for mutual warnings 
he said norway is preparing a proposed treaty to present to the 
soviets that would require the two nations to inform each other of 
military accidents the soviets recently signed such agreements with 
the united states britain france and west germany 
kanavin said norway was justified in its sharp reaction to the 
initial soviet silence 
the submarine came up to the surface it was being towed and 
any observer would have to believe it was involved in an accident 
he said we had to react quickly especially since there have 
recently been two extremely serious accidents of which we were not 
warned

a 60 million star wars experiment was praised 
by its managers monday as a major achievement in advancing plans 
for a spacebased missile shield but they said congressional budget 
cuts raise questions about the systems future 
the experiment launched over white sands missile range in new 
mexico on thursday tested how a neutral particle beam accelerator 
would work in space it was the first time such a beam of atomic 
particles was fired into the heavens 
the test known as bear or beam experiment aboard rocket was 
considered a primary step in pentagons research into the lasers 
beam accelerators and other futuristic weapons which would be 
designed to shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the united states 
or its allies 
the strategic defense initiative as star wars is formally 
called would make use of particle beams as a potential antimissile 
weapon a beam would determine whether an object is a decoy or an 
enemy warhead and could be used to disable a missile 
last weeks experiment involved lifting into space just for a 
few minutes a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small aires 
rocket before the rocket returned to earth the accelerator was 
turned on and scientists collected data on how it worked and how the 
particle beams moved 
at a news conference monday the experiments managers declared 
the test a success displaying a fuzzy black and white video tape of 
the bright pulsing beam as it emerged from the rocket 
air force col thomas meyer head of the sdi organizations 
office of directed energy said the experiment showed that the 
complex equipment needed to produce the beam could be made in a 
compact way survive being shot into space and function well 
it is a major achievement both in technology and 
engineering meyer said 
he said the experiment demonstrates the promise of sdi that 
we have talked about all along 
in the laboratory the equipment used for ground experiments of 
the system would fill an averagesize house while the payload 
aboard the rocket was about 24 feet in length and 3 feet in 
diameter 
the director said the programs designers and scientists also 
wanted to test how the beam acted in space and how space affected it 
all experiment objectives were succesfully achieved he 
said 
meyer asked how long it will take before the system could become 
a fullfledged weapon in space indicated that budget cuts are more 
of a problem than technical difficulties 
the real issue is what is the funding for sdi meyer said 
its difficult for me to tell you when well have a weapon in 
space without a clear definition of what our future funding is and 
its continuing to be up in the air 
on capitol hill rep les aspin chairman of the house armed 
services committee said a number of programs have yet to go in 
terms of proving and particle beams is one 
i have not seen the briefing my reaction is skepticism to say 
that its all fixed he added 
meyer called the elements of last weeks experiment 
ontheshelf hardware but that some engineering problems still 
need to be worked out 
it only takes the money to put it together and thats when 
well get the weapon he said 
army lt col warren higgins a former manager of the bear 
program also at the briefing disputed the notion that the tests 
were in conflict with the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
critics of the star wars program say the treaty puts severe 
limits on testing and deployment of a spacebased defense 
we have a nonlethal beam we had no target higgins said 
adding that the experiments have been cleared as 
treatycompliant 
defense secretary dick cheney has battled congressional budget 
cuts in the spacebased antimissile defense 
the house armed services committee has approved a 35 billion 
budget for sdi compared with the 46 billion president bush 
proposed the senate armed services committee reduced the 
administrations request to 45 billion

senior officials flew to siberia and met with coal 
miners monday in an effort to end the soviet unions biggest strike 
which is spreading to the main coal fields and threatens to cripple 
industry 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov said the special commission met with a 
new regional strike committee that demands a greater voice for 
miners in running the industry in western siberia 2100 miles east 
of moscow 
state television said eight mines had been struck in the 
ukraines donetsk basin the main coal region 1450 miles south of 
moscow the official news agency tass said more than 2000 miners 
were striking at six mines in makayevka adjacent to the 
administrative center of donetsk 
tass said the donetsk miners demands were fewer than those in 
western siberia more rapid reduction in the bureaucracy running the 
mines longer vacations and improved housing 
in remarks to the soviet legislature before reports about the 
donetsk strikes ryzhkov said 110000 miners and sympathizers were 
striking in the kuznetsk basin the nations secondranking coal 
production area 
politburo member nikolai n slyunkov led the moscow delegation 
which tass said conferred with miners in kemerovo and then with a 
strike committee in prokopievsk 
mines in both cities and seven others are involved in the 
weekold strike each city has two representatives on the committee 
which was formed late sunday night said committee spokesman valery 
serdtsev 
in the first kremlin comment on the strike ryzhkov said it 
threatened production at some metallurgical and power plants 
weekend press reports said coal production had been cut by 1 
million tons and a coal shortage had interrupted work at the 
magnitka steel complex in the ural mountains 
ryzhkov said in televised remarks to the legislature that he and 
president mikhail s gorbachev sent a telegram to the miners sunday 
urging them to return to work and promising to address their 
grievances 
he said any decisions made in kuznetsk also would affect donetsk 
miners the premier said he opposed using force because violence 
would only make things worse and noted that the legislators were 
asked last month to draft a law on strikes and collective 
bargaining tass reported 
ryzhkov also criticized regional authorities in the kuznetsk 
basin for failing to meet the miners needs he responded to a 
speech by viktor medikov a local representative who said miners 
were tired of working hard for few benefits 
soviet law does not forbid strikes but they were suppressed 
before gorbachev gained power in march 1985 
the strike apparently is the largest in the soviet union since 
the bolshevik revolution of 1917 and the civil war and turbulence 
that followed 
official soviet histories do not mention any strikes since then 
and underground reports speak only of sporadic work stoppages 
neither as widespread or prolonged as the mine strike 
slyunkovs commission was instructed to study what ryzhkov 
described as social problems in the kuznetsk basin and prepare a 
plan for economic development of the region tass said 
demands by the miners include higher wages better food housing 
and working conditions and a greater role in running the industry 
local party government officials were not included on the strike 
committee but press reports said they declared support for greater 
autonomy from the coal mining ministry which runs the mines from 
moscow and controls many social services in the coal basin 
on the special commission with slyunkov were coal mining minister 
mikhail i shchadov stephan a shalayev chairman of the allunion 
council of trade unions and deputy premier lev a voronin chairman 
of the state committee for material and technical supply which 
oversees industry 
serdtsev the kuznetsk strike committee spokesman and the 
communist party daily newspaper pravda said miners were divided 
about whether to extend the strike to other enterprises in the 
region or to stop delivery of coal to plants outside the area 
the strike committee in prokopievsk decided to stop the 
shipment of fuel to users which will in turn affect the countrys 
steel workers pravda said in a dispatch from the region 
it added however that strikers from the regional administrative 
center kemerovo wanted to continue shipping coal that had been mined 
the coal miners are showing restraint and discretion and not 
yielding to inflammatory demands that the enterprises of other 
sectors be asked to join the strike the paper declared but press 
reports sunday said workers at 17 nonmining enterprises in the town 
of kiselevsk had struck in solidarity

industry minister ariel sharon a former defense 
minister who favors tougher action against the palestinian uprising 
said monday the israelis must eliminate yasser arafat if they 
want peace 
in an earlier threat against the plo chairman sharon said jan 
28 there will be no peace as long as arafat lives 
israeli soldiers wounded 13 palestinians during confrontations in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip arab hospital officials 
reported at least 565 palestinians and 36 israelis have been killed 
in the 19monthold uprising in the occupied lands and more than 
8000 palestinians have been wounded 
also monday the underground palestinian popular army alleged 
university professor sari nusseibeh suggested as a possible 
palestinian negotiator with israel had embezzling funds from the 
uprising and gone abroad with help from the israeli security service 
sharon toured the golan heights captured from syria in 1967 and 
renewed his demands for strong measures to end the palestinian 
revolt which he called a different kind of war against israel 
we have to stop using slogans dishing out promises and handing 
out tranquilizers he told reporters the most important thing 
is to restore law and order to bring an end to terror and 
violence 
the government must eliminate the heads of the terrorist 
organizations first of all arafat or there is no chance for 
peace he declared 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said he 
had not seen the complete text of sharons remarks but added i 
point out that us policy is to support a deescalation of violence 
in the middle east not an escalation of violence if true as 
reported these remarks would obviously not help in that process 
sharon 61 was defense minister and directed israels 1982 
invasion of lebanon with the stated aim of driving palestine 
liberation organization guerrillas out of the country 
he resigned in 1983 after a commission found him indirectly 
responsible for the massacre of palestinians in beirut refugee camps 
by lebanese christian militia allies of israel 
earlier this month sharon led a rebellion in the conservative 
likud bloc that forced prime minister yitzhak shamir to accept harsh 
conditions for his plan of discussing peace with the palestinians 
in response the centerleft labor party threatened to leave the 
cabinet creating a crisis in the coalition government 
motta gur a labor minister said monday of sharons latest 
statements in talking sharon is most effective as defense 
minister he led us to a most unnecessary war although we were 
closer than ever to arafat in beirut sharon did not harm arafat 
did not eliminate terrorism did not resolve the palestinian problem 
one needs extraordinary audacity to make all these claims 
gur said in his comments on israel radio 
palestinians in the occupied lands observed a general strike 
monday to protest alleged harsh conditions in israeli prisons where 
the army says more than 8600 palestinians are held on suspicion of 
security offenses 
soldiers blew up the homes of two palestinian youths suspected of 
fatally stabbing a 64yearold israeli building contractor zalman 
yosef schlein on friday the army reported 
the two confessed to planning and carrying out the murder with 
a nationalist motive the army said in a statement about the 
destruction of the houses in gaza citys shajaiya district 
nahed yusef radwan gundiah and mohammed mahmud ayed hamdiya also 
said they belonged to groups associated with fatah the main plo 
guerrilla group led by arafat the army said 
a leaflet issued by the palestinian popular army an umbrella 
name for loosely organized squads of militants declared that 
nusseibeh has secretly left the country with the help of the 
zionist shin bet after it was discovered large sums of money given 
to him to be distributed to the popular armies and strike forces 
were lost on the way 
it said the professor at bir zeit university adores fancy 
parties and loves to conduct palestinian struggle from fancy 
hotels 
nusseibeh was named in recent israeli court documents as a 
paymaster of the uprising responsible for distributing plo funds 
and publishing uprising literature he has not been charged 
friends said he was abroad on vacation and could not be reached

president daniel ortega said monday the 
united states has an intransigent hegemonic imperialist 
attitude toward latin america and the rest of the third world 
on the 10th anniversary of the day the late president anastasio 
somoza fled nicaragua ortega declared that washington is not 
interested in democracy so much as in domesticating the peoples of 
latin america and the caribbean 
he addressed a symposium called democracy and revolution 
commemorating what the sandinista government calls the day of joy 
july 17 1979 when somoza fled and his familys 42yearold dynasty 
ended the guerrillas entered managua two days later 
festivities for the revolutions 10th anniversary have been 
lowkey and no heads of state are expected most of the observances 
are cultural events 
during a speech to the symposium that lasted just 10 minutes 
short of two hours ortega mentioned prominent americans who had not 
accepted invitations to attend 
among them were former president jimmy carter former un 
ambassador jeane j kirkpatrick and elliot abrams former assistant 
secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
mrs kirkpatrick and abrams both of whom served president ronald 
reagan are known for strong opposition to the leftist sandinistas 
and support for the contras rebels who fought ortegas government 
ortega said nicaragua has more democracy than the united states 
because the sandinistas have increased literacy lowered infant 
mortality improved health services and distributed land to 
peasants the revolution means the attainment of democracy he 
said 
the president said more than 120000 peasant families have 
benefited from land distribution and the number of families in farm 
cooperatives has grown to 76715 ortega said the number of labor 
unions has increased from 163 before the revolution to 873 
representing 28 percent of workers 
he criticized president bush for concerning himself with the 
problems of hungary and poland when he has so many problems in latin 
america ortega described central america and the caribbean as 
explosive territories 
washington is not interested in helping solve the economic 
problems of latin america because there is no vision there is an 
underestimation of our nations and their problems he said 
bushs visits to poland and hungary exhibited a lack of interest 
in latin america ortega said and urged latin americans to unite in 
demanding a change in the us attitude toward their problems 
its better to collide with us policy now than face 
revolutionary struggles tomorrow he said 
nicaragua which has 3 million people is in an economic crisis 
that has made it one of the worlds poorest nations according to a 
study by a us economist hired by the sandinista government sweden 
financed the study 
last week ortega said he was willing to talk with the opposition 
about more changes in electoral and media laws the opposition has 
said the new rules still gave the sandinistas an unfair advantage 
general elections are scheduled for feb 25

communist leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
met with solidarity lawmakers for six hours monday and tried to 
persuade them to support him for president 
authorities as expected announced that the national assembly 
will convene wednesday to elect the president solidarity said its 
senators and deputies will meet tuesday to consider their votes 
jaruzelski has the support of his communist party and its ally 
the united peasant party but he has said he doesnt want to be 
elected without backing from the opposition 
it remained unclear if jaruzelski would allow his name to be 
placed in nomination 
the president is to be chosen by a majority of the national 
assembly the 100member senate and 460member sejm meeting in a 
joint session 
because of its overwhelming victories in the june 4 and june 18 
elections solidarity controls 259 of the 560 seats or 46 percent 
the legislators from the independent union movement asked scores 
of questions at the closeddoor meeting with jaruzelski at the sejm 
a small contingent from the anticommunist confederation for an 
independent poland demonstrated outside the bulding one of their 
banners read jaruzelski really must go police did not 
interfere 
sen karol modzelewski of wroclaw speaking for the solidarity 
lawmakers told reporters the meeting was difficult for both sides 
for several reasons but there is no doubt it is an event of high 
rank 
jaruzelski told the communist partys central committee on june 
30 that he did not want to run for president and recommended 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak for the position 
but the party asked jaruzelski to reconsider 
its still not clear what decision he will make said 
modzelewski 
the senator reported jaruzelski said he would step down as 
communist party leader if elected president he said there is no 
doubt that the two posts are not to be combined modzelewski said 
kiszczak also attended mondays meeting but solidarity lawmakers 
who participated said most of the discussion focused on jaruzelskis 
possible candidacy 
they said jaruzelski gave a speech and then answered questions 
some indicated they did not like the generals responses 
its the same thing hes been saying for years said jozef 
slisz leader of the independent farmers union rural solidarity and 
deputy speaker of the senate 
under a revamped constitution the president is to serve up to 
two sixyear terms and control polands military and foreign 
relations he also will nominate the prime minister who is to put 
together the next government 
on friday solidarity leader lech walesa said he would cooperate 
with jaruzelski if he is elected he also said polands domestic and 
international situation requires that the president come from within 
the communist coalition 
but modzelewski said walesas statement did not mean the 
solidarity lawmakers were bound to vote for jaruzelski 
it is not a habit of parliamentary democracy that an opposition 
votes the same way as the government majority he said but he 
addeed that even if the opposition votes against jaruzelski 
mondays meeting was important as an attempt at opening a certain 
dialogue which is very difficult but necessary 
according to at least one parliamentary leader there are fears 
that a noncommunist president would provoke a dangerous reaction 
from hardliners inside poland or from other countries in the soviet 
bloc 
president bush praised jaruzelski during his trip to poland july 
811 and that is considered to have eased opposition to jaruzelski 
who imposed martial law to crush solidarity in december 1981 
solidarity was restored to legal status april 17 
in a concession to the communist coalition monday members of the 
citizens parliamentary club as the solidarity lawmakers call 
themselves agreed the balloting for president should be open the 
opposition previously had favored a secret ballot 
the communist coalition wants an open ballot to make it easier to 
uphold party discipline

afghan soldiers captured a base 
overlooking the guerrillacontrolled town of gaziabad near the 
pakistani border and killed at least 68 insurgents in another 
offensive officials said monday 
the government said it must have a formal letter of request from 
the united states before it could release an american photographer 
captured last month after entering the country with guerrillas 
prime minister rajiv gandhi of india said he had given soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev proposals from the united nations for 
ending the 11yearold war between the sovietsponsored government 
and moslem guerrillas gandhi returned to new delhi from a sixday 
trip to france the soviet union and pakistan 
mohammad nabi amani spokesman for the afghan foreign ministry 
said at least 68 guerrillas had been killed since sunday in a 
government offensive around surkdewar 75 miles southeast of kabul 
amani did not give details of either offensive and no 
independent confirmation of the government claims was available 
after gaziabad amani said the army would aim for torkham 
believed to be the last guerrilla outpost in the east gaziabad is 
100 miles east of kabul about 20 miles from pakistan and torkham 
is 6 miles from the border 
the seven main rebel groups fighting to overthrow the communist 
government are based in pakistan 
for every step we take now we are consolidating the last three 
steps we have taken amani said our eventual aim is to march 
toward torkham and free our territory from our opponents 
gaziabad has three large orange and olive farms that serve as 
bases for the usbacked guerrillas who began fighting after a 
communist coup in april 1978 
guerrillas have controlled the area since before the soviet union 
sent soldiers to afghanistan in december 1979 soviet military 
forces completed a unmediated withdrawal feb 15 
american photographer tony obrien 43 was arrested june 8 at a 
guerrilla hideout in kabul while on assignment for timelife 
although the government has decided in principle to free him 
amani said we will need a letter from the american government 
asking us to release mr obrien we hope the american consular 
officer who is in town is carrying such a letter which should also 
authorize her as the representative of the american government 
renny smith from the us embassy in new delhi who arrived 
sunday to oversee the release would not comment on the afghan 
demand i was told everything was ok in fact i have booked 
myself to return on tuesday she said 
gandhi did not give details of the un proposals he passed to 
gorbachev but described them as incomprehensive and inadequate he 
said gorbachevs reaction was similar 
india a soviet ally of long standing was the only noncommunist 
country to recognize the afghan government after the coup in 1978

the house ethics committee will consider 
pursuing a complaint against republican whip newt gingrich the 
fiercely partisan conservative whose accusations sparked the panels 
investigation of speaker jim wright sources said monday 
the committee could vote thursday its first scheduled meeting 
since wright resigned from the house last month to begin a 
preliminary inquiry into gingrichs conduct the inquiry according 
to the committee source will center on a partnership formed to 
promote a book written by the georgia lawmaker his wife and a third 
person sources said 
well probably be taking up gingrich and not anything else 
said one committee source insisting on anonymity 
the ranking republican on the committee rep john t myers of 
indiana said he presumed the gingrich case would be on the agenda 
because its one of the things we have not dealt with 
rep bill alexander dark filed a 10count complaint in april 
accusing gingrich of violating several house rules by the formation 
of the cos limited partnership twentyone investors put up 5000 
each in an unusual arrangement to promote the book window of 
opportunity 
gingrich has denied any wrongdoing in the book promotion 
spokeswoman sheila ward said gingrich was aware of the committee 
meeting but has received no formal notification of any action on 
alexanders complaint 
according to the complaint the investors money could be 
construed as income to gingrich a violation of limitations on 
outside earnings applicable to house members 
the complaint also said the more than 100000 raised could 
constitute a gift to gingrich from those with a direct interest in 
legislation house rules prohibit members from keeping gifts of more 
than 100 from anyone with such a direct interest 
alexander alleges the money could be considered campaign 
contributions subject to reporting obligations and restrictions 
under campaign financing laws if so alexander said the investment 
money may have exceeded contribution limits and may not have been 
properly reported 
gingrich said in april that none of the investors received 
unusual or extraordinary personal help from him in their 
dealings with the federal government but he acknowledged that some 
of the investors had a direct interest in legislation and that he 
had handled routine requests from some of them 
he contended that the 5000 each investor gave to the 
partnership does not constitute a gift 
under rules of the committee on standards of official conduct 
the formal name of the ethics committee the panel shall conduct a 
preliminary inquiry if members believe a complaint merits further 
action gingrich would have an opportunity to respond to the 
allegations 
gingrich initiated the investigation that led to the panel 
charging wright with 69 rules violations that led to the texas 
democrats decision to give up his speakership and resign from the 
house 
wrights alleged violations including charges that bulk sales of 
a book he wrote violated outside earning limits and that he received 
gifts from a business associate with a direct interest in 
legislation

the united states in 1987 this made the vessels eligible for us 
military protection without the complication of treaties or other 
governmenttogovernment agreements during the iraniraq war when 
iranian forces were attacking shipping to and from kuwait which 
supported iraq and iraqi forces were attacking irans tanker 
traffic 
the united states was anxious to keep kuwait from carrying out a 
threat to turn to the soviet union for military help 
at the peak of the effort the us navy had 27 warships in the 
gulf other western naval forces brought the total to more than 80 
with the end of the war those forces were reduced the us 
contingent dropping to 10 in april of this year 
kuwait transferred six of the tankers back to its own flag in 
april may and june of this year but five still were flying the 
stars and stripes 
at the request of the defense department the coast guard waived 
most of the requirement that all crew members aboard usflagged 
vessels be us citizens leaving only the master and the radio 
operator subject to the requirement 
but the aficio maritime committee said no waiver was granted 
from us laws requiring payment of at least 335 per hour 
an inspection team from the international transport workers 
federation an international grouping of union discovered on 
boarding three of the 11 tankers in rotterdam the netherlands in 
may that seamen were paid less than 2 per hour 
the aflcio announcement quoted gertjan harmsen one of the 
rotterdam inspectors as saying crewmen were reluctant to complain 
for fear of being thrown off the ship or blacklisted in the future

children who werent alive when man first landed 
on the moon got a chance to guide another spacecraft to a lunar 
landing monday at the challenger centers mock mission control 
aided by nine flight controllers who were in nasas mission 
control during apollo 11s historic july 1969 landing the youths 
talked through headsets and completed checklists before giving the 
goahead for the mock landing 
while the 15 students worked in mission control another group of 
children were flying in a simulator at a second challenger 
center in greenbelt md accompanying those children was former 
astronaut michael collins who circled the moon in apollo 11s 
command module while neil armstrong and edwin buzz aldrin landed 
in the lunar module 
i learned what it really feels like and what you have to do to 
communicate with people up there its really kind of hard said 
trina jones 11 who will attend houstons lanier middle school this 
fall 
i was afraid i would mess up she added 
the simulation marked the first time that students from the two 
challenger centers were able to communicate with each other the 
facility in houston was the first center opening in august 1988 
the centers built as a memorial to the seven astronauts who died 
in the explosion of the space shuttle challenger offer youngsters a 
chance to learn by participating in simulated missions the two 
centers are the first of a planned network of simulators 
for about 30 minutes the students sat behind their control 
consoles along with the veteran flight controllers the mostly 
fourth fifth and sixthgraders also watched three television 
monitors above which showed their counterparts working at the other 
center and television footage taken when the real lunar module 
approached the moon 
shortly before the landing gene kranz chief flight controller 
for the touchdown two decades ago asked all the controllers if they 
were go nogo for a landing they all gave their ok 
soon a voice from greenbelt repeated the words spoken 20 years 
ago houston tranquillity base here the eagle has landed 
several relatives of the challenger astronauts attended the 
event including jane smith widow of pilot michael smith lorna 
onizuka widow of ellison onizuka and cheryl mcnair widow of ron 
mcnair 
kranz who is now director of mission operations at the national 
aeronautics and space administrations johnson space center in 
houston said such simulations are important to keep children 
interested in science and space so they may be motivated to pursue 
careers in those areas 
its an incredible opportunity to basically challenge their 
curiosity if their curiosity is up well do ok kranz said

the scientists who designed the rocket 
that sent people to the moon 20 years ago reunited monday to 
commemorate the event and to voice shame that the united states 
barred their project manager from attending 
arthur rudolph project manager for the saturn v rocket at the 
marshall space flight center in huntsville remained in voluntary 
exile in his native west germany under threat of prosecution for 
alleged nazi war crimes if he returned to the united states 
many believe this is a sad day said retired nasa scientist 
ernst stuhlinger who like rudolph was one of 118 germans who came 
with wernher von braun to america after world war ii and helped 
start americas space program in huntsville 
another member of the von braun brain trust konrad dannenberg 
said rudolphs absence blights the nationwide festivities 
celebrating the 1969 apollo 11 moon walk 
its a shame for the united states to send out a man who did so 
much for the united states dannenberg said everyone here 
should be ashamed this thing happened 
rudolph now 84 retired in january 1970 after helping send two 
spaceships to the moon and moved to san jose calif where he lived 
in relative obscurity for 14 years his tranquil retirement ended 
when the justice departments office of special investigations 
raised allegations that during world war ii he was involved in the 
deaths of thousands of concentration camp prisoners who were forced 
to work in a v2 rocket factory where he was technical director 
those allegations were backed up by some survivors 
rather than fight the allegations rudolph left the country 
returning to hamburg west germany a twoyear investigation there 
found no offense against rudolph and returned his citizenship 
rudolph did not return phone calls to his hamburg residence 
monday one of his friends and former colleagues in huntsville 
walter haeussermann said rudolph was doing no interviews on the 
20th anniversary because so many things have been distorted 
three weeks ago huntsville television station whnt caught up 
with rudolph at a scientific convention in salzburg austria where 
he gave his last interview and talked about wanting to return to 
huntsville 
in the interview he acknowledged forced labor worked for 
months underground without seeing daylight but he said that was not 
his decision he said he once gave the workers a 12hour break 
because they looked very tired 
my boss called me on the carpet and said if you do that 
again ill put you in a concentration camp rudolph said 
he said the events of world war ii must be put in perspective 
that was of course a dictatorship if i didnt do what i had 
been told there was a high danger i would lose my life or be put in 
a concentration camp he said 
dannenberg 77 said efforts to clear rudolphs name in the 
country he served for 25 years have failed 
petitions to president reagan went unheeded and efforts to get 
the alabama reunion committee behind rudolphs case were rejected by 
chairman david rumbarger because he feared it could jeopardize the 
groups nonprofit status with the federal government 
all of von brauns original team has retired from the national 
aeronautics and space administration and half of them most in 
their 70s and 80s are still living von braun died in 1977 
stuhlinger said he and some other von braun members visited 
rudolph three weeks ago at the austrian convention 
his physical health is good considering hes 84 years old but 
hes sad and depressed about the fate forced on him said 
stuhlinger who is 75 
mondays reunion was also a chance for more than 800 usborn 
americans who worked with the german team to gather many of them 
also felt rudolph should be allowed to return 
ed buckbee director of the space and rocket center in 
huntsville was press spokesman for the von braun team during most 
of the moon program 
we allowed him to come into our country knowing his background 
allowed him to work to the top of our space program retired him and 
congratulated him then after wed used all his capabilities 
another branch of government decided to investigate him and punish 
him buckbee said 
there is reason to be ashamed i certainly am

a sixmember jury was chosen monday in us 
district court to hear a lawsuit accusing korean air lines of 
willful misconduct when one of its passenger jets was shot down by 
soviet planes in 1983 klling all 269 people aboard 
families of 132 of the passengers killed when flight 007 was 
destroyed are suing kal alleging that the planes crew due to a 
navigational mistake deliberately left uncorrected allowed the 
plane to go hundreds of miles off course over a period of several 
hours into soviet air space 
after the six jurors and three alternates were chosen and sent 
home for the day lawyers for the airline asked judge aubrey 
robinson to limit presentation of the conclusions of a report on the 
shootdown by the international civil aviation organization 
the icao said flight 007 had been off course for nearly 5 hours 
before it was destroyed 
robinson said any analysis in the report which the families want 
to present in court must be found to have a reasonable basis 
before he will admit it into evidence 
but the judge said he had no intention of keeping most of the 
information in the report out of the case 
i do not see the report as being wholly untenable the judge 
told kal attorneys 
the case will turn on whether plaintiffs can show willful 
misconduct by the crew failing that international agreements limit 
them to recovering at most 75000 each 
lawyers for the families have contended that crew members chose 
to continue the flight with a flawed program in the aircraft 
navigation system rather than return to the starting point to 
reprogram it possibly leaving them open to company discipline 
previously the judge said a failure to notice that the flight 
was offcourse at point a or point b or point c might be 
evidence only of negligence but a failure to notice that the 
flight was offcourse at point a and point b and point c is 
susceptible to a different interpretation 
the trial could last three to four weeks the judge told jurors

the mayor called it murder most fowl 
and ordered the defendant to do time on a petting farm robert 
yarsky thinks the sentence is daffy but he hasnt tried to duck it 
yarsky 20 of strongsville has been baling hay and doing other 
chores at a petting farm as part of his courtordered community 
sentence for running over danny a beloved neighborhood duck in 
january 
strongsville mayor walter ehrnfelt called it premeditated 
murder of danny the duck joseph and shirley spak owners of the 
popular pekin duck received dozens of cards letters and flowers 
after dannys death 
yarsky says he could not get police or the mayor to believe 
dannys demise was an accident i figured i would get a fine but 
i didnt think it would be anything outrageous like this he said 
last week when interviewed at the olmsted township farm where he 
must work two days a week for two months 
yarskys flap with the law began jan 23 when he and three 
friends were driving down a residential street in strongsville a 
city of 36000 in northeast ohio 
there was a stop sign and i guess i was paying more attention 
to the stop sign than anything yarsky said my friends shouted 
but i really didnt see anything except for kind of a little white 
flash out of the corner of my eye and i swerved the car then i hit 
it 
i remember there was this guy in a van who saw it happen and 
he charged at me so i left the scene because i didnt know what 
that guy was going to do later that evening the police arrested 
me they said they had three witnesses but ive always said i 
didnt do it intentionally 
ehrnfelt said he got a much different impression based on police 
accounts and yarskys lack of remorse in his appearance in mayors 
court feb 9 yarsky pleaded no contest to the seconddegree 
misdemeanor charge of killing an animal 
i dont think young people can go through life with that kind 
of attitude whether the life be animal or person the mayor said 
this duck had crossed the road there for maybe about nine 
years it would actually come up to the roadway and hesitate and 
then start across the road and then swim in a little creek that is 
right next to the fire station said ehrnfelt then he would 
travel back 
everyone knew this duck and cars would stop for him and let 
him cross the road even school buses would stop if he was going 
across the road everyone gave him necessary consideration with the 
exception of mr yarsky 
ehrnfelt fined yarsky 750 assigned 28 in court costs and 
suspended a 90day jail sentence pending completion of community 
service at burnettes farm and education center which is owned by 
jim burnette yarsky also has to buy a new duck for the spaks 
yarsky who recently took a job with a storage company said he 
didnt know what to expect when he began his sentence at the pet 
farm in june after about six working visits he said he was 
enjoying the experience 
its not a bad place and i like it but ive always had 
compassion for animals yarsky said my uncle lived on a farm 
and ive been around animals all my life but the mayor gets the 
idea i dont have compassion for animals so i guess thats why he 
sentenced me here

the chairman of the house ways and means 
committee said monday that he wont recommend a capitalgains tax 
cut to finance any program including catastrophicillness insurance 
for older americans 
rep dan rostenkowski dill made the statement to reporters 
after his committee again failed to change the insurance program 
whose financing mechanism is under heavy fire from retirees 
there apparently is no majority in the committee for any of 
several ideas for changing the incometax surcharge paid only by 
higherincome older citizens or the flat monthly premium paid by all 
but the poorest beneficiaries 
the most popular idea appears to be to let the program continue 
as is said rep james moody dwis 
the committee meeting ended in disagreement with rostenkowski 
saying he would put together a package to include catastrophic 
insurance extending several expiring provisions and miscellaneous 
tax provisions including ways to pay for them 
but the package wont include president bushs proposal to cut 
the capitalgains tax as a way to raise revenue when asked why 
rostenkowski replied because im a democrat 
democrats generally oppose a cut in the capitalgains tax which 
applies to profits from stocks and other investments because almost 
all the benefit would flow to those with annual incomes over 
100000 
bush and his advisers insist that a capitalgains cut would 
actually increase government revenues by generating new economic 
activity democrats generally argue that although a reduction would 
bring in more revenue in the first year it would lose money in 
later years 
although the capitalgains reduction is a prime topic of 
conversation by washington lobbyists lawmakers apparently are 
getting far more mail about the catastrophic insurance enacted a 
year ago the program was designed to protect medicare recipients 
from catastrophic costs of a major illness 
twothirds of the cost is paid by upperincome people 65 and 
older along with their federal income tax in 1989 the surtax can 
be up to 800 per beneficiary to pay that full amount a single 
person would have to have total income above about 42000 almost 
59 percent of retirees would pay no surtax 
the remaining part of the cost is paid by most recipients through 
the premium they already pay for part b medicare which covers 
doctors bills for 1989 the regular part b premium is 2790 plus 
4 for catastrophic coverage 
higherincome retirees subject to the surtax contend society in 
general should pay for the benefits for those retirees whose incomes 
are so low they escape most of the cost 
this is a totallose situation said committee member rep 
brian donnelly dmass who suggested the panel may have to leave 
the decision up to the house

iran and iraq blamed each other monday for 
the deadlock in peace talks that began after the aug 20 ceasefire 
that halted their 8yearold war 
iran also said the united nations was guilty of negligence and 
complacency and had failed to ensure a lasting peace 
president saddam hussein of iraq said the iranians had stalled 
the peace talks and used the deadlock to blackmail the region and 
threaten its security and stability 
unmediated peace talks began aug 25 five days after the 
truce and have gone nowhere 
in a separate development hashemi rafsanjani speaker of irans 
parliament and favorite in its july 28 presidential election said 
relations with the west could improve if approached on the basis of 
equality the official islamic republic news agency reported 
a foreign ministry statement for the anniversary of irans 
acceptance of un security council resolution 598 on july 18 1988 
said the council had promised to implement the resolution which 
also is a peace plan 
it said the commitment remained unfulfilled after a year 
the statement broadcast by tehran radio said the security 
councils negligence was not only a violation of the 
resolution by its authors but also a violation of the duty of 
maintaining international peace and security 
after several military defeats in the last weeks of fighting 
iran suddenly accepted the yearold truce resolution iraq had 
declared soon after passage that it would accept the resolution if 
iran did the same 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the late iranian patriarch said 
accepting the ceasefire was more deadly to me than poison 
other provisions of the un resolution include withdrawal to 
prewar boundaries prisoner exchange peace negotiations and an 
impartial commission to assess blame for the war 
a fourth round of peace talks was held in may and no further 
meetings have been scheduled 
irans statement monday said iraq had refused to implement the 
most important instruction of the resolution withdrawal to 
recognized international borders and had used every possible 
means to avoid honoring that commitment the radio said 
iraqi soldiers still occupy about 380 square miles of iranian 
territory iran insists they leave before peace talks proceed 
iraq rejects a 1975 treaty drawing part of the border down the 
middle of the shattalarab waterway its only outlet to the sea 
and insists the border be altered to give it all of shatt 
president hussein of iraq in an address marking the 21st 
anniversary of his baath arab socialist partys rise to power said 
this nowar nopeace situation could not continue 
its been nearly a year and they are still refusing to end the 
plight of war prisoners he said earlier this year hussein 
suggested the more than 100000 prisoners held by both sides be 
exchanged under a new agreement separate from the un resolution 
in an interview with the iranian newspaper jomhuri islami 
rafsanjani said iran would would give priority to better relations 
with third world nations and reiterated the desire for good 
relations with neighboring countries irna reported 
it quoted rafsanjani who is considered relatively moderate by 
iranian standards as saying of the west if they deal with us on 
the basis of equal terms and do not wish to impose anything on the 
revolution we will deal with them on equal terms 
iran needs western money and technology to rebuild from the war 
western analysts estimate reconstruction will cost at least 200 
billion

mstislav rostropovich one of the worlds 
leading cellists said monday he would play a benefit recital to 
help raise money to save the african elephant 
rostropovich music director of washingtons national symphyony 
orchestra announced the sept 18 performance at a news conference 
sponsored by conservation groups trying to draw attention to what 
they called a possible elephant holocaust 
when i see chairs and tables made with legs of ivory i think 
how inhuman how barbaric rostropovich said 
killing for ivory has reduced the african elephant population 
from 13 million to an estimated 550000 in the past 10 years said 
diana e mcmeekin vice president of the african wildlife federation 
the ivory is harvested after the elephants are killed 
sponsors of the concert at washingtons kennedy center for the 
performing arts predicted it would net at least 400000 all to be 
used for elephant conservation projects and investigation into the 
network of elephantpoaching and ivory trading being outlawed by 
many countries 
christine stevens president of the washingtonbased animal 
welfare institute described the poachers as totally evil but 
wonderfully wellorganized 
she predicted a fierce battle at the october meeting in 
switzerland of the 102nation convention on international trade in 
endangered species to ensure there are no weakening moves 
against a proposed total ban on ivory imports 
japan the major ivory buyer and botswana south africa and 
zimbabwe the major suppliers want reservations that would allow 
them to trade among themselves 
many african nations led by kenya and tanzania support 
curtailing the ivory trade 
japan accounts for 40 percent of world ivory consumption and the 
united states 15 percent japanese use carved ivory for personal 
signature stamps as well as jewelry 
in june japan banned ivory imports but continues to permit 
shipments certified by the countries of origin ms stevens said 
such a loophole would mean that all of the elephants in all of 
africa will be at risk 
president bush issued an executive order june 5 banning us 
import of ivory from all countries the west european community has 
taken similar steps

patriotism rippled through a crowd of 
thousands who gathered among the tumbleweeds outside a tightly 
guarded air force plant to watch mondays maiden flight of the b2 
stealth bomber 
great god exclaimed les holland as the batwinged plane 
soared into the air from air force plant 42 in the mojave desert 
where spectators had parked motor homes trucks sports cars and 
motorcycles 
holland was one of the many employees of northrop corp the 
builder of the craft that already has cost about 224 billion in 
development who woke up early to watch the flight 
the fourengine flying wing took off from a runway at plant 42 
then made what appeared to be a perfect landing at nearby edwards 
air force base 
air force capt tess taft unfurled an american flag and the 
star spangled banner was sung on the runway by alis clausen 
employee of a local cable television station

the radarevading b2 
stealth bomber took its maiden flight over the mojave desert on 
monday impressing its pilots while crowds cheered and political 
debate intensified over the costly planes fate 
if we appear a little giggly about all of this it was a lot of 
fun said air force col richard couch one of two pilots on the 
test flight 
the nearly twohour flight appeared flawless to people who 
watched the sinisterlooking flying wing take off from 
secrecyshrouded air force plant 42 in palmdale shortly after 630 
am and land at nearby edwards air force base 
the fourengine bomber built with advanced composite materials 
and a shape that are not easily detectable by radar flew at 10000 
feet over the antelope valley at three speeds accompanied by two 
f16 fighters through a clear sky 
the b2 was temporarily arrayed with radar reflective material to 
allow test personnel to keep track of it on radar screens 
the b2 a tailless 172footlong wing with a bulge in the 
middle rather than a conventional fuselage finally landed and 
quickly rolled to a stop without a wobble stopped for several 
minutes and then taxied off into a hangar 
we were very pleased with the performance of the aircraft it 
was very close to the simulators said bruce j hinds chief test 
pilot for northrop corps b2 division who flew the plane with 
couch 
during takeoff they intended to pitch the plane to a 7degree 
angle before it was supposed to become airborne but we never got 
there couch told reporters the airplane just very smoothly 
came off the ground 
couch called the b2 a very nimble aircraft and said it made 
a grade a landing 
i had to ask the tower if we were on the ground couch said 
the plane needed only about 5000 feet of the 11000foot takeoff 
runway and the wheels remained down throughout the flight a normal 
practice for a maiden flight the b2 used only about 5000 feet of 
runway on landing 
the air force had planned to evaluate data and nspect the plane 
for about five weeks before trying a second flight however the 
results were so heartening that the next flight will probably be 
sooner said gen bernard t p randolph commander of the air force 
systems command 
this is a historic day in aviation randolph said it 
basically negates the air defenses that have been building up over 
many years around the world 
at the pentagon officials issued a statement by defense 
secretary dick cheney on the b2 flight 
i am pleased with the success of the project to date it is 
good to see that the test program appears to validate the judgments 
made previously by the department of defense and congress to go 
forward with the b2 
the government has already invested about 224 billion in the 
b2 program which is 18 months behind schedule and congress has 
balked at the thought of paying northrop more than 500 million 
apiece for 132 bombers 
the senate armed services committee approving president bushs 
3055 billion defensespending request for fiscal 1990 stipulated 
friday that no new money be spent on the b2 until it flew the 
pentagon seeks 47 billion for the bomber in the coming fiscal year 
and may need 8 billion in each of the three peak years of 
production 1992 to 94 
rep sonny montgomery dmiss a member of the house armed 
services committee said in washington that in spite of the 
successful flight the program is still in trouble in the house 
the b2s maiden flight was long awaited by aviation buffs and 
workers from the desert aerospace community thousands gathered 
among the tumbleweeds outside plant 42 and shouted here they 
come when the great wings dark shadow passed over great 
god exclaimed northrop employee les holland 
the star spangled banner was sung beside the runway by alis 
clausen employee at a local cable tv station air force capt tess 
taft unfurled the stars and stripes 
i think its time in the debate that we begin stressing the 
capabilities of the aircraft instead of placing all ephasis on the 
cost we are a nation with global responsibilities said northrop 
spokesman les daly a longtime proponent of the flying wing concept 
the b2 is designed to carry nuclear bombs and with the 
conventional b1 replace the air forces aging fleet of b52 
bombers that form part of the us nuclear deterrent against the 
soviet union 
socalled stealth technology combines advanced materials and a 
special shape to create a plane undetectable by enemy radar though 
the bomber is still being developed stealth fighters have operated 
for several years 
the b2s first flight followed a series of ground speed tests 
it was supposed to fly saturday but a low fuel pressure reading 
forced a delay 
montgomery the mississippi congressman said an amendment will 
be offered in the house to stop all b2 funding when the defense 
bill comes up on the floor next week he said the possibility of its 
passing is realistic 
i believe what im leaning toward right now is to continue the 
program mainly in research he said 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo also a member of the house 
armed services committee and an opponent of the stealth bomber said 
she hoped the maiden flight would not result in a blank check for 
the pentagon 
schroeder supports an amendment to the defense bill that would 
stop production of the b2 after 13 planes until further tests and 
flights

the house voted monday to reduce the interior 
secretarys authority over the national parks in what supporters of 
the bill said was an effort to keep politics out of the 
environmental decisions 
rep bruce vento dminn said the bill also was designed to 
protect professional park employees who he said are being harassed 
and intimidated by political appointees 
republican opponents of the bill which was approved by voice 
vote said it would be vetoed by president bush it still must go 
through the senate before reaching the presidents desk 
a similar measure passed last year by the house was never acted 
on by the senate 
the issue is to let the professionals use professional 
judgments said vento who led debate in favor the bill 
but rep john rhodes rariz who opposed the measure said it 
was bad law that removes the park service control from one group 
of political appointees by just putting it under control of 
another set of political operatives 
the legislation would require the president to nominate a park 
service director who would be confirmed by the senate for a 
fiveyear term and be answerable directly to congress 
the interior secretary would relinquish almost all power over the 
parks including hiring to the director the secretary would still 
have to approve the budget of the national park service before 
submission to the president 
currently the director of the national park service is appointed 
by the interior secretary without senate confirmation and may be 
removed by the secretary 
with one exception in the late 1960s park service directors have 
always been professional park managers either from the federal 
system or a state system 
an amendment offered by rhodes that would have eliminated all 
provisions of the bill except the one requiring the director to be 
confirmed by the senate failed 148251 
vento said if the final vote on passage had been by roll call 
there would have been a twothirds majority the margin needed to 
overturn a presidential veto 
vento said however the fight in the senate for the measure 
would be tougher 
environmentalists clashed several times with the reagan 
administration over its supervision of the parks and alleged 
dictation of national park service decisions 
as land and resource scarcity has increased so have the 
pressures of certain segments of society to take actions detrimental 
to the basic legislative directives to protect the national park 
system said the report from the interior committee which handled 
hearings on the bill 
such actions have polarized opposite reactions from citizen 
groups and the general public who see park resources being seriously 
degraded 
the report said professional resource managers decisionmaking 
has been supplanted by political decisionmaking 
interior secretary manual lujan formerly the senior republican 
on the committee was away from washington monday but department 
spokesman tom wilson said that the secretary testified against the 
measure in committee hearings 
lujan told house interior committee chairman morris udall 
dariz that he would recommend a veto if the bill passed in the 
form approved by the committee wilson said

president bush is being advised to veto any 
legislation which forbids him to use money from other countries for 
activities denied funds by congress such as helping the contra 
rebels sen jesse helms said monday 
this doesnt even make good nonsense because congress doesnt 
have the authority to do that said helms rnc as debate 
opened on an amendment offered by sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny to a pending state department authorization bill 
it is a direct explicit and conscious attack on the separation 
of powers helms said of the amendment on which the senate will 
vote tuesday 
it is nothing less than an attempt by congress to criminalize 
foreign policy 
i get the impression in the political climate in washington 
today that there is an effort to milk that irancontra cow that goes 
on and on and on helms said 
the moynihan amendment springs from disclosures at the 
congressional irancontra hearings that the reagan administration 
solicited funds from foreign nations to aid the contra rebels in 
nicaragua at a time when congress had barred using us funds to 
provide such aid 
during the hearings the countries were referred to by code names 
such as country one and country two and the like but it was 
clear that nations like saudi arabia and brunei had contributed 
former marine lt col oliver l north then a staff member of 
the national security council was described in testimony as having 
been heavily engaged in such solicitation 
the moynihan amendment would make what north and others did 
illegal 
the amendment would provide penalties of up to five years in jail 
for any officer or employee of the government who solicits funds or 
material aid for a prohibited activity from any foreign government 
foreign national or us citizen 
the amendment also would cut off us foreign aid to another 
nation if that would have the effect of assisting the activity 
proscribed by congress 
undersecretary of state lawrence eagleburger in a letter read by 
helms said the amendment would seriously affect the ability of bush 
or any succeeding president from conducting foreign policy 
he said that if congress attaches the moynihan amendment to the 
state department authorization bill we would recommend the 
president disapprove the bill 
moynihan said there is no question about this legislation 
being necessary we went through an extensive painful and divisive 
inquiry into practices in the executive branch which clearly 
undermined the will of congress but took place even so 
helms contended that while congress can bar spending tax dollars 
on an executive branch policy it cannot under the constitution bar 
the administration from finding the money elsewhere 
he argued that the president has the power to do that as he sees 
fit and can only be punished for such action by impeachment or 
defeat at the polls not by criminal sanctions 
but moynihan said congress has the right to act to prevent the 
laws it passes from being circumvented 
this is not just our right it is our responsibility he 
said were trying to protect the presidency and the process

the bush administration has refused to sell 
india a device for testing missiles state department spokesman 
richard boucher said monday 
it could conceivably contribute to the development of further 
ballistic missiles boucher told reporters 
the device is called cavcts for combined acceleration vibration 
climatic test system 
boucher said he was not aware of any protest from the indian 
government against the us denial of an export license for the 
device 
but the indian embassy said later the refusal was unjustified 
since india had already received a us license to purchase the 
equipment in 1985 and the device was usable only for testing 
shortrange missile launchers 
an embassy statement said the denial was based on alleged 
concern arising out of the missile technology control regime that 
the united states concluded in 1987 the agreement with france 
britain the soviet union japan and several other countries aimed 
to curb proliferation of missile technology in the third world 
however the embassy said this piece of equipment is only 
relevant for shortrange launchers and does not attract mtcr 
concern 
the embassy did not explain the delay in buying the 12 million 
device which allowed the original license to expire 
india has successfully tested its agni surfacetosurface 
ballistic missile which western experts speculated could carry a 
nuclear warhead but the indian government continues to renounce 
nuclear arms

large rallies are ineffective in 
spreading christianity to members of rival faiths and the focus 
instead should be on lowprofile dialogue delegates to a worldwide 
evangelical conference were told monday 
the rev martin alphonse a methodist minister from madras 
india said at the lausanne ii conference that such dialogue will 
not be seen as a threat to or an open assault on other faiths 
by playing a low key it will still be able to permeate the 
various spheres of peoples of other faiths in a quiet but firm 
way said alphonse who lives in a predominantly hindu city 
the conference which opened last tuesday has brought together 
about 4200 evangelical christians from more than 160 countries to 
devise ways to spread the christian religion worldwide by the end of 
the century 
alphonse told the delegates that they face a seemingly 
insurmountable task in reaching 900 million moslems 690 million 
hindus 320 million buddhists and others by the year 2000 
we are not thinking about organized conventions and 
evangelistic crusades for thousands of them exclusively in one 
place he said such strategy may not simply work 
rather we are thinking about world evangelization by local 
evangelization by reaching a few here and a few there thus 
eventually making this gospel proliferate everywhere he said 
colin chapman a lecturer in religion at trinity university in 
bristol england said such quiet dialogue paralleled the style of 
preaching used by jesus and the apostles when dealing with jews and 
members of other religions in the roman empire 
chapman said it is important for evangelicals to avoid insulting 
other faiths even if they find the religions erroneous and 
incomplete 
the lausanne committee which organized the conference is 
chaired by the rev leighton ford a canadian who lives in north 
carolina and is the brotherinlaw of american evangelist billy 
graham 
graham has used largescale rallies or crusades as his 
principal method for evangelizing for nearly 40 years graham was to 
have addressed the opening session of the conference which ends 
thursday but he canceled because of a schedule conflict 
alphonse said christianity faced resistance from other religions 
because of cultural conflict the faiths association with european 
colonialism and the aggressive activities of early christian 
missionaries 
he said other religious groups had expected a decline in 
missionary activity after the collapse of european empires after 
world war ii 
on the contrary most of the national churches have revived the 
traditional evangelistic work and some have become much more 
vigorous in it than ever before he said the number of converts 
from other faiths to christianity has continued to increase in 
several nations in the postcolonial era and in unprecedented 
measure in a few cases 
no figures were immediately available 
he said islam had attempted to resist christian encroachments by 
taking on a political aspect and had become established as a state 
religion in pakistan malaysia brunei and nations of the middle 
east

both the timber industry and the forest service 
on monday rejected a proposal offered by environmentalists aimed at 
ending the fight over logging in the ancient forests of the pacific 
northwest 
the rejections came as lawmakers from the region sought to craft 
a legislative compromise that would ensure an adequate shortterm 
supply of logs to keep the regions mills operating over the next 15 
months and protect the oldgrowth forests that are prime habitat for 
the rare northern spotted owl 
the lawmakers had hoped to attach the compromise to the interior 
department appropriations bill when it came before a senate 
appropriations subcommittee tuesday but the meeting has been put 
off until later in the week for unrelated reasons 
the lawmakers have made clear they will act whether or not the 
environmentalists and the industry agree the spending bill will 
include funds for the forest service and the bureau of land 
management 
industry representatives said the environmentalists proposal 
would be technically infeasible because its restrictions on 
oldgrowth logging would make it impossible to meet the timber sales 
levels it envisions 
this is a nonstarter an offer of terms of surrender mark 
rey a vice president of the national forest products association 
said at a news conference adding that environmentalists had just 
repackaged their previous demands 
the environmentalists proposal would reduce the harvest over the 
next 15 months to a level 400 million board feet below that of the 
earlier plan and rey said that would result in the loss of 7000 
jobs 171 million in payrolls and 162 million in government 
revenue at all levels 
in a letter to northwest lawmakers f dale robertson forest 
service chief said the environmentalist proposal would be 
unworkable the timber targets are achievable with protection of 
significant oldgrowth stands but not under the conditions and 
criteria proposed 
the restrictions on oldgrowth logging proposed by the 
environmentalists would allow harvesting in mostly younger stands 
and such areas are not capable of providing the intended sales 
volume 
the federal government has been prevented from selling many older 
stands to timber companies as a result of court injunctions won by 
environmental groups who argued the stands may be the last 
remaining habitat of the spotted owl 
environmentalists said that despite the rejections they were 
still willing to negotiate 
we think the industry ought to be doing a little more in terms 
of coming up with their own proposals rather than taking cheap shots 
at ours said rich hoppe a spokesman for the wilderness society 
hoppe said that environmentalists were a little surprised at the 
forest services comments as their plan was based on numbers 
supplied by the agency

fire bosses in southern utah requested 400 reinforcements monday 
to battle a blaze threatening summer cabins and a fire that was 
declared controlled in mesa verde national park rekindled and jumped 
fire lines 
smokejumpers parachuted to a small fire in rugged terrain in 
idaho at a site so high that snow was available to fight flames 
in addition to the requested reinforcements 400 firefighters 
were already on the uintah flat forest fire in the dixie national 
forest 
forest service spokesman bevan killpack said the fire grew to 
6230 acres by monday burning well into private land and moving 
slowly toward several summer cabins in the bonanza creek subdivision 
near hatch about 40 miles east of cedar city 
the fire came within an eighth of a mile of one cabin and a 
quarter mile of several others which were guarded by engine crews 
as firefighters cleared brush and bulldozers carved fire lines 
around them killpack said 
us bureau of land management officials scrambled for crews to 
fight two new fires elsewhere in utah 
however a 118acre blaze that neared dozens of posh homes on 
salt lake citys east side was declared contained sunday and on 
monday crews doused hot spots by helicopter and with handcarried 
water bags 
a forest fire that was declared controlled thursday in mesa verde 
national park in southwestern colorado flared up again over the 
weekend and had spread to more than 360 new acres by monday for a 
total of 3100 acres burned in the 52000acre park officials said 
the humidity dropped it got warmer and the wind picked up the 
fire kind of skittered around a little bit and skipped a fire 
line said john pasquantino fire information officer at the park 
we can try and stamp on it and all but only mother nature is 
going to do anything to really put the thing out he said 
there were 137 firefighters on the line monday triple the number 
working when the fire flared up saturday officials estimated the 
blaze was 85 percent contained but the remaining 15 percent was on 
extremely steep terrain pasquantino said and containment was not 
predicted until wednesday 
the park which features ancient indian cliff dwellings sheltered 
in canyons remained open although three roads were closed 
as last week archaeologists worked with fire crews monday on the 
mesas above the canyons to make sure no ancient artifacts in the 
park were damaged by firefighting there were no reports of any 
specific archaeological sites threatened pasquantino said 
fire bosses dropped a pair of smokejumpers into rugged terrain on 
the targhee national forest in eastern idaho on monday to battle a 
small lightningsparked fire on us sheep experiment station land 
its so high they have access to snow up there and theyre 
going to use that said targhee spokeswoman lisa lew she didnt 
know the elevation but it was at least above 7000 feet 
the odell creek fire was the latest in a spate of fires across 
idaho after a weekend of thunderstorms all of the dozens of other 
fires had either been doused or contained

the multiple investigations triggered by 
thomas roots 800mile autopilot flight while he was unconscious 
and by his bullet wound are moving ahead on several fronts federal 
investigators said monday 
the 36yearold lawyer from alexandria va remained in 
hollywood memorial hospital in stable condition a hospital 
spokeswoman predicted he would be there for another week 
investigators with the fbi and the national transportation safety 
board are examining various aspects of roots business activities 
and details of his flight thursday 
he planned to fly his small plane from washington to rocky mount 
nc but told air traffic controllers he was having trouble 
breathing and apparently passed out until his plane ran out of fuel 
and ditched near the bahamas 
military rescue crews who had followed roots plane picked him up 
from the sea doctors later discovered he had suffered a gunshot 
wound to the abdomen root theorized a pistol in his planes cockpit 
may have fired when the plane hit the water 
laboratory tests will check for drug traces in blood samples and 
also for evidence of carbon monoxide that would explain his 
difficulty breathing and loss of consciousness during the flight 
rachel halterman of the national transportation safety board said 
those results should be completed by midweek 
in north carolina the secretary of states office has been 
investigating security fraud allegations against a company with 
which root acted as an attorney secretary of state rufus edmisten 
said root knew he was under investigation 
the ntsb is interviewing business associates and doing a 
background check as well as interviewing pilots and members of 
rescue crews who found root 
the fbi is investigating possible violations of criminal statutes 
and will make a recommendation to the us attorney here 
fbi spokesman paul miller said his agency is checking the 
situation surrounding the flight and also checking on matters 
reported in washington virginia and north carolina 
root contacted the washington post after his family considered 
numerous written requests for interviews and told the newspaper 
that the effects of his accident have surprised him 
im shocked i cant understand why this story has blown up 
beyond the admittedly unusual circumstances to end up being a 
frontpage story like this root told the post for monday editions 
he repeated his adamant denial that the bullet wound meant he 
tried to commit suicide 
as i was swimming around out there hurting a lot i was 
thinking about my family and that i wasnt going to see them again 
and i say that to say that i dont have the ability nerve or 
stupidity to take another life mine or anybody elses 
root added that his life insurance policy has a clause allowing 
his family to collect in the event of a suicide so it would have 
been pointless for him to plan the flight to conceal a suicide

the united states should pursue travel to 
other planets rather than joint space ventures with the soviet 
union alan shepard the first american in space said monday 
shepard one of 12 americans to walk on the moon disagreed with 
apollo 11 moonwalker edwin buzz aldrin who said saturday during 
a trip to huntsville that america should pursue joint missions with 
the soviet union and possibly japan 
shepard on monday visited the space and rocket center a tourist 
attraction for festivities celebrating the 20th anniversary of 
americas moon landing 
speaking from what he described as an engineering perspective 
rather than a political one shepard said i would rather see us 
develop the technology to have planetary travel manned and 
unmanned i think our space technology level in general is ahead 
of the soviets 
he said the united states should find things other than 
technology to share with the soviet union 
shepard rode a huntsvillebuilt redstone rocket into space on may 
5 1961 as the american space program rushed to catch the soviets 
after recovering from an inner ear disorder that temporarily 
grounded him shepard returned to space in february 1971 on apollo 
14 and became the fifth man to walk on the moon 
shepard said his first trip though brief remains his favorite 
pointing to a model of the redstone rocket at the space and 
rocket center he said from the standpoint of pure gut 
excitement obviously riding that baby for the first time had to 
take the prize 
turning to his moon trip shepard said his famous swing at a golf 
ball on the moons surface was not spontaneous as the national 
aeronautics and space administration made it appear at the time 
we practiced in the suit we worked out all the safety 
aspects he said 
now 65 shepard lives in houston where he is a commercial real 
estate developer

two aides to a former state attorney 
general pleaded guilty monday to charges stemming from his 1986 
gubernatorial battle with one saying the candidate approved the use 
of state equipment to spy on political foes 
andy yeomans who admitted to a misdemeanor charge of aiding in 
the use of stateowned property for political purposes said former 
state attorney general charlie graddick endorsed electronic 
surveillance at state democratic party headquarters and at a 
telephone bank run by graddicks opponent in the 1986 democratic 
runoff thenlt gov bill baxley 
yeomans codefendant don bekurs pleaded guilty to a 
misdemeanor charge of misapplying state property bekurs was accused 
of taking eavesdropping equipment from the attorney generals 
office while yeomans was accused of implementing the bugging 
graddick an investment banker who is considering a return to the 
political arena in 1990 did not immediately return telephone calls 
seeking comment monday he previously has denied wrongdoing in his 
campaign 
district attorney jimmy evans declined comment on whether charges 
were being considered against graddick who reportedly is thinking 
about a campaign for lieutenant governor or attorney general 
yeomans and bekurs a former assistant to graddick had been

tapes made in the bugging operations aides kept him informed about 
what was overheard

the vatican and poland restored full 
diplomatic ties on monday the first such relations between the holy 
see and one of the warsaw pact countries that tried to muzzle 
organized religion after world war ii 
the move comes two months after polands parliament granted legal 
recognition to the roman catholic church following 15 years of 
permanent working contacts between the holy see and the communist 
government 
the communists broke diplomatic relations when they came to power 
in 1945 mondays announcement made by the vatican and polands 
staterun news agency set ties at the ambassadorial level 
polishborn pope john paul ii who himself negotiated with 
polands communist rulers when he served as archbishop and cardinal 
of krakow disclosed a week ago that he planned to send an envoy to 
poland soon an indication that restoriation of relations was near 
in overwhelmingly catholic poland the news was hailed by both 
church and government 
stefan staniszewski spokesman for the foreign ministry said it 
is a very important fact that crowns a long process of 
normalization of relations between the state and the church 
the polish government sought diplomatic ties with rome to improve 
its standing at home and abroad for a while some polish bishops 
reportedly had opposed the idea fearing the government would go 
directly to the vatican to deal with churchstate issues 
but on monday the bishops expressed the deep conviction that a 
proper development of relations will influence the realization of 
citizens rights in poland and open a new field of church activities 
with benefits for the whole society 
the reestablishment of ties marked one of the greatest successes 
of the vaticans policy of ostpolitik which has sought to win 
concessions for the church by a cautious dialogue with communist 
officials 
the church has also seen major improvements in its relations with 
hungary and the soviet union since president mikhail s gorbachev 
instituted his reforms 
the pope is planning a visit in 1991 to hungary which recently 
expressed interest in diplomatic ties with the holy see gorbachev 
is expected to meet the pope during a trip to italy this fall 
such dialogue would have been nearly unthinkable after world war 
ii when officially atheistic communist governments tried to 
suppress the church 
in poland the regime confiscated property arrested priests and 
placed cardinal stefan wyszynski under house arrest during the 
stalinist era 
conditions eased for the church when party leader wladyslaw 
gomulka relaxed controls in 1956 pope john paul ii then bishop 
karol wojtyla went on to play a key role in formulating the polish 
churchs moderate but firm demands for religious freedom in 
communist countries 
in recent years the church has played a key political role in 
poland 
it was instrumental in arranging the negotiations between 
polands communist authorities and the opposition that led to an 
historic april accord on political and economic reform 
the church also maintains close links with solidarity the first 
independent labor movement in the east bloc john paul has been an 
outspoken supporter of the union federation which was legalized in 
april after a sevenyear ban 
the pope has closely followed political events in his homeland 
requesting detailed reports giving instructions to polands church 
hierarchy and discussing the political situation with polish bishops 
while the presence in poland of a papal nuncio or ambassador 
was not expected to have a major effect on daytoday church 
affairs the nuncio will likely have strong symbolic importance 
he will be a reminder to the government of its promises and a 
symbol of an institution considered to have far broader popular 
support than the communist government 
there was no immediate announcement on the name of the vatican 
envoy there has been speculation it could be archbishop gabriel 
montalvo a colombian who is papal nuncio to yugoslavia 
poland was christianized in 966 and has always considered itself 
a bulwark of western christianity in the east the church kept alive 
polish identity in the centuries when the country was split among 
russians austrians and prussians before 1918 
in june 1987 during the last of his three papal trips to poland 
the pontiff declared it was abnormal for a predominantly 
catholic country to lack full ties with the vatican the holy see 
has relations with 117 other countries 
nonaligned yugoslavia is the only communist country in eastern 
europe with vatican ties the vatican also has full relations with 
cuba 
the last papal ambassador to poland left warsaw on sept 5 1939 
at the outbreak of world war ii

a quebec superior court judge on monday 
upheld an injunction won by a pregnant womans exboyfriend 
preventing her from having an abortion 
a conceived child that is not yet born is a human being under 
article 1 of the quebec charter of rights and freedoms and has 
the right to life guaranteed every person said justice jacques 
viens 
he said the mother chantal daigle faced a difficult and painful 
problem but that the court had to rule in favor of the fetus 
i feel like a victim said ms daigle 21 i still have 
hope and it is still my choice i have more rights than a 
20weekold fetus 
her lawyer planned to appeal the ruling wednesday ms daigle 
told reporters outside the courthouse that she will wait until the 
appeal is heard before taking action on the abortion 
ms daigles exboyfriend jeanguy tremblay 25 hugged his 
lawyer and antiabortionists who had come to the courthouse to hear 
the judgment 
i intend to raise the child but with her said tremblay who 
won the injunction in the superior court july 7 
henri kelada a lawyer representing tremblay said the ruling 
will have an impact on doctors giving abortions and women will be 
more cautious about getting pregnant 
ms daigles lawyer daniel bedard said the ruling if not 
overturned on appeal will mean that anyone can intervene on behalf 
of the fetus and say that it has rights 
this means no more abortions and means women will have to be 
silent he said 
bedard had argued that the judges job is to apply the law not 
create it he said the injunction should be quashed since there is 
no law to base it on 
the supreme court of canada last year struck down the countrys 
abortion law which permitted abortions under certain conditions 
canada now has now criminal law governing abortion 
the case is the third of its kind this month to grab headlines 
and reignite the abortion debate in canada 
in toronto last week barbara dodd had an abortion hours after 
the ontario supreme court quashed an injunction obtained by her 
exboyfriend greg murphy in winnipeg a 20yearold single mother 
had an abortion shortly after a july 6 court decision struck down an 
injunction obtained by the womans exboyfriend

east germany said monday that if the west german 
government includes the ultrarightist republican party in a ruling 
coalition the move might pave the way for hitlers successor 
neues deutschland the official daily of east germanys communist 
party called on west germany to outlaw the party which made strong 
showings in regional elections in recent months 
whoever trivializes the danger of neonazis or even considers 
the neonazis as future partners in a coalition must reckon with 
being seen in the world as paving the way for hitlers successor 
neues deutschland said 
the republicans led by former nazi ss trooper franz schoenhuber 
concentrate on nationalist themes they advocate stiff reductions in 
the number of asylumseekers allowed to stay in west germany and 
strict limits on foreign workers 
schoenhuber has said his party speaks out for german interests 
and supports constitutional law 
earlier this month west german interior minister wolfgang 
schaeuble said membership in rightwing extremist groups last year 
increased 128 percent in the nation of 61 million and may have 
surpassed 30000 
the republicans earlier this year gained seats in local 
legislatures in west berlin and frankfurt and won six seats in the 
european parliament on june 18 
most of the partys gains were at the expense of chancellor 
helmut kohls conservative christian democratic union and its 
bavarian ally the christian social union 
kohls christian democrats have expressed concern about national 
elections scheduled for december 1990 but say they rule out forming 
a coalition with the republicans as a means of staying in power 
schoenhuber however added to speculation about a possible 
coalition by saying at a recent party meeting we are in the 
fortunate position of being a wanted bride and not a flirting 
bridegroom 
neues deutschland claimed that a debate about a 
conservativerepublican coalition showed west germany has not come 
to terms with germans nazi past 
it is clear that the ideology of nazism chauvinism the racism 
between the rhein and elbe rivers north sea and the alps has a 
noticeable basis the newspaper said referring to key boundary 
lines in west germany 
schaeuble has said west german officials will meet in september 
to determine if the republican party should be labeled an extremist 
organization if it should be ruled extremist the party could be 
kept under surveillance by the verfassungschutz the countrys main 
domestic intelligence agency

archaeologists using radar mapping monday 
found subtle signs of underground disturbances that could be the 
centuryold remains of the victims of admitted cannibal alferd 
packer 
we dont have for you the knife in the bone but we have subtle 
indications that we are in the right place said james starrs a 
george washington university law professor heading the expedition 
as residents and reporters watched 13 archaelogists and other 
scientists looked for clues to determine how the five gold seekers 
died during the bitter winter of 1874 and whether their remains were 
consumed by packer 
the search concentrated on a 50by50 foot section of deadmans 
gulch where it is believed the bodies of the five men were buried 
the equipment detects rocks depressions and other anomalies by 
shooting radar beams underground 
starrs said a rather demonstrable blip was detected near the 
suspected graves 
its subtle but after years of looking at this type of data i 
feel confident there has been some disturbance in the area said 
engineer stan smith who conducted the radar mapping 
the scientists plan to begin digging tuesday in areas singled out 
through radar mapping 
starrs is 90 percent sure that the bones of the victims lie 
beneath a boulder roughly marking the gravesite in the gulch which 
lies between cannibalism plateau and round top mountain about 2 
miles south of lake city 
a grave marker honors the five men who were murdered on this 
spot early in the year 1874 while pioneering for mineral resources 
of the san juan country 
packer a harness maker from utah led the party of five into the 
san juan mountains in search for gold he told authorities in april 
1874 that shannon bell a member of his party killed the others 
with a hatchet while packer was away from camp looking for an 
escape route from the mountains 
packer said he killed bell in self defense and that he was forced 
to eat the remains of the other victims to survive 
packer escaped from custody but was captured in 1883 in 
cheyenne wyo he was convicted of killing one of the prospectors 
but that sentence was overturned by the colorado supreme court 
he was retried for all five murders convicted of manslaughter 
and sentenced to 40 years in prison he was paroled in 1901 and died 
april 24 1907 
in the years to follow packers admitted cannibalism provided 
plenty of joke fodder and made him a bizarre folkhero in colorado 
and the united states 
although starrs is confident the group will locate the bones 
walter birkby curator of physical anthropology at the arizona state 
museum in tucson who is on the dig said he was unsure whether there 
were any bones to find 
the dig differs from usual practices of archaeologists who tend 
to be secretive about the location and progress of their research 
however starrs said his goal to raise 10000 to fund the 
expedition has not been reached so he and his assistants have 
encouraged press coverage of the event 
starrs assembled a team of anthropologists archaeologists and 
pathologists for his expedition near lake city about 170 miles 
southwest of denver 
starrs believes the bones will be in good condition 
from the bones we will be able to see bullet holes and 
hatchmarks where the skinning knife might have scraped the bones 
well be able to tell if the victims were cannibalized if they were 
struck by a hatchet blow if they were really near starvation 
starrs said 
the group has set aside this week to search for the bones later 
this month its findings will be sent to the arizona state museum at 
tucson for analysis 
next month starrs plans to rebury the bones and restore the 
gravesite the results of the expedition are scheduled to be 
released early next year 
as the scientists worked about two dozen residents watched while 
sitting in lawn chairs with coolers packed with refreshments 
most were amused by the expedition and one joked that he thought 
the group probably would unearth elvis presley belt buckles instead 
of bones 
one resident byrne smith said he believed that shannon bell 
one of the gold seekers killed his companions and was later killed 
himself by packer 
i dont disagree that packer probably was a liar but im not 
sure he was literate and he might have signed a confession he 
couldnt read smith said it will be interesting to find out if 
there is any corroborating evidence because there are so many 
stories

a retired colonel testifying in the spy 
trial of a turkish man said monday a us soldier accused in the 
case attracted attention at an army base by buying an expensive car 
for cash 
retired col kenneth roneys testimony came on the opening day of 
the us district court trial of huseyin yildirim 61 who is 
accused of scheming with army warrant officer james william hall iii 
to provide military secrets to the soviets and east germans 
roney said thensgt hall was singled out to him at field 
station berlin in germany in 1986 because he owned a 21000 1985 
volvo 760 gle roney the bases commander was considering buying 
the car 
questioned about the effects of the alleged conspiracy roney 
said he noticed toward the end of his command that there was a drop 
in the amount of material coming to the berlin listening base from 
eastern bloc sources 
yildirim who worked as a civilian mechanic on an army base in 
berlin was identified in court documents as the man hall identified 
as his conduit of classified national defense documents to east 
german agents 
hall in the army since 1976 spent most of his career in europe 
working as an analyst of intercepted radio and telephone traffic and 
code messages 
prosecutors said roneys testimony was important because it 
showed apparent excessive spending by hall who made 20000 a year 
in opening arguments earlier in the day assistant us attorney 
fred kramer talked about military tensions between the east and the 
west and said nato forces are vastly outnumbered 
what is required to equalize the balance is information 
kramer said after jury selection was completed intelligence in 
the modern world is not james bond stuff it never was 
the trial is being held in savannah because hall was stationed at 
nearby fort stewart at the time of his arrest 
kramer said for the first time that hall who was courtmartialed 
earlier this year will be a government witness against yildirim 
in his opening argument yildirims attorney lamar walter said 
his client did not participate in this conspiracy to the extent he 
should be charged 
i know some of you read spy novels you never know what the 
conclusion is until you read the last chapter walter told the 
jury adding that hall did most of the work 
yildirim who has been held in seclusion since his arrest at his 
belleair beach fla home in december speaks little english and 
was accompanied by an interpreter in the courtroom 
hall 30 an intelligence analyst in the 24th infantry division 
was court martialed at fort mcnair near washington dc in march 
and pleaded guilty to 10 counts of espionage attempted espionage 
and failing to obey army regulations 
he was sentenced to 40 years in prison fined 50000 and 
dishonorably discharged

randall dale adams refuses to let bitterness 
spoil his enjoyment of freedom even though he served 12 years in 
prison and came within three days of being executed for a murder he 
didnt commit 
i hate what happened said adams 40 freed in march from a 
texas prison after an appeals court set aside his conviction but 
each day is like being granted another day to walk upon the earth 
and bring peace to my family 
if i did hold feelings of bitterness or revenge i will ruin 
whatever future i do have if you come within three days of being 
executed you better know who you are and you better throw your 
animosities out the window 
adams was convicted in the 1976 shooting death of a dallas police

scientists began radar mapping part of 
deadmans gulch on monday in an attempt to find the centuryold 
bones of five gold seekers and determine whether they were victims 
of admitted cannibal alferd packer 
under the watchful eyes of residents and reporters 13 
archaelogists and other scientists looked for clues to learn how the 
five men died during the bitter winter of 1874 and whether their 
remains were consumed by packer 
james starrs a george washington university law professor who is 
heading the expedition is 90 percent sure that the bones of the 
victims lie beneath a boulder roughly marking the gravesite in the 
gulch which lies between cannibalism plateau and round top mountain 
about two miles south of lake city 
a grave marker honors the five men who were murdered on this 
spot early in the year 1874 while pioneering for mineral resources

as much as godzilla stomps buildings and eats 
telephone wires hell never measure up to ultraman the benevolent 
bugfaced alien whos spent 23 years battling bizarre monsters from 
outer space 
noboru tsuburaya says the time has come for audiences around the 
world to see the other side of his father eiji tsuburaya the man 
who created the reptillian godzilla japans most infamous movie 
monster 
that other side is ultraman who tsuburaya says is still the 
ultimate japanese superhero and the specialeffect wizards most 
important legacy 
ultraman will be a much greater hit than godzilla ever was 
said the younger tsuburaya now president of the production company 
that owns rights to the superhero 
so confident is the 53yearold tsuburaya that he is preparing 
to set ultraman loose in the most difficult market of all the 
united states a new 13part series is to be syndicated next year by 
new yorkbased teletrib 
america is the home of the entertainment industry and though 
japan exports material goods it lags behind in pop culture he 
said ultraman will change that pattern 
rights to broadcast an old ultraman spinoff series in north 
america have been purchased by turner broadcasting system and 
translation of the dialogue has already been completed ultraman 
will also be shown in the european market primarily france later 
this year 
and just who is this ultraman and what is his story 
ultraman and other inhabitants of several planets in the m78 star 
cluster have been sent to protect earth from attack by 
interplanetary intruders and earthborn mutants which range from 
giant crayfish to fluffy snowmen 
many of the monsters come from tokyo bay making the series a 
statement against pollution and radiation tsuburaya said the 
monsters arent all bad but the wasteful polluting people who 
created them are 
each installment ends with spectacular fights usually in drab 
industrial areas in tokyo with lots of buildings to smash and 
electric lines to break after ultraman transforms himself into a 
130foot 35000ton giant 
for the animated export to america tsuburaya has elaborated on 
his fathers idea having a starsandstripes clad ultraman enter a 
special base through abraham lincolns mouth in mount rushmore 
aside from the cosmetic changes the ultraman story is universal 
tsuburaya said he is a japanese superhero and an international 
superhero 
after debuting on the tokyo broadcasting system network in july 
1966 the ultraman series was followed by seven spinoffs including 
ultra seven ultraman returns and the animated ultraman 
80 which went off the air in 1981 the network still airs weekly 
reruns 
over the years ultraman and his ultrarelatives have done battle 
with more than 600 monsters including godzilla 
but the tv producers had to promise to change the monsters 
name and design to get permission to use the godzilla suit from the 
movie studio which owns his rights tsuburaya said ultraman of 
course won the fight 
like supermans problem with kryptonite ultraman has a weakness 
as a giant he burns up energy at an incredible pace and can only 
remain ultrasized for three minutes at a time 
myojo foods used that shortcoming in tv ads starring ultraman to 
promote its threeminute instant noodles the superhero has also 
endorsed a bank and publicized a booklet on national defense 
tsuburuya says sales of ultraman products including diapers 
chopsticks golf bags and cigarette lighters have quadrupled over 
the last three years 
sales of ultraman goods alone annually bring in revenues in the 
1 billion yen 76 million range he said if hes a hit in 
america that could easily increase by one digit 
in march ultraman starred in three tokyo broadcasting system 
television specials a movie a primetime dramatization of how he 
was created and a themakingofultraman documentary 
tsuburaya has other big plans for ultraman 
he envisions a theme park where a 330foot ultraman will beam his 
smile and cable tv signals over the surrounding countryside

linda leary was president of civic groups and 
donated time to causes to all appearances a welltodo 
communityminded woman 
one son paul heilbrunn was a commodities broker and columnist 
for a local business journal the other richard heilbrunn lived on 
a farm outside town 
but all three now are being held in an austrian jail fighting 
extradition to face charges they ran a marijuanasmuggling ring so 
big that authorities say the people hired to count money were told 
to not bother with 1 bills 
leary and her sons left the united states in 1985 two years 
before their november 1987 indictment they werent arrested until 
may leary was released but rearrested this month after the us 
government protested and attorneys on both sides of the case say 
it could be years before they are tried 
at this point its completely in the hands of the austrian 
government said deputy us attorney john thar obviously i 
would feel better if i were in control but thats just the way it 
is 
thirtyfour people were named in the 136page indictment 
outlining what federal authorities said was one of the largest 
marijuanasmuggling rings ever uncovered it allegedly touched 11 
states and moved at least 250000 pounds of marijuana employees 
counted as much as 15 million at a time 
the family knew it was under investigation paul heilbrunn had 
testified before a grand jury so it wasnt terribly surprising 
that they fled said us attorney deborah daniels anybody that 
has that much money and knows there is an investigation is a likely 
flight suspect 
daniels and her staff bided their time waiting for officials in 
washington to process hundreds of pages of documents at the justice 
department translate them into german and move them through the 
state department to austria 
the three were first arrested may 24 in austria under the 
international convention of narcotics there is no usaustria 
extradition agreement 
they had no indication they were going to be taken into 
custody said bernard l pylitt an indianapolis attorney 
representing leary i have no idea what the austrian government is 
going to do in this case 
paul heilbrunn who shares a home near salzburg with his wife and 
two children believes if he returns to the united states he will 
not get a fair trial said linda pence his attorney here the 
attitude toward drugs is such that it clouds everyones minds as to 
guilt and innocence 
were very hopeful the austrians will give them their 
release pence said paul did not flee he did not leave that 
country at all he knew an extradition request was pending hes not 
going to flee 
pylitt and pence said they did not know if richard had an 
attorney here 
leary and her sons might have been likely to flee in the eyes of 
federal authorities but to all appearances they were unlikely 
criminals 
leary 58 had been president of the indianapolis league of women 
voters and the local chapter of the national council of jewish 
women she was an outstanding community citizen said robert 
davies a family attorney who was acquitted in march of 
moneylaundering and conspiracy in the case 
she did a lot of things for the community she was in every 
organization davies said she was in leadership positions she 
gave the position of being a welltodo communityspirited person 
paul heilbrunn 35 was a very charming bright guy davies 
added 
however authorities say paul led the ring in partnership with a 
man thar identified as jeffrey b collins an escapee from a florida 
prison richard was one of three lieutenants immediately under the 
two partners thar said leary helped manage money laundered by 
dummy companies in the bahamas and panama 
the indictment says the ring imported at least 140000 pounds of 
pot in 1985 alone storing it on a farm in northern indiana and near 
ann arbor mich when robbers stole 6000 pounds from the farm 
eight employees were given voice stress tests the loss ultimately 
was absorbed by the heilbrunns collins and unindicted 
coconspirators richard i bernstein and charles e stocksdale 
the ring operated in indiana california connecticut 
washington alabama mississippi georgia south carolina florida 
michigan and virginia according to the indictment 
leary faces 12 counts including conspiracy to distribute 
marijuana moneylaundering and interstate transportation in aid of 
racketeering paul faces 26 counts including conspiracy to import 
and distribute marijuana and running a continuing criminal 
enterprise richard 38 faces nine counts 
however they could not be prosecuted on 21 taxrelated charges 
if they are extradited under provisions of the international 
convention of narcotics eight of learys counts are taxrelated as 
are 10 of pauls and three of richards 
were in the waiting process said daniels who nonetheless 
is happy with other results in the drawnout case 
i think weve been real successful weve convicted everyone 
weve gotten our hands on the people whove fled to austria there 
was nothing we could do to stop that and we have every reason to 
believe theyll be extradited

republicans think they have a promising target 
in challenging what they call the permanent congress even though 
the numbers show a turnover rate that doesnt match their 
description 
those records of changing house membership and high reelection 
rates indicate that republican problems go deeper than the incumbent 
reelection advantages now under gop fire 
it is true that house incumbents have the advantage when they 
seek new terms and that they almost always have those odds 
confront the gop minority with a particular problem but it is not 
new business house incumbents usually have won from the beginning 
the incumbent return rate was overwhelming 35 years ago in the last 
elections that awarded the republicans control of the house 
today incumbents stay in office for decades amassing huge war 
chests to scare off strong challenges in election after election 
president bush said in proposing legislation to overhaul campaign 
finance laws and curb free congressional mailing privileges this 
is not democracy at all 
but speaker thomas s foley counters with records showing the 
shifting makeup of a house in which 55 percent of the seats are held 
by people elected since 1980 only 19 percent of house members were 
in office 15 years ago 
besides he adds with a smile whats wrong with incumbency and 
experience in congress after all theyre valued in other lines of 
work 
the reelection rate for incumbents is overwhelming 983 percent 
in 1988 98 percent in 1986 but it was 97 percent in the 1968 
elections and it has been over 90 percent in every election but one 
for the past 20 years according to the congressional research 
service of the library of congress nor has the number of incumbents 
seeking reelection changed markedly it has ranged between 85 and 
95 percent in most 20th century elections 
as long as we retain 99 percent reelection of incumbents 
were going to have scoundrels because power does corrupt rep 
newt gingrich of georgia the republican whip said in a speech on 
that gop theme how many of you think the founding fathers 
intended for congress to be a lifetime event unless youre 
incredibly corrupt or stupid or you happen to die otherwise youre 
just reelected automatically 
some of those founding fathers were still around when the rate of 
return for house incumbents seeking reelection hit its record high 
100 percent in the elections of 1792 
in the 1952 elections the last time republicans won control of 
the house 91 percent of the members who sought reelection won new 
terms when they lost it in 1954 the incumbent reelection rate was 
931 percent 
the advantages of incumbency have grown in the era of television 
political action committees and exploding campaign costs but the 
library of congress numbers show trends that have been fairly stable 
since world war ii 
the numbers do not dampen the rhetoric 
i think theres a growing prairie fire out there where people 
are going to rise up and say hey wed like these elections back in 
our hands said rep guy vander jagt of michigan who heads the 
republican congressional campaign committee wed like a house of 
the people again instead of the house of incumbents which it has 
become 
in 1989 you were 16 times more likely to be defeated if you 
were a provincial leader of the communist party in the soviet union 
than if you are an american congressman gingrich said 
foley said the republicans real concern stems less from a 
permanent congress than from frustration at their seemingly 
permanent minority status in the house the lineup now stands at 257 
democrats 175 republicans with special elections coming for three 
vacant seats that were held by democrats 
the speaker said incumbent advantages cant be the real reason 
because democrats hold their own or better in contests for open 
seats in which no incumbent is involved in competition for open 
seats in the last four elections there has been no net change in 
party strength he noted in special elections during that period 
the democrats made a net gain of one seat 
foley said each party might do well to take a lesson from the 
other republicans on the way to compete for house seats and 
democrats on the national campaign skills vital in presidential 
elections since the gop has won five of the last six 
the washington congressman jokes that if the democrats do manage 
to elect a president theyll probably have to hire a republican 
consultant to tell them how to put on an inauguration 
but he said the democrats do a better job in the localized 
politics of a house district in recruiting house candidates and in 
serving constituents the ability to deliver on that latter task is 
one of the key advantages of incumbency that serves the majority 
democrats well especially in relatively conservative districts in 
1988 democrats won 136 house seats in districts carried by bush 
only 12 republicans were elected to the house in districts that 
voted for the democratic presidential ticket

its summer and americans are on the road 
enjoying new places and burglars are out searching for the vacant 
houses left behind 
for many people the perception of a burglar is someone breaking 
into a home in the dark of night but that isnt always the case 
the fbi reports 
more home burglaries occur in the daytime than at night and in 
nearly onefourth of the cases the crook simply gets in through an 
unlocked door or window the fbi has found 
many cases are simply crimes of opportunity with people knocking 
on doors and if there is no answer trying the door if it opens 
they go in and help themselves police explain if the door is 
locked they go on to the next house 
that means a simple thing like making sure the door is kept 
locked can prevent a burglary certainly a costeffective measure if 
ever there was one 
of course that means all doors not just the front door make 
sure there are locks on windows and attic basement and garage 
doors too 
if you are unsure about where your home may be vulverable check 
your local police department many departments will conduct free or 
lowcost home security audits and make suggestions for improvement 
one of the things they stress is to never leave keys available 
outside the home 
once upon a time people left keys in mailboxes or under doormats 
with little fear but no more today thieves know all the obvious 
places to look and check them out quickly 
the insurance information institute which is interested in crime 
because its members wind up paying for many of the losses suggests 
making the home look livedin while you are away 
for example ask neighbors to collect mail and newspapers and 
have someone mow the lawn 
in addition get automatic timers for the lights and set them to 
turn lights on and off in different rooms at different times to make 
it look like someone is home 
a telephone answering machine can be a good idea too that way 
thieves arent tipped off by an unanswered ringing phone turn off 
automatic garage door openers while away 
the insurance group urges putting ladders away and says to be 
sure not to advertise your vacation in the newspaper society columns 
valuables should be locked in a safe or safety deposit box the 
costly items should be inventoried with photos for use in making 
insurance claims and identifying the items in the event of theft 
electronic equipment is among the most popular with crooks so 
make a mark on it to identify it later for example many people 
engrave their social security number on a metal part of the product 
electric engraving tools can be rented or borrowed from many police 
departments or purchased at a reasonable price 
finally when coming home from vacation check the house before 
going in if there is any sign of entry go to a neighbors house 
and call the police the last thing you want to do is walk in on a 
burglar in the act

with all the police and all the arrests new yorkers still name 
drug abuse and crime as the citys greatest problems it would not 
be fair to lay the total responsibility on the mayor and the police 
department reppetto says still the question is could they 
have responded in a better way 
at a minimum kochs response is true to form hiring more 
employees to address problems has been his consistent practice says 
charles brecher research director for the citizens budget 
commission another independent watchdog group 
the citys budget has grown from 136 billion the year before 
koch took office to 25 billion now and most of it goes for 
compensation brecher says city employment has risen from 195176 
to 231982 
brecher says such widescale hiring has serious flaws there 
has been a tendency to associate more workers with better services 
and that has not proven to be the case he says delivery of 
services has not improved in proportion to the amount of money put 
into them 
the problem brecher says is that kochs approach shifts the 
focus off productivity and innovation you have to give him good 
marks for keeping the budget balanced he says but less good 
marks for spending the money wisely 
city spending under koch has been funded largely by dint of a 
steady economic upswing property values have soared and real estate 
development particularly in midtown manhattan has boomed in part 
with the help of citysupplied tax benefits 
one result has been a drastic cut in socalled singleroom 
occupancy hotels the cheap and dreary tenements that housed the 
poorest of the poor the city has lost 70000 sro units in the 
last 12 years says robert hayes counsel to the coalition for the 
homeless an advocacy group that is a gaping hole that hasnt 
been filled 
today the coalition estimates 70000 to 90000 people are 
homeless in the city when polls ask about new yorks greatest 
problem homelessness invariably is the third mostcited issue 
after drugs and crime 
there are many many people of great affluence who are 
suffering great spiritual angst as they step over prone bodies 
literally on the streets hayes says homelessness apart from 
the tragedy for homeless people is sapping vitality from the entire 
city 
its demoralizingit raises questions that are very 
fundamental about our ability as a society and a government to deal 
with problems its not that in 1977 there were no problems but the 
visibility of homelessness as a chronic assault on our 
selfconfidence did not exist 
the city faces other pressing problems that did not exist or 
were not so severe at the dawn of the koch administration acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome with its enormous demands on the health 
care system was unknown the bridges and highways were not 
crumbling so badly racial tensions were not so great the public 
education system had not deteriorated so badly 
now polls put koch after overwhelming reelection victories in 
1981 and 1985 as the underdog in this years contest as he 
campaigns koch points to a list of programs he has initiated to 
address the citys problems and he argues that his experience never 
was so needed as now 
his opponents promote their own initiatives from appointing a 
drug czar to building schools with billions in bonds but when it 
comes to the voting first in the sept 12 primary the decision 
will reach to the past as well as the future comprising a judgment 
on the words koch spoke in january 1978 
we are the trustees of a national treasure the city of new 
york itself the new mayor said history will hold us 
accountable for how well we live up to that trust we must not let 
this city dwindle and diminish we must not fail 
the mistakes of the past are past we have been tested and the 
testing will continue but we have survived and soon we will begin 
to flourish

editors note something happened to xavier suarez after he was 
elected mayor of miami he developed a taste for politics from his 
base as the boss of a culturally diverse city the cubanborn suarez 
has become a strong political influence in hispanic circles heres 
a mayor of a troubled city whose star appears to be on the rise 
</TEXT>

xavier suarez gained national attention when he was 
elected as miamis first cubanborn mayor around here he quickly 
gained a reputation as the pothole mayor competent but dull in 
the land of miami vice 
he was considered by many to be an unimaginative technocrat 
seemingly uncomfortable in public and lacking the urbane 
highprofile style of his predecessor 
suarez steered away from the foreign policy issues that often 
dominate the local news media saying his job was not to overthrow 
fidel castro but to get the garbage picked up 
that was four years ago no one calls xavier suarez boring 
anymore 
from a 5000ayear job which carries no actual executive powers 
because miami has a city manager system suarez has built a 
political empire 
his influence has spread from dade county to the state capital 
and washington as well as to latin america 
with the departure of san antonio mayor henry cisneros from 
politics because of personal problems suarez is one of the 
highestprofile hispanic politicians in the united states 
reelected in 1987 with 62 percent of the vote suarez last year 
was under serious consideration to become secretary of housing and 
urban development this year he was the only mayor in the white 
house team of observers sent to monitor the elections in panama he 
often meets with latin heads of state and travels to latin countries 
as a speaker 
suarez also claimed national attention for his personalized role 
in trying to ease the overtown race riots in january 
in a poll conducted by a veteran democratic consultant in 
february suarez got 76 percent overall approval ratings from 
miamis three major ethnic groups blacks hispanics and anglos 
hes close to unbeatable says raul masvidal the banker 
defeated by suarez in 1985 
still officially independent suarez has allies in both major 
parties 
with all this political clout whats next for xavier suarez 
a us senate seat would always be interesting suarez says 
a highlevel administration position it would take a pretty high 
level to get me out of here someday governor to manage a 23 
billion budget and do it efficiently would be challenging 
suarez has an easy explanation for how he moved so far so 
quickly hes still at heart a pothole mayor interested in 
efficiency and hes learned that the most efficient way to get 
things done is with political networking and pressure 
i used to say id rather beg forgiveness than ask 
permission it seemed better to let everybody else follow now i 
have found that its a lot easier to have people agree with you you 
get things done a lot quicker 
also he has found he has more of a taste for politics than he 
realized 
he learned that his own popularity is a commodity with value 
beyond getting him reelected easily and enabling him to dream of 
statewide office 
if you have good ratings in the polls youre in a position to 
negotiate with both parties suarez says you can exert a lot of 
influence but you have to win a lot 
suarez a villanovatrained engineer harvardeducated lawyer 
had lost three city elections before 1985 he and his associates 
arent losing many these days 
in 1987 suarez backed the opponent of his chief nemesis on the 
city commission fiery anticommunist joe carollo the son of a 
nuclear physicist imprisoned by castro suarez said it was time to 
get city meetings away from exile politics and onto current concerns 
suarez built a coalition on the city commission after carollo was 
ousted that enabled him the miami herald reported to go through 
the two city commission meetings in january without losing on a 
single one of the more than 100 votes in each meeting 
last year suarez backed candidates who ousted three county 
commissioners who had a total 44 years in office among them he also 
backed several judges legislators and cabinet officials in their 
successful election campaigns

he decided to stay out of the miami areas aug 29 special 
congressional election to fill the seat left by rep claude peppers 
death at age 88 
a visitor to suarezs office three days after peppers death 
found him in the middle of allianceforging 
phones rang every few minutes republican party leaders a state 
representative interested in running political consultants 
finally suarez agreed to support republican state sen ileana 
roslehtinen for congress state rep lincoln diazbalart for her 
seat 
suarez stresses though that people who assume he will become a 
republican when he decides to run for a partisan office could be 
mistaken on foreign policy he is more in line with current 
republican philosophy as are most cubanamericans but his domestic 
policy viewpoints run to liberal democrat as do most of the 
nations other hispanics 
democratic party state chairman simon ferro a friend says he 
doesnt consider suarez a republican and hopes to have him run under 
the democratic label someday 
suarez clearly relishes his newfound political standing which 
sometimes evinces the stubborn streak that drove him to spend weeks 
in 1983 searching for his car that was stolen after two months 
suarez spotted his blue impala parked in front of an apartment got 
his keys and restole it 
there are those who whisper that suarezs clout has gone to his 
head 
he angered some legislators this year with a strongly worded 
threatening letter demanding their support for a 2 percent food and 
beverages tax which later passed 
told someone is canceling an appointment with him suarez says 
tell him thats the last appointment he gets with me told us 
rep bill nelson a democrat has been courting influential cubans 
for support of his 1990 gubernatorial bid suarez snorts he 
hasnt talked to me yet 
while voicing ambitions beyond miami suarez says he still has 
much left to do here he streamlined the government of what he 
called the city that doesnt work in his 1985 campaign that saw 
the defeat of incumbent maurice ferre but as the january riots 
showed work remains to be done in the inner cities he pledged to 
make a priority 
suarez has sheaves of statistics to show progress made in adding 
housing spurring businesses and improving services in the 
impoverished black neighborhoods but he concedes more needs to be 
done to lift the spirits and hopes there 
suarez drew praise by walking virtually unprotected through riot 
areas and his ratings among blacks were strong in the poll taken by 
sergio bendixen he said suarez was in a unique position among 
cubanamerican politicians because of his crossethnic appeal 
getting away from miamis ethnicbloc politics has been a major 
goal he opened a press conference with hispanic journalists by 
warning there were two questions he wouldnt answer whats it 
like being the first cuban mayor and how do you compare 
yourself with henry cisneros 
id rather just talk about being mayor of miami suarez said 
that job though turned out to include being a special figure in 
latin america just as ferre had been and suarez had scoffed at 
nearly all latins view miami as something of a suburb he explained 
a place to shop to invest to get medical service to cut deals to 
catch up on whats going on in the region the miami news media is 
followed throughout latin america suarez said 
i did take a low profile on international issues at first i 
wanted to batten down the hatches and get the city moving suarez 
says now i realize you can do it totally parallel to being 
mayor 
for now he will run for reelection in november this time to a 
fouryear term after two twoyear terms he hopes to see voter 
approval of a strongmayor system and also a strongcounty mayor 
system 
he his wife and four young children are planted firmly in miami 
suarez says for the near future 
its a very exciting city concluded its notsodull leader

editors note hes the gadfly of ticonderoga ny a man who 
carries a grudge a long way while serving time in prison for 
possessing an unlicensed gun john wright took to studying lawbooks 
two decades later he put his legal skills to work seeking revenge 
against those who put him in jail in the first place he fought to 
the states highest court and won much to the chagrin of town 
officials 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
john wright has never forgiven police in 
this historic adirondack community for their role in sending him to 
prison for two years in the 1960s 
but he didnt just get mad he got even he got more than even 
the 61yearold selftaught lawyer sued to get six members of the 
ninemember police force including the chief fired because they 
werent trained and tested properly 
the town fought him every step of the way but finally gave up 
this year when new york states top court ruled they were wrong and 
wright was right 
the police chief became a former police chief 
twenty years ago i would have gone out and knocked these guys 
silly with my fists says wright who lives and works out of two 
trailers around the corner from the site of a famous revolutionary 
war battle now i just take the lawbooks and get them that way 
its better 
his neighbors in ticonderoga are amazed not to mention annoyed 
at how far wright carries a grudge 
his story began in 1963 strapped for a job he came to the 
adirondacks from new jersey to work at a bar owned by his mother he 
said people in the rugged mountain area naturally suspicious of 
outsiders were out to get me from the start 
about two years after wright moved in horace snow then a state 
police officer and his colleagues raided the bar and arrested 
wright for possession of an unlicensed gun wright didnt dispute 
the charge although he considered his sentence of 3 to 7 years 
excessive 
during wrights 2 years 2 months and 28 days in prison his 
mothers tavern burned to the ground in a mysterious fire that was 
never solved he says 
once out of prison wright worked in an auto parts store and 
maintained an uneasy truce with police he continued an interest in 
law that began with a correspondence course in prison taking 
classes at adirondack community college 
the auto parts job didnt work out wright whose wife is a 
school cook raised money by renting out other trailers on his 
cluttered property in 1981 wright fought with a tenant who didnt 
pay her phone bill holding the womans stereo and television set 
hostage until he got his money 
he also got arrested on grand larceny and possession of stolen 
property charges although the charges were eventually dropped 
wright didnt forget 
instead the amateur lawyer retreated to his second trailer 
stuffed with hundreds of secondhand lawbooks and a home computer 
by then snow retired from the state police was chief of the 
small police force in this community of 5500 people on the northern 
edge of lake george studying laws and personnel records wright 
noticed that snow didnt have two years of supervisory experience 
and didnt take a civil service examination both required of 
prospective police chiefs by state law he said ticonderoga also 
didnt properly advertise the position when the job opened 
wright also discovered that the towns three parttime police 
officers and two fulltime constables hadnt taken required civil 
service examinations before they were hired 
so he sued 
a state trial court in essex county agreed that the three 
parttime police officers should be fired but the court said snow 
and the other two officers could stay on 
town officials fired the three officers then quickly rehired 
them as constables wright filed an appeal

ticonderoga thought so little of wrights case that the town 
lawyer didnt even drive to albany to argue the case before the 
appellate division of state supreme court wright made his case 
before the justices himself 
in july 1988 the appeals court judges accepted wrights 
arguments calling snows qualifications questionable they 
ruled he should be fired the three new constables should also be 
let go because they were doing work they didnt have authority to 
do the court said the other two officers had to go as well 
the town then hired an albany attorney to take the case to the 
court of appeals new york states highest court but in february 
the court refused to hear the case letting the ruling of the lower 
appeals court stand 
the following month ticonderogas town board reluctantly fired 
snow and the others 
needless to say wright is not very popular at city hall 
personally im not very fond of him says robert dedrick 
the town supervisor hes certainly caused the town of ticonderoga 
a lot of problems 
dedrick is reluctant to say more because wright has already filed 
a slander suit against him for calling him an sob in a 
newspaper article wright has also harassed town officials with a 
series of other lawsuits and requests for information about various 
town board decisions filed under the freedom of information act 
dedrick says ticonderoga hasnt added up how much wrights 
lawsuits have cost the town 
wright estimated hes spent 20000 on the cases he bought a 
copying machine and his bookshelves literally sag under the weight 
of all his law books he cant tell how many times hes had to 
travel two hours to albany to file papers and do research all for 
revenge 
its a personality struggle thats frozen town government 
says fred herbst editor of the local weekly newspaper the times of 
ti the town government has accomplished virtually nothing in the 
last year and a half 
ticonderoga persisted in fighting wright because you dont like 
to see people lose their jobs dedrick says the town currently 
has five police officers and is advertising for others a 
threemember police commission runs the department 
while theres some sentiment against ticonderoga pursuing the 
case when the courts said the town wasnt following the rules 
theres not much sympathy for wright herbst says most people are 
annoyed the gadfly didnt look at the big picture of what his 
fight meant to the town the newspaper editor says 
oddly one person who says hes not angry at wright is the 
62yearold snow currently unemployed he says no one in law 
enforcement has a grudge against wright and hes baffled at why 
wright thinks they do 
im not too bitter about it snow says im that type of 
person he did his thing as far as im concerned out of every bad 
comes some good 
snow wont say why police went into the bar where wright was 
arrested in the first place he said wright had gotten a court order 
sealing the police records in the case and he wont wouldnt violate 
it 
wright meanwhile is taking no chances he has strung 
highintensity spotlights around his property convinced that 
someone will come late at night to avenge his legal victory he has 
six loaded shotguns in the small trailer where he lives and he 
carefully locks his doors 
you cant buy satisfaction like this said wright who 
dismisses those who say he took a grudge to extraordinary lengths 
they did everything they can to me he says they put me in 
jail they burned my mothers bar downits just like a dog if 
you tie him up and beat him every day when you finally untie him 
hes going to bite your leg off at the knee

editors note the banc darguin national park in mauritania 
presents a striking marriage of the sahara desert and the sea the 
islands in northwestern africa are teeming with birds the water is 
rich with fish while the mainland and its dunes are practically 
devoid of biological life and getting there is an adventure in 
itself 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
a trip to mauritanias desolate banc 
darguin national park begins with a moonlit ride down the beach 
where the sahara desert presses tightly against the atlantic ocean 
it takes a determined tourist to visit this park its only 125 
miles north of mauritanias capital nouakchott but then nouakchott 
itself is only 500 yards from the edge of the vast sahara 
the banc darguin is 4635 square miles of sand and sea 
containing one of the worlds finest bird sanctuaries the bay of 
arguin with its underwater prairie of sea plants is teeming with 
marine life ranging from breeding food fish to seals and turtles 
inland is only trackless desert 
there are no roads to the park there are no roads in the park 
no hotels no restaurants no fresh water the tourism ministry in 
nouakchott doesnt have much information about the park or how to 
get there 
and getting there as they say is half the fun 
the easiest solution is to locate one of the several nouakchott 
outfits that rent fourwheeldrive vehicles with drivers fill it 
up with gas and they will take you anywhere but be sure to pack all 
the fuel food and water youll need for the duration of the journey 
setting out at 8 pm ahmed the driver followed a barely 
discernible track for about 20 or 30 miles into the desert north of 
nouakchott finally breaking out on the beach he flies along the 
waters edge on the hard sand disturbing only an occasional bird 
there are no troublesome turns to worry about there is little 
danger of getting lost just keep the atlantic on the left and the 
dunes on the right 
occasionally a jackal appears in the headlight beams searching 
the seashore for a dinner of fiddler crabs 
the jackal is the only wild mammal still roaming the region in 
large numbers a few dorcas gazelles remain the dama gazelle and 
oryx disappeared in the 1960s about the same time the last ostrich 
was seen the cheetah left 30 years ago most of these animals were 
victims of long and severe droughts 
scattered along the beach between nouakchott and the entrance to 
the park at nouamghar are a few tiny villages of imraguen fishermen 
who have plied these seas for centuries as the tide comes in ahmed 
recommends a halt he stops at the village of tiouilit a dozen or 
so slapdash homes made of bits of wood and corrugated iron 
several villagers welcome three visitors to tiouilit and over 
endless glasses of sweet tea they gab till long after midnight 
before allowing their guests to sleep on the strawmatted floor 
talk is simple close to home unpretentious one learns that in 
tiouilit women are not allowed to go into the ocean if they do 
there will be no more fish and the village will suffer 
up early we head again for the beach the pink rays of the 
rising sun wash over the dunes of the vast sahara as they sweep down 
to the atlantic 
in the flyblown huddle of cement buildings that make up 
nouamghar the park lieutenant is located for tourists the entry 
fee is 38 expensive but for a good cause after a courtesy call 
on the local prefect were back on the road 
the going really gets tough here heading inland across the 
desert ahmed follows the merest hint of a track sometimes its 
smooth and straight sometimes sandswept finally it disappears 
as eventually does the horizon behind a cloud of blowing sand 
the last 15 miles into iouik is by dead reckoning 
village chief ahmed baba greets his visitors warmly there is tea 
the long mauritanian ritual of continuous pouring and repouring 
a bit of dried fish ripped into strips a few peanuts and 
discussion about the price of a boat to the bird islands

637 am with two f16 fighter jets giving chase through the still 
and cloudless desert sky 
it landed here at 830 am after performing test maneuvers over 
the mojave desert the plane landed perfectly on the runways center 
line at edwards where the space shuttles land after returning from 
orbit 
the batwinged bomber 69 feet long with a 172foot wingspan 
quickly rolled to a stop without a wobble or waver idled for 
several minutes and then taxied into a hangar the b2 will remain 
at edwards for further tests 
the planes landing gear remained down during the flight as is 
standard practice on test flights in case of malfunctions 
we were very pleased with the performance of the aircraft 
northrop test pilot bruce hinds told a postflight news conference 
copilot air force col richard couch said the plane came 
smoothly off the ground was very nimble in flight and 
rocksteady on landing 
the pilots said the landing was so smooth they had to ask the 
tower if they were down tests included three different speeds 
the stealth bombers only previous flights have been on a 
computer flight simulation air force and northrop officials say no 
other aircraft has been tested more thoroughly without having been 
flown 
the flight was seen as vital for the future of the bomber which 
is already 18 months behind schedule at a budgeted price of 500 
million each the air force wants 132 of the planes it is the 
most expensive warplane in history 
a key congressional committee voted to withhold further funding 
until the plane proves itself in the air 
if that plane doesnt fly the debate is over senate armed 
services committee chairman sam nunn said friday it is far too 
expensive to be a stealth taxi 
as the plane took off this morning the star spangled banner 
was sung on the runway by alis clausen a member of the staff of a 
local cable tv station air force capt tess taft unfurled the stars 
and stripes which was held by a tearful linda tokish 
thousands of civilian stealth watchers gathered among the 
tumbleweeds outside the palmdale plant shouted here they come 
here they come as the great flyingwings dark shadow passed 
over great god exclaimed northrop employee les holland 
im shaking my legs are shaking it was going right over my 
head said shari cutler who came with her four children 
it feels great it feels just fantastic a lot of work has gone 
into this millions of man hours with people working seven days a 
week 24 hours a day we feel just great said air force col 
douglas kennett 
i was overcome with emotion i was so thrilled when i saw the 
wheels go up im just so excited to know that its up there now and 
i pray that it lands safely taft said 
this represents the technology of tomorrow said maj pat 
mullaney it gives us the opportunity to stress deterrence it 
represents a new generation of technology and its the way youre 
going to see airplanes look tomorrow 
the bombers maiden flight had been scheduled saturday but a low 
fuel pressure gauge reading aborted the flight 
after the flight was canceled workers checked the aircraft and 
discovered a problem in a device called the heat exchanger in the 
bombers fuel system the problem was fixed but no other details 
were available said air force lt col jerry fergeson 
the b2 is designed to carry nuclear bombs and along with the 
conventional b1 replace the air forces aging fleet of b52 
bombers that have formed part of the us nuclear deterrent since 
the 1950s 
socalled stealth technology combines advanced materials and a 
special shape to create a plane undetectable by enemy radar though 
the bomber is still being developed stealth fighters have operated 
several years

tim reid is back with his wife daphne maxwell 
reid in a new cbs television show that for the first time he can 
say is really his own 
he and his wife not only star in the stylish romantic mystery 
snoops but he helped create it as coexecutive producer he 
also controls every aspect of the show 
one thing he wanted was a racially mixed crew 
rarely in this town do people have an opportunity to work in an 
integrated environment reid says when i did franks place 
45 percent of the people behind the camera were black this will 
probably be more than that 
we have blacks at every level we have black writers and black 
directors and i especially made it a point to find a black woman 
writer with experience people keep telling me you cant find 
experienced blacks i found them my job is to find qualified people 
in areas of production closed to women and minorities 
reid says its necessary to find enthusiastic people to make a 
show a success 
in the pilot i remember there was no way we could get one 
shot he says but i saw people pull together and go the extra 
mile in television you have to give 150 percent to get a show on 
the air and keep it on the air it has to have a special spark 
in snoops reid and his wife play chance and micki dennis an 
offbeat professional couple in washington that always seems to 
stumble upon a murder hes a criminology professor at georgetown 
university shes chief of protocol at the state department 
the sophisticated crimesolving couple and their clever repartee 
are in the mold of the thin man mr and mrs north 
mcmillan and wife and hart to hart 
reid when he is asked about the comparison to the thin man 
says i hope so 
his wife and costar adds we talked about that concept we 
loved nick and nora charles and the fact that these things happened 
within their lives they didnt go out looking for things we loved 
their repartee it will be stylish i think its in tune with the 
times families and romance are back 
daphne reid a former fashion model who was the first black woman 
on the cover of glamour magazine will be attired in the latest 
fashions for her job and for the many diplomatic parties they will 
attend reids character is described as an eccentric 
conservative who will wear vests 
snoops will be the first time a black woman has starred in a 
onehour drama since teresa graves was in abcs get christie 
love in 197475 if the series goes past 22 episodes it will be 
the first time a drama with a predominantly black cast has been 
renewed 
reid was on several television shows in the 1970s including the 
shortlived richard pryor show but it was his role as disc 
jockey venus flytrap on wkrp in cincinnati that made him famous 
after that he was detective downtown brown on simon amp simon 
then in franks place 
franks place was one of the best shows of the 198788 
season but it was moved frequently on the schedule by cbs and never 
caught on with the audience in that show reid was a new england 
college professor who inherited his fathers creole restaurant in 
new orleans the show was called a dramady a mixture of drama 
and comedy 
hugh wilson who created franks place is doing a more 
commercial show this season with the famous teddy z reid says 
im doing a more commercial show with snoops itll have more 
mass appeal and the stories will be lighthearted you have to 
entertain i think franks place forgot that 
daphne reid says we want to portray a black family because we 
are one we want people to see a black family and have something for 
the community to root for what the world knows of black families is 
what they see on television we want them to see all aspects 
reid will also be seen this fall in john frankenheimers the 
fourth war which also stars roy scheider harry dean stanton and 
jergen prochnow he had previously worked with director 
frankenheimer in dead bang starring don johnson 
reid says he will have a segment on each show featuring a 
washington street kid i want him to do something positive he 
says we had some difficulty finding one for the pilot because 
every kid we auditioned was middle class 
despite the resemblance to the thin man reid says there will 
be no dog we wont drink as much either he says i will 
also do anything i can to avoid a drug story if we do anything at 
all it will be about rehabilitation 
reid created the show with writer sam egan 
we were looking for an occupation for daphnes character 
something stylish and glamorous he says we went on vacation to 
the bahamas and ran into two sisters dickie and fuzzy dickie 
worked for the state department and thats how we came to make her 
head of protocol then when we filmed the pilot we picked a house in 
georgetown and it turned out to be only a few doors from dickies 
house

for richard backus the workweek starts twice 
on tuesday when he begins the first of eight performances in the 
cocktail hour the offbroadway hit by ar gurney and on 
thursday when he starts writing a new script for as the world 
turns the television soap opera 
ive gone from a chaotic actors life to suddenly becoming a 
very methodical person backus was saying the other day in his 
upper west side apartment where he does his writing 
last october the actor was hired as one of five dialogue writers 
for as the world turns the venerable soap opera which has been 
running five days a week on cbs since 1956 at the same time last 
fall he took a job as standby for bruce davison in the cocktail 
hour which concerns a son who has written a play about his 
parents and wants their permission to get it produced six months 
later when davison left the show backus took over the role of the 
son 
it means that i literally do nothing else except do the play 
and then come home to write backus says 
soap opera writing is a highly disciplined tightly structured 
craft on as the world turns head writer douglas marland a 
respected veteran of the daytime drama wars plots the show over the 
long term he is supported by what are called breakdown writers who 
do the plot narratives they write what will happen on a given day 
these highly detailed scenarios are turned into dialogue by a 
third group of writers including backus he writes one script the 
equivalent of a oneact play each week 
the writing is regimented in precise segments according to 
backus each episode of the hourlong as the world turns 
contains a prologue and seven acts made up of from 20 to 25 
carefully plotted scenes 
each scene ends with a little something to make you go on to 
the next scene he says each act ends with a little something 
to make you sit through the commercials and watch the next act the 
final act always has three parts each one a little cliffhanger and 
then each friday show has an especially good cliffhanger to make 
sure you come back on monday 
backus begins a new script each thursday after receiving a plot 
breakdown he tries to get most of the show written by friday 
afternoon but may have to polish up a scene or two over the weekend 
between the three performances of the cocktail hour he gives in 
two days 
the finished script is turned in to the producers on tuesday a 
day backus usually reserves for reading new breakdowns and scripts 
by the other dialogue writers as well as watching taped episodes of 
the show something he is required to do by contract 
in a way its a real factory but its amazing how creative it 
is within the format backus says but what douglas cares about 
and what drew me to the show initially is that he deals with serious 
issues and you get to watch people grapple with real problems and 
he deals with the problems long term there are no miracle cures 
as the world turns set in the mythical midwestern town of 
oakdale is more of a straightforward domestic drama that doesnt 
rely on mystery crime or the bizarre for its plots it focuses on 
character and consequently uses a lot of experienced stage actors 
such as kathleen widdoes larry bryggman elizabeth hubbard and 
patrick tovatt 
until he started writing for as the world turns the 
44yearold backus had never written professionally born in 
goffstown nh and educated at harvard he made his living as an 
actor working in new york theater an occasional movie in 
television and on soap operas including a stint on as the world 
turns several years ago 
new york first noticed him in 1972 in the play promenade 
all for which he won a theater world award and later in a 
critically praised revival of oneills ah wilderness at 
broadways circle in the square in which he played the 16yearold 
juvenile lead at age 30 
coincidentally it was a gurney play children that first 
got backus interested in soap operas in 1976 while waiting tables 
he auditioned for the play but didnt take the job because the pay 
was too low and he had a family to support backus told his agent to 
get him on a soap so he could afford to do the acting that he 
wanted to do 
backus watched as the world turns regularly for a year before 
he suggested to its thenproducer robert calhoun that he wanted to 
write for it he submitted sample scripts and was accepted by 
calhoun and marland calhoun in fact told him that actors make 
good soap opera writers 
its more a process of turning a short novel into working 
dialogue backus says its very close to what an actor does 
when he gets a new play and makes it work on stage so if you have a 
good background in acting you have a sense of what works 
i now think soap operas combine the best of stage with the best 
of film a stage play like the cocktail hour is able to focus in a 
short time on a very cathartic moment in someones life the 
wonderful thing about soap operas is that they can deal with 
characters over a long period of time you get a sense of the real 
immediacy and familiarity that you do to a certain extent on the 
stage because its alive performance

the accidental tourist warner home video vhs 8998 rated 
pg 
 
the accidental tourist was a lumbering exercise on the large 
screen and becomes even more narcoleptic on the small screen at 
home 
it was one of the years most overrated movies with one of the 
years most overrated performances namely that of geena davis who 
won an academy award as supporting actress for her portrayal of a 
freespirited dog trainer 
based on the acclaimed novel by pulitzer prizewinner anne tyler 
the movie illuminates the world of a finicky travel writer named 
macon leary william hurt who is thrown into a tailspin when his 
wife kathleen turner leaves him 
he takes his dog to a rather bizarre trainer muriel davis who 
does more than merely mold the pooch macons reluctant and 
accidental romance with muriel forms the meat of this very spare 
tale 
tylers novel was a sophisticated and bittersweet romp 
interspersed with travel notes from all over whats translated to 
film however is a studied boorish examination of unglued people 
that takes far too long to say nothing and yes there are travel 
notes from all over and they just might be the most interesting 
thing about the film 
hurt speaks like he has marbles in his mouth and looks like he 
really wishes he were someplace else davis speaks like her jaws 
been wired shut her dialogue comes out as clipped chirpy phrases 
there is nothing special about her performance if anything its 
grating 
tyler took the reader on an excursion of sorts through family 
relations through introspection through the human comedy of 
living too bad the tale went through the hollywood cusinart and 
turned into a slushy

salaam bombay virgin vision english subtitles vhsbeta 
7995 unrated 
 
salaam bombay is a heartrending look at the homeless street 
children of bombay india but its meanings and nuances transcend 
that exotic locale 
the film which won a number of international film awards in 
1988 is a riveting portrayal of how 20th century societies 
including socalled civilized ones are devouring their young 
alternately selling them or selling them short 
producerdirector mira nair traveled the streets of bombay 
fascinated by the resilience of the thousands of children who 
survive by their wits in a squalid world of dirt drugs and 
prostitution she decided to tell their story not with actors but 
with children she gathered from those very backstreets 
salaam bombay is the story of 10yearold krishna abandoned 
first by his mother then by the traveling circus he joins he 
travels to bombay hoping to earn 500 rupees to take back to his 
mother 
krishna acquires street wisdom and a toughness that even leads to 
a murder but somehow almost miraculously he keeps a childlike 
empathy even as he is failing in his own hopes he befriends a 
desperate drug addict and comforts an abject 16yearold sold by 
her own mother to a brothel 
the films producers decided to use proceeds to establish 
learning centers for the street children of bombay and delhi 
salaam bombay is not rated it has no objectionable language 
or sexual encounters but the themes of street life are nonetheless 
unvarnished 
it is a truly exceptional film

images om records georganne cassat harp 
 
like some of the larger planets in our solar system marcel 
tourniers images for harp are heavy in atmosphere the music covers 
the gamut of harp effects these short pieces sound a little like 
debussy piano etudes though less complex they were unquestionably 
written by a harpist the liner notes call tournier one of the most 
important harpists and harp composers of the 19th and 20th centuries 
and a judicious one at that we can be thankful he doesnt indulge 
in too many of those sweeping runs such as the kind used as a 
backdrop for movie flashbacks 
these pieces presented here as a whole for the first time are 
fairly simple and pleasant to listen to they have quaint titles 
such as moonlight in a pool replete with rippling run effects 
and children by the christmas crib which nicely evokes the 
choir sound of a christmas carol 
cassat is an accomplished harpist who more often than not avoids 
the sometimes annoying overplucked quality of solo harp 
performances she has an excellent sense of dynamics offering a 
constant interplay of soft and loud passages 
her brief biography oddly points out that she has brought the 
music of the harp to some of the leading royal houses in europe and 
the orient has royalty traditionally been deprived of harp music 
and do those kings and queens feel properly grateful maybe playing 
this disc can make our living rooms feel a bit more regal it 
certainly lends a little atmosphere

cycles capitol the doobie brothers 
 
give one of the worlds most popular bands six years off and 
its amazing how many fresh ideas theyll come up with hardly any 
if thats a revelation its the only one shed by cycles the 
doobie brothers first album since 1983 and their first studio 
album since 1980 
five of the six doobies who reunited for cycles were with the 
band when they first hit the top 40 in the early 1970s and much of 
the music here sounds like the doobies of that period that means 
boogie guitars tight harmonies and plenty of percussion 
the music is professionally played but the formula is too 
familiar to generate much excitement and most of the material 
especially the feeble first single the doctor fails to match 
the doobies best songs of the past 
still there are moments of merit guitarist tom johnstons 
wrong number an anticocaine song has a stirring lyric i 
can read your mind offers a lovely vocal counterpoint by patrick 
simmons and could have been an outtake from minute by minute 
perhaps the bands best album 
but cycles sounds used rather than new the guitar riff from 
the doobies chestnut china grove kicks off the doctor the 
riff that opens the oldie listen to the music begins need a 
little taste of love maybe this album shouldve been called 
recycles

youve seen him as sammy grace tina and 
fernando now the real billy crystal more or less stands up in a 
romantic comedy directed by his best friend rob reiner 
some friend reiner talked to other actors before offering when 
harry met sally to his pal 
it was awkward crystal recalls because when the project 
came to me it wasnt as best friends it was i think you should 
do this film i knew he had seen other people and i was just like 
dying i didnt know the script i just knew the age group and who 
the guy sort of was and i thought well why isnt he giving it to 
me 
when he called me up to say you got to do the movie he 
said i had to go through the process of seeing other people that 
any director would do i wanted you to do it but i just had to make 
sure 
i said i dont know if its any good i have to read it and 
make sure i called afterward and said i have to do it but we 
got to start working together 
nora ephron heartburn had written a script about a couple 
who meet over the years and test his theory that men and women cant 
be real friends because the sex thing gets in the way a lot of 
the material stemmed from reiners own experiences with dating after 
the breakup of his marriage to actressdirector penny marshall 
my job was to get rob out of the script and me in or harry 
in said crystal it was awkward playing moments that i knew had 
happened to rob in his life and he was on the other side of the 
camera watching me 
having been married for 18 years crystal could not contribute 
his dating experiences but he did inject a bit of billy into harry 
i think in the sense of humor the deflection of his pain he 
said any of us who do comedy know or just in life find that a 
laugh is the best medicine this character more than any other ive 
played is me 
meg ryan plays sally in the film which also features carrie 
fisher and bruno kirby as the couples best friends 
unlike his pal robin williams who performs maniacally in 
interviews at restaurants and on street corners billy crystal is 
reflective when he doesnt have a mike in front of his mouth next 
year marks his 20th year as an entertainer and he was asked about 
the milestones in his career 
you mean millstones he cracked lamely 
i guess the first was in 1975 being bumped from the first 
saturday night live as a guest which hurt a lot six months later 
i was on soap wonderful show four years playing the same 
character fine experience working with the talented actors and 
actresses in that show learned a lot about acting there 
my own tv show was canceled in 82 but i learned a lot about 
myself on that show he said i took about two years to do 
nothing but make myself a better performer i didnt do much 
television i wasnt doing films at all i wasnt asked i went on 
the road just to make myself better 
i went back to saturday night live as a host in 84 which 
was a personal vindication then coming on as a regular in 8485 
everyone said what are you doing that for you dont need to do 
that i had to do that i could do the things im doing now but i 
didnt have a place 
during that memorable saturday night live season crystal 
stretched himself with onthenose impressions of sammy davis jr 
tina turner grace jones and most famously fernando lamas film 
work followed the princess bride with reiner running 
scared throw momma from the train and memories of me 
which he cowrote and coproduced 
i dont give up he said im a little bit of a pit bull 
with myself if somethings bothering me about the work and where i 
want to be in the business i just latch onto something and i dont 
let go until it gets better ive always had that survival feeling 
when memories of me didnt do well that hurt a lot because 
i liked that movie i took it personally but it made me work harder 
and better and i could see what i didnt like in my performance 
im better in when harry meets sally you just have to keep 
reexamining yourself and always think that one thing is a step 
towards the next one

from her first moments of awareness as 
a small child henriette wyeth knew she would be a great artist and 
it wasnt just because her father was an american master 
her powers of observation were evident early photos taken when 
she was a few months old show her focused intently fascinated on 
whatever was at hand she constantly drew had read her first work 
by william shakespeare henry viii by the age of 7 studied at 
the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and was renowned as a 
portraitist by 16 
at 81 she is the first lady of american art 
newell convers wyeth nc wyeth as he is known for his classic 
book illustrations and countless other works of art was the first 
to recognize his daughters gifts and later those of her famous 
brother andrew 
the wyeth children grew up in the nurturing shadow of a giant 
where both environment and heredity were optimum of the five three 
are artists one a composer who also paints and the other an 
inventor who holds 23 patents 
we had the most extraordinary life really we were well 
disciplined we had the best music and our father talked about 
everything in the world and with such enthusiasm wyeth says 
and we were all hanging on every word looking for the first 
flowers in spring and that is the way it ought to be for children 
she paints nearly every day in her studio at sentinel ranch the 
adobe hacienda to which her late husband artist peter hurd brought 
her on their honeymoon in an overheated nash on a moonlit night in 
1929 
her subsequent move to new mexico from the brandywine river 
valley of pennsylvania was against her fathers wishes 
he felt i should not let marriage interfere with my painting 
she says 
she didnt as mrs hurd henriette wyeth never stopped finding 
the essential haunting character of whatever she painted from her 
still lifes of pumpkins and squash to the ethereal death and the 
child her portraits particularly zero in on the subjects inner 
truth whether or not the subject might want the truth told 
if you really absorb them the way this nose is constructed or 
that shoulder drops you become the person i think i have a 
feeling about the truth of people when i meet them she said 
during an interview in the courtyard of her ranch in southcentral 
new mexico 
wyeth who counts early american master benjamin west among her 
ancestors says she always knew she was an artist 
we all drew and i was quite certain i would be splendid even 
without my father i think i would have gone ahead and done my 
damnedest 
its all involved in the genes she said all our grandsons 
everybody is painting 
despite what might seem obviously inherited gifts genetic 
transmission of artistic talent remains a largely unexplored 
scientific field says erika stephens a harvard population genetics 
researcher 
one of the major difficulties with artistic ability is its 
hard to define stephens said in a telephone interview from 
cambridge mass these are complex traits its highly possible 
there is some genetic basis for some part of whats involved in 
being very musical or being able to paint but since nobody has been 
able to define the traits narrowly enough we just dont know 
most of us have a strong intuitive feeling that theres something 
there but theres not enough scientific work 
wyeth says i think if you really inherit something tangible 
it manifests itself as a child i went after flowers and colors 
in a letter to his mother in march 1912 when his daughter was 
just 4 nc wyeth reported she was astounding in her powers of 
perception henriette drew a picture of a japanese lily bulb we 
have here and it was fabulously well done 
polio contracted when she was 3 has left her with a gnarled right 
hand it barely slowed her down 
i cant hold a piece of charcoal in my right hand she says 
im drawing with my left hand and painting with my right hand 
she uses a wristbraced aluminum walking stick to get around 
because she injured a hip in a horseback riding accident 16 years 
ago 
how hard is she working 
its intensive she says i used to be crosseyed at 
lunch 
i think ive been doing some of my best work she adds 
henriette wyeth born in chadds ford pa on oct 22 1907 her 
fathers 25th birthday was educated in a montessori school and 
later the art academy in philadelphia but her real teacher was nc 
wyeth 
he constantly played down any success and yet as a teacher he 
couldnt have been more patient warm and stimulating she says 
she started formal art lessons when she was 11 mostly charcoal 
studies of spheres and pyramids as skewed by shadows and light 
there was this excitement over how the light would hit it there 
was always excitement and reverence and also cold criticism 
wyeths portrait subjects have included her father her children 
her grandchildren brother andrew husband peter actress helen 
hayes former first lady pat nixon and others as varied as the 
rolling landscape around san patricio she says tricia nixon so 
disliked the portrait of her mother for its wistfulness that she 
asked wyeth to change it the artist gently refused 
she is not afraid to speak her mind and is outspoken on such 
topics as childhood feminism and television 
now you have to go to that hideous disneyland watch violence 
on tv she says its a horrible blunting experience for 
children now i havent painted any children in 10 to 15 years 
because todays children they are so deadpan 
of feminists i think they are absolutely on the wrong track i 
think they are throwing everything worthwhile in a womans life out 
out 
women she says should read to their children forget the slim 
hips be happy the more a woman gives to people and the busier she 
is the far happier she is 
the same could be said of men she said except i think its 
even more important for a woman we have a marvelous warmth and 
intuitive understanding adaptability and sense of humor 
she cites the late georgia okeeffe as an example of a strong 
independent woman who was capable of singlehandedly changing the 
world the two artists were friends 
people think of her as cold she wasnt that way at all 
wyeth said noting okeeffes charitable donations to indians 
various museums and the santa fe chamber music festival 
the last time she saw her okeeffe was with her assistant juan 
hamilton and one of his small sons 
the boy was rambunctious punching and pulling at her in the 
car wyeth recalled but okeeffe tolerated the childs behavior 
without any sign of annoyance 
i reached across and kissed her hand that was the last time i 
said goodbye to her

back in the 1950s in bugaloosa la a boy was 
born to beauregard and beulah poindexter the famous songanddance 
team they named the child buster 
as the poindexters toured the south young buster built up a 
large following giving uncanny impersonations of carmen miranda and 
louis armstrong while drinking water out of a martini glass and 
telling jokes with the skill of a seasoned veteran 
but on easter sunday in 1959 beauregard was shot in a crooked 
game of hearts by a man in a stetson hat named staggerlee the 
bullet shredding the queen of spades 
busters desperate mother learned that actress tallulah bankhead 
needed an assistant and the poindexters moved to new york 
no one knows what happened to beulah poindexter after that but 
buster resurfaced in the 1980s at a new york club called tramps 
drinking real martinis and performing standards and new songs 
dressed in tie and tails 
audiences young and old responded to poindexter and in 1987 
the singer released his debut album buster poindexter a lively 
collection of rock jazz and soca that included the hit single 
hot hot hot 
and so the imaginary life of buster poindexter goes 
hes really david johansen former singer for the seminal punk 
band the new york dolls and now a parttime actor married to the 
mob who recently spoke of his two very different careers and 
personalities 
busters timeless johansen said people who like the new 
york dolls dig what im doing now the thing about buster i dig is 
that little kids like it 5yearold kids 3yearold kids its 
like a character they can relate to 
on poindexters new album buster goes berserk he covers 
all night party a 60s dance hit suggested by his baby sitter 
wilson picketts international playboy and an obscure reggae 
song poor people 
im prone not to record wellknown songs you can judge them 
against something else said johansen who reluctantly covered the 
animals classic house of the rising sun on his first record 
im in this network of people who make tapes of old stuff 
different genres of music i make some of the best soca tapes in the 
world i got this guy in la fast freddy the mambo king he makes 
some unbelieveable stuff 
johansen grew up in staten island ny in the 60s and listened 
to all kinds of music especially rhythm and blues 
there were two soul stations johansen recalled wwrl in 
manhattan and wnjr in newark nj wnjr instead of just playing 
the slick kind of soul songs also played a lot of southern soul 
solomon burke little walter plus i used to listen to disc 
jockey murray the k and im a big fan of wbais world dance 
party 
the new york dolls broke up after just two records but 
anticipated the english punk movement and american new wave scene of 
the 70s with their combination of crude energy and ironic 
intelligence johansen pursued a solo career but tired of life on 
the road 
i used to live in the back of a van which isnt so good for 
your back or your liver he said wed been traveling eight 
hours a day in a van and youd go nuts especially if youre going 
to talk to some heavy metal guitarist all day youll go bananas 
some guy whos in love with george jetsons daughter and youre 
trying to explain to him that its a cartoon 
performing as buster was meant originally as a temporary escape 
but the acts popularity especially on new years eve made 
recording an album a logical step 
when i started it was just two guys a piano player and me 
then a drummer joined us a guitar and bass he said i was just 
going to do it for a month of mondays at tramps we kept doing it 
because people liked it it built very naturally we added the horns 
and percussion and then decided to make the record 
his fast songs recall hot summer nights in new york with crowds 
spilling out of nightclubs into the streets but poindexter also 
switches moods with an occasional ballad such as deep in a 
dream 
my sense leans towards fun stuff but i like to have a little 
pathos as well i see all kinds of images the beach all kinds of 
stuff the airport i normally do a ballad at the end of the show 
for your third encore you do a ballad otherwise people will never 
leave

just when you thought the old formula 
westerns were getting to be about as tired as a team of oxen 
crossing death valley a new western hero comes to the rescue 
hank the cowdog 
hank head of security at a texas panhandle spread in ochiltree 
county earns his keep protecting the ranch from such villainous 
creatures as dogkilling coyotes eggsucking foxes and a oneeyed 
killer stud horse 
in the 12 books chronicling his adventures hank the cowdog 
solves myriad ranch mysteries while engaging in such traditional 
canine pursuits as barking at the mailman chasing a winsome collie 
named beulah and sleeping in his gunnysack bed 
the cowboy canine is the creation of author and excowboy john r 
erickson who has sold more than 200000 hank books since 1983 the 
latest hank the cowdog the fiddleplaying fox was published 
in february by texas monthly press the 13th volume in the series 
hank the cowdog the wounded buzzard on christmas eve is 
scheduled to be out this fall 
i dont mind working for a dog joked erickson 45 whose 
scholarly manner is a far cry from his protagonists homespun 
character 
a former harvard divinity school student who quit his studies 
just three hours shy of a masters degree erickson spent 15 years 
having his historical novels rejected by new york publishers then 
turned to writing for the san angelobased livestock weekly magazine 
i ran out of ideas and i did a story about a dog which i 
thought would be fun erickson said i picked a dog named hank 
who belonged to the neighbors and who i had known when i was 
ranching up in the oklahoma panhandle 
erickson made the circuit of smalltown church groups and civic 
clubs reading his stories aloud 
the one that people singled out as their favorite was this hank 
story so i decided i should give hank a book all to himself 
erickson said i didnt know whether i could sustain the story for 
that length but it worked 
he founded maverick books inc and got artist gerald l holmes 
to illustrate the book which was published in 1983 
the book in which hank tires of ranch life and joins up with a 
band of outlaw coyotes became such a success that erickson created 
another hank adventure 
for a long time he said he didnt think there was anything all 
that special about the flopeared cowdog with the selfappointed 
role of ferreting out ranch mischiefmakers and erickson who has 
written more than 20 other books mostly about western life never 
anticipated the popularity of the series 
hanks popularity has spawned audio tapes a hank fan club 
tshirts and posters the first hank book was made into a 30minute 
cartoon on cbs televisions storybreak series erickson even 
publishes a catalog of hank spinoffs including two volumes of 
hank the cowdogs greatest hits 
the author has written more than 20 songs to accompany the taped 
stories and performs all the character voices ranging from hanks 
brainless sidekick drover to sally mae the ranch matriarch who 
always suspects hank as the perpetrator of any trouble on the spread 
playing the banjo and accompanied by trev tevis on other 
instruments erickson has hank singing everything from the raucous 
daddy packed his suitcase cause momma was a mean old bag and 
every dog has his day to the tender love song my heart goes 
wild for you and the curse of the incredible priceless corncob 
supplementing the books with audio tapes appealed to erickson 
because his writing style is heavily influenced by storytelling 
one of the major tasks of a young writer is to find the voice 
hes most comfortable with that can express what he wants he 
said i tried on a lot of voices before i began imitating the way 
the cowboys told stories thats when my stories really began to 
click 
erickson uses a folksy conversational style in the tales all 
told by hank himself 
some of the cowdogs zany adventures are inspired by the authors 
own cowdog a blue heeler named sophie as well as the antics of his 
three children 
a lot of those hank episodes come from experiences that ive 
had or seen on ranches he said some of them come from my 
observations of dogs i grew up with dogs and i used to sleep eat 
and play do everything with my dog 
ericksons humorous depictions of ranch life were drawn from 
eight years spent working as a cowboy on ranches in oklahoma and 
texas his stint in the publishing business lasted through the 
production of 10 hank books before texas monthly began publishing 
the books a year ago 
changes made by the new publisher included printing books in 
larger type for children 
the original hank audience was all adults but somewhere along 
the line that changed he said we didnt do anything 
different 
erickson no longer worries about running out of hank plots 
its great fun writing the hank stories he said ill go 
on writing them as long as im having fun i dont ever want it to 
turn into a job because i think the strain would show

seventeen years ago the nitty gritty dirt band 
put out the record will the circle be unbroken 
today the newest lp from the long beach calif folk rockers is 
will the circle be unbroken volume 2 the new double lp 
entered the top 10 on the country bestselling charts in july and is 
climbing the pop charts two singles from it turn of the 
century and and so it goes the latter with john denver are 
on the country chart 
guitarist and founding band member jeff hanna recalled in an 
interview that it was thenmanager bill mceuen who had the idea for 
the first will the circle be unbroken album 
we were hippie musicians from california considered a rock 
band getting together with elder statesmen of country music i 
hadnt yet had my 23rd birthday he said 
there was definitely a generation difference i think 
sociologically we were bridging a gap too the record was viewed as 
helping break down some barriers 
country musician earl scruggs and his sons randy gary and 
steve came to one of the bands concerts and they struck up a 
friendship 
that became the seed that became the first circle album 
hanna said 
scruggs helped get other country musicians to play on the album 
the only one who declined hanna recalls was bill monroe he 
didnt think his fans would understand him playing music with a rock 
n roll band 
weve done concerts with bill in the last few years it wasnt 
personal animosity i guess im glad it wasnt 
all the guests from the first album who are still living are on 
the new one except for doc watson who is semiretired they are roy 
acuff jimmy martin vassar clements and earl and randy scruggs 
recording was done in randy scruggs studio in berryhill tenn 
last december and january there were usually two or three great 
tracks we let the artist choose we didnt splice hanna said 
the entire album is acoustic 
johnny cash sings on the opening lifes railway to heaven 
we put him first because in europe a couple of years ago he 
said if we ever did another will the circle be unbroken hed be 
happy to appear on it explains bob carpenter who plays keyboards 
and accordion in the nitty gritty dirt band 
we did a couple of shows with them in europe hanna said 
june carter went on about how much mother maybelle loved us she 
called us them dirty boys we got a kick out of that they were 
the guardians of traditional country music that gave the idea a 
blessing 
but they didnt rush into it because they wanted to get it right 
the first time was all traditional tunes honkytonk blues 
hank williams songs carpenter said this time we asked people 
to bring in songs traditional or traditional sounding were 
looking at where country music stands now 
our manager read a story that bruce hornsby said if he was on a 
desert island hed want the will the circle be unbroken album we 
called him up for this and he jumped at the chance hornsby 
reworked his own the valley road into bluegrass 
roger mcguinn and chris hillman perform you aint going 
nowhere which they recorded in 1969 on one of the first folkrock 
albums the byrds sweetheart of the radio 
levon helm whose music in the band is now considered country 
and john denver who had recorded songs by dirt band members but 
never recorded with them were invited there are also appearances 
by john prine emmlylou harris paulette carlson of highway 101 
michael martin murphey and rosanne cash in a duet with john hiatt 
june carter was in the booth singing backup with her sisters on 
lifes railway to heaven and she said i could swear i hear 
mamas guitar anita or helen had brought it in she recognized the 
sound without seeing it hanna said 
when they made the first circle album the group felt it had 
to be on its best behavior i think roy acuff was especially 
reticent about what was going on he came in when we were doing the 
merle travis sessions we were auditioning for him he told us 
making the new record was more fun than the first time around 
hanna said 
when pop radio stopped playing country rock in the late 1970s 
the nitty gritty dirt band went nashville one of its last pop hits 
was an american dream in 1980 its first country single on 
which ricky scaggs played was long hard road in 1982 
weve had 15 consecutive top 10 singles on the country 
charts hanna said 
the bands last album for warner bros was more great dirt 
out in january will the circle be unbroken is its first for 
universal 
for the last two years since john mceuen left the band has been 
a quartet with hanna carpenter drummer jimmie fadden and guitarist 
jimmy ibbotson hanna has donated the washboard he used for both 
circle albums to the country music hall of fame

hashemi rafsajani widely expected to be 
irans next president says he plans to focus the countrys economic 
future on developing its vast natural gas reserves the official 
islamic republic news agency reported 
it quoted rafsanjani irans parliament speaker as saying in an 
interview with the radical jomhuri islami daily published sunday 
that iran should intensify exploitation of its gas reserves as the 
best and richest sources of energy 
this should be a key part of irans postwar reconstruction 
program he said 
iran has natural gas reserves estimated at 700 trillion cubic 
feet the second largest reserves in the world after the soviet 
union but these have been largely left untapped 
building up gas as a major export and energy source most likely 
would involve major foreign financial and technological assistance 
indicating that rafsanjani could be planning to revive his efforts 
to rebuild irans links with the west 
his moves to end irans isolation suffered a setback in february 
with a radical resurgence triggered by british writer salam 
rushdies novel the satanic verses which the late ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini charged blasphemed islam 
with khomeinis death june 3 and the ascendance of rafsanjanis 
socalled pragmatists the prospect of renewed moves to patch up 
differences with the west has emerged again 
the newspaper apparently did not elaborate on rafsanjanis 
remarks regarding gas 
but western and iranian economic analysts have noted in recent 
months that irans leaders must make decisions soon on a major 
restructuring of the economy to take the country into the 21st 
century 
the most crucial decision they say is whether iran will 
continue to base its economy on the longterm value of its oil with 
costly investment or focus on gas which energy specialists believe 
will be in more global demand than oil in the decades to come 
iran has rebuilt much of its oil industry which was badly 
damaged in the eightyear war with iraq and is seeking to develop 
new fields 
but because of aging equipment and high production costs irans 
current oil output is about 3 million barrels a day and experts say 
it cannot produce any more than that economically this makes iran 
prey to price fluctuations since it cannot compensate for price 
drops by boosting output 
some industry specialists estimate that for every 1 drop in the 
price of a barrel of oil irans revenue from oil exports tumbles by 
2 billion a year 
oil provides 90 percent of irans foreign exchange earnings 
rafsanjani noted in the interview that the iranian economy is in 
poor shape 
he confirmed estimates by analysts that industry is running at 
only 30 percent to 40 percent of capacity due to a shortage of 
materials energy and parts and that there has been massive waste 
of resources in the first decade of the islamic revolution 
most analysts agree that the iranian leadership must move fast on 
economic strategy 
before the revolution iran could feed itself now because of 
poor economic management failure to carry out land redistribution 
following the revolution and an urban drift away from rural areas 
the country has a food import bill that runs 2 billion to 3 
billion a year

american telephone and telegraph co says it 
will end its sixyear partnership in italian computer maker ing c 
olivetti and co in exchange for a stake in olivettis parent 
company 
atampt said it agreed to swap its 222 percent stake in olivetti 
for a more liquid 186 percent interest in compagnie industriali 
riunite spa or cir a key holding company of italian financier 
carlo de benedetti 
the swap amounts to exchanging a 735 million olivetti stake for 
a 635 million cir holding based on current share prices the 
telecommunications company said executives said that probably 
little or no cash would change hands 
the complex financial transaction was announced saturday at a 
joint news conference here by de benedetti chairman of both cir and 
olivetti and robert allen chairman of atampt 
the deal signals a firstever diversification for atampt outside 
the hightechnology industry in addition to its stake in olivetti 
cir has major interests in financial services publishing 
mechanical engineering and auto parts 
as a result of the transaction cir will consolidate its control 
of olivetti by raising its stake to 40 percent and following a 
number of capital increases will raise as much as 265 trillion 
lire or the equivalent of 19 billion in fresh funds for de 
benedettis financial empire 
one of the planned capital increases will be arranged by 
olivetti which hopes to raise the equivalent of 900 million in 
support of its expansion plans 
the two executives admitted that the original 1983 atamptolivetti 
relationship which combined an original 25 percent stake by atampt in 
olivetti with a wideranging technological and commercial agreement 
hadnt lived up to expectations atampt said it paid about 260 
million for its original stake 
under the 1983 accord atampt bought olivetti personal computers 
for resale under it own name in the united states but these sales 
have seriously slumped over the past few years 
allen told the news conference that the alliance with cir gives 
atampt a sizeable investment in a broad base of european buinesses 
he declined to comment on whether this diversification by atampt 
outside the high tech field would be followed by similar moves 
both executives said the upgrading of atampts financial alliance 
with olivetti to the level of the holding company wouldnt alter the 
commercial relationship between the two groups 
they said that olivetti will continue to supply atampt with 
personal computers for sale in the united states even though atampt 
agreed earlier last week to jointly develop personal computers with 
intel corp 
likewise olivetti will continue to sell atampt minicomputers in 
europe and is expected to sell atampts starlan local area network 
de benedetti said the restructuring of the alliance with atampt 
doesnt mean olivetti is looking for another partner he denied 
recent newspaper reports that olivetti was negotiating a partnership 
with a european computer company 
atampt will be represented on cirs board with three seats 
including one reserved for allen the alliance will last for at 
least five years 
the de benedetti holding company has assets throughout europe 
valued at about 469 billion it had a profit of 280 million last 
year 
the 40percent olivetti shareholding is cirs single largest 
investment accounting for about 30 percent of its total holdings 
financial investments represent about 15 percent of its invesments 
publishing about 14 percent auto parts 12 percent and mechanical 
engineering 3 percent

miners desire to return to work called for an end to unauthorized 
pickets and a monthlong wildcat strike

weekend and approved trumkas request which he issued friday 
id say the vote was 99 percent to return to work nick 
molnar president of district 2 in pennsylvania said today the 
district has 3500 miners at 52 sites in 23 counties 
in southern west virginia and western kentucky however wildcat 
strikers again disrupted coal production today 
man theyre upset said danny wells a district board 
representative in umw district 17 the nations largest with 6000 
miners they are just upset with trumkas call they feel thats 
nothing been won yet 
about 2850 peabody coal co miners in west virginia remained off 
the job today company spokesman tom clarke said 
its my understanding that all of our mines outside of west 
virginia with the exception of the camp complex in kentucky are 
working clarke said 
trumkas backtowork order applied everywhere except district 
31 in northern west virginia monday through wednesday and in 
district 6 in eastern ohio and west virginias northern panhandle 
from wednesday through friday the union didnt explain the 
exeptions 
up to 46000 miners in 10 states began wildcat strikes june 12 to 
support 1900 other umw members who have been striking the pittston 
coal group inc since april 5 
pittston was struck in part for its refusal to sign a contract 
guaranteeing full medical benefits for pensioners and prohibiting 
mandatory overtime and sunday work

excessive fines and jail terms imposed on umw members and supporters 
picketing pittston coal headquarters in lebanon va 
coal companies in states other than kentucky and west virginia 
reported no problems today although their employees were unhappy 
over the backtowork order 
this situation at pittston is not over so naturally there is 
some unhappiness said jerry jones president of umw district 12 
everybody has the same sentiments and feeling 
but trumka has asked everybody to return to work as he tried to 
get the sides back to the bargaining table which is what we are 
doing 
illinois miners returned to their jobs early saturday at some of 
the states 40 unionized mines that had scheduled weekend work 
miners working a shift beginning at midnight reported without 
incident to the central ohio coal co surface mine which covers

creeks elk creek no 10 mine near emmett wva mine officials 
contacted said only that work hadnt resumed 
island creeks hamilton mines nos 1 and 2 and its ohio no 11

district judge glen williams had written to trumka and paul douglas 
chairman of the pittston co parent of pittston coal and asked 
for tuesdays meeting to discuss why negotiations broke down last 
month

with trumka would attend 
the people and mr trumka have to prove that the union is 
sincere about wanting a fair contract said lewis blankenship 
president of umw local 7970 at coal mountain with the letter that

a lengthy drilling spurt stumbled slightly this 
week as the number of oil and gas rigs working in the united states 
dropped by five to total 820 halting a sevenweek trend according 
to baker hughes inc 
the company said there is no obvious reason for the decline in a 
year that has defied common drilling trends 
we dont think the weather would explain the decline in all of 
these states some people have suggested that what we need to see 
are higher natural gas prices baker hughes economist ike kerridge 
said monday 
but there are a lot of things this year that dont make a lot 
of sense he said we saw little drilling in march when you 
normally expect firmer prices and then we saw some recovery in 
april when you usually get declining prices 
the companys rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing 
oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
among major oil producing states louisiana posted the biggest 
decline this week with nine fewer rigs followed by new mexico 
seven oklahoma six and north dakota two 
texas was the biggest gainer with nine additional rigs followed 
by ohio and michigan two and colorado one california 
pennsylvania and wyoming were unchanged for the week

scores of londons famous red buses were off the 
roads on monday as another strike by maintenance engineers stopped 
them leaving their depots 
the 24hour stoppage over pay was one of a string of walkouts 
creating the worst industrial unrest of prime minister margaret 
thatchers 10 years in power 
railwaymen city hall employees and dock workers were also 
striking or engaged in sporadic walkouts and firefighters at 
londons heathrow airport were discussing a strike which could close 
the worlds busiest international airport next week 
unions were angered by pay hikes lagging behind a national 
inflation rate of 83 percent the highest in the 12nation european 
economic community while dock workers were demanding retention of 
national bargaining 
the capital faced more travel chaos on tuesday in a fifth 
combined oneday strike that would all railway trains in britain and 
the london subway 
the national union of railwaymen which has started weekly 
oneday strikes was meeting to discuss a revised pay offer by the 
british rail board which hiked its rejected 7 percent increase to 
88 percent last week 
the train crews union the associated society of locomotive 
engineers and firemen has banned voluntary overtime and restday 
working indefinitely causing cancelation of trains 
british rail was hoping mondays negotiations might get tuesdays 
strikes called off but union leaders said that was unlikely as there 
would not be time to ballot their members 
a threeday strike over pay by 500000 white collar workers 
employed in public services by city halls throughout britain was set 
to start at midnight monday the third walkout in three weeks 
the city hall strikes stop care services for children and the 
elderly shut slaughterhouses as meat inspectors are not available 
and close local tax offices museums and libraries 
on the seventh day of an indefinite national docks strike at 60 
of the countrys 162 ports dock workers leaders from belgium 
france and west germany were expected in london to discuss possible 
solidarity action at european ports 
the visitors were meeting at the headquarters of the 14 million 
member transport and general workers union britains largest labor 
union the union organized the strike in support of demands that 
port employers maintain national bargaining after the abolition of a 
government system guaranteeing dock workers jobs whether they had 
cargoes to handle or not 
the union said the international transport workers federation 
called the oneday conference to discuss the british strike and that 
the dutch had already asked their members to organize sympathy 
action 
the 80 firefighters at heathrow airport were balloting over 
strike action in protest at the airports rejection of their claim 
for a 20 percent pay hike 
a spokeswoman for the management said the airport has to have 
fire cover for operations so potentially operations could shut down 
if there was a strike

product liability causes as much as 80 billion 
to change hands each year for insurance courts damage awards 
legal fees expert witnesses and the like 
but less than 50 cents on the dollar goes to anyone who is 
injured says peter w huber a legal scholar in a report just 
published by the center for the study of american business 
roughly 60 percent is siphoned off by the systems overhead 
according to huber adding that in most states you would be 
prosecuted for fraud if you ran a charity with 60 percent overhead 
that isnt the half of what hubert a businessman and attorney in 
private practice as well as a senior fellow at the manhattan 
institute for policy research has to say about the system 
not only does most of the money evade the victim he says but it 
can be shown that the system does little to improve product safety 
and in fact might lower it 
on top of this he adds it thwarts production of useful 
products smallplane manufacturers for example have been so 
devastated by liability problems that safety advancements have been 
slowed rather than hastened 
it would seem that most private pilots have not read the legal 
theorists he says because most this pilot certainly included 
are begging washington to cut back on their right to sue 
the center founded by murray weidenbaum chief economic adviser 
in president reagans first term published hubers comments after 
he lectured earlier this year at the washington university school of 
law st louis the center is based at the university 
to most people huber acknowledged 1 billion is just a lot of 
zeros but relate the liability insurance cost to the prices of 
specific products and the impact becomes starkly real 
liability insurance he contends is 100 of the cost of a 200 
football helmet 20000 on the 60000 price of a small plane 11 
on a certain childhood vaccine that sells for 12 and 20 on a 100 
household ladder 
the insurance payoff to victims decimated though it is by 
overhead is uniquely regressive he says it is bad enough that so 
much is siphoned off by the system but the system also rewards the 
rich much better than the poor 
wealthy people get much more insurance of the liability system 
than poor people because liability covers lost income and 
increasingly such things as hedonic damages payment for the 
loss of the pleasures of life huber says 
donald trump and donald trumps chauffeur pay the same 
liability premium when each one buys a stepladder or a car or a 
vaccine he continues but the benefits they get are very much 
proportional to their quite different wealth and social status 
huber is well qualified to address the subject and offer 
recommendations he holds a doctorate in mechanical engineering as 
well as a law degree 
first he says we must rebuild and attempt to rely on the 
principles of contracts rediscovering some basic notions like 
consent assumption of risk and other features of a bilateral 
beforethefact choice 
if principles of contract are unacceptable he suggests we might 
give more power to the opinions of prudent competent experts full 
compliance with standards established by such people he says 
should be allowed as a defense 
finally he contends that society would be well served if 
insurability were restored to the system by attacking features that 
have made many products uninsurable and because of this less 
available to the public 
these include runaway noneconomic damages that insurers dare not 
cover such as punitive pain and suffering etc and loose 
interpretations of causeeffect and scientific evidence 
he suggests far too much reliance is placed on the courts too 
often the courts are asked to determine liability after the product 
is sold sometimes years later better suggests huber to define 
conditions in advance

after years of worrying about zappers who use 
remote controls to make rapidfire channel switches during 
commercials television advertisers are facing another weapon the 
muting button 
some advertisers sound off against prospective muters or deny 
that they exist but som industry observers claim the muting threat 
is having an impact on the modern commercial 
you can see how much more entertaining commercials are now 
that i feel is an indication that they are quite concerned that 
they cant just present the product said camille elebash an 
advertising professor at the university of alabama in tuscaloosa 
my guess is that the button has had a modest effect no doubt 
about it its one of the factors influencing the reformatting of 
commercials making commercials look more like rock videos 
sportscasts or newscasts said everette dennis executive director 
of the gannett center for media studies at columbia university 
bobby calder a professor of marketing and psychology at 
northwestern universitys kellogg school of management called the 
mute buttons impact obvious 
the traditional way of advertising is to very early on get 
attention identify the product but that may be precisely the kind 
of activity that signals people to turn off the sound he said 
advertisers can fight back says calder with the same tactics 
they use against zapping such as building interest slowly telling 
some kind of story or creating a commercial so cute that viewers 
just want to watch it 
anheuserbusch cos made such an attempt during this years super 
bowl with a series of commercials featuring a game between teams of 
animated beer bottles labeled bud and bud light if sports fans 
watched the last spot they knew bud eked out a lastminute victory 
one recent campaign for goodyear had no spoken words at all made 
by hill holliday connors amp cosmopoulos inc the commercials 
flashed a series of images and questions such as are you ready 
for a change accompanied by a hard rock musical track 
john f farrell executive vice president and chief creative 
director for hill holliday said the threat of remote control 
muting had no influence on the campaigns style 
zenith electronics corp included a mute button on the first 
remote control device introduced in the 1950s and on every remote 
control the company issued thereafter 
one 1957 zenith advertisment even urged consumers to just touch 
a button to shut off the sound of long annoying commercials while 
the picture remains on the screen 
in 1989 an ac nielsen survey showed 72 percent of a 
4000person sample owned remote control mechanisms compared with 
29 percent of a survey group in 1985 
still while zapping gained attention several years ago many in 
the advertising industry turn a deaf ear to the concept of consumer 
muting 
my gut tells me that its a nonissue i just dont believe that 
people do that said allen banks a media director for saatchi amp 
saatchi dfs advertising inc 
according to a 1986 survey by television audience assessment 40 
percent of 3000 daytime viewers sampled missed commercials but 
muting or changing the channels accounted for only about 5 percent 
other advertisers said they recognized the power of the mute 
button but were resigned to its use 
while zapping is more of a boredom mechanism muting seems to 
be an issue of someone has something else to do i think at that 
point weve lost them anyway said bill oakley the creative 
director on the budweiser account and vice president of darcy masius 
benton amp bowlesst louis

nearly 2 million ford motor co cars and 
light trucks were recalled monday because of problems with emissions 
systems and the possibility of engine fires 
the nations no 2 automaker said owners of 296000 1984 ford 
escort and exp and mercury lynx automobiles were being notified that 
cracks in their cars cylinder heads could leak oil onto exhaust 
manifolds 
also owners of 222000 1985 model escort and lynx cars were 
being told that a rockercover gasket also called a valve gasket 
could leak allowing oil to drip on the manifolds 
both conditions could cause engine fires the company said 
the 1985 escort and lynx vehicles were introduced late in the 
model year ford did not designate any escort or lynx cars as 1985 
models 
ford spokesman michael parris said the company received two 
reports of hand burns most likely sustained when the owner was 
putting out the fire he did not know the severity of the injuries 
or have an estimate on how many engine fires were caused by either 
problem 
another safety recall involved about 28000 1989 ford ranger and 
bronco ii fourwheeldrive vehicles with automatic locking 
frontwheel hubs the company said some of the vehicles may have 
been built without a locking key in the left front hubs which could 
cause the left front wheel to fall off 
the company also said it was recalling about 14 million 198587 
cars to correct a problem with their emissions control systems 
the problem stems from the fuel injectors engine control modules 
or catalysts 
included in the recall are 198587 ford tempo and mercury topaz 
cars with 23liter and 23liter high output engines 198687 ford 
taurus and sable cars with 25liter engines and 1987 ford escort 
mercury lynx and ford exp vehicles with 10liter engines 
the company said testing by ford and the california air resources 
board showed that hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions passed 
acceptable limits 
ford said the emissions recall would be phased in because of the 
number of vehicles involved notifications would be sent first to 
owners in california 
inspection and repairs in all of the recalls would be performed 
at no cost to the customer

texas air corp has little choice but to pursue a 
reported 28 billion purchase of new jets despite the 
strikeinduced bankruptcy at one of its major subsidiaries industry 
analysts said monday 
an ongoing texas air will need to have aircraft which are 
competitive with other carriers and that are able to meet any noise 
standards to be imposed said james carey an analyst at 
washingtonbased airline economics inc 
therefore they have to raise the capital to make this 
replacement to be competitive all airlines do 
texas air parent company of continental and eastern airlines is 
one of only two major us carriers which have not announced major 
jet purchases within the past several months 
the wall street journal quoting airline and aerospace industry 
sources reported monday that the boeing deal would involve the 
purchase of 50 new 737300s with options on 50 more with delivery 
dates as early as 1991 
texas air spokesman art kent said monday the company has been 
talking to aircraft vendors but would not confirm the boeing 
discussions 
what weve been saying all along is that we are always 
reviewing our options and talking to various suppliers kent said 
analysts said the narrowbody planes would be used mainly by 
houstonbased continental which completed a bankruptcy 
reorganization three years ago the airline posted losses of 718 
million last year and 255 million in the first quarter of 1989 
eastern currently is operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy court 
supervision in the wake of a machinists strike that virtually shut 
down the miamibased airline 
robert j joedicke an advisory director on the airline industry 
for shearson lehman hutton inc said analysts have known about the 
texas airboeing discussions for some time 
all theyre doing is basically reserving a position for 
deliveries five years down the road joedicke said prudence 
would say they would have to have some aircraft on delivery by the 
early 1990s 
its something i would view more as insurance joedicke said 
adding he would be more surprised if texas air were not negotiating 
a deal 
analysts said texas air could face a serious problem unless it 
buys more planes because of expected noise limits that will restrict 
the use of older jets and an average four to fiveyear wait for 
airplane deliveries 
in the past texas air has purchased new aircraft under a 
saleleaseback arrangement in which the parent company leases its 
planes back to its subsidiaries and analysts described that as a 
likely scenario under current negotiations with boeing 
boeing spokesman david jimenez declined comment monday on the 
texas air talks saying the seattlebased company allows its 
customers to announce purchases

billion bid for the british conglomerate 
anglofrench financier sir james goldsmith joined by british 
merchant banker jacob rothschild and australian entrepreneur kerry 
packer offered the equivalent of 1369 a share in securities for 
bat which quickly rejected the bid 
we really dont discuss individual cases said a spokeswoman 
for the stock exchange who wasnt identified in accordance with 
british practice 
but she said we would automatically investigate in a bid of 
this sizeparticularly where there is unusual volume movements or 
other suspicious factors that would alert our attention 
prices and trading volume in both bat shares and options surged 
in the two trading sessions immediately ahead of the bid 
announcement 
the offer represents the secondbiggest corporate takeover 
attempt ever trailing the 25 billion buyout of rjr nabisco inc 
earlier this year bat the worlds biggest tobacco company also 
has interests in retailing including the saks fifth avenue and 
marshall fields department stores in the united states paper 
making and financial services 
bat shares climbed 31 cents a share in moderately active trading 
last monday the day before the bid was announced after advancing 
29 cents the previous friday 
the shares rose 333 to close at 1451 the day of the bid 
on monday the shares finished at 1415 up 3 cents 
in options trading 9864 bat options contracts changed hands 
last monday representing an underlying volume of 10 million shares 
the spokeswoman confirmed that accounted for nearly a quarter of 
the options markets total volume that day last tuesday another 
11161 contracts were traded she confirmed 
the average daily volume in the previous week had been around 
2000 contracts including the 4000 contracts traded on friday 
also an unusually active day she stated 
an investigation into bat trading could take months even after 
its conclusion the exchange itself is unlikely to disclose the 
outcome 
we never officially comment the spokeswoman said 
while the stock exchange regularly engages in such probes it is 
unable to bring charges instead it submits its findings to the 
department of trade and industry which then decides whether or not 
to prosecute

stock prices hovered in a narrow range today as 
the markets july rally flattened out 
while the market gained ground in each of the first nine sessions 
of july through the end of last week the debate intensified over 
when the advance might be due for at least a brief pause 
but analysts said that mood of skepticism actually served to keep 
the rally going for a while by keeping the flow of potential buying 
power into stocks at a slow but steady pace 
brokers said the new week began with an added element over 
caution over the impending monthly report tuesday on the nations 
international balance of trade 
the data for may are expected to show an increase in the trade 
deficit to 9 billion or more from 83 billion in april

eastern airlines said monday that a bankruptcy court 
filing inaccurately indicated the companys august schedule would be 
more than 15 percent smaller than earlier announced 
however a spokeswoman said the strikebound airline was 
reviewing its schedule and adjustments were possible 
eastern in a federal bankruptcy court filing last week in new 
york indicated its august schedule would have 330 daily flights 
compared with the 390 it had announced previously 
the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization march 
9 five days after machinists pilots and flight attendants unions 
went on strike and left it at 10 percent of its prestrike schedule 
of nearly 1100 daily flights 
pilots union officials said monday the disclosure proved eastern 
could not live up to its announced efforts to rebuild without the 
unions 
but eastern officials in miami expressed surprise monday at the 
figure which was included in documents requesting release of 100 
million in funds held in escrow 
the 330 figure is inaccurate said spokeswoman karen 
ceremsak the number will be corrected 
ms ceremsak said no cancellations had been made for the august 
schedule 
were reviewing all of the schedule on a daily basis and any 
adjustments are going to be minor and within a small period of time 
in august ms ceremsak said 
eastern has begun reorganizing as a smaller carrier under a plan 
that includes the sale of some 18 billion in assets to help pay 
off its creditors 
the company more than doubled its daily schedule in july to 220 
flights daily and said it would be up to 390 flights daily 
on aug 1eastern intends to further increase operating 
levels to 330 departures a day said a july 13 court application 
filed by eastern attorneys 
eastern unions which support a buyout by chicago options trader 
joseph ritchie as an alternative to the downsizing have argued that 
eastern doesnt have the trained personnel particularly pilots to 
make its rebuilding plan work 
we told you so theyre short pilots and they cant do it 
said gary greksa spokesman for the eastern pilots union local said 
of the apparent schedule buyback buyer beware they left people 
stranded at the gates in march and theyll do it again 
easterns request for 100 million also calls for 50 million 
immediately saying eastern needs the money by the end of the month 
fewer than 300 of easterns 3800 union pilots have come back to 
work since the march 4 strike 
meanwhile eastern has hired 835 pilots 559 of whom still are in 
training the company said 215 are flying and 61 have flunked out 
or left its roundtheclock training program 
eastern which once flew into 102 cities plans to rebuild its 
schedule to 65 cities by aug 1 and 77 cities by the end of the 
year the august schedule requires 580 pilots for 390 daily flights

said procter amp gamble learned monday from press reports of the sale

grain and soybeans futures prices plummeted monday on the chicago 
board of trade as a forecast for cooler wetter weather over the 
next 10 days eased traders fears of supply tightness through the 
summer 
on other markets coffee was sharply lower on news that colombia 
was lifting nearly all taxes on its exports to become more 
competitive in the newly deregulated marketplace heating oil led a 
modest rally in the petroleum futures complex and cattle futures 
climbed in anticipation of a government report expecting to show 
fewer animals on the feedlots 
after the close of trading friday the national weather service 
released a forecast calling for aboveaverage precipitation and 
belowaverage temperatures over the next 610 days especially in 
the western cornbelt region corn and soybeans tumbled at the 
opening bell at the bot and most contract months for both 
commodities locked down the daily trading limit 
the grain prices have been carrying a substantial amount of 
risk premium for fear of another drought said rich feltes 
director of commodity research for refco inc chicago but people 
are coming around to the idea that were not going to have the 
persistent heat and dryness that characterized last year 
traders remained split over whether last weeks order by the 
exchange forcing market players to liquidate large positions in july 
soybeans still affected the market 
the bots board of directors ordered all holders of such 
contracts to reduce their positions to 3 million bushels by the 
close of business tuesday and to 1 million by thursday when the 
contract goes off the board 
the move was widely interpreted as an effort to prevent italian 
agribusiness giant ferruzzi spa from cornering the soybean market 
the company has acknowledged contracting for delivery of some 24 
million bushels while slightly less than half that amount remains 
accessible but said it needs the beans for export business and to 
keep its processing plants working 
ferruzzi lost a court fight last week to block the bot action 
but said it intends to return to court and seek monetary damages for 
losses tied to the forced liquidation 
those who suggested the fallout from ferruzzis fight with the 
exchange had already been figured into prices noted that the july 
contract which has no daily trading limit only slid 26 cents 
compared to 30 cents in the new crop months 
they also noted that the limitdown move in corn and oats pointed 
to weather as the culprit for mondays slide 
wheat settled 6 cents to 11 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in july at 384 a bushel corn was 10 cents to 12 cents 
lower with july at 247 a bushel oats were 10 cents to 12 cents 
lower with july at 138 a bushel and soybeans were 26 cents to 
30 cents lower with july at 677 a bushel 
coffee was 03 cent to 103 cents lower on the new york coffee 
sugar and cocoa exchange with july at 8685 cents a pound 
analysts said a trading skirmish is shaping up in the wake of a 
july 3 move by the international coffee organization abolishing 
export controls on the commodity 
without the umbrella of the ico there is going to be some 
adjustments by the big exporters said arthur stevenson who 
tracks the soft commodities for prudentialbache securities inc 
new york the byword now is market share and youre going to see 
some aggressive strategy to retain and build on it 
gold settled 20 cents lower to 20 cents higher on the comex with 
july at 371 a troy ounce silver was 56 cents to 64 cents higher 
with july at 5263 cents a troy ounce platinum was 70 cents to a 
130 higher on the new york mercantile exchange with july at 
50870 a troy ounce 
heating oil was the star performer on the new york mercantile 
exchange it settled 19 cent to 11 cents higher with august at 
5043 cents a gallon crude oil was 13 cents to 44 cents higher 
with august at 2045 a barrel and unleaded gasoline was 24 to 97 
cent higher with august at 5708 cents a gallon 
some analysts said the surge may be speculation that a report 
tuesday by the american petroleum institute will show inventories 
are lower 
livestock analysts were looking for bullish numbers tuesday as 
well these from the us department of agriculture on how many 
animals were placed on feedlots this past month 
live cattle were 28 cent to 97 cent higher with august at 
7292 cents a pound feeder cattle were 60 cent to 92 cent higher 
with august at 8382 cents a pound live hogs were 20 cent lower to 
60 cent higher with july at 4765 cents a pound and frozen pork 
bellies were 15 cent to 80 cent lower with july at 2907 cents a

dow chemical co will acquire 67 percent 
of the stock in marion laboratories inc under a tentative 
transaction announced monday 
the total cost of the deal for dow is difficult to estimate the 
closing price of marions stock monday indicates that the market 
values marions 155 million shares at 52 billion 
the deal if completed will create a new publicly traded company 
consisting of marion laboratories and cincinnatibased merrell dow 
pharmaceuticals which is now a dow chemical subsidiary 
the new company although majorityowned by dow chemical would 
be based in marions hometown of kansas city and would be called 
marion merrell dow inc 
its just a wonderful opportunity said larry wheeler 
marions vice president of communications this gives us a chance 
to remain a publicly traded company and yet gain access to one of 
the strongest research institutes in our industry 
in the first part of the transaction dow would buy 39 percent of 
marions 155 million shares of common stock at 38 a share or 23 
billion later it would issue new shares of marion to dow giving 
dow 67 percent of marions then outstanding shares 
dow would pay for the newly issued shares by turning merrell dow 
over to marion and issuing a new class of dow securities that 
provide for payments by dow to marion shareholders based on marions 
stock price at the time 
marions stock jumped 825 a share to 3350 in consolidated new 
york stock exchange trading but it remained below the 38 a share 
offered by dow for 39 percent of the stock indicating that 
investors are skeptical about the pershare value of the second half 
of the deal 
dows stock fell 150 a share to 8837 on the big board 
wheeler said marion had been looking at a number of different 
opportunities in the last few months and chose dow merrell because 
its products would not overlap with marion products dow has 
concentrated on respiratory and centralnervous system products 
while marion focused on cardiovascular and urology 
ewing kauffman who founded marion in 1950 and his family 
support the transaction and will tender their shares to dow newcom 
said 
the kauffmans now control 23 percent of marion stock kauffman is 
coowner of the kansas city royals 
wheeler said managers of marion merrell dow would be drawn from 
the management of both companies no layoffs are anticipated he 
said 
jon braatz an analyst with bc christopher securities co in 
kansas city said its a good thing for marion and all parties 
concerned there are a lot of happy faces today 
marion with 3500 employees had earnings of 150 million last 
year on sales of 752 million 
its sales exploded in the early 1980s thanks to the drug 
cardizem which brought in 441 million of the companys revenues 
last year 
marion has been selling cardizem tablets for angina patients 
since 1982 and this year received fda approval and began selling 
the sustainedreleased form of the drug to treat highblood pressure 
but its stock has never fully recovered the value lost in the 
stock market crash of oct 19 1987 since then the stock has 
dipped at times below 20 a share when it had previously been 
trading in the 30 and over range 
scott stevenson another bc christopher analyst said some 
investors had been concerned that marion did not have any other 
significant products under development in preparation for losing 
exlusive rights to cardizem sr in 1992 it recently bought a 20 
percent share in us bioscience of philadelphia which has eight 
cancer treatment drugs under development 
dow chemical is based in the detroit suburb of midland merrell 
dow is based in cincinnati ohio

the worlds leading supplier of the most 
sophisticated computer simulation systems raised the stakes monday 
in the usjapanese battle over the rapidly expanding market for 
supercomputers 
evans amp sutherland of salt lake city unveiled the es1 at its 
mountain view calif research facility touting it as the first 
truly general purpose supercomputer it has the equivalent power 
of more than 60 ibm 3090 computers machines at the high end of the 
ibm line 
jeanyves leclerc president of the companys computer division 
said its design a modification of parallel processing that 
significantly enhances performance will greatly expand the 
commercial applications of supercomputers a market expected to 
reach 9 billion by 1993 
its efficiency price performance and ease of programming 
will make topend supercomputer performance available to a much 
broader range of users leclerc said in a statement 
the trend toward betterperforming supercomputers is driven by 
the need of scientists and engineers to perform mathematical 
modeling improved computer modeling represents a qualitative leap 
forward in science and engineering and could have a major impact on 
every technical discipline from drug research to integrated circuit 
design 
what we need are highperforming systems that are reasonably 
costefficient and interactive said roger anderson a computer 
research scientist at the lawrence livermore national laboratory 
near san francisco 
if the companys machine lives up to its claims it would be a 
welcome development in that direction anderson said 
the es1 which in some functions can run 16 billion operations 
per second will cost 22 million to 8 million 
its highperformance capabilities are due to the fact that its 
eight processors are independent allowing in some operations a 50 
percent improvement in efficiency said bob stevens vice president 
of marketing for the companys computer division 
the computer runs on an enhanced version of the popular unix 
operating system allowing users to modify programs while the system 
is running an option not generally available to supercomputer 
users stevens said 
the entry of eamps into the international supercomputer market is 
another sign that american companies are upping the ante in their 
battle with japanese manufacturers which control about a quarter of 
the market however the companys main competitor is cray 
to show it is serious in dominating the supercomputer market 
japans nec corp in april claimed it had developed the worlds 
speediest such machine capable of 20 billion operations per second 
but nec was quickly upstaged when ncube inc of beaverton ore 
unveiled a machine that can do up to 27 billion operations per 
second 
the united states leads in the development of parallel 
processing which allows machines to divide large problems into 
smaller ones and work on them simultaneously 
the key to es1s performance is a moderately parallel 
architecture that allows each of its 16 computational units per 
processor to either work together or independently on problems 
submitted by other users each computational unit has the power of a 
minisupercomputer the company said

centrust bank said it agreed to sell nearly all its 
branches monday to great western financial corp of beverly hills 
for more than 100 million 
the miamibased savings and loan is selling 63 of its 71 branches 
and all of the accounts in those brances to great western bank a 
great western financial subsidiary the branches have 24 billion 
in deposits 
the move comes as centrust seeks to restore its financial health 
and alleviate concerns of federal and state banking regulators 
centrust will be left with eight branches and 800 million in 
deposits the deal will give great western the largest branch 
network in florida 
by more than doubling our retail banking presence in florida 
this transaction will give us the largest savings branch networks in 
california and florida the two best growth markets for retail 
banking in the country said james f montgomery chairman of 
great western 
curtis cravelli executive vice president of retail banking at 
great western said the giant thrift hasnt achieved the clout it 
wants in florida despite acquiring more than 30 offices in the 
state from other sampls 
after the centrust deal great western will have 114 offices in 
florida and more than 4 billion in retail deposits 
great westerns parent firm has assets of 36 billion its 
capital which is a measure of its financial health is well above 
minimum federal standards 
for centrust the move ultimately will give the sampl the money it 
needs to meet federal standards for net worth the company said 
centrusts asset base will drop to 64 billion but its net 
worth will rise to 4 percent of assets putting it in compliance 
with federal standards 
the 100 million proceeds will also help rid centrust of a 
sizable chunk of its past losses that it has been carrying on the 
books and writing off slowly 
centrust grew from the ashes of the insolvent dade federal 
savings in the early 1980s chairman david l paul in part using 
investments in highyield securities known as junk bonds built 
centrust into one of the nations largest thrifts 
it is perhaps best known for its brightly lit headquarters 
building that dominates the downtown miami skyline

the philadelphia and american stock exchanges are 
discussing either a full or partial merger the new york times 
reported in tuesdays editions 
under the plans which are in the preliminary stages either the 
exchanges would be combined outright or they would merge their 
optionstrading operations the newspaper reported quoting 
unidentified sources 
the merger discussions are fueled by a recent rule adopted by the 
securities and exchange commission regarding the trading of equity 
options the sources said 
under the rule which will be phased in over the next few years 
multiple exchanges would be able to trade an equity option unlike 
the current system in which each option is allotted exclusively to 
an exchange 
the largest market for options currently is the chicago board of 
options 
an option is a right to buy or sell a block of stock at a certain 
price within a stipulated time 
the times said its sources told it that the philadelphia exchange 
was growing increasingly worried that the rule would take away its 
options business since in competition with other exchanges the 
philadelphia exchange would likely be in the weakest position 
because its market share is smaller than the american exchange and 
the chicago board of options 
a full merger of the two exchages would be the first in this 
country in decades industry officials said under that plan the 
philadelphia exchange would be operated as a branch of the american 
exchange which is based in new york the times sources said 
negotiations on the possible merger have been going on for about 
a month the times said
