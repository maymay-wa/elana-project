territorial conflicts that brought about the 
war between iran and iraq eight years ago will jeopardize the truce 
that both countries have accepted an iranian specialist in 
international law said monday 
a 1975 border treaty could be the solution and for iran there 
should be no questions said alireza deyihim deputy dean of 
irans diplomatic academy that is affiliated with the foreign 
ministry 
he said in an interview that both countries had accepted the 
1975 pact and iraq clearly violated international law when it 
abrogated the treaty unilaterally in 1979 
iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after a series of border 
skirmishes 
iran and iraq agreed monday to accept the united nationss call 
for a ceasefire un security council resolution 598 also states 
that both iraqi and iranian forces should withdraw to the 
internationally recognized borders without delay after the 
ceasefire is in place 
deyihim said iran believes that phrase means the forces should 
withdraw to the borders agreed upon in the 1975 treaty between iraq 
and irans government of shah mohammed reza pahlevi that was 
overthrown in 1979 in the revolt led by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
both countries have ratified this treaty and announced 
ratification to the united nations deyihim said that treaty 
settled all problems including the border in the shattalarab 
the 120mile waterway that flows into the persian gulf and forms 
the southern border between the warring neighbors 
deyihim who entered irans foreign service 17 years ago and was 
involved in the 1975 treaty negotiations said if iraq had wanted 
to renegotiate parts of the agreement it could have used the 
complaints procedure that is part of the pact 
he claimed iraq had removed many of about 570 markers set to 
delineate the 730mile border after the 1975 treaty 
they removed them and even pulled out trees that marked 
the border he said 
we hope that this border issue does not cause a delay in 
implementing the ceasefire he added

japans doors are hesitantly open to a trickle of 
americans seeking an experimental antiaids drug that has not been 
approved for use in the united states 
the drug dextran sulfate was developed in japan in the 1960s 
and has been used to treat arteriosclerosis and high cholesterol 
within the last year however japanese and american researchers 
have shown in the test tube that the compound is a potent agent 
against infection by hiv which causes the fatal acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
now researchers are trying to determine whether dextran sulfate 
is effective when given to aids patients and whether they can take 
large doses over a long period 
the drugs potential has received wide publicity and some 
american aids sufferers or their friends have sought the drug in 
japan 
a year ago i started receiving calls from american guys who 
asked if dextran sulfate was available said manabu yamamoto 
manager at the american pharmacy in central tokyo i had no idea 
it could be used against aids 
now yamamoto says two or three americans come in every month 
seeking dextran sulfate 
the american pharmacy is one of three pharmacies in the tokyo 
area that were authorized two months ago to sell the compound under 
tight control but without a doctors prescription by the 
phamarceutical division of kowa co ltd one of about a dozen 
makers of dextran sulfate in japan 
we talked it over with the ministry of health and decided for 
humanitarian reasons it would be sold to american tourists said 
kowa spokesman kazuhiro endo 
endo said the company limited overthecounter sales to three 
pharmacies because if dextran sulfate were widely available it 
would be difficult to give proper warnings to purchasers there 
could be damage and we as a pharmaceutical company are quite 
worried about this he said 
a buyer at the american pharmacy must sign a form in english 
stating how many tablets were purchased that they were for 
personal use that the drug is approved in japan for treatment of 
high cholesterol at a dosage of 450900 milligrams a day and that 
it affects blood coagulation and should not be used by hemophiliacs 
a separate page includes information on adverse reactions such 
as skin eruptions anorexia and diarrhea 
the dosages being considered for aids therapy are much higher 
than routine use in japan we dont have any information on this 
drug in such high dosage endo said adding that if a patient 
takes a high dosage the risks might be higher 
he declined to name all three pharmacies permitted to sell the 
drug though he said their names were wellknown to san francicso 
aids sufferers he said kowa was concerned that people that people 
with irrational fears of aids might experiment with dangerously 
high doses 
the three pharmacies reportedly have anywhere from two to 30 
customers per month 
the company also worries that buyers might start a black market 
business exporting the drug which sells at the american pharmacy 
for 272 for 1000 300milligram tablets 
kowa is not doing aids research with dextran sulfate japans 
leader in that area is a 70yearold chemical firm ueno fine 
chemicals which has no medicines currently on the market 
ueno is worried that its research backed in the united states 
by the national institute of health may be harmed by personal 
imports by american aids sufferers 
from a humane point of view we will not do anything to stop 
the drugs sale to americans said dr ryuji ueno director of the 
department of medicine at his familys company we are just a 
little disappointed though 
at stake for the company is the possibility of a lucrative us 
market if the drug is proved effective 
the us food and drug administration recently reaffirmed its 
policy of letting aids patients import drugs for their personal use 
even if they have not been approved 
but the fda last week ordered inspectors to block imports of 
dextran sulfate from polydex pharmaceuticals ltd of toronto 
canada saying the canadian company was promoting its unproven drug 
in violation of federal rules 
the fda has approved clinical tests of uenos dextran sulfate 
compound but approval for use of the drug in aids therapy still is 
a long way off ueno said in a telephone interview from his 
laboratory near osaka so far he said the drug has been tested 
for side effects on patients at san francisco general hospital 
the current phase of tests which began july 7 involves giving 
patients increasingly higher doses to see whether the drug is 
effective against hiv and to determine its side effects ueno said 
the research is being done at nine aidstreatment centers in the 
united states and will take six months 
ueno said the fda had granted his compound open drug status 
meaning authorities will help fund research and give the drug a 
protected market for seven years if it is successful 
japan has had only 80 aids cases according to the ministry of 
health and welfare so few that the drug could not be tested on 
patients 
aids is most often transmitted through sexual contact other 
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or 
blood products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles 
or syringes by drug abusers aids can also be passed from mother to 
child at or before birth

rene poirier a roman catholic priest deported 
from haiti after he criticized the military government said in an 
interview sunday he told his superiors last week that something 
could happen to me 
i told them that if they heard id received a bullet in my 
head dont be surprised poirier said in the telephone interview 
the priest a native of cornwall ont arrived in montreal 
saturday on a flight from new york 
he was asked why be believed he could be the target of killers 
and said the system is becoming much more repressive and anything 
is possible 
poirier said he was expelled because he spoke out against 
injustice and encouraged the poor to organize politically he 
acknowledged he had refused a military demand to provide a list of 
parish members who attended one of his recent religious services 
he said the troopers who seized him friday did not have a 
warrant for his arrest and did not know his name 
all they knew was that i was the parish priest and therefore 
wicked he said 
poirier gave this account of his expulsion 
several soldiers entered his parish in grand goave 30 miles 
southeast of the capital of portauprince and drove him to a 
prison where he was not allowed to call the canadian embassy 
the soldiers took him to the airport where he was placed aboard 
a commercial jetliner and when he tried to resist they struck him 
with their rifles and threw him face down on the aisle 
it was a new yorkbound flight and after spending the night in 
new york he flew to montreal 
a haitian radio station said the government accused poirier of 
making insulting public declarations which are liable to disturb 
the social and political order established in the country 
a statement by the canadian government said it was deeply 
distressed and unhappy at the cavalier way that father poirier was 
deported and we will be expressing our dissatisfaction to the 
haitian authorities 
poirier was seized the same day that haitis leader lt gen 
henri namphy was touring the grand goave region namphy said at 
that time that haitis problems should be solved by haitians not 
foreigners 
namphy the armed forces commander ousted civilian president 
leslie manigat in june and sent him into exile namphy headed a 
threeman junta that had ruled haiti for two years after dictator 
jeanclaude duvalier fled the country during violent protests in 
february 1986 duvalier now lives in france

elephants at the beijing zoo have forgotten the 
taste of bananas and tigers are now rarely thrown a live chicken 
hard times have befallen their keepers 
the official china daily said today that the 3000 animals 
birds and fish at chinas largest zoo have come across lean days 
because of inadequate funding and sharp rises in food prices 
with the quadrupling of banana prices in recent years elephants 
have been put on a diet of nutritious but less palatable carrots 
zoo officials said 
tigers now get just two meals a day down from three and are 
fasting one day a week zoo officials said explaining that the big 
cats are used to eating irregularly in the wild 
in addition tigers lions and other carnivores that used to 
have a twiceweekly treat of a live chicken or rabbit now feast on 
such delicacies only when they are sick or weak 
the report said the zoo had to give away its most popular seal 
because it couldnt afford the annual expense of up to 13500 in 
fish 
we dont want to adopt these cruel measures but as our budget 
is tightened there seems to be no other way around the report 
quoted jiang hongtao office director of the zoo as saying 
the daily said expenses at the zoo have shot up from 11 
million in 1984 to 19 million last year 
the state last year provided 810000 and the zoo had to make 
up the rest by introducing video games bumper cars and other 
sources of recreation admission to the zoo costs less than a 
nickel 
the zoos chief accountant yang qingchuan said expenses may 
double next year because of swiftly rising food costs 
consumer prices rose 19 percent in june compared to the same 
month in 1987 while prices of some food items have nearly doubled 
in the past year with the elimination of some government price 
controls 
the zoo opened in 1908 and is home to rare animals such as the 
giant panda and the golden monkey it is one of the capitals main 
tourist attractions

americans believe the united states has moved 
toward racial equality during the past quarter century but a 
majority say society remains racist overall a media 
generalassociated press poll has found 
twentyfive years after the rev martin luther king jr declared 
his dream of equal opportunity more than eight in 10 respondents 
in the poll said the goal is closer and seven in 10 said it is 
attainable 
but while 54 percent said blacks and other minorities have the 
same opportunities as whites in the united states a sizable 42 
percent of all respondents including 69 percent of blacks 
disagreed 
there were other measures of concern over inequality found by 
the national survey of 1223 adults among them 
respondents were evenly divided on whether minorities receive 
equal treatment in the nations criminal justice system and three 
in 10 said minorities are denied justice because of their race 
of those who said racial equality can be achieved four in 10 
said it would not occur within their lifetimes 
majorities in all education income and ideological groups and 
all but the oldest age group said american society is racist 
overall fiftythree percent of whites agreed as did 68 percent of 
blacks in all 55 percent said society is racist 37 percent said 
not and the rest had no opinion 
it was a quarter century ago in august 1963 that king 
delivered his celebrated i have a dream speech to 200000 
demonstrators in washington establishing civil rights at the 
forefront of the nations social agenda 
i have a dream that one day on the red hills of georgia sons 
of former slaves and sons of former slave owners will be able to 
sit down together at the table of brotherhood king said i 
have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a 
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin 
but by the content of their character 
the civil rights act became law a year later prompting sweeping 
changes in the thensegregated south but many americans in the 
poll particularly the bettereducated indicated that the advances 
are not complete 
among respondents with postgraduate degrees only 28 percent 
said blacks and other minorities have the same opportunities as 
whites now by contrast 65 percent of those with only high school 
diplomas said there is equality 
on the question of the criminal justice system 46 percent of 
whites said minorities received equal treatment but 40 percent 
said not and nearly 15 percent didnt know sixtyone percent of 
blacks said minorities did not receive equal treatment in the 
criminal justice system 
even with the perceptions of inequality the poll found divided 
opinion among blacks and solid opposition among whites to the 
practice of giving minorities preference in hiring and college 
admissions to address past inequalities 
fortyeight percent of blacks were in favor and 44 percent were 
opposed to preferential treatment in hiring and they split 4447 
on preference in college admissions more than 80 percent of whites 
opposed both 
despite their sense of racism and discrimination in society 94 
percent of the blacks said they had close friends who are white a 
smaller share of whites 67 percent said they had close friends 
who are black

more than 50 cars of a freight train 
derailed monday causing tankers to break open and spill a 
flammable industrial solvent and forcing the evacuation of about 
300 people overnight authorities said 
authorities built a dike using booms supplied by the us coast 
guard to keep the pool of liquid xylene from flowing into nearby 
beaver dam creek said lucy justus spokeswoman for the state 
environmental protection division 
the elbert county sheriffs department and officials with csx 
transportation inc estimated 57 cars in the 95car csx train 
derailed about 130 pm in this rural community 
elbert memorial hospital reported treating about 20 people who 
had breathed fumes from the liquid chemical which is used in 
aviation fuel and as a solvent for resins enamels and lacquers 
none were seriously injured and all were released after they 
were washed down and looked at by a physician said tom johnson 
a hospital official 
the primary hazard is that it xylene is flammable there are 
vapors and fumes which are mildly toxic by inhalation or 
ingestion ms justus said 
the fractured tanker which contained about 30000 gallons of 
xylene leaked its contents at a rate that grew to 3000 gallons an 
hour she said a second tanker also was leaking the chemical 
although at a much slower rate she said five of the derailed cars 
contained xylene she said 
csx transportation spokesman ripley watson said the train which 
was headed to hamlet nc from atlanta also carried coal pulp 
board lumber soybean meal and a number of piggybacked truck 
trailers 
he said the train was going about 35 mph when it derailed there 
was no immediate indication of what caused the derailment 
cleanup was expected to begin after daylight tuesday ms justus 
said the liquid probably would be allowed to soak into the dirt 
field where it spilled and the contaminated soil would be dug up 
and taken to a hazardous waste landfill 
the elberton civic center was set up as a clearing house for aid 
to the evacuees most found shelter at motels or at the homes of 
family and friends in the area although the rev gary purvis 
pastor of first baptist church of elberton said he expected some 
evacuees would sleep on the pews at his church 
middleton is four miles northeast of elberton in eastern 
georgia about midway between atlanta and columbia sc

when caterpillar inc struts its stuff it 
does it in a big way 
the company staged a power parade sunday displaying 15 
million worth of its finest earthmoving equipment in a showcase of 
sophisticated engineering and raw power for 10000 customers and 
employees 
the peoriabased caterpillar trotted out 76 machines from the 
largest tracktype tractor in production on any assembly line down 
to its smallest paving vehicle 
the demonstration track built near peoria for the parade looked 
like a giant construction site scrapers used in highway 
construction pulled up dirt and dumped it back excavators dug 
holes filled their buckets with dirt and then loaded empty dump 
trucks used in mining and construction 
graders leveled the rumpled ground and compactors rumbled along 
packing the dirt down again 
there were tests of strength for hydraulicpowered swing arms 
other machines did pushups intricate driving and even waved to

former nbc reporter linda ellerbee said she 
was afraid that colleague jessica savitch was on a suicidal course 
because of problems including drug use but her approaches to 
network management went unheeded 
savitch was killed in a car accident oct 26 1983 in new hope 
pa the accident was not linked to drug use 
recent books about savitch describe her as a tormented women who 
was well aware that she had moved up the ladder on her appealing 
presence and was resented by more experienced colleagues 
her career nosedived after a disastrous newsbrief in which she 
appeared on the air virtually incoherent 
at one point ellerbee said i went to nbc management and 
said you have to do something this womans in trouble an nbc 
vice president said to me were afraid to do anything were 
afraid shell kill herself on our time 
ellerbee says on the first installment of the new latenight 
talk show later with bob costas to be broadcast aug 22 that 
she and her nbc correspondents decided to try to help savitch 
ellerbee said she former nbc correspondent john hart and other 
nbc news colleagues met in ellerbees office and decided hart would 
get advice from his psychiatrist on how to approach savitch but 
she died in the car wreck that weekend 
savitchs story is worth telling ellerbee said as a 
cautionary tale for young women and men entering the television 
news field 
ellerbee who now freelances her commentary and hopes to have a 
pbs version of abcs our world says television news has 
changed little in its attitude toward women who go into the 
business 
jessica is just what the business wanted she said lets 
be candid what the men who run the business wanted she looked 
the part and they didnt care that she wasnt a very good reporter 
and that she wasnt a very good writer 
they just wanted what they wanted out of her and its a 
tragedy that they didnt want more jessica might have been able to 
give more had they expected more from the very beginning

a surrogate campaigner for george bush has 
been trying to reassure the political right that the vice president 
isnt straying too far from conservative doctrine as he moves 
toward the center in his presidential campaign 
the surrogates name is ronald reagan 
increasingly the president sprinkles his speeches with such 
phrases as vice president bush and i and nancy vice 
president bush and me 
he also has both praised and glossed over positions that bush 
has taken that are at variance with his own conservative stands 
in a recent speech to a group of evangelical youth for example 
he tackled the issue of day care for children reagan has opposed 
governmentsubsidized child care proposals 
bush however trails in the polls among women voters and has 
attempted to close that gender gap with proposals including a 
22 billion plan to give lowincome families a 1000perchild 
tax credit for day care 
conservatives have generally been against this kind of thing 
and it is one of a number of issues on which bush has been 
exploring new territory in a campaign that is expected to be fought 
out in the political center 
reagan speaking to the student congress on evangelism 
approached the matter this way 
vice president bush has proposed an innovative plan one that 
would strengthen the family the basic idea here is that the 
government would simply let families keep up to 1000 more of 
their own money thats money the family itself can decide how to 
spend working mothers could put the money toward child care but 
by giving each family this tax credit the vice presidents plan 
would also permit thousands of mothers to choose to stay home with 
their children 
reagan suggests that even though it goes against the grain of 
traditional conservative thought bushs daycare program is really 
profamily and amounts to a kind of tax cut things that 
conservatives like 
the president also tiptoed around the differences between his 
position and the vice presidents on abortion 
bush has said he would accept abortion if necessary to save the 
life of the mother or in instances of rape and incest the 
president has said repeatedly he would accept the operation only if 
needed to save the mothers life 
the way reagan spelled it out to the evangelicals was 
many who seek abortions do so in harrowing circumstances and 
just as tolerance means accepting that many in good faith hold 
views different from our own it also means that no man or woman 
should sit in judgment on another i believe and vice president 
bush believes with me that we must rise above bitterness and 
reproach to find positive answers to the tragedy of abortion 
no mention of their differences just positive answers for 
people in harrowing circumstances 
as the campaign goes on bush is expected to stake out 
increasingly independent stands 
hes talking about education hes talking about child care 
soon he is going to be talking about flexibility in defense 
posture hes talking about public service said stephen j 
wayne a specialist in the presidency and electoral politics at 
george washington university 
not the usual fare for conservative rallies 
so are reagans explanations part of a plan to bolster bushs 
conservative credentials 
i dont know if it has been strategically laid out as such 
but it makes sense said daniel l casey executive director of 
the american conservative union that is probably the single best 
way to use him

michael dukakis challenge to debate george bush 
on foreign policy and defense is the democratic presidential 
nominees confident counterattack in an area that could be either a 
weakness or a weapon for him 
dukakis staff seemed taken aback by bushs claim last week that 
dukakis would unilaterally disarm the nation an unusually 
aggressive attack at this early stage of the general election 
campaign 
shrill was the way dukakis described it as he delivered a 
series of escalating responses ending in the call for a 
midseptember debate on the issue 
it had already been clear however that bush would strive to 
paint dukakis as inexperienced and out of step on national security 
matters as the vice president moved to recover from a substantial 
deficit in the polls 
foreign policy defense and national security concerns are 
widely regarded as the weakest areas for dukakis for a variety of 
reasons it is the one area in which dukakis a statehouse 
politician has no record and despite his familiarity with several 
languages dukakis is not a veteran traveler to foreign capitals 
bush for all his image problems can point to his experience in 
the international arena even before his vice presidency as 
ambassador to china and cia director 
but dukakis has been hammering away at bush on the foreign 
affairs missteps of the reagan administration the dukakis campaign 
clearly believes that bush is vulnerable on the irancontra affair 
dealings with panamanian strongman manuel noriega the pentagon 
contracting scandal and other problems 
dukakis raised that criticism to a new level on friday while 
campaigning in california when he said bush doesnt have what it 
takes to run the country 
anybody who sits there and does nothing while we trade arms to 
the ayatollah and says he didnt know that noriega was doing drugs 
and running drugs and is a suspected murderer and went to the 
philippines in the early 80s and commended ferdinand marcos for 
his commitment to democracy in my judgment doesnt have what it 
takes to lead this country when it comes to foreign policy 
dukakis said 
a day earlier however dukakis had fed the impression he could 
misstep on military issues when he was questioned about bushs 
charges asked initially if he still supported a nuclear freeze 
which was debated before arms reduction talks began in 1985 
dukakis responded sure 
moments later aboard his campaign jet dukakis aides hastily 
arranged a news conference and brought the candidate back to where 
reporters were sitting on the plane there when asked he 
clarified his response and said that the issue had moved beyond the 
question of a nuclear freeze to that of arms reductions 
the reason we were all for the freeze originally was because 
we wanted to stop the administration from expanding the arsenal 
dukakis said he said that had changed now that negotiations 
centered on reductions 
did i favor the freeze sure im for reductions now sos the 
administration he said im for developing certain weapons 
systems and for substantially reducing others 
in attacking the democratic nominee bush pointed to dukakis 
opposition to some new systems particularly landbased nuclear 
weapons dukakis has said he doesnt rule out modernization of the 
landbased arsenal that is producing a new type of missile yet 
he opposes current options the mx and the smaller midgetman 
dukakis aides point to his support for other systems such as 
the new trident submarinebased missile and cruise missiles and 
for development of the bombcarrying stealth aircraft 
dukakis generally prefers to talk about his plans to beef up 
conventional forces although he has not been specific on how to 
pay for expensive upgrades in equipment weaponry supplies and 
training it is on conventional forces that he can be expected to 
focus if he gets that debate with bush

the owners of 1988 passenger vans and large 
sedans are likely to have fewer damage claims and lower repair 
bills while those who own sports cars and some compact cars may 
not be as lucky according to an insurance industry report 
the study by the highway loss data institute an insurance 
research group examined both the frequency of insurance collision 
claims and the average amount of the claim for 60 new cars that had 
repairs paid through insurance policies during the first nine 
months of the 1988 model year 
even among cars of the same size class and body style there 
were large variations in results the insurance group said but 
it said that in general larger cars had a better collision loss 
record than smaller vehicles 
the average claim payment ranged from 800 to 3500 depending 
on the type of vehicle the frequency of claims ranged from six to 
nearly 17 per 100 vehicles the study said 
the study did not provide dollar amounts for all vehicle claims 
but said the average repair bill for the 60 cars was 1921 the 
average number of claims filed was 111 per 100 insured vehicles 
it singled out the chevrolet astro van as having the lowest 
average loss payment per claim 60 percent lower than average for 
all passenger vehicles examined the jaguar xj6 had the highest 83 
percent higher than average for all cars while the mazda mx6 and 
the ford mustang also had average repair costs per claim that were 
at least 50 percent higher than average 
the study said the passenger vehicles with substantially 
better than average results in both frequency of claims and 
average cost of repairs also were vans the plymouth grand voyager 
and dodge caravan and two large 4door sedans the chevrolet 
caprice and the mercury grand marquis 
all four of these vehicles had claim frequencies and loss 
payments at least 30 percent below the average for all cars 
the least number of claims per vehicles on the road involved the 
4door cadillac deville which had 46 percent fewer claims than 
average for all cars 
at the other extreme the cars with the poorest showing in both 
claim frequencies and repair costs were the ford mustang and 
chevrolet camaro both in the sportsspeciality category and 
the 2door mazda mx6 in the small car category 
all three had claim frequencies and loss payments more than 20 
percent above average the mustang had more than twice the average 
repair cost than reported for all cars the highest among the 60 
cars and 32 percent more claims 
the 2door toyota celica had the most number of claims 53 
percent more than the average for all cars 
while both the number of claims and the average cost of repairs 
ranged widely among vehicles of different size and design the 
insurance group said they also varied significantly within groups 
of basically similar cars 
for example the frequency of claims among the small cars 
ranged from 12 percent below average for the mercury tracer to 53 
percent above average for the toyota celica and 46 percent above 
average for the pontiac lemans 
in the midsize category the frequency of claims ranged from 32 
percent below average for the chevrolet celebrity to 29 percent 
above average for the renault medallion repair costs ranged from 
21 percent below average per claim for the celebrity to 25 percent 
above average for the chevrolet cavalier 
the study examined 60 model 1988 passenger vehicles that had 
collision claims filed from june 1987 through february 1988 while 
there are about 400 various 1988 car types only 60 had sufficient 
highway exposure during the period to be included in the study the 
institute said

here are the relative frequency of claims and 
repair cost comparisions of 1988 model cars examined by the 
insurance industry according to the highway loss data institute 
the number in each column reflects relative claim frequencies or 
repair costs compared to the average reflected by the figure 100 
for all cars examined for claim frequency 100 is equivalent to 
111 claims per 100 insured vehicles for average loss payment per 
claim 100 is equivalent to 1921 
example a claim frequency 123 would reflect 23 percent more 
claims than average for all vehicles listed a claim frequency of 
88 would reflect 12 percent fewer claims than average for all 
vehicles listed a repair cost figure of 82 reflects a cost 18 
percent lower than average while a repair cost figure of 166 
reflects a cost 66 percent higher than average

federal officials have begun contingency 
planning in case an outofcontrol russian satellite powered by a 
nuclear reactor plunges to earth inside the united states 
at the moment we dont anticipate at all that it will land on 
the united states says peg malloy a spokeswoman for the federal 
emergency management agency but we need to have our act together 
to respond to any catastrophic emergency so were coordinating an 
interagency effort right now 
the planning work has drawn together representatives from the 
departments of defense state health and human services and energy 
in addition to the environmental protection agency the spokeswoman 
added 
the various agencies are working to tailor femas general 
federal radiological emergency response plan to deal with the 
possibility of radioactive satellite pieces being spread across the 
countryside ms malloy said 
the agencys radiological emergency plan was originally 
developed in the wake of the threemile island nuclear plant 
disaster she added 
the concern of the planners is a nuclearpowered 
oceansurveillance satellite launched by the soviet union last 
december 12 to keep track of us navy vessels the satellite 
designated by the soviets as cosmos 1900 began its life in space 
in a low circular orbit about 160 miles above the earths surface 
soviet controllers unexpectedly lost radio contact with the 
craft in april and the russian news agency tass reported may 11 
that the satellite could fall to earth in august or september 
soviet officials have insisted there is no reason to fear 
radioactive debris from the spacecrafts reentry but according to 
pentagon officials the soviets have apparently been unable to 
separate either the nuclear reactor or the fuel section from the 
rest of the satellite two common safeguards 
that raises the possibility cosmos 1900 could reenter the 
atmosphere in one piece meaning it might not burn up completely 
that could spread harmful radioactive debris just as cosmos 954 
did over canada in 1978 
at the moment its still a onepiece satellite navy cmdr 
dugald gillies a spokesman for the us space command said 
recently 
the orbit of cosmos 1900 is continuing to decay and the 
spacecraft is now under constant surveillance gillies said 
reentry is not imminent he said but the period for a 
revolution is continuing to decline and its continuing to come in 
closer to earth were keeping a close watch on it 
while the us space command is not yet prepared to predict when 
the russian satellite will reenter the atmosphere the european 
space agency in paris said last week it thought the plunge would 
occur in midseptember 
cosmos 1900 is expected to reenter around the middle of 
september give or take four weeks the agency said in a 
statement only a few days before the satellite reenters can the 
entry location be predicted 
until then experts can only say that cosmos 1900 will 
reenter somewhere between latitudes 65 degrees north and 65 
degrees south meaning anywhere in the world between the arctic 
and antarctic circles 
its not coming down as fast as originally anticipated but 
its coming down added ms malloy 
should cosmos 1900 fall within us borders fema will have an 
emergency response team ready she said 
the size and composition of the response team will depend upon a 
variety of factors including whether the satellite debris is 
radioactive and where it lands she said 
the soviet union has launched more than 30 nuclearpowered 
satellites over the years and in at least two cases radioactive 
debris from such satellites has fallen to the earths surface 
besides the crash of cosmos 954 over canada in 1978 the nuclear 
core of cosmos 1402 splashed into the indian ocean in 1983

rupert murdoch has agreed to buy triangle 
publications inc for 3 billion in one of the most expensive media 
deals ever and one that would add tv guide the nations 
largestselling weekly magazine to his empire 
the purchase of the privatelyheld company from walter annenberg 
includes two other publications the daily racing form and 
seventeen magazine murdoch said sunday 
these publications are the most valuable and prized publishing 
properties in the world murdoch said in a statement announcing 
the purchase by his news corp 
the purchase of tv guide raises antitrust questions because of 
murdochs ownership of the fox television network said andrew j 
schwartzman executive director of the media access project a 
washington dcbased public interest telecommunications firm 
but a spokesman for murdoch said tv guide would be run 
separately from murdochs other holdings which include newspapers 
and magazines on four continents 
murdoch began negotiating with the 80yearold annenberg for 
triangle a month ago 
they the triangle publications have been developed 
brilliantly by ambassador annenberg and we plan to make them the 
cornerstone of a great american publishing company murdoch said 
annenberg chairman of triangle said in a statement i am 
very happy that my publications are passing to mr murdochs 
company i now plan to devote the rest of my life to education and 
philanthropy 
his past philanthropies include the establishment of the 
annenberg school of communications at the university of 
pennsylvania to which he has given onethird of triangles stock 
over the years 
murdoch and annenberg were in los angeles and would have no 
further comment said murdoch spokesman howard rubenstein the 
spokesman declined to say who initiated the talks for the sale 
which is contingent upon signing of a final contract 
the largest media takeover was capital cities incs 35 
billion purchase of abc in 1986 
annenberg who was us ambassador to the court of st james in 
london during the nixon administration took over triangle from his 
father in the 1930s he founded tv guide in 1952 and it quickly 
became triangles flagship earning an estimated 75 million per 
year 
tv guide has an audited circulation of more than 17 million 
copies 
triangle was valued at about 1 billion last year by wall street 
analysts 
the three best businesses in america are the daily racing 
form tv guide and the wall street journal annenberg said in a 
1987 interview when he indicated that the three publications would 
be sold before 1990 
schwartzman said joint ownership of tv guide and the fox network 
could allow murdoch to use the publication to favor fox programs 
and stations such treatment could hurt small independent tv 
stations for which tv guide is an essential advertising medium 
said schwartzman 
any media conglomeration of this scope ought to set off 
warning signals at the federal trade commission and the justice 
department schwartzman said 
but rubinstein said the tv guide will be run totally 
independent of all mr murdochs other interests 
murdoch 58 is perhaps best known in america for his work at 
the new york post which he purchased in 1976 and converted from 
one of the countrys most liberal dailies to a conservative paper 
with screaming headlines 
he sold the post earlier this year to conform with federal 
regulations barring dual ownership of a television station and a 
newspaper in the same city his holdings have an estimated value of 
22 billion

delegates to the republican national 
convention arent particularly choosy about a vice presidential 
candidate with the largest group inclined to accept anyone george 
bush selects 
in an associated press survey the candidate backed by the 
largest group of delegates 39 percent was nobody in particular 
two former presidential candidates jack kemp and bob dole each 
were favored by 14 percent 
others mentioned by a smattering of delegates included chrysler 
corp chairman lee a iacocca major league baseball commissioner 
peter ueberroth former white house communications director patrick 
buchanan and a couple of otherwise unknowns whose candidacies were 
advanced by relatives who happen to be delegates 
of the 1274 gop delegates responding to the ap survey 492 said 
they had no particular choice for the no 2 spot on the partys 
ticket 
that sentiment is not at all uncommon as delegates tend to defer 
to whatever decision their partys presidential nominee makes on 
the issue of a running mate 
twothirds of the democratic delegates did not name anyone as 
their choice for vice president but when michael dukakis picked 
texas sen lloyd bentsen as his running mate that decision was 
endorsed by acclamation at last months convention in atlanta 
bush has said he will not announce his running mate until aug 
18 the final day of the republican convention 
the ap survey did show some sentiment for a female vice 
presidential candidate polls have shown that bush lags behind 
dukakis among female voters and 10 percent of the delegates 
responding to the ap survey said one way to overcome this would be 
to pick a woman as his running mate 
fourteen percent of the gop delegates scattered their support 
among four women former united nations ambassador jeane 
kirkpatrick who was named by 82 delegates former transportation 
secretary elizabeth dole supported by 79 delegates sen nancy 
kassebaum of kansas with 17 delegates and supreme court justice 
sandra day oconnor with five delegates 
kassebaum has said she does not want to be considered for the 
vice presidential spot as has california gov george deukmejian 
who was named as the choice of two dozen delegates 
the delegates vice presidential choices cut across lines of 
education gender and political experience with roughly the same 
percentages of college graduates supporting dole as kemp for 
example 
the survey was conducted by ap bureaus in all 50 states as well 
as puerto rico and is based on responses from 56 percent of the 
2277 delegates who will attend the gop convention

j skelly wright whose 38year career as a 
federal judge included decisions on major cases balancing 
individual rights and government power has died at age 77 
wright who participated in the pentagon papers case and wrote 
the decree ending de facto segregation in the nations capital 
died saturday of cancer 
he had retired last year after 25 years on the us court of 
appeals here two as chief judge and 13 years as a us district 
judge in his native new orleans 
wright whose full name was james skelly wright graduated from 
loyola university law school in 1934 and became an assistant us 
attorney three years later following military duty in london 
wright returned to new orleans to practice law before being named 
us attorney in 1948 
the next year at the age of 38 he was appointed to the us 
district court becoming the youngest man to hold the post at that 
time 
after his 1960 order desegregating the new orleans school system 
drew threats against his life president kennedy reassigned wright 
to washington dc 
in 1967 wrights order overturned the district school systems 
racially separate tracking system for grouping students the 
wright decree in addressing de facto segregation was 
considered one of the most significant education rulings since the 
1954 supreme court decision outlawing the doctrine of separate

a week after abandoning any claim to the 
israelioccupied west bank king hussein says he would recognize 
the establishment of a palestinian governmentinexile and welcome 
a plo embassy in amman 
the jordanian monarch made the comments to reporters sunday as 
draft documents calling for an independent palestinian state 
circulated in israels occupied lands where the uprising entered 
its ninth month today 
by severing administrative ties with the west bank hussein has 
challenged the plo to make good on its claims to leadership in the 
territory that israel seized from his familys control 21 years ago 
without hesitation hussein told foreign reporters on sunday 
that he would immediately recognize a palestinian 
governmentinexile 
in israel on sunday us envoy richard murphy indicated the 
united states had not abandoned hope hussein will play an important 
role in the peace process 
jordan has been and will remain a strategic anchor for peace 
in the region the assistant secretary of state told reporters 
husseins interest is in peace and i assume his actions were 
taken toward that goal 
us policy under the reagan administration has relied heavily 
on jordan as a standin for the plo which israel refuses to 
recognize 
murphy was scheduled to travel to jordan today for talks 
he said dialogue with the palestine liberation organization is 
possible but israeli prime minister yitzak shamir told murphy that 
us contacts with the plo would only lead to further violence in 
the occupied lands 
despite the israeli occupation jordan has maintained heavy 
economic and political ties with the west bank and gaza strip its 
dinar is the dominant currency and many palestinians carry 
jordanian passports 
in the past two weeks the king has scrapped a 13billion 
development plan for the territories laid off or retired 21200 
jordanian employees there and shut the separate ministry for 
territorial affairs in his government 
he said sunday the option of reversing these measures does not 
exist 
we are in a new reality of position the king said in a 
somber tone adding jordan has no sovereignty over the west bank 
and gaza both belong to the palestinian people 
it is not clear how husseins moves may affect the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied lands which has claimed the lives of at 
least 237 arabs and four israelis 
but palestinians and others have suggested hussein is trying to 
pressure the plo to make good on its claims of palestinian 
leadership if the plo fails the argument goes jordan might be 
ready to step back in 
commenting on measures to be taken regarding citizenship the 
king said that passports will all remain with jordanian citizens 
of palestinian origin until a palestinian state is created and 
they can choose their own citizenship 
hussein also denied media reports that both bridges linking 
jordan with the west bank are to be closed down 
bridges are the lifeline he said we have no intension to 
close them nor has it the idea crossed our minds 
the king said he hoped to see the plos mission in amman enjoy 
the diplomatic status like other missions like an embassy 
he said however that we have nothing to say to the plo 
delegation that is due to visit jordan later in the week though 
adding we shall keep in touch in the future there are no 
differences between us 
palestinian sources in the occupied territories speaking on 
condition of anonymity said sunday that a draft of a declaration 
of independence had been forwarded to the plo for approval 
the israeli daily yediot ahronot on sunday published what it 
said was a draft declaration of independence signed by 152 
palestinians 
the declaration called for a state based on a 1947 un 
partition plan which would encompass much of israels northern 
galilee and arab east jerusalem as well as the west bank and gaza 
a different draft obtained by the associated press made no 
mention of 1947 borders calling for a state in the west bank and 
gaza with arab east jerusalem as its capital 
both draft versions said plo chairman yasser arafat would be 
president of a governmentinexile 
israel television on saturday said one draft version of the 
declaration was seized by israeli security forces during a search 
at the east jerusalem arab studies institute immediately after the 
institutes leader faisal husseini was arrested on aug 1

writers are back to work trying to salvage the 
fall tv season after ratifying a contract that ends one of 
hollywoods longest strikes but it could be weeks before scripts 
reach producers 
some scriptwriters sat down in front of word processors and 
typewriters after the writers guild of america overwhelming 
ratified the fouryear contract sunday 
a lot of them are already going to work and they will be 
working night and day now business is going to be booming said 
cheryl rhoden spokeswoman for the writers guild of america 
most people expect to see the first finished scripts for 
episodes in about four weeks 
the guild approved the pact with the alliance of motion picture 
and television producers by 2111 to 412 or 837 percent said 
guild president george kirgo 
the 22week walkout by the 9000 members crippled hollywood and 
will delay the start of the fall tv season perhaps until november 
writer dave fuller was anxious to return to work on a new hbo 
series and feature film he is cowriting with partner rick natain 
im going to try to pick up all the momentum we lost during 
the 22week layoff fuller said 
ratification came in the 154th day of the longest strike ever to 
cause a major disruption of film and television production 
hollywood has endured a more protracted strike involving 
musicians but the writers guilds longest previous walkout in 
1960 lasted 153 days 
the impact of the strike which began march 7 reached beyond 
writers producers and behindthescenes personnel affecting 
businesses including equipment rentals and caterers and has cost 
the television networks tens of millions of dollars 
producers are pleased that the wga membership has ratified the 
new agreement and we are able once again to get this industry back 
to work said nicholas counter iii president of the 217member 
alliance 
divisiveness however was expected to linger ms rhoden said 
it was a very difficult time over a period of time some of 
the rancor and anger will be forgotten i dont think the spirit 
will be forgotten though they the writers will remember this 
for a long time she said 
the financial loss to union members was estimated at 500000 
each week and the guild paid out more than 2 million in hardship 
loans to members 
the median income for working union members is 43000 although 
the guild does have some millionaires 
in arguing for acceptance of the proposal guild negotiators 
said the pact would provide writers more creative control over 
scripts and over the reacquisition of original screenplays but 
the union acknowledged it was not very successful in winning larger 
payments for reruns of television programs sold to foreign markets 
a major strike issue 
we went in looking for modest improvements and we made 
achievements in all those areas ms rhoden said 
writers will choose between the existing formula which pays a 
maximum of about 4400 for a onehour show rerun abroad or a plan 
that pays 12 percent of the producers foreign sales within a 
range of 85 percent to 130 percent of the current payment 
television producers usually make up production costs with their 
share of payments for reruns of primetime shows 
rising production costs and reduced demand for expensive 
hourlong shows prompted the producers to propose revisions for 
domestic reruns 
under the new formula payments for domestic onehour reruns 
would be tied to sales of the show as opposed to a set dollar 
amount 
writers have been earning about 16000 for onehour programs 
but under the new system that could range from 8000 to 24000 
depending on the syndication sales writers can seek a return to 
the fixedpayment formula through binding arbitration if the 
syndication market improves 
the contract also calls for salary increases of 5 percent in the 
first 18 months another 5 percent in the next 18 months and 45 
percent the fourth year

a terrorist attack aboard a cruise ship 
last month has frightened thousands of americans away from this 
country that depends so highly on foreign vacationers tourism 
officials report 
aegean sea islandhopping cruises have begun to regain 
popularity but hotel and tourism officials say the july 11 gun and 
grenade assault aboard the city of poros cruise ship led to a wave 
of hotel cancellations 
the terrorist action left nine dead and more than 90 injured 
the attack occurred as the city of poros returned from a oneday 
islandhopping tour with 471 passengers aboard 
killed in the attack were three french citizens two hungarians 
a dane a swede and two unidentified men no americans were among 
the casualties 
greek security officials have still not established who was 
responsible for the assault and no arrests have been made in 
connection with the case the abu nidal organization a palestinian 
group known for other terrorist attacks is suspected of 
involvement 
most of the hotel cancellations have been by american business 
people who planned to attend conferences in the greek capital and 
american vacationers on tour groups hotel officials said they 
said europeans did not appear to have been frightened away by the 
attack 
three major business conferences that were to be attended by 
some 900 americans were canceled almost immediately after the ship 
massacre eva veloudakis public relations manager at the 
intercontinental hotel in athens told the associated press 
about 400000 american vacationers were expected to visit greece 
in 1988 a 65 percent increase over last years figure of 260000 
leading tourism officials said 
according to joanne despotopoulou of the governments national 
tourist organization about 4000 americans canceled their visits 
in the immediate aftermath of the attack 
tour operators estimated the figure was much higher 
since the attack weve had a great drop in american 
visitors said a tour operator who asked not to be namedour 
bookings are down by approximately 10 percent compared to last 
year 
cruises are gradually picking up again but there was a 
noticeable slump in their popularity following the attack said 
ms despotopoulou a lot of tourists and particularly the 
japanese stopped going on them and took up classical tours by bus 
instead 
in 1987 8 million tourists visited greece led by britons and 
west germans totaling 19 million and 12 million respectively 
tourism is greeces biggest foreign exchange earner according 
to the bank of greece tourists brought in approximately 22 
billion in foreign exchange in 1988 more than 5 percent of the 
countrys gross national product 
american visitors to greece dropped dramatically in 1985 when 
the united states issued a travel advisory on the potential danger 
of flying to athens after the hijacking of a twa jetliner 
the plane was seized during a flight from athens to rome 
a us navy diver was murdered by the hijackers and 39 other 
poeple were held captive for 17 days until their eventual release 
in beirut lebanon 
greece lost 100 million in tourism revenues because of 
terrorism in 1985 according to official figures of the european 
economic community 
the cruise ship industry always popular among high income 
earners was the hardest hit with americans canceling 35 percent 
of their bookings 
when the 1985 advisory was lifted after six weeks the greek 
government set about trying to lure tourists especially americans 
with an expensive publicity campaign 
top tourism officials say the country plans a similar publicity 
campaign in an effort to blunt negative reaction from last months 
attack

for the third time in four years 
residents vote on a referendum to allow casinos with the 
opposition saying approval could return galveston to the days when 
illegal gambling and prostitution flourished 
but galvestonians for economic development the progambling 
group that initiated a petition to bring the issue before voters 
saturday speak of the jobs and money such an industry could bring 
to this touristoriented island city suffering high unemployment 
the contest has been a feverish complete with phone banks 
rallies and an advertising war 
its been very divisive its a decision between two entirely 
different choices for the future of our city said hl shrub 
kempner jr cochairman of galvestonians against casino gambling 
it is a question of whether we become contaminated by the 
casinos in terms of trashing our town or whether we move on 
toward other ways of developing our economy kempner said 
the nonbinding referendum asks voters in this scity of nearly 
200000 residents to approve a gambling district that proponents 
say will consist of four casino hotels with at least 500 rooms each 
voters rejected legalized gambling proposals in 1984 and 1987 
but gambling promoters say last novembers statewide approval of 
parimutuel horse racing signals a change in attitude that will be 
reflected in voter approval saturday 
they also are optimistic that proposals to limit the size of the 
district and earmark a percentage of its proceeds to benefit the 
elderly will help win support 
its similar to parimutuel gambling and bingo and lots of 
other things in state of texas that had to be attempted several 
times said pete fredriksen chairman of galvestonians for 
economic development 
both sides admit that polls show voters evenly split on the 
gambling question with about 10 percent to 15 percent undecided 
the winner may well be decided by which side gets the highest 
turnout 
the referendum if approved would require the passage of 
similar legislation in the state house and senate before returning 
for a binding localoption vote 
rep lloyd criss supports the casino district while rep james 
hury a former galveston county district attorney opposes it 
state sen chet brooks meanwhile says he is dutybound to 
introduce the legislation if it passes 
law enforcement officials also have joined in the debate 
when we study whats happened with casino gambling in other 
locations we see a tremendous amount of street crime and we also 
see organized crimes involvement with casinos said county 
district attorney mike guarino adding that tax benefits would be 
outweighed by the increased demands on law enforcement and courts 
but fredrikson dismisses such speculation 
i keep telling them guys youve been watching too many 
godfather movies he said 
we believe that these casinos would be an economic tool to 
expand our economy the estimates are that they would create 20000 
direct and indirect jobs and put over 600 million on the tax rolls 
here fredrikson said 
galvestons unemployment rate this year has ranged from 11 
percent to 89 percent according to the texas employment 
commission its 97 percent june rate compared with nearby 
houstons 77 percent and ranked 21st out of 27 metropolitan areas 
in the state 
galveston became a haven of crime and vice in the 1950s before a 
government crackdown ran casino and slot machine operators out of 
business

publications on teen fashion television and 
horse racing are the newest divergent entries in rupert murdochs 
wideranging communications empire 
murdochs 3 billion agreement to buy triangle publications 
publishers of tv guide seventeen magazine and the daily racing 
form from walter annenberg was announced sunday 
it was the latest deal by a man who parlayed a small family 
newspaper in his native australia into billions of dollars in 
broadcasting book newspaper and magazine holdings on four 
continents including the fledgling fox television network 
the prospect of having the same man own tv guide and a 
television network raised some eyebrows but murdoch said the 
popular magazine will be operated independently from his other 
holdings 
murdoch now a united states citizen assumed ownership of his 
fathers paper the tiny adelaide news and built from there his 
wife anna murdoch met him while working as a reporter at one of 
his australian papers 
in 1969 he purchased the sun a londonbased tabloid in 
addition to sensationalist stories murdoch added daily photos of 
barebreasted women circulation soared from 950000 to 4 million 
later he took over the respected newspapers the times and the 
sunday times of london 
murdochs early us acquisitions included the san antonio 
texas express and news a daily newspaper and the national star 
a weekly gossip magazine he owned both when he paid 30 million 
for the new york post in 1976 
though bare breasts did not become a commonplace on the pages of 
the post other aspects of his style were evident conservative 
editorial stance screaming headlines outrageous stories 
circulation increased but did not bring a similar increase in 
advertising revenue 
but if he lost millions at the post the rest of his empire 
flourished profits for the news corporation ltd his worldwide 
company were 32 times higher when murdoch sold the paper in 
february than when he bought it 12 years earlier 
while running the post murdoch also purchased the iconoclastic 
liberal weekly the village voice which he has since sold and new 
york magazine adweek named him publisher of the year in 1982 
murdoch moved to manhattan during the mid1970s after becoming 
an american citizen in 1985 he began buying television stations 
but an enemy made with his stance at the post came back to haunt 
him sen edward kennedy dmass got legislation passed setting 
an imminent deadline for enforcement of a federal communications 
commission rule requiring murdoch to end his dual ownership of 
newspapers and television stations in boston and new york 
during his presidential run in 1980 kennedy was hammered 
repeatedly by the post murdoch papers also delighted in running 
photos of an overweight kennedy with headlines like tubby teddy 
you seldom achieve big things in life without making some 
enemies on the way murdoch said earlier this year 
murdoch still owns the san antonio paper his other us 
newspaper holding is the boston herald his efforts these days are 
focused on converting fox into the nations fourth commercial 
network 
and murdoch has promised to keep looking for new deals 
now youre going to see joint ventures and startups new 
newspapers magazines and television services murdoch said five 
months before swinging the 3 billion triangle publications deal

transport minister michel delebarre said he accepted the 
resignation offered sunday by 53yearold philippe rouvillois who 
had been president of the railroad for just six months 
union leaders said the rouvillois resignation would only gloss 
over a fundamental problem the governments scrimping on safety 
to save money 
a 29yearold man was killed and 57 people were injured saturday 
when a fourcar passenger train crashed into a barrier at the end 
of the line in paris gare de lest station 
on june 27 a train crash at another paris station the gare de 
lyon killed 56 people and injured 32 that accident was blamed on 
brake failure 
seven of saturdays injured remained hospitalized sunday none 
of them in a lifethreatening condition hospital officials said 
an initial investigation indicated the cause of saturdays crash 
was mechanical failure not human error 
the railroad known by its french initials as sncf said the 
conductor applied the brakes which appeared to work normally but 
the engine drove the train into the barrier anyway 
the two major accidents and several minor incidents have 
heightened concern about safety on the railroads 
on saturday night delebarre said instructions given by the 
government after the june 27 crash had not been adequately followed 
i dont believe in fate he said the safety instructions 
given on july 20 to the railroad board of directors remain 
still insufficiently followed up 
those measures included stricter checks on braking equipment 
more training of mechanics on brake equipment and installation of 
telephone links between passenger cars and the driver 
in 1985 during a series of three accidents in which 75 died and 
nearly 200 were injured sncf president andre chadeau also resigned 
you can change a man once again but you will only solve the 
problems by answering their causes said the socialistrun french 
democratic confederation of labor the communistled general 
confederation of labor frances largest union said the 
government is trying to camouflage its own responsibility 
both unions blamed the accidents on the governments railroad 
policy which they say is based mainly on saving money the current 
plan is to reduce the sncfs work force by 10000 a year over the 
next four years 
railway officials said the driver during saturdays crash told 
them he noticed nothing unusual during his run from chateau 
thierry 60 miles northeast of paris until he entered the gare de 
lest 
then he said he applied the brakes but could not stop the 
train 
a review of the trains blackbox recorder indicated the driver 
correctly braked and the train slowed down sncf officials said 
but the recording showed that while braking appeared normal the 
engine continued to push the train which entered the station at 12 
mph to 19 mph 
its like having your foot on the accelerator and the brake at 
the same time said sncf spokesman yves chenel 
the train which chenel said was about four years old is what 
is known as a reversible meaning it can be either pulled by an 
engine or pushed by it when it is pushed the driver controls the 
train from a cabin in the first car 
the train was being pushed when the first car slammed into the 
barrier rode up on it and twisted at a right angle the other 
three cars and the engine remained on the tracks 
most likely there was a malfunction in the control cable 
connecting the driving cabin in the first car and the engine at the 
rear the railway officials said 
separate investigations were being carried out by the railroad 
and police

jesse jackson says blacks and jews should form 
a council to air their disagreements a step he advocated in a 
meeting with israeli ambassador moshe arad 
jackson met sunday with arad in a session that both men 
described as cordial but which also included disagreements over the 
middle east most notably jacksons call for palestinian selfrule 
jackson said that during the 2hour meeting at arads home he 
proposed creating some kind of council or conduit for 
communication so that the two groups historical allies on civil 
rights can talk with each other when they disagree 
arad in an interview today with israeli state radio said he 
tried to make clear to jackson that private citizens should not try 
to mediate the middle east conflict 
one cannot expect people no matter how talented or 
wellknown to mediate between us and our neighbors it is more 
appropriate to leave these kinds of jobs to governments 
concerned arad said he told jackson 
i also noted the very disconcerting antisemitic phenomena 
that have been reported recently especially in his city chicago 
and i noted that his voice was not heard in condemnation 
arad said 
the former democratic presidential candidate who has a history 
of poor relations with jewish groups initiated the meeting with 
arad after the session jackson told reporters he had invited arad 
to visit him in chicago his home town 
jackson is supporting democratic candidate michael dukakis 
campaign but said he acted independently in setting up the meeting 
with the ambassador 
although jackson said he and arad did not shy away from 
controversial subjects he refused to detail many of the points of 
contention i did share my points of view he said adding he 
would keep them private 
rather jackson stressed that the meeting allowed the men to get 
to know each other personally 
jackson said he did advocate selfdetermination for the 
palestinians along with security for israel an issue the men 
delved into in depth and detail 
israelis and palestinians are trapped in a death grip which 
must be broken jackson said he said he would ultimately like to 
see an international peace conference on the middle east 
arad issued a statement in which he said the session provided 
a useful opportunity to review the situation in the middle east 
especially the arabisraeli conflict to discuss issues of mutual 
concern and to clarify points of difference 
atlanta businessman ed elson chairman of the american jewish 
committee described the mood at the meeting which he helped to 
organize as gracious generous new york businessman peter 
strauss and rep mervin dymally dcalif also took part in the 
meeting 
jacksons relations with the organized jewish community have 
long been strained by a number of factors including his strong 
support for palestinian rights and a derogatory remark about jews 
in the 1984 campaign

overcrowding and safety violations caused 
an aging ferry to capsize in the ganges river killing as many as 
400 people a government report said the ferry accident was said 
to be indias worst ever 
strong currents hampered efforts today to pull the twodecker 
from the rising monsoonswollen river hundreds of relatives stood 
by watching 
a senior government official discussing the confidential report 
on condition of anonymity said authorities believed at least 300 
people on the lower deck died when the ferry overturned saturday 
morning 
about 200 people were on the upper deck he said authorities 
believe about 100 people swam to safety or were rescued by 
villagers 
only about a dozen bodies have been found and most of the 
missing were believed trapped inside the 35yearold ferry 
it was badly overcrowded the situation was made more 
dangerous by wheat bags loaded on the ferry many lives could have 
been saved if the ferry had carried water safety equipment such as 
life jackets said the senior official 
survivors said they protested when 150 bags of wheat were loaded 
onto the ferry the steampowered vessel started wavering soon 
after it left the banks and capsized about 100 yards from the shore 
navy divers attempted to reach the submerged boat today but the 
river was too muddy and its current too swift said hs pathak 
head of the eightmember diving team 
we are trying our best but because of the current we are not 
able to go near the launch pathak said the water is too 
muddy we cant see anything so we just have to feel by our 
hands 
authorities said the water was still rising and the submerged 
boat was sinking in the river bed the water depth was estimated at 
12 to 30 feet 
katihar commissioner madan mohan singh estimated the boat was 
resting in about six feet of sand 
we are planning to break the ferry only then will we be able 
to get the bodies out singh said 
katihar district police chief ps natarajah said chances of 
finding any survivors were very very dim 
he said the death toll may never be known because some bodies 
probably were carried downstream 30 to 60 miles by the surging 
water 
the ferry was designed to carry about 160 people but was was 
always overcrowded he said jetty workers who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said 535 tickets were sold for the trip 
katihar police inspector n kumar said about 2000 relatives and 
residents were waiting along the rainswollen river for the bodies 
to be recovered 
police are trying to control the crowds and console them he 
said 
family members railed against authorities as numerous officials 
arrived to review recovery efforts 
give back our family members we dont want government 
ministers they shouted 
one survivor chadrasekhar d tiwary said he was standing on 
the ferrys upper deck when it started wavering 
as soon as the ferry tilted i knew we were going down i saw 
three women crying for help they probably drowned the 
50yearold farmer said 
ram prasad yadaws wife and four other family members vanished 
in the accident 
the women and children suffered the worst they had to sit on 
the lower deck he said i am sure my wife is dead 
it was the worst boat accident ever in india according to the 
united news of india at least 150 people died on july 5 1970 
when a boat capsized in krishna river in eastern india 
the navy divers came from new delhi the indian capital about 
650 miles west of katihar 
mangan chand a police officer said only one body surfaced near 
the ferry sunday ten to 12 bodies were found saturday according 
to bihar state officials 
chand said his father and uncle were aboard the ferry he said 
he was waiting for the bodies so he could cremate them according to 
hindu rites 
the boat trip is normally used by hindu pilgrims going across 
the river to worship at a shrine of lord shiva in deoghar town 
lord shiva is the destroyer diety in the hindu trinity 
boat accidents are common during the annual monsoon rains when 
major rivers overflow their banks

john lennon spent much of a threeyear span 
tucked away in his room sleeping or sitting in a lotus position 
with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke according to 
a biography of the slain beatle 
an excerpt from the book the lives of john lennon by 
journalist and biographer albert goldman appearing in the aug 15 
issue of people magazine discloses a sometimes unflattering 
portrait of both lennon and his second wife yoko ono 
the book is scheduled to be published later this month by 
william morrow amp co inc 
between 1976 and 1979 goldman writes lennon could not be 
more remote 
apart from a few hours in the morning and evening including 
time spent with his son sean lennon is back here in his room 
alone and silent 
the author says the idolized beatle spent most of his adult life 
as an anorexic starving himself to what he perceived as 
perfection the onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965 
goldman writes when some fool described him in print as the fat 
beatle 
that phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that the 
wound has never healed 
lennon rarely wore clothing other than a pair of backless 
slippers and avoided touching anyone according to the book 
the 719page biography also details yoko onos 5000aweek 
heroin habit in 1979 she reportedly snorted the drug 
according to the book lennon also took heroin and consumed a 
great deal of lsd 
i must have taken a thousand trips the book quotes lennon 
as saying i just ate it all the time like candy 
goldman spent more than six years researching the book 
interviewing 1200 friends relatives and associates of lennon who 
was murdered eight years ago in new york

president ali khamenei said today his 
countrys 8yearold war with iraq appears to be coming to a close 
and claimed world opinion prompted baghdad to drop its demand for 
direct talks before a ceasefire 
but khamenei questioned iraqs sincerity in wanting peace 
his first public reference to the expected end of the fighting 
khameneis comments came at the opening of an international 
conference of islamic scholars and specialists in third world 
issues 
he said the gathering fortunately is taking place in days when 
the war that lasted eight years is apparently coming to a close 
there is no doubt that the international public opinion put 
pressure on iraq khamenei said in his 40minute speech it is 
under that pressure that iraq was finally forced to accept a 
ceasefire 
un secretarygeneral javier perez to cuellar announced sunday 
that both sides had agreed to a truce that is to take hold in about 
two weeks 
iran had accepted iraqs compromise offer that direct talks on a 
lasting peace immediately follow a ceasefire before making the 
offer saturday iraq had insisted that direct talks precede a 
ceasefire 
speaking without a prepared text khamenei said iraq hesitated 
to accept the ceasefire because it wanted to dictate conditions 
for peace since the spring iran has suffered a string of 
battlefield defeats 
it would be good for the international community to question 
their kind of approach he said it is this regime that should 
be doubted and its true devotion to peace should be looked upon 
with great doubt 
iraq launched a major offensive against iran shortly after 
tehran reversed itself and accepted a yearold un ceasefire 
resolution last month 
meanwhile the official islamic republic news agency said today 
that three people were wounded on sunday in three hours of iraqi 
shelling across the northern border 
the iranian capital is still dressed for war but headlines 
point to progress toward a ceasefire and the countrys battered 
economy has swiftly reacted to prospects for peace 
building entrances are still sandbagged windows are taped to 
prevent them from shattering in a missile explosion and yellow 
signs show the way to the nearest airraid shelter 
but residents in tehran a city of 8 million seem convinced 
these remnants from the last iraqi missile attacks in april will 
disappear before long 
there were no sensational headlines sunday in irans afternoon 
newspapers which came out before the developments in new york but 
after tehran radio announced iraqs compromise offer 
new developments in un talks for ceasefire said the small 
headline in the ettelaat newspaper 
iranians in the street did not seem surprised by news of the 
developments which broke an impasse in two weeks of unmediated 
negotiations there were few signs of exuberance 
people were sure the end would come sooner or later said 
said a middleaged englishspeaking businessman iranians know 
very well whats going on in the world perhaps better than many 
westerners 
amid hopes for a postwar recovery the iranian riyal has in the 
past few weeks risen sharply against the dollar and other 
currencies on the black market 
the dollar was unofficially quoted at 300 riyals at noon sunday 
this compared to 785 on aug 1 and 1480 before iran accepted a 
un ceasefire resolution on july 18 
the driver of a vintage chevrolet said he bought his wellkept 
car second hand eight years ago for 35 million riyals and two 
months ago he was offerered 10 million for it 
now the price is back where it was in 1981 he said with a 
grin that means the war is over

occasion for superstitious chinese 
not only the cantonese but everyone is celebrating said 
peter lee at the pure mind one of many restaurants reporting 
record bookings for dinner in malaysia where more than onethird 
of the 16 million people are ethnic chinese

rocky sung siukwong of hong kong in a recent interview 
indeed todays scheduled opening of a new lightrail mass 
transit system in hong kong was put off after a spate of testrun 
accidents including one that killed an 8yearold boy 
little luck rubbed off on the colonys freewheeling stock 
exchange where prices dropped slightly in light trading in kuala 
lumpur malaysia however the commodity exchange launched trading 
in cocoa futures to coincide with the date 
jiang jong yue a selfdescribed master of geomancy palmistry 
astrology and name consultant in malaysia cautioned that 8888 
may not mean prosperity for all 
he noted the cantonese pronounciation for four is sei the 
same as the word that means to die since todays date has four 
eights he advised tread with caution and contain your greed

us envoy richard murphy criticized israel 
today for failing to establish a dialogue with moderate 
palestinians and for the tough measures used against activists in 
the occupied territories 
his statements came after a 2hour meeting with defense 
minister yitzhak rabin and military officials at the defense 
ministry in tel aviv 
ive discussed americas concern that there is insufficient 
dialogue shall we say between israel and the moderate 
palestinians said murphy adding he was not suggesting israel 
talk to the palestine liberation organization 
murphy referred to sharp disagreements with rabin over israels 
handling of palestinian activists 
since the uprising began dec 8 in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip about 2500 alleged agitators have been jailed for up 
to six months without trial the homes of 84 activists have been 
demolished and 29 nationalists have been deported 
we dont think theyre the way to go we dont agree with 
israel on that weve had a very frank exchange said murphy who 
was to fly to jordan later today 
israel radio said that because of us pressure israel agreed 
to file criminal charges against faisal husseini a palestinian who 
on july 31 was ordered jailed for six months without trial the 
united states protested husseinis detention without due process 
israeli officials claimed husseini who advocated dialogue with 
israeli officials was a senior representative of plo chief yasser 
arafats outlawed fatah organization 
a draft of a proposed palestinian declaration of 
independence was found by israeli police in his arab studies 
center in jerusalem and leaked to israeli newspapers 
an israeli official who demanded anonymity confirmed murphy and 
rabin disagreed on the measures used by israel in the occupied 
lands but said the subject was only a minor part of the agenda he 
said the exchange last only five minutes and murphys protest was 
perfunctory 
speaking on israel radio before the meeting rabin noted he had 
held several meetings in recent weeks with palestinian leaders from 
the occupied territories which israel seized from jordan and egypt 
during the 1967 middle east war 
the uprising in the occupied lands has left 237 palestinians and 
four israelis dead 
rabin said he was willing to hold talks with palestinian leaders 
from the occupied territories regardless of their demands as long 
as they are not affiliated with the plo 
but rabin said the middle east peace process is totally 
frozen and will remain so until after the israeli and us 
elections in november 
murphy disagreed saying i dont think its something that 
should wait for elections here there or elsewhere 
we are encouraging the opening of channels of communications 
which have gradually closed down over the last several months and 
we hope that will be undertaken said murphy 
rabin said he would welcome emergence of an indigenous 
palestinian leadership without links to the plo 
the moment there is palestinian leadership which says to us 
we are your partners for dialogue with us you must reach an 
agreement i will say immediately lets sit around the table 
rabin said 
in a rare display of unity leaders of the likud bloc and labor 
party on sunday spoke out against a document calling for the 
declaration of an independent palestinian state headed by arafat 
labor and likud reject negotiating with the plo outlawed in 
israel as a terrorist organization and oppose establishing a 
palestinian state in the occupied lands 
the origins of the declaration details of which were published 
for the first time on israel television saturday remained a 
mystery 
hanna siniora editor of the jerusalembased proplo al fajr 
daily told israel television it was the work of a palestinian 
think tank it was passed around to find out the reaction of the 
local leadership 
siniora said the plo leadership should endorse the document 
because it would positively affect the situation

khartoum and three other sudanese cities 
were declared disaster areas after torrential rains caused floods 
that left about 1 million people homeless the middle east news 
agency reported today 
foreign minister hussein abusaleh of sudan appealed for 
international help at a news conference in his countrys capital on 
sunday night the egyptian stateowned news agency said 
later today the news agency reported a serious food shortage 
threatened khartoum but that fewer than a dozen people died in 
the floods thursday and friday 
cairo newspapers reported dozens of deaths in sudan some by 
electrocution caused by broken power cables falling into flood 
waters 
the middle east news agency also reported antigovernment riots 
in some districts of khartoum and said some schools and 
universities were closed 
the agency quoted sudanese officials as saying the floods were 
the worst there since 1946 
in its unattributed report the egyptian agency painted a grim 
picture of the situation in khartoum 
public utilities in the capital continue to suffer from almost 
complete paralysis for the third straight day the report said 
khartoums official omdurman radio has gone off the air the 
report said and only a provincial governmentowned radio station 
at wad medani 100 miles southeast of the capital is broadcasting 
for a few hours daily 
abusaleh said khartoum the eastern cities of kassala and 
showak and the northern city of eldamer were declared disaster 
areas because of the flooding sudans finance minister omar nour 
eldayem was quoted as saying about 1 million people were left 
homeless because the floods destroyed thousands of dwellings he 
said 5000 houses were washed away in the khartoum area alone 
sudan has a population of about 23 million 
kassala capital of the eastern province is 250 miles east of 
khartoum eldamer lies 160 miles northeast of the capital 
entire villages and districts have been isolated by the 
flooding and rescue forces have not been able to reach them 
because of the high water level abusaleh was quoted as saying 
he did not identify the affected areas 
the ministers said flood waters cut telephone and telex 
communications and caused power failures which in turn disrupted 
public utilities 
president hosni mubarak of egypt ordered immediate relief for 
sudan which traditionally has had close ties with egypt 
five egyptian c130 military transport planes flew in tents 
medical supplies and food on sunday another five planeloads went 
to khartoum today 
the flooding has compounded sudans economic difficulties which 
include a chronic balance of payments deficit and a 12 billion 
foreign debt 
for several years the country has been suffering from food 
shortages including bread increased commodity prices and 
deficient public utilities 
these problems frequently touched off public unrest last week 
people rioted in khartoum on three successive days to protest water 
and bread shortages and electric power cuts police used tear gas 
to disperse the rioters who had set fire to tires on the streets

britain is to send a diplomat to iran for the 
first time in a year the foreign office said today 
a foreign office spokesman said david reddaway a first 
secretary will spend two to three weeks in tehran to test the 
water and will then report back 
the announcement followed a marked improvement in relations 
between britain and tehran over the past six weeks raising hopes 
that british hostages held by proiranian captors in lebanon might 
be freed 
officials said reddaway is expected to visit two britons jailed 
in tehran businessman roger cooper and a tourist nicholas nicola 
last month britain and iran reached a compensation agreement 
for damage done in 1980 to each others embassies and related 
properties in london and tehran 
the foreign office said july 26 that relations were in a new 
phase following irans acceptance of un terms for a ceasefire 
in the 8yearold persian gulf war 
britain last summer recalled its diplomats who worked out of 
the swedish embassy in tehran and all but broke diplomatic 
relations with iran 
the move came after a british diplomat was kidnapped and beaten 
in apparent reprisal for the arrest by british police of an iranian 
envoy on shoplifting charges 
the british embassy was damaged by rioting mobs denouncing 
britain as a us ally after the us embassy and american 
diplomats had been seized the iranian embassy in london was 
damaged during a siege by iranians opposed to ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini

president reagan told the nations governors 
today that in his two terms in the white house he had kept his 
promise to get the federal government off the backs of the 
states 
speaking to the 80th annual meeting of the national governors 
association the president said in the last 7 years we have 
broken the federal government of its compulsion to control every 
breath the states take 
in his text reagan never mentioned the presidential contest 
between his vice president george bush and democratic gov 
michael dukakis of massachusetts 
dukakis was not scheduled to appear at the governors conference 
until the closing session on tuesday bush was in new orleans 
where the republican national convention will nominate him for 
president next week 
reagan portrayed himself as a former governor who reversed a 
trend toward federal domination of the states 
too often in the past when washington listened to the states 
it heard only what it wanted to hear he said today things 
are different 
when governors talk we not only listen but we hear 
the president said his administration had worked closely with 
governors to come up with assistance for farmers hurt by the 
widespread drought 
you have advised he said we have responded americas 
farmers are getting help 
from education to transportation to helping americas poor and 
homeless you have led he said while washington has been 
caught up in partisan intrigue youve gone out and done the job 
reagan cited welfare reform as an area in which the states 
will find the way truly to help welfare families become independent 
and productive and to put them on the ladder of opportunity 
he contrasted state actions with what he called program after 
program enacted by congress to get people off welfare 
all of those programs have had one thing in common he said 
of the federal efforts theyve failed 
the governors have fought reagans effort to shift 
responsibility for welfare to the states they argued that he was 
giving them the problem without shifting the funds needed to deal 
with it 
reagan recalled his days as governor of california when i was 
sitting where youre sitting and i was talking about the need to 
get the federal government off the backs of the states 
i hope that history will record that this former governor went 
on to practice what hed preached and to fight the use of federal 
dollars first as bait then as a club and to return power and 
responsibility to the states where they belong 
earlier the chairman of the governors association predicted 
that reagans successor democrat or republican will turn more 
federal power over to the states 
i think both candidates understand there is a return of 
authority and responsibility necessary to go back to the states 
john sununu the republican governor of new hampshire said on the 
nbctv today program 
if were going to be effective and efficient in health care 
and education some of the handcuffing of federal legislation has 
to be removed said sununu who appeared in the interview with 
incoming association chairman gerald baliles of virginia 
by the time the governors hold their winter meeting in 
washington in 1989 a new president will be in the white house 
before the meeting began sununu a strong bush supporter and 
baliles agreed privately to lobby their colleagues to steer clear 
of presidential politics during the conference 
throughout reagans first term and well into his second the 
governors were often at odds with the president over budget 
priorities with reagan resisting their demands that he cut his 
plans for increases in defense spending and that he consider a tax 
increase as a means of reducing the budget deficit 
they also clashed over the presidents effort to transfer 
responsibility for many domestic programs to the states 
even democratic governors admitted that reagan won that battle 
here we are 7 years later not too far from perhaps where 
the president first thought we ought to be said democratic gov

nasa today rescheduled the crucial 
hotfire test of shuttle discoverys engines for wednesday morning 
after replacing the defective valvesensor combination that caused 
a lastsecond scrub last week 
the test in which all three of the shuttles engines are fired 
was set for 730 am edt technicians will begin the countdown for 
the test at 610 pm tuesday 
the shuttles engines were to have been tested last thursday 
but the sensor reported that a oneinch valve which circulates 
coolant before firing had not closed to where it was supposed to 
be the engines onboard computer sensing a malfunction aborted 
the test before ignition 
technicians spent the weekend swapping out the mechanism today 
the blast doors that protect the shuttle during the firing were 
being installed and scaffolding removed 
the engines will be fired for 22 seconds with the shuttle bolted 
firmly to the pad the ships two solid fuel booster rockets will 
not be ignited 
the firing tests not only the engines but the entire countdown 
process the shuttle system and launch teams it is a requirement 
since no shuttle has flown in the more than 2 years since the 
challenger explosion dicovery is being treated as if it were an 
untried new ship 
no date has been set for discoverys launch with five astronauts 
on board but five postponements of the hotfire test to date have 
made it all but certain that nasa cant meet a late september 
target 
the sensor which signals the valves openclosed position to 
the ships onboard computer gave a wrong reading last thursday 
and the flight readiness firing test was aborted engineers 
determined that the valve was in the proper position but decided to 
replace both because they are in the same subassembly 
that work was finished by midnight saturday crews spent sunday 
reconnecting lines and hoses and testing everything for leaks

shot down an iranian airliner last month rescued five iranian 
fishermen over the weekend who apparently had been drifting in a 
dinghy for more than a week defense officials said today 
the officials who asked not to be identified said the 
guidedmissile cruiser was on a routine patrol in the gulf of oman 
just below the entrance to the persian gulf at the strait of 
hormuz when it spotted the five fishermen in a small dinghy on 
sunday 
the men were quickly taken aboard and treated for what was 
described as minor injuries primarily dehydration and hypothermia 
the officials added 
the five identified themselves as fishermen whose boat sank 
while working in the gulf of oman said one source they had 
apparently been adrift for several days possibly up to eight 
days 
the sources said the men were still aboard the vincennes today 
awaiting arranfements to be made for a return to iran 
the vincennes took up patrol duties just outside the persian 
gulf not long after it accidently shot down an iranian air bus on 
july 3 killing all 290 aboard the guidedmissile cruiser had just 
emerged from a battle with iranian gunboats when its radar 
operators detected what crew members thought was an iranian f14 
fighter 
according to a pentagon report which has not been released 
publicly the stress of firsttime combat contributed to crew 
errors in tracking and targeting the illfated airliner

a fastmoving forest fire in oregon grew by more than half 
overnight to 11000 acres while cooler temperatures and higher 
humidity helped firefighters in yellowstone national park halt the 
spread of wildfires there 
authorities were considering whether to evacuate a popular 
tourist area 25 miles southeast of bend ore because of the fire 
in deschutes national forest the fire continued to burn out of 
control this morning despite the efforts of more than 1000 
firefighters 
the paulina fire pushed by winds and low humidity consumed 
4000 acres of mostly dead lodgepole pine overnight officials said 
laurie johnson a us forest service spokeswoman said it was 
possible the fire could reach the rim of newberry crater today 
if this should happen spot fires might start within the 
crater near east and paulina lakes johnson said theres no 
reason to panic the fire is still a ways away 
smoke from the humancaused blaze could be seen as far away as 
idaho 
weve had columns of smoke up to three miles high johnson 
said 
at yellowstone some 1000 firefighters halted the movement of a 
19600acre blaze toward a religious settlement 
the fires have slowed down park spokeswoman joan anzelmo 
said this morning i know we did not see significant increase in 
acreage overnight and all the fires continue to be contained 
within the park boundaries 
much of the smoke that has billowed from the fires since late 
june has begun to lift unveiling acres and acres of green trees 
that somehow managed to survive flames she said 
while some 180000 acres of the 22 millionacre park have been 
affected by the fires anzelmo said once all the smoke clears the 
stands of untouched trees will reduce the number of acres actually 
charred 
on the fan fire burning in yellowstones northwestern corner 
firefighters managed to stop the northern movement of the fire and 
keep it out of southern montana property owned by the church 
universal and triumphant 
church officials have threatened to sue the national park 
service if the blaze which has stalled for several days at about a 
quartermile from the yellowstone border crosses onto their land 
last week week church members stood before the flames and prayed 
in an attempt to redirect the fire 
in idaho crews continued to mop up the hot spots inside the 
fire line on the 1500acre spring canyon ii fire 
were hoping the weather will stay cool and humidity will stay 
up for the next few days spokeman gary cornell said 
firefighters contained the blaze which is burning in the 
targhee national forest near the wyoming border saturday evening 
officials said they hope to have the fire under control by tonight

scientists first dives to the bottom 
of crater lake turned up no signs of expected hot springs that 
might be evidence of ancient volcanic activity but their submarine 
ride gave them a new outlook 
i think so far we have seen similar things but in much 
greater detail than last year when a robot submarine explored 
the lake oregon state university oceanographer jack dymond said 
sunday describing the first two dives 
we havent found any actual thermal springs said dymond 
who made the first manned dive to the bottom of the nations 
deepest lake friday the deepest point in the lake is 1932 feet 
dymond and fellow osu oceanographer robert collier are using a 
oneman submersible called deep rover to search the lake for hot 
springs that may be the remnants of volcanic activity that formed 
the lake 
dymond said he saw what he interpreted as evidence of old hot 
springs deposits of iron and manganese and rock formations with 
colored stains on holes or cracks 
the research could affect efforts by california energy co to 
develop hydrothermal energy nearby outside the boundary of crater 
lake national park if the lake is found to have significant 
geothermal features development in the neighboring winema national 
forest could be prohibited 
the two men are in the second year of a threeyear effort 
financed by the national park service to learn why the lakes water 
is so clear with visibility measured to depths of 85 to 115 feet 
collier who made his first dive saturday said that at a depth 
of 1200 feet blue light was still visible from above 
their work is part of a larger 10year study started after 
scientists in the 1970s noticed a significant reduction in the 
lakes clarity recent measurements have shown the clarity 
returning to levels last measured in the 1930s 
dymond and collier said nothing they have found so far could 
settle the question of whether drilling for hydrothermal energy 
more than seven miles away would affect the lake 
california energy co geologist joe lafleur said if hot springs 
do exist they wouldnt be affected by the drilling 
crater lake was formed after rain and melted snow filled a 
crater called a caldera formed when the mount mazama volcano 
erupted nearly 7000 years ago and then collapsed into what had 
been a chamber filled with molten rock 
collier and dymond said sonar echos off unexpectedly craggy 
features on the bottom of the lake made precise navigation 
difficult 
precise navigation is important last year while using the 
remotecontrolled submersible scientists found what looked like a 
vent oozing a milky fluid however they were never able to 
relocate it to take a temperature reading or a fluid sample

a vehicle struck a camel on a

monday 
the arabic newspaper almadina did not provide any more details 
of the accident other than to report that it occurred on the road 
linking the red sea town of allith with mecca in western saudi 
arabia 
saudi arabias superhighways usually are safeguarded from 
wandering animals by fences but herdsmen who want to move their 
beasts from one side of the road to the other sometimes cut holes

the government today declared an 
immediate ceasefire in the 13year angolan war and set nov 1 as 
the date it plans to begin pulling out of neighboring southwest 
africa 
however foreign minister pik botha said further negotiations 
are necessary to determine a timetable for withdrawal of cuban 
troops from angola and the granting of independence to southwest 
africa also known as namibia 
this is the first step of a very long arduous road to 
peace botha told a news conference 
cuba angola and the united states also were expected to issue 
statements today following last weeks fifth round of usmediated 
peace talks 
botha said south africa planned to pull its estimated 3000 
troops out of angola by sept 1 
south africa along with the united states backs the unita 
rebel movement in its 13yearold fight against the angolan 
government angola is backed by an estimated 50000 cuban troops 
south africa has an estimated 50000 troops in namibia and 
botha said withdrawal would begin nov 1 but he said the countries 
involved must first agree on a single date for the total withdrawal 
of cuban troops from angola and independence for namibia 
the parties plan a sixth round of talks the week of aug 22 to 
try to resolve the matter the site of the talks was not announced 
south africa has said it will grant namibia independence next 
june 1 if all cuban forces have left angola by that date cuba 
however has offered in previous talks to withdraw over four years 
todays announcement suggested the two sides were closer to 
agreeing on a mutual date than at any time previously 
botha said south africa had invited un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar to south africa to discuss namibian 
independence 
its imperative that the secretary general visit south africa 
urgently botha said 
the peace talks began in london in may in the fifth round held 
last week in geneva negotiators reportedly agreed on a ceasefire 
between south african and cubanangolan forces as well as a mutual 
pullback of troops details of the agreement were withheld 
the parties have reached no public agreement on the role of 
unita swapo or the african national congress the main black group 
fighting white rule in south africa south africa has called for 
the dismantling of seven guerrilla camps it says are operated in 
angola by the outlawed anc 
south africas mandate over namibia was terminated by the united 
nations in 1966 but it has retained control over the territory in 
defiance of several security council resolutions 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp in a commentary 
today described the current diplomatic climate as one that would 
hardly have been conceivable just a few months ago 
however it said major problems remained unresolved in regard to 
implementation of the un plan for elections in namibia 
the very substantial costs associated with the plan have 
caught some of the parties unawares the report said apart 
from the 600 million needed for organizing unsponsored 
elections guarantees will have to be found for replacing the 120 
million in annual economic aid that south africa has borne 
until now

graffito at a lower east side park entrance 
reads go home yuppie scum but neighbors say reasons for a riot 
that pitted hundreds against police reach beyond tensions created 
by gentrification and include drugdealing and homelessness 
thirtyeight people including seven police officers were 
slightly injured in confrontations early sunday at tompkins square 
park nine were arrested on riot assault and disorderly conduct 
charges authorities said 
six brutality complaints were filed against police who were 
wearing riot gear and were bolstered by mounted officers and 
helicopters 
i hope you saw what was going on because we didnt start 
this said police capt gerald mcnamara we did everything in 
our power not to provoke an incident they didnt charge the crowd 
until the bricks and bottles started flying 
the riot started as police tried to enforce a 1 am curfew at 
the manhattan park some residents had asked that police do so 
saying the park is a nighttime hangout for drug dealers rowdy 
drunks homeless people and socalled punk rockers who dress in 
black leather and spike their hair 
at a city hall news conference this morning koch blamed 
sundays riot both on tempers that flared in the heat and on 
provocateurs 
on sunday koch said the curfew at tompkins square would be 
suspended for the duration of the current heat wave today koch 
said the city will enforce a curfew at two city parks washington 
square and stuyvesant park where he said residents favor 11 pm 
closings 
neither koch nor police commissioner benjamin ward who appeared 
with koch said they could conclude whether police used undue 
force citizens complaints about extreme use of force will be 
investigated ward said 
aides to koch handed out photocopies of flyers said to have been 
distributed by demonstrators one warned landlords near tompkins 
park that if the curfew were enforced our organization will 
destroy your homes another was bordered with drawings of guns 
and explosives koch called them the work of provocateurs and 
ward suggested they were drawn up by professional demonstrators 
protesters bystanders and reporters and photographers 
complained of random attacks by police with billy clubs police 
complained they were pelted with rocks bottles and sticks 
firecrackers exploded and at least one fire was set 
estimates of the crowd ranged from around 100 to the police 
departments official estimate of more than 700 the police force 
started at about 100 and swelled to 450 
police were calling people scum twirling their nightsticks 
and the kids were inciting them too but they werent throwing 
bottles or anything said dan kelley 26 who lives in the 
neighborhood also known as the east village 
the riot started as police attempted to enforce a 1 am curfew 
that applies to all city parks but is rarely enforced police said 
residents had complained that they were having trouble sleeping 
because of noise from the park 
its noisy theres rampant drug dealing drug use all night 
revelry said kim yarbrough 41 who lives nearby and the 
place looks like a dump 
it makes it difficult for people to sleep said phillip 
glazel 38 ive heard lots of complaints from oldtimers 
some park habitues however saw the police effort as part of a 
vague conspiracy of developers and city officials who want to rid 
the area the poor punkrockers and squatters and make it more 
attractive to affluent whites 
its being totally gentrified taken over by the 
uppermiddlewhiterich class said mike huckelberry 18 a 
squatter in a nearby abandoned building 
thats yuppiebashing said lee kelly who attributed the 
clash to hot weather and frustrated police who panicked 
youll talk to 50 people and get 50 explanations she said 
but the fact is nothings happening 
the decision to enforce the curfew was made july 11 and an 
informal coalition of residents homeless people punk rockers and 
selfstyled revolutionaries held at least two protests during the 
past month police cleared the park but allowed the homeless to 
sleep in one corner 
on saturday evening anticipating a large demonstration police 
turned out in force at 1115 about 250 demonstrators marched 
around the park with police standing by while firecrackers were 
thrown mcnamara said 
as the demonstration continued blocking traffic officers were 
hit with flying debris he said mcnamara ordered officers on foot 
to form a phalanx led by mounted officers which charged the crowd 
at about 1 am 
the crowd went nuts kelley said horses were charging in 
a sense and then bottles started flying people started getting hit 
by billy clubs i ran across the street i was really afraid of 
getting trampled 
the crowd was dispersed but bottle and rockthrowing 
skirmishes continued until dawn at several places around the park 
an entire neighborhood was terrorized said sharon breslau 
who has lived a half block from the park for the past eight years 
there was no time for what where excuse me whats your badge 
number it was a riot

george bush criticized the democrats 
platform as a document of deceit today and suggested there 
still may be a chance that he and president reagan will appear 
together at the republican national convention next week 
initial plans called for reagan to leave new orleans before bush 
returns next tuesday however the vice president told reporters on 
air force ii that he would view such a joint appearance as a plus 
for his campaign 
bush trying to put his stamp on the gop platform flew to the 
republicans convention city today to call for a statement of 
solutions that he said would cotrast with the invisible policies 
of rival michael dukakis 
hes the stealth candidate the vice president said in 
prepared remarks for while he cant decide about the stealth 
bomber he favors instead stealth policies they can be neither 
seen nor heard 
his campaign jets from place to place but no issues show up 
on the radar screen 
besides testifying before the platform committee bush was also 
to tour the superdome where he will be formally nominated next 
week as his partys presidential candidate 
their nominee spoke for 50 minutes in atlanta and failed to 
mention the most important issue of our time how to make the world 
a safer place bush said 
we need to make this campaign a plan for the future a 
statement of solutions not an exercise in evasion he said we 
should make our principles and our policies crystal clear to the 
american people 
bush ran through a litany of positions he had espoused during 
his campaign suggesting their inclusion in the platform 
these ranged from tax credits for child care to a ban on 
offshore dumping a reduction in the capital gains tax and 
imposition of the death penalty for drug kingpins 
if we want to stop our kids from putting drugs in their veins 
they must first have good ideas in their heads and moral character 
in their hearts he said 
on sunday bush spoke with reporters on the grounds of st anns 
episcopal church in kennebunkport maine after attending services 
with 22 members of his family his wife barbara his 87yearold 
mother dorothy his five adult children their spouses and his 10 
grandchildren 
the bush clan which occupied the two front pews of the small 
oceanfront church later posed for family photographs outside and 
taped television commercials for the fall campaign 
bush denied accusations from the dukakis campaign that he was 
shying away from debates 
not only do i want debates but i have to because ive got to 
get him to stand by his record bush saidweve got to spell 
these differences out and debates are a good way to do it he 
said 
but bush was vague on when and how often he would be willing 
to debate dukakis 
therell be more than one debate but how many has not 
been sorted out yet he said 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich said bush was only making 
a display of bravado for the television cameras and should agree to 
debate sept 14 in annapolis the first of three dates set by a 
bipartisan commission 
dukakis campaign officials have criticized bush for refusing to 
commit himself to the schedule of debates set by the advisory 
commission 
its time to dock the motorboat in kennebunkport and launch 
the debate in annapolis estrich said sunday 
meanwhile bushs designated campaign chairman treasury 
secretary james a baker iii suggested bush might further distance 
himself from positions embraced by the reagan administration once 
he is formally nominated 
baker who is resigning his cabinet post next week said bush 
already has started to develop his own individual persona 
he will be seen in an entirely different light once he is his 
partys nominee a bit more free to speak out speak his own mind 
and speak out on issues distinct and different from the 
administration baker said on nbctvs meet the press 
baker also said he did not view bushs campaign as troubled 
despite low ratings in recent public opinion polls 
but i would agree there are a large number of unfavorables out 
there baker said 
he suggested the gap corresponded to the disapproval rating of 
the administration of the president and that it would narrow as 
the election approaches

experts began work monday to unload from a 
syrian ship 12000 drums of a toxic substance that shippers have 
been trying to dispose of for more than a year 
several rusty leaking drums from the freighter zanoobia were 
being put into larger containers while experts began tests on the 
waste said giuseppe francese head of the genoa port 
unloading the drums will take from two to three months he said 
the zanoobia brought the waste back to italy two months ago 
after foreign countries refused to accept it 
the italian statecontrolled company castalia which won a 6 
million contract to dispose of the waste did not make public the 
final destination of the unidentified toxic material although port 
sources said the material may be sent abroad to be incinerated 
the waste produced by italian firms was returned to italy 
after unsuccessful attempts to dump it in djibouti venezuela and

tropical storm beryl the second named storm of the 
atlantic hurricane season hugged the louisiana coast today 
forcing evacuations from oil rigs in the gulf of mexico while the 
seasons first tropical storm fizzled out near the canadian coast 
beryl was upgraded today from a tropical depression after its 
winds strengthened reaching close to 45 mph with gusts up to 55 
mph the storm strengthened as it drifted closer to the warm waters 
of the gulf of mexico oil companies evacuated more than 2000 
workers from oil rigs in southern louisiana and the gulf 
the tropical storm had a center near latitude 295 north and 
longitude 893 west it was drifting southeastward at less than 5 
mph and its movement was expected to be slow and erratic through 
tuesday the storms center was about 50 miles southeast of new 
orleans 
there is some likelihood it could strengthen said mark 
zimmer of the national hurricane center in miami its not 
drifting inland its drifting away from land but very slowly 
zimmer said the immediate danger from beryl was to shipping and 
oil rigs along the gulf coast people on the coast he said should 
watch for tides of up to three feet above normal 
tropical storm warnings were in effect from morgan city la to 
pensacola fla and small craft from port oconnor texas 
eastward to appalachicola fla should remain in port the center 
said 
right now were advising people to listen to their radios and 
watch television said andy valence mayor of grand isle la 
about 40 miles south of new orleans in the gulf of mexico 
its highly unusual for depressions to form over land most of 
the time they get their start way out in the middle of the ocean 
said jim gross a forecaster at the national hurricane center in 
miami we dont have a lot of experience with systems that form 
this way 
a tropical weather system becomes a named storm when its winds 
hit 39 mph and a hurricane when wind velocity reaches 74 mph 
the storm chiefly affected those out on oil rigs in the gulf 
the weather service said 
chevron spokesman jonathan lifa said about 2000 workers were 
being evacuated early today all employees at facilities at venice 
and leesville in plaquemines parish were evacuated by boat and 
helicopter while nonessential personnel were removed from a 
facility at morgan city 
lifa said the storm became more threatening as it neared the 
gulf 
news reports over the weekend were that the center was 
partially onshore and partially offshore so we didnt have high 
winds to worry about lifa said the concern is that the more 
it gets into the gulf the more winds pick up it is something we 
are very concerned about 
texaco spokesman max hebert said an unknown number of workers 
were taken off texaco rigs in the gulf of mexico today 
coast guard petty officer first class bob morehead said the 
coast guard has not carried out any evacuations but the storms 
winds buffeted helicopters and created choppy seas for its ships 
the storm didnt appear to affect republicans gathering in new 
orleans for their national convention next week about 2 percent 
or 105 of the delegates have arrived to serve on various 
preconvention panels and committees said connie thumma 
codirector of media operations for the convention 
better this week than next week said bill phillips the 
convention manager 
the storm was unlikely to have any effect on todays visit by 
vice president george bush who landed in new orleans this morning 
for an appearance at gop platform sessions said phillips bush 
also planned a stop at the superdome site of the convention 
right now new orleans is mostly getting the weaker western 
side of the storm the folks that have been getting the worst of it 
are those south of new orleans said meteorologist mike koziara 
meanwhile alberto the seasons first named storm fizzled out 
today off the canadian coast zimmer said 
its lost its tropical characteristics he said now its 
just a storm the center will no longer issue bulletins on it he 
said 
shortly after noon sunday the forecasters had issued a tropical 
storm warning for maines coast from bar harbor to eastport but 
they canceled it less than six hours later 
the storm was most likely to make landfall at yarmouth halifax 
or eddy point nova scotia forecasters said 
typically there are 10 named storms during the sixmonth 
hurricane season which begins june 1 last year there were only 
three hurricanes and four tropical storms in the atlantic

exercise in evasion 
aboard air force ii on his way to new orleans from his maine 
home in kennebunkport bush also suggested there still may be a 
chance that he and president reagan will appear together at the 
republican national convention next week 
previously announced plans called for reagan to leave new 
orleans before bush returns next tuesday however the vice 
president told reporters that he would view such a joint appearance 
as a plus for his campaign 
bush attacked dukakis as unexperienced and therefore a risky 
bet as president in remarks sunday dukakis campaign countered 
that bushs lengthy government resume didnt help him when it 
mattered 
reagan spoke in cincinnati today to the national governors 
association declaring while washington has been caught up in 
partisan intrigue youve gone out and done the job 
in his remarks prepared for delivery to the governors reagan 
never mentioned the presidential campaign he said that during his 
two terms in the white house he had kept his promise to get the 
federal government off the backs of the states 
bush in remarks prepared for his unusual appearance before the 
republican platform committee today called dukakis the stealth 
candidate 
for while he cant decide about the stealth bomber he favors 
instead stealth policies they can be neither seen nor heard his 
campaign jets from place to place but no issues show up on the 
radar screen 
bush called the democratic platform a document of deceit and 
urged gop drafters to be more specific 
we need to make this campaign a plan for the future a 
statement of solutions not an exercise in evasion he said we 
should make our principles and our policies crystal clear to the 
american people 
bush also was to tour the superdome where he will be nominated 
next week 
the gop platform free of controversy within the party will 
highlight differences with the democrats 
i think the country is entitled to know the specifics bush 
said sunday after going to church near his home in kennebunkport 
maine the governor of massachusetts says he is a liberal says 
he is a cardcarrying member of the aclu the american civil 
liberties union and that didnt come out of the convention 
bush even added new heat to his attacks on dukakis foreign 
policy experience 
we cant risk the peace and national security of this country 
on someone as unexperienced as the governor of massachusetts the 
gop nomineetobe said 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich responded by saying bush 
supported arms sales to the iranians in the irancontra affair 
the vice presidents resume didnt help him when it 
mattered she said he sat silently by while the administration 
peddled arms to the ayatollah 
presidential politics was the topic in private discussions at 
the national governors association meeting where dukakis was to 
speak on tuesday but the chief executives agreed to avoid public 
partisanship 
republican gov john sununu of new hampshire a vigorous dukakis 
critic promised sunday to keep the campaign out of the meeting 
dukakis just returned from a threeday campaign swing needled 
bush for not accepting a debate plan put forth by the two political 
parties the gop nomineetobe said the question was not whether to 
debate but when and who will sponsor the confrontations that have 
become a staple of presidential campaigns 
therell be more than one debate but how many has not 
been sorted out yet bush said not only do i want debates but 
i have to because ive got to get him to stand by his record 
the democratic campaign is ready to talk debate specifics but 
bush has said those conversations cannot begin until he formally 
becomes the republican nominee at next weeks convention 
bush is talking tough to the cameras but is refusing to meet 
mike dukakis in a facetoface debate estrich said if george 
bush wants to debate foreign policy mike dukakis is ready 
bush with a unified party behind him but trailing badly in the 
polls moved today to take the spotlight for the next two weeks 
coming to the republicans convention city seven days before the 
opening gavel to talk to the platform committee 
the democrats have had their day in sun he said now we 
will have our day 
bush vowed to draw distinctions with the democrats and their 
short platform that spoke of themes and goals and mentioned few 
specific programs 
they masked it they cramped down any discussion of individual 
initiatives bush said mine will be somewhat more specific 
from the democratic side came the warning that the republican 
platform will be full of phrases that sound acceptable to moderate 
voters but which promise nothing 
theyll say were for human rights in south africa but were 
not going to oppose apartheid said rep william gray iii of 
pennsylvania who chaired the democratic platform drafting 
committee

astronomers have discovered a galaxy 15 billion 
light years from earth one of the most distant galaxies ever seen 
it was announced today by the space telescope science institute 
the galaxy named 4c4117 was discovered by scientists using a 
new search strategy they developed it was located because of the 
enormous power and peculiar spectrum of its radio emissions 
the galaxy is more than 90 percent of the distance to the 
visible limits of the universe the announcement said 
the discovery was made by ken chambers a graduate student at 
johns hopkins university and george miley professor of astronomy 
at leiden university in the netherlands who was stationed at the 
telescope science institute in baltimore by the european space 
agency they made their observations with wil van breugel an 
astronomer at the university of californiaberkeley 
extremely distant galaxies are of great interest to astronomers 
because light from them takes billions of years to reach the earth 
remote galaxies can be used to provide data about the early stages 
of the universe the record distance of the new galaxy means it is 
being seen only about a few billion years after the big bang which 
scientists believe marked the beginning of the observable universe 
the announcement was made in baltimore at the general assembly 
of the international astronomical union

authorities in the soviet republic of byelorussia 
have arrested or given official warnings for vagrancy to more than 
40000 people in the past four years a newspaper report said 
the report in saturdays sovietskaya byelorussia received 
monday in moscow said more than half of the people arrested for 
vagrancy had held jobs but either were fired or quit voluntarily 
when they started wandering 
the newspaper added that many others had lost families and homes 
while imprisoned and are faced with a suspicious society that does 
not want to give them a second chance 
being isolated from society many of them lose their families 
their residence permits homes and when they return work 
collectives often do not wish to accept them and recognize them as 
firstclass citizens the report said 
soviet media have begun paying more attention to social problems 
such as homelessness and vagrancy in the more open atmosphere 
created by mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
the numbers cited by sovietskaya byelorussia 8000 arrests and 
35000 warnings were surprisingly large for the republic of 10 
million people there was no indication how they might compare with 
figures in other areas of the soviet union 
the soviet union guarantees a job and a place to live for all of 
its citizens and proclaims that as one of the benefits of the 
soviet system 
the newspaper said many of the vagrants turn to theft of 
government or personal property 
more than 80 percent of the vagrants are men the newspaper 
said three quarters of the men and half of the women are under 
30 half have a high school education but every sixth vagrant has 
specialized high school or technical training it said

george bush trying to put his stamp on the 
republican party platform told drafters today it should include 
a statement of solutions in contrast to what he said were the 
invisible policies of rival michael dukakis 
hes the stealth candidate the vice president said in 
prepared remarks for while he cant decide about the stealth 
bomber he favors instead stealth policies they can be neither 
seen nor heard 
his campaign jets from place to place but no issues show up 
on the radar screen 
bush told the platform committee we need to make this 
campaign a plan for the future a statement of solutions not an 
exercise in evasion we should make our principles and our policies 
crystal clear to the american people 
he listed positions he had espoused during his campaign and 
suggested they be included in the platform 
these ranged from tax credits for child care to a ban on 
offshore dumping a reduction in the capital gains tax and the 
death penalty for drug kingpins 
before bushs arrival the platform committee heard testimony 
from witnesses including contra leader adolfo calero who urged the 
party to renew its pledge of support for the nicaraguan rebels 
other witnesses including antiera activist phyllis schlafly 
and the chairman of ford motor co lined up today to press their 
views on the committee but the spotlight was on bush the man who 
will carry the partys standard in the election 
were just very excited by the fact that he is coming to new 
orleans and appear before us nebraska gov kay orr chairwoman 
of the platform committee said sunday 
orr and sen bob kasten of wisconsin a cochairman of the 
panel told reporters they expect there will be no minority planks 
in the 1988 platform continuing a pattern established in 1980 and 
1984 
bush traveled here from his summer home in kennebunkport maine 
to make an unusual personal appeal to the platform writers meeting 
a week in advance of the republican national convention 
today contra leader calero told the committee the rebels could 
revive their dispersed army of 17000 and bring down the sandinista 
government within a year if we receive the proper support he 
said afterward the rebels need 100 million in new us aid 
he told reporters democratic nominee michael dukakis an adamant 
opponent of contra aid doesnt understand the sandinistas 
apparently he doesnt understand the threat they represent 
sen phil gramm of texas one of the crafters of the 
grammrudman deficit reduction law told a platform panel 
subcommittee on the economy if the american people knew the 
dukakis record clearly he would not be elected 
he urged adoption of a fourpoint plan that includes allowing 
social security recipients to work without penalty providing 
childcare dividends lowering the capital gains tax and giving tax 
breaks to families with collegebound children 
sen orrin hatch of utah told a family subcommittee that the 
democratic plan for child care would throw money from the top 
down a washington bureaucratic approach he urged adoption of a 
republican proposal for child care tax credits which would be 
putting back money in the pockets of the american family 
kasten cochairman of the platform committee said in an 
interview generally speaking i sense were not likely to 
revisit in great detail some of the debates we had in 80 and 84 
on era and abortion 
he said however that the potential for genuine controversy 
and division among us exists on day care education drugs 
handicapped aids issues that we didnt thoroughly hash out and 
digest in 80 and 84 
republican leaders have said they expect their 1988 platform to 
follow the same conservative lines that the gop established in 1980 
and 1984 for the reaganbush ticket with some new emphasis on 
child care drugs and other emergent domestic issues 
bush told reporters sunday in maine he would urge his fellow 
republicans to be a little more specific than the democratic 
platform committee which produced that partys most general 
platform in half a century 
i think the country is entitled to know the specifics said 
bush who claimed that the democrats had masked their own and 
dukakis liberalism 
the subcommittees on the economy education family 
agriculture energy and environment foreign policy and defense 
will spend tuesday drafting their planks which the full committee 
will hammer out in sessions over the rest of the week 
there is no doubt the party will repeat its antitax increase 
pledge from 1984 and other tenets of the reaganbush administration 
the 1984 republican platform opposed any tax hikes and was 
silent on the equal rights amendment it endorsed proposed 
constitutional amendments requiring a balanced federal budget and 
empowering the president with the lineitem veto 
the gop platform committee has been gathering testimony around 
the country since the end of march 
the committee will formally vote on the platform it drafts next 
monday then present it the next day to the full convention for 
approval

the parents of a young woman strangled in 
central park charged in a 25 million lawsuit monday that a tavern 
owner used her killer to lure underage girls to his bar 
steven and ellen levin charged that dorrians red hand owned by 
jack dorrian was a cesspool of corruption 
they alleged that dorrian served robert chambers alcohol on aug 
26 1986 the morning he killed their daughter jennifer even 
though he was too young to drink 
they charged that dorrian served chambers as part and parcel 
of a scheme or plan to parade chambers as a decoy and an 
enticement for the patronage of his social group and those of 
approximately similar age and more particularly of the feminine 
portion thereof 
chambers 21 is serving a five to 15year sentence for killing 
miss levin he pleaded guilty march 25 to firstdegree manslaughter 
while a jury was deliberating murder charges against him following 
his twomonth murder trial 
chambers strangled miss levin 18 and left her nearly naked and 
battered body sprawled beneath a crabapple tree behind the 
metropolitan museum of art a bicyclist discovered the body 
during the trial dorrian put up his 700000 home to secure a 
total of 157500 bail for chambers he said he did it because he 
felt sorry for chambers mother phyllis 
the levins suit which names dorrian his wife carol and the 
restaurantbar charges the defendants were negligent careless 
and reckless in making possible and causing the conduct that 
led to miss levins death 
dorrian called the levins allegations absolutely 
ridiculous he has said that recent legal action against him has 
been vindictive because he helped the chambers family after miss 
levin was killed 
dorrians liquor license was suspended for two 10day periods in 
1988 for serving alcohol to underage patrons 
in july the levins filed a multimilliondollar lawsuit against 
chambers for the wrongful death of their daughter their lawyer

contra leader adolfo calero seeking a 
renewed pledge of support from the republican party said monday 
that democratic nominee michael dukakis doesnt understand the 
nicaraguan sandinistas and the threat they represent 
he doesnt understand that they are bent on not only 
subjecting the nicaraguan people but to expanding their revolution 
throughout central america otherwise he wouldnt be speaking the 
way he has the nicaraguan rebel leader said after addressing the 
republican platform committee 
on the other side nicaraguan president daniel ortega says he 
found dukakis acceptance speech at the democratic national 
convention inspiring and believes the sandinista government can 
trust dukakis administrative ability and the administrative 
ability of a future democratic administration to change us 
policy 
ortega quoted in the august issue of forbes magazine said i 
think that with dukakis we could have better conditions to work for 
a new dialogue however i think mr dukakis will doubtless 
encounter some serious obstacles he will be subjected to 
mccarthyist pressures from the diehard conservatives 
in new orleans today contra leader calero made his negative 
comments about dukakis after asking a gop platform committee to 
renew the partys support of the nicaraguan rebels 
the platform to be presented to the convention next week is 
expected to include language similar the partys 1984 statement of 
support for the contras 
during his testimony calero avoided referring specifically to 
dukakis saying only that many americans seem to lack understanding 
about the situation in his homeland 
questioned later by reporters however calero said of dukakis 
who opposes aid to the contras he doesnt understand the 
sandinistas apparently he does not understand the threat they 
represent 
calero one of seven directors of the nicaraguan resistance 
said if congress would give proper support the contras could 
bring down the sandinista government in a year he said sandinista 
soldiers would defect and the contras could not only revive their 
dispersed forces of 17000 but double their numbers in a few 
months 
critics see that outlook as overly optimistic not only because 
of the uphill congressional battle for funds but in light of recent 
infighting among the contra factions and defection of the southern 
fighting faction from the larger force 
calero said a repeat of the 100 million in military and 
humanitarian aid approved in 1986 could turn the tide for the 
weakened contras and pressure the sandinistas back to a serious 
negotiating posture 
senate republicans and democrats are pondering a resumption of 
military aid to the contras but the figures under consideration 
generally are much lower 
without the aid calero told the platform hearing the chances 
are very dim for peace negotiations to resume 
he told the platform committee that the contras are committed to 
peace through negotiation although the rebel leaders have rejected 
sandinista proposals to resume peace talks that broke off june 9 
without agreement in late june the nicaraguan government offered 
to have talks in miami but the contras said the talks should be in 
a central american country 
in congress an aid package proposed by senate democratic leader 
robert c byrd of west virginia was considered monday by senate 
republicans 
it would allow release of 16 million in military aid this fall 
if president reagan certified that the nicaraguan government had 
disrupted the peace and stability of central america 
calero termed the 27 million humanitarian aid package currently 
proposed by senate leaders with the 16 million in stockpiled 
military supplies releaseable by separate presidential and 
congressional approval totally inadequate

nasa officials said monday that a 
new valve had tested out satisfactorily in the space shuttle 
discoverys engine compartment and they rescheduled the ships 
oftpostponed main engine test firing for wednesday 
the countdown for the test will begin at 610 pm edt tuesday 
the 22second engine firing is set for 730 am 
the engine test was halted thursday in the last second when a 
sensor reported that a valve had not closed as it was supposed to 
engineers determined that the sensor not the valve was 
malfunctioning but decided to replace both parts as a unit 
that required erecting scaffolding removing extensive plumbing 
and wiring and gaining access to the crowded engine compartment 
the changeout was completed by midnight saturday the work of 
reconnecting and testing all parts and removing the work platforms 
was being completed monday 
work on changing the hydrogen fuel bleed valve in discoverys 
number two main engine went better than expected over the 
weekend the space agency announced monday in setting the new 
test date 
the recovery from the problem on thursday shows that the team 
is working smoothly and i am expecting an ontime engine firing on 
wednesday morning said hugh harris a spokesman for nasas 
kennedy space center 
all three of discoverys engines will be fired using only a 
portion of the half million gallons of fuel in the external tank 
while the shuttle remains bolted to the launch pad the two solid 
fuel rocket boosters flanking the shuttle tank will not be ignited 
in the past a flight readiness firing has been required only 
for new shuttles except for one time when a malfunction made a 
retest necessary but the national aeronautics and space 
administration is treating discovery as an untried ship because of 
the long time since the last flight and the many changes made since 
the challenger disaster 
challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch on jan 28 1986 
with the loss of seven lives and there have been no american manned 
missions since then a leak in challengers right booster was 
blamed for the accident the boosters have been redesigned to 
prevent a recurrence 
discoverys testfiring has been postponed five times for 
various malfunctions including leaks in ground equipment and last 
wees abort 
no date has been set for discoverys fourday flight with five 
astronauts aboard but the delays have made it all but certain that 
nasa cant meet a late september target

thousands of soviet jews are getting a 
firsthand look at israel after a 21year travel ban to the jewish 
state some say they dont like what they see while others dream 
of staying forever 
about 2000 soviet jews are in israel visiting their immigrant 
relatives according to foreign minister shimon peres hundreds 
more arrive each month 
until this year relatives of the more than 200000 soviet jews 
who emigrated to israel have been permitted only telephone or 
letter contact and family visits were forbidden 
although diplomatic ties cut by the kremlin to protest israels 
1967 seizure of the west bank and gaza strip have not been renewed 
recent changes in the soviet political climate have made tourism 
possible for those jews who have relatives in israel 
the visitors are permitted to stay up to two months and are 
restricted to bringing about 10 a day out of the soviet union 
airfare and visa charges amount to about 3000 a large sum for 
soviets who on average make about 285 a month 
a foreign ministry official said the visits were a very 
positive trend and were accompanied by the arrival of a soviet 
consular delegation in israel last year and the departure of a 
similar israeli mission to moscow last month 
israeli officials hope the visits will help boost soviet jewish 
emigration to israel which reached a record low last month 
while jewish emigration from the soviet union attained an 
eightyear high of 1639 in july during the first seven months of 
1988 only about 12 percent of 16178 emigrants decided to settle in 
israel 
to boost emigration the jewish agencys russian department has 
begun organizing free promotional tours that include seminars on 
israels history and culture officials say the funding is 
unlimited 
weve turned into a travel agency one official said as he 
added the name of another soviet jew requesting a tour to a long 
list of visitors on his desk the phones never stop ringing 
mina helman of riga said the tour had given her a glimpse of 
the astonishing jerusalem the lively tel aviv and the beautiful 
negev desert 
but some soviet jews said their time in israel had revealed 
problems in finding jobs and housing as well as a constant state 
of tension with israels arab neighbors 
i have spent 10 days in israel and now i dont know if i want 
to settle here said a middleaged man who said he was a 
refusenik a soviet jew denied an emigration permit 
chaim finkelstein 60 a construction worker from kishinev said 
his visit convinced him that israeli politics are ugly 
you have too many political parties there must be a limit 
somewhere and too much democracy can be harmful he told the 
daily newspaper yediot ahronot 
some soviet jewish immigrants in israel agreed their countrymen 
would be better off settling elsewhere 
its a crime to encourage people to come here the absorption 
system is a disaster said vika ladizhinsky whose father yefim 
a wellknown immigrant painter hanged himself in 1982 because he 
failed to get the reception in israel he had expected 
some soviet jews said the visits had strengthened their desire 
to live in israel 
marina a moscow teacher in her 40s who declined to give her 
last name said the israel she saw during a 40day visit was 
markedly different from the hostile picture portrayed in the 
official soviet media 
i thought people were being killed in the streets of israel 
she said of soviet coverage of the 8monthold palestinian 
rebellion in the israelioccupied territories ill tell all my 
friends to come to israel immediately 
berta 66 a gynecologist on a twoweek visit with her sister 
said she wanted to settle in israel with her husband and was using 
the visit to find out about job opportunities and pensions 
most of the soviet visitors praised mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms saying they had greatly simplified the procedure for 
getting exit visas 
one middleaged leningrad woman her relatives said was 
reborn by her trip the woman sat on a bench silently 
embracing her mother and sister 
she cannot talk the mother said she is too distressed 
she goes back in two days

us secretary of state george p shultz 
narrowly escaped an assassination attempt today when a bomb 
exploded near his motorcade a window of his wifes car was 
shattered but she was not injured 
the government blamed the attack on shultzs motorcade and 
another bombing today at the us commissary in la paz on cocaine 
traffickers no injuries were reported in either bombing although 
the entrance to the commissary building was damaged 
the bomb attack on shultzs motorcade occurred on the outskirts 
of the bolivian capital as the secretary of state and his party 
were driving in from the airport the bomb blew a hole in the road 
and scattered chunks of pavement over a wide area 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said in washington 
that windows were smashed or tires blown on three cars in the 
motorcade she said shultzs wife helena was in the first car 
that was damaged medical personnel were in the second and state 
department spokesman charles redman was in the third shultz and 
his wife were in separate cars 
ms oakley said shultz was proceeding with his schedule as 
planned 
if people are hoping for some sort of interruption in our drug 
interdiction efforts that is not in the cards redman told 
reporters at a briefing in la paz he said he was paraphrasing 
shultz 
the explosion occurred seconds after shultzs car passed over 
the road but before all 11 cars in the official motorcade had gone 
by the explosion occurred between the sixth and seventh vehicle 
the blast was seen by this reporter from a vantage point a few 
cars behind the official motorcade 
 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombings 
but foreign minister guillermo bedregal said both were the work of 
cocaine dealers us cooperation with government efforts to stem 
the thriving cocaine trade has fueled antiamerican sentiment in 
bolivia 
after the highway blast dozens of police officers closed the 
road and climbed a nearby hill to search for the bombers they 
found a wire they said had denotated the bomb by remote control 
shultz 67 was riding in one of the first few cars of the 
motorcade riding in his car was bolivias foreign minister and 
us embassy charge daffaires david greenley a police escort 
accompanied the motorcade 
the secretary of state had been scheduled to go the sheraton 
hotel in la paz but instead was rushed directly to the us embassy 
shultz has been secretary of state since 1982 he has traveled 
widely abroad during that time but has never before been attacked 
in la paz shultz was expected to praise the governments 
efforts in fighting cocaine production and smuggling the 
government crackdown and us cooperation has angered drug barons 
here as well as peasants many of whom depend on the coca crop for 
their livelihood 
shultz is on a 10day ninecountry latin american tour aimed at 
gaining support for the reagan administrations policies he flew 
to bolivia today from brazil he began his tour aug 1 in guatemala 
city the trip was scheduled to end wednesday in ecuador

gunmen firing from a car shot 
and killed two roman catholics on monday in a suspected revenge 
slaying by protestants for a new round of irish republican army 
attacks 
the gunmen escaped after the killings in the catholic ardoyne 
area of north belfast and abandoned their car in the protestant 
shankill district about two miles away police said 
police sources and moderate catholic leaders blamed the attack 
on protestant extremists taking random revenge for a series of ira 
bombings and shootings in northern ireland britain and west 
germany which left six dead and 37 injured last week 
witnesses said the assailants pumped bullets from a machine gun 
into seamus morris who was standing with friends on a street 
corner the killers sped off into a side road as the 17yearold 
fell dying from head and stomach wounds the witnesses said 
in the side street the car was confronted by a guinness truck 
delivering beer to a club the gunmen fired a burst through the 
windscreen hitting the drivers assistant in the head and chest 
witnesses said 
the wounded man was rushed to north belfasts mater hospital 
where he died 30 minutes later hospital authorities said the 
youth was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital 
it is clear that loyalist protestant gunmen think they can 
retaliate on innocent workers for the coldblooded murders of last 
week said brian feeney a local councilor of the main moderate 
catholic party the social democratic and labor party 
sinn fein political front of the outlawed ira also blamed 
protestant gunmen but said the attack was not in revenge for the 
iras latest campaign of violence against british rule 
there is no logic behind the retaliation theory said gerry 
mcguigan sinn fein councilor for ardoyne 
police sources said suspicion fell on the ulster volunteer force 
which like the mainly catholic ira is an outlawed guerrilla 
movement it was the first attack for more than a month by 
protestant extremists 
the killings in broad daylight in a shopping district took 
place as police chiefs and protestant political leaders met to try 
to devise new security measures against the ira 
the ira preparing for next years 20th anniversary of the 
deployment of british troops to stop sectarian feuding has said 
its new campaign is aimed at british military targets 
last weeks attacks included bombing british army barracks in 
london and west germany killing two elderly protestants on 
temporary maintenance work at a police station and dragging a 
parttime soldier from a store and killing him in front of his 
family 
also on monday a british soldier cpl alex bannister 21 who 
was shot and wounded in catholic west belfast three weeks ago died 
of his injuries the defense ministry said 
the three deaths brought to 1840 the number of people killed 
violently in northern ireland since sectarian violence flared in 
1969 and britain sent in troops 
the ira is fighting a bombandbullet campaign to end british 
rule and unite the protestant dominated province with the catholic 
republic of ireland under a leftist administration the ira is 
banned on both sides of the border

authorities investigating a boat racing 
accident that injured 23 spectators eliminated a floating railroad 
tie as the cause monday leaving the wake from other boats as the 
prime explanation 
early reports suggested the boat driven by 1987 canadian 
national champion robert wood struck the railroad tie 
theres no connection said public safety director glenn 
cannon there are no marks on it at all to indicate that it was 
struck by anything and we have a witness who places it near the 
shore before the impact occurred 
woods boat which was clocked at more than 116 mph during time 
trials for the champion spark plug grand prix event catapulted out 
of the allegheny river veered right and crashed into the bank 
where spectators were watching the 11th annual three rivers regatta 
it just seems he hit a wake cannon said it lifted him up 
in the air when it came down it didnt come down in the manner it 
should have he tried to steer the boat to the left 
wood who suffered minor injuries and shock told police he 
believed his boat was buffeted by air from the boats he was 
following 
investigators hoped to determine the speed by studying videotape 
of the scene shot from a blimp for secaucus nj television 
station wwor the station was covering the new york metspittsburgh 
pirates baseball game nearby at three rivers stadium 
the boat appeared to slow after it veered toward shore 
apparently no longer under power 
not only that but as he hit the bottom of the engine would 
have begun striking the bottom of the river cannon said and 
theres a manmade edge called riprap stones together with 
cement that slowed the boat tremendously 
divers continued looking monday for the last missing piece of 
the boat a piece of metal that was located below the propeller 
the part could confirm whether debris in the river contributed to 
the accident cannon said 
meanwhile city officials started reviewing crowd control 
measures 
the parks department previously used fence to keep spectators 
from the rivers edge but for some reason that was 
discontinued cannon said 
the fence will probably be back next year putting an additional 
15 to 20 feet of concrete walkway between the water and spectators 
he said 
only one of the injured remained in critical condition monday 
said allegheny general hospital spokeswoman karen long two others 
improved to serious seven remained hospitalized in serious to good 
condition and 13 others were released

the nations governors warmly applauded 
president reagan on monday for a vintage attack on washington and a 
tribute to their initiatives in dealing with national issues such 
as welfare and job creation 
he was talking language we understand republican gov 
thomas kean of new jersey said of reagans address to the national 
governors association 
democratic gov bill clinton of arkansas replied 
absolutely when asked if he thought it was a political speech 
designed to help vice president george bush in the presidential 
campaign 
but it was one that was appropriate within the limits of the 
association clinton added i think it was as political as he 
could be without stepping out of line 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts the associations most 
prominent current member was not present for the presidents 
speech 
the democratic presidential candidate planned to attend the 
closing session of the nga meeting on tuesday and then have a 
closed strategy session with democratic governors 
reagan never mentioned bush dukakis or the presidential 
campaign but he touted the economic statistics certain to be a key 
part of the bush campaign 
our states like our citizens have known the blessings of the 
longest peacetime economic expansion on record he told the 
governors citing the creation of more than 17 million jobs during 
his two terms as well as a current unemployment rate that is the 
lowest in 14 years 
the largest part of the presidents speech was devoted to citing 
the virtues of states as opposed to the federal government a 
familiar theme of the reagan presidency 
in the last seven and onehalf years we have broken the 
federal government of its compulsion to control every breath the 
states take reagan said 
he said that too often in the past when washington listened to 
the states it heard only what it wanted to hear today things are 
different when governors talk we not only listen but we hear 
praising state initiatives reagan said that from education 
to transportation to helping americas poor and homeless you have 
led while washington has been caught up in partisan intrigue 
youve gone out and done the job 
the governors were meeting between the two national political 
conventions but they studiously avoided allowing the campaign to 
intrude on their meeting 
reagan held to that nonpartisan approach but he was far more 
partisan during a stop at us precision lens a firm located a few 
miles from the governors meeting 
still avoiding mentioning dukakis by name the president said 
ive heard some people bad mouthing our economy recently i think 
they must have stopped reading the newspaper that day in 1981 when 
they handed over the lease to the white house 
he said some people are telling you to take for granted the 
economic growth of today and of the last seven years 
he characterized that message as telling people you can take 
prosperity for granted its time for a change take a chance on 
us 
reagan said that was sort of like someone telling you that 
youve stored up all the cold beer you could want so now you can 
unplug the refrigerator you cant unplug our progrowth 
economic policies and expect things to stay the same 
democratic gov richard celeste of ohio retorted that the 
issue is bread and butter not cold beer 
celeste called reagans speech to the governors a wonderful 
trip down memory lane all of us would agree on the importance 
of initiatives on the state level 
kean said reagan would be a help to bush but anybody no 
matter how good they are is a marginal help its up to the 
candidate whos running

american airlines will pay 70000 to resolve 
a government complaint that it discriminated against flight 
attendant applicants based on their citizenship status the justice 
department said monday 
the settlement will cost the air carrier 53000 in back pay and 
17000 in federal civil penalties 
the agreement will affect 33 applicants who qualified as 
intending citizens but whom american refused to consider for 
employment either because they could not produce an alien 
registration card or because their cards had expiration dates 
intending citizens under the 1986 immigration law are 
permanent and temporary residents admitted under the new 
legalization program and refugees and those who have sought asylum 
who intend to become citizens the act prohibits employers from 
discriminating against them 
we hope this settlement will put others in the airline 
industry on notice that the challenged practices are proscribed by 
the immigration reform and control act of 1986 said lawrence j 
siskind the special counsel named under the statute 
siskinds office enforces prohibitions against employment 
discrimination based on national origin and citizenship status 
the agreement settles a complaint filed april 12 and cannot be 
construed as an admission of liability by american the department

the discovery of new planets and of complex 
organic chemicals in comets is encouraging astronomers to intensify 
their search of the universe for intelligent life beyond the earth 
the circumstantial evidence is mounting every day that 
intelligent life could have developed elsewhere in the universe 
michael j klein manager of nasas radio search for life said 
monday it is encouraging 
klein said discoveries announced last week that planetlike 
objects have been found orbiting distant stars and that organic 
chemicals thought to be the precursors to life exist in comets 
support fundamental theories about life evolving from cosmic 
chemistry 
that is the circumstantial evidence that life exists 
elsewhere klein said we know now that the materials are 
there it gives us a good feeling that we are on the right track 
he commented at the 20th assembly of the international 
astronomical union which is meeting in baltimore 
klein heads a project called the search for extraterrestial 
intelligence or seti that is planning to mount an intensified 
search for radio signals from civilizations that may exist on 
planets orbiting distant stars 
programs run by the national aeronautics and space 
administration by harvard university and others have listened for 
intelligencedirected radio signals for more than 20 years but 
only a small fraction of the vast universe and the many radio 
frequencies that must be monitored have actually been checked 
the jet propulsion laboratory which is operated by the 
california institute of technology for nasa has proposed to expand 
the effort with sophisticated new equipment that would listen to 
tens of millions of channels at the same time the equipment would 
be monitoried by a computer capable of identifying signals that 
could be sent by intelligent life 
klein said the new equipment would be able to look at a 1000 
different stars that are thought to be similar to the earths sun 
locations that experts believe hold the best chance for the 
evolution of life 
there also would be whole sky survey in many radio 
frequencies in which every portion of the heavens would be 
systematically searched 
searches in the past have only scratched the surface said 
klein 
the new equipment would be 10 million times more thorough than 
present equipment he said noting in the first few minutes we 
would be able to match all of the searches that were done before 
but even with the new devices the job is immense said frank 
drake chairman of a seti committee of the astronomical union and 
an astronomer at the university of california santa cruz 
many people think the project should succeed in the next year 
or two he said thats probably not going to happen the 
universe is so huge and the cosmic haystack so large it will take 
us decades 
drake added the consequences of success are so great that 
its worth dealing with the problems 
the theory behind the seti work is that because there are 
billions of galaxies each with billions of stars the odds are 
good that the conditions that permitted life to evolve on earth 
must exist elsewhere 
if so then intelligent life could have developed along the same 
lines as it did here on earth civilizations that are equal to or 
more advanced than humankind would be sending out signals just as 
occurs on earth the seti project is looking for those signals 
such signals may leak out just as to do on earth drake said 
the strongest sign of our existence in the universe is the 
accumulation of our television signals he said the second most 
common radio signal from earth comes from military communications 
klein said the federal budget now under consideration by 
congress includes a 6 million appropriation for the enhanced seti 
equipment he said the total project would last 10 years and cost 
90 million 
if the funding is approved the intensified search could begin 
in 1992 with all of the new equipment on line by 1994

jill eikenberry revealed monday that she was 
undergoing treatment for breast cancer while filming the first six 
episodes of the hit nbc series la law two years ago 
eikenberry made a surprise appearance at a news conference held 
by nbc entertainment president brandon tartikoff to announce she 
will help produce with nbc news a documentary about breast cancer 
survivors destined to survive 100 roads to recovery to air 
oct 12 
i was one of the lucky ones i didnt have to lose a breast 
said eikenberry who said the cancer was discovered between filming 
of the pilot and beginning of production of the series i had to 
undergo radiation therapy during the first six episodes of la 
law it was not an easy time she said 
eikenberry plays attorney ann kelsey on the series she and 
costar michael tucker are married in real life as well as on the 
series 
between the period of my treatment and diagnosis i underwent 
a tremendous amount of soulsearching and terror despite the 
incredible support of my husband my family and my friends said 
eikenberry the only real rays of hope came from the women who 
had been through these things and survived they were the ones who 
made me feel i wasnt alone 
the documentary will profile 100 survivors of breast cancer 
some famous such as first lady nancy reagan and others not the 
aim is to encourage other women to carefully check themselves for 
signs of the disease 
we brought this project to brandon because we felt i felt he 
would be sympathetic because of his history with hodgkins disease 
because hes also destined to live eikenberry said 
tartikoff said he underwent successful treatment of hodgkins 
disease a form of cancer several years ago before he went on to 
huge success programming nbcs primetime lineup 
when jill brought this to me it honestly did touch a chord 
he said i do think that what this will say to people who face 
any form of cancer particularly breast cancer is that you cannot 
only survive you can triumph flourish and lead meaningful 
productive lives

months behind in an industry where everything 
is due last week producers and scriptwriters scrambled monday to 
regroup after a 22week strike that idled thousands and devastated 
the fall television schedule 
the writers guild of america membership sunday voted 2111 to 
412 or by 837 percent in favor of the pact with the alliance of 
motion picture and television producers 
i would say nobodys in fighting form nbc entertainment 
president brandon tartikoff said 
the walkout crippled hollywood and left the upcoming tv season 
in shambles the seasons start will be delayed perhaps until 
midoctober or later despite the anticipated glut of written 
material 
the production season for primetime television usually begins 
in late june and early july 
what we are going to do this morning is what we normally do in 
may we have two writers meetings today and three tomorrow 
producer tony thomas said in a telephone interview as he drove to 
work we are starting from scratch which is what everyone in 
town is doing 
thomas producer of tvs beauty and the beast the golden 
girls its a living and empty nest said the networks 
have not reduced their orders and he expects to produce 22 shows 
for beauty and the beast and the golden girls 
probably around the production of the fourth and fifth episode 
we will start to feel the crunch because of lack of planning and 
have to start spending more money thomas said youre always 
behind in tv and that will just happen sooner 
the ratification came in the 154th day of one of the longest and 
most painful strikes in modern hollywood history eclipsing by one 
day the wgas 1960 walkout that lasted 153 days 
there have been hardships said al di tolla president of 
the international association of theatrical and stage employees 
which is holding its annual conference in reno nev this week 
di tolla said the fivemonth strike resulted in the worst 
unemployment rate in the history of his union which covers 
carpenters electricians set decorators costumers and other 
crafts 
of the 75000member union up to 60 percent were unemployed di 
tolla said onethird of the unions members are based in los 
angeles

on the second draft of one of the tv movies wurtz said and we 
have to deliver a second draft on one of the features within six 
weeks 
wurtz said he typically writes four to five hours in the morning 
and devotes afternoons to business now i might be working eight 
to 10 hours a day writing and i may be working more than five days 
a week 
at restaurants and messenger services two peripheral businesses 
affected by the strike managers noted an upswing in business as 
early as last week when a tentative agreement was reached 
following several days of rumor 
thursday and friday we had a little burst of business said 
frank casado who with his wife lucy owns the el adobe mexican 
restaurant on melrose avenue across the street from paramount 
studios 
i look forward to things improving beside the writers you 
have all the extras and the carpenters and electricians those 
guys eat pretty good too casado said it may take awhile they 
may need a few checks to get back ahead of things 
jim burke manager of the la express messenger service also 
said business had picked up thursday and friday before the strike 
burke said la express dealt almost exclusively with entertainment 
industry clients and suffered a 50 percent loss in business 
he said he pushed for new nonentertainment clients and 
recouped about 90 percent of his regular business 
now we hope to go through the roof he said 
the wga has 9000 members most living and working in southern 
california the alliance has 217 member companies responsible for 
85 percent of network primetime television and 90 percent of

a woman and her three sons were convicted monday 
of murder in the deaths of three police officers whose 
bulletriddled bodies lay in a motel room from which the family 
held police at bay for 10 hours 
a wayne county circuit court jury deliberated for 17 hours over 
four days in convicting alberta easter 70 and her sons william 
lemons 44 roy lemons 48 and george lemons 46 of three counts 
of firstdegree murder each 
murder convictions carry mandatory life prison terms 
they were charged in the deaths of inkster officers daniel 
dubiel 36 and clay hoover 24 and sgt ira parker 41 
the jury which heard 13 weeks of testimony also found the sons 
also were found guilty of felony firearms and felonious assault 
charges 
there were many trial delays because george lemons must have 
dialysis treatments 
the police officers had been trying to serve a bad check warrant 
on easter and one of the lemons when they were shot easter and her 
sons then negotiated with police for the release of the officers 
who medical witnesses testified were dead during the siege at the 
bungalow motel 
police and the easter family exchanged gunfire during much of 
the night of july 9 1987 before the family gave up early the next 
day they have been jailed ever since 
easter had claimed both that the officers shot each other while 
exchanging gunfire with the family inside the room and that they 
were shot during exchanges between the family and officers outside 
but autopsy reports said the officers were killed within minutes 
of entering the motel room hoover and dubiel were shot 29 times 
each one report said 
dubiel and hoover initially tried to serve the warrant and 
called for help from parker when easter asked for a delay in her 
arrest saying she wanted to try to straighten the matter out 
without going to jail

seat belt use has curtailed the number of 
traffic fatalities but there is no clearcut evidence that belt 
use laws have reduced the number of injuries in highway accidents 
an insurance industry study claims 
the report by the highway loss data institute outlined the 
results of a study of automobile accident injury claims before and 
after the enactment of mandatory auto seat belt use laws in eight 
states 
it acknowledged that belt use by motorists has reduced the 
number of highway fatalities but that the study found no 
clearcut evidence of comparable reductions in overall injuries 
as reflected by accident claims in the eight states 
these results are disappointing the report added 
the study which was released this week examined accident 
claims submitted before and after seat belt laws went into effect 
in new york new jersey connecticut florida kansas maryland 
michigan and texas 
while injury claims declined in michigan and connecticut after 
beltuse laws went into effect there they increased from 2 percent 
to 6 percent in texas florida and kansas 
in new jersey the number of injury claims remained stable even 
though overall collision claims increased as much as 11 percent no 
significant change was found in total injury claims in new york or 
maryland although the most serious injuries those with claims of 
more than 1000 increased in both states 
according to the study the sharpest injury increases were found 
among claims of 1000 or more those jumped 15 percent in texas 
20 percent in kansas 8 percent in maryland and as much as 7 
percent in new york 
highway safety experts suggested that belt use in some of the 
accidents might have prevented fatalities but the motorists were 
still seriously injured inceasing the latter category 
the sharpest decline in injury claims occurred in michigan 
where depending on the severity of the injury there were 6 
percent to 17 percent fewer claims filed after beltuse laws went 
into effect in 1985 
although these reductions are impressive the magnitude of the 
decreases are probably due to other factors in addition to the seat 
belt law the study said it noted for example that total 
collision claims declined as much as 6 percent in michigan during 
the years examined 
the study suggested several reasons why the beltuse laws in the 
eight states did not have a greater effect on overall injury losses 
most insurance claims are for relatively minor injuries while 
belt use is designed to be most effective in preventing serious 
injuries 
the benefits of belt use in preventing serious injuries may be 
masked by injury claims that may be relatively minor but still 
expensive to treat 
insurance claim records included injuries to individuals who 
may not be subject to beltuse laws such as people riding in the 
rear seat of a car 
some of the effects could easily have been masked by normal 
yeartoyear fluctuations in accident claims 
the study compared injury claims submitted to a dozen insurance 
companies in the eight states during the 12 months prior to 
enactment of beltuse laws and during the 12 months to 24 months 
after the laws went into force

iran and iraq will begin a ceasefire on 
aug 20 in their 8yearold persian gulf war secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar announced today 
the un chief made the announcement to the security council 
climaxing several days of intense diplomacy that ended a deadlock 
in nearly two weeks of unmediated truce talks 
he said facetoface negotiations between the two sides would 
begin aug 25 in geneva under un auspices the war has killed or 
wounded 1 million people since it began in september 1980 
in exercise of the mandate given me by the security council i 
now call upon the islamic republic of iran and the republic of iraq 
to observe a ceasefire and discontinue all military activity on 
land at sea and in the air as of 0300 gmt aug 20 11 pm edt 
aug 19 he said in a statement to the 15member council 
i note that military activity has decreased in the past few 
days the un chief said i wish on this occason to appeal to 
all concerned in the strongest possible terms to exercise the 
utmost restraint and to refrain forthwith from any hostile action 
on land at sea and in the air in the period of entry into effect 
of the ceasefire 
but the secretarygeneral did not announce the other crucial 
dates in a un peace plan the dates for a troop withdrawal 
prisoner exchange and the establishment of a tribunal to assess 
responsibility 
those dates are to be announced later 
as he made his announcement the envoys of iran and iraq were 
both in the council chamber it was the first time the two were 
present together in the council since the war began iran has been 
boycotting council sessions 
ambassador mohammed jaafar mahallati of iran and ambassador 
ismat kittani of iraq did not acknowledge each others presence 
although they passed within a few feet of each other 
i wish to express my deepest appreciation of the efforts made 
by the parties the members of the security council and others over 
the past two weeks perez de cuellar said i am confident that 
i shall be able to count on the continuing cooperation of the 
islamic republic of iran and the republic of iraq 
the security council was to convene tuesday to authorize the 
350man un peacekeeping force which will supervise the 
ceasefire perez de cuellar said earlier that it would take about 
two weeks to deploy the peacekeeping force from 24 nations that 
will monitor the truce along the 730mile front 
a report released today by the secretarygeneral estimated the 
cost of the force at 74 million for the first six months 
in tehran earlier today president ali khamenei declared the war 
is apparently coming to a close and said international public 
opinion had forced iraq to drop its demand for direct talks before 
a ceasefire 
but he said in a speech to a gathering of islamic scholars and 
specialists in third world issues that he doubts iraq is genuinely 
interested in peace 
the un peace talks began after iran reversed itself and 
announced july 18 that it would accept security council resolution 
598 provisions in the resolution include troop withdrawal to 
international boundaries and repatriation of prisoners taken in the 
war 
the ceasefire date announcement came after foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati of iran delivered what amounted to irans formal 
acceptance of the compromise proposal saturday by iraqi president 
saddam hussein that a ceasefire be followed rapidly by direct 
talks on a lasting peace 
the un peace talks had faltered over iraqs demand for 
facetoface talks before a ceasefire 
iraqs compromise accepted kittani declared sunday as he 
entered a meeting with perez de cuellar its a very good day i 
think we are on the road to peace 
as he left kittani said he had a good meeting but when asked 
if he was satisfied he said thats something else 
before offering the compromise iraq said direct talks were 
needed to test irans intentions it accepted resolution 598 last 
year and said it would not now be stampeded into a ceasefire 
badly battered by a string of battlefield defeats iran had been 
pressing for an immediate truce in the past few weeks baghdad has 
launched repeated attacks in which iran says at least 1700 of its 
people were injured by chemical weapons 
iraq had been urged by many nations to compromise and agree to 
an early ceasefire and peace settlement but a major factor un 
diplomats said was the security councils assurance to iraq last 
week that its five permanent members would guarantee a peace 
settlement 
the five the united states britain china france and the 
soviet union promised iraq that they would insist that iran not 
exploit a truce 
weve made another step on the road to peace us 
ambassador vernon a walters said after the security council met 
with perez de cuellar on sunday there are hurdles of tremendous 
resentment and bitterness of eight years of war but in physical 
steps to end the war we are moving rapidly 
the british ambassador sir crispen tickell said we are 
focusing now on logistical arrangements that should follow a 
ceasefire 
asked if there were major problems he replied its much more 
a question of logistics sorting out the many problems attendant on 
setting up this peacekeeping force

president reagan is expected to sign 
legislation to require nuclear power companies to take a bigger 
financial responsibility for damages arising from a reactor 
accident an administration official said monday 
we have strongly supported this bill the official said of 
the proposed 15year renewal of the 1957 priceanderson act that 
won final congressional approval on a voice vote friday in the 
senate 
it is likely that he will sign it said the office of 
management and budget official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the priceanderson act is unique because it is the only federal 
statute that sets a limit on how much a company or an entire 
industry can be forced to pay to victims of an industrial accident 
the bill would set the liability limit for the nuclear 
generating industry at 71 billion for all damages from a single 
accident that is 10 times the amount the industry was responsible 
for under the previous law which expired a year ago 
if damage awards exceeded the limit congress would have to come 
up with a legislative plan to supply the rest of the money 
the 71 billion limit walks a line between the nuclear 
industry which sought a lower figure and interest groups like 
public citizen the ralph naderfounded organization which pushed 
for a higher limit or none at all 
public citizen has pointed to government studies suggesting that 
a catastrophic nuclear accident could cause 100 billion or more in 
damages critics say the treasury could end up providing most of 
the compensation 
david hamilton national field director of us public interest 
research group said that while the new cap is a net 
improvement over current law the revision does little more than 
current law to encourage corporate responsibility to protect 
taxpayers from having to pay for a nuclear accident or to ensure 
that all legitimate victims of an accident are compensated 
steve unglesbee director of legislative communications for the 
american nuclear energy council an industry group called the 
legislation a big step forward in compensation for victims 
renewal of the priceanderson act is not expected to spur 
construction of new nuclear power plants unglesbee says that to 
revive the industry the federal licensing procedure needs to be 
streamlined and a standardized plant design must be established 
and barring an accident requiring large payments to victims the 
higher liability limit is not expected to have any major impact on 
electricity rates charged by utilities with nuclear plants 
according to congressional aides

george p shultz joined the reagan 
administration in 1982 and combined with previous tasks during his 
service to president nixon he has spent 11 years as a cabinet 
officer sixth on the alltime list 
during his tenure as secretary of state shultz has flown over 1 
million miles to more than 70 countries and it was on a visit to 
bolivia on monday that he had his closest brush with danger 
a bomb exploded as his motorcade was making its way from the 
airport to downtown la paz but shultz and other members of his 
party escaped injury 
when alexander m haig jr resigned unexpectedly as secretary in 
june 1982 president reagan was intent on finding a replacement who 
could win swift senate confirmation 
reagan settled quickly on shultz whose appointment was greeted 
with bipartisan praise he assumed his duties less than a month 
later becoming the first official in us history to serve in four 
cabinetlevel posts state treasury labor and the office of 
management and budget 
shultzs most significant achievement has been was a treaty with 
the soviet union to abolish all us and soviet intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles his biggest disappointments thus far have been 
the administrations inability to bring about peace and democracy 
in nicaragua and to promote arabisraeli peace negotiations 
but shultz cannot be faulted for lack of effort he has made 
four trips to the middle east this year and on wednesday he will 
make his third trip to central america in five weeks 
shultz became secretary of state after serving as president of 
the bechtel group an international construction and engineering 
firm where his annual income was estimated at 500000 to 1 
million

leave from stanford university which he is 
theyve established a chair in my honor he frequently 
remarks i told them when im through with this job ill need a

the new central park zoo opened monday amid much 
fanfare with a collection of penguins polar bears piranhas and 
their pals entertaining huge crowds in their recently renovated 30 
million home 
a fourblocklong line snaked through the park within an hour of 
the opening as new yorkers waited for their first look at rarities 
such as the golfodulcean dart poison frog the tufted puffin or the 
plumbeous water redstart thats a bird folks 
these animals know how to act theyre not like people who 
have to learn how to act said 11yearold patricia benitez one 
of the first visitors to the tropic zone one of the zoos three 
new natural habitats 
monkeys bats fish and frogs were featured there the polar 
circle hosts polar bears penguins and arctic foxes the temperate 
territory is home to otters red pandas turtles and sea lions in 
all 13701 visitors toured the three areas on its first day the 
parks department said 
when mayor koch appointed me five years ago i promised to be 
a man for all species said parks commissioner henry stern who 
introduced the 450 animals from more than 100 species 
mayor edward i koch then cut the ribbon to officially open the 
new facility before playing straight man to a frisky sea lion named 
finn 
finn circling in the newly renovated sea lion tank in the 
middle of the park waved to koch waved to the visitors caught 
fish tossed by the mayor and barked on request 
the renovation of the zoo was supposed to cost 28 million but 
came in at about 30 million partly because work took several 
months longer than anticipated stern said construction on the new 
zoo began in april 1985 
the other zoo was like a singsing for animals said stern 
referring to the facility shut down in the winter of 1983 so 
weve built a humane zoo a zoo for the 1990s 
there was one other new feature visitors who once toured for

the navy said monday it had successfully 
demonstrated a submarine capsule launch system for a tomahawk 
cruise missile during a test in the gulf of mexico 
the test firing was performed by the nuclearpowered uss 
providence on sunday and involved a conventional landattack 
version of the tomahawk fitted into a specially added capsule 
in the bow of the submarine 
the cruise missile carrying an inert warhead for the test 
was launched from the submerged submarine and then flew a fully 
guided landattack mission of approximately 450 miles to a recovery 
area on the eglin air force base fla range the navy said 
the test was important because it demonstrated that landattack 
cruise missiles can be carried and stored aboard a submarine in the 
bow outside the pressure hull and fired from that position said 
bob holsapple a spokesman 
without such a capsule launch system in the bow a submarine 
cannot be armed with cruise missiles without reducing its arsenal 
of onboard torpedoes he added

iranian leaders issued new calls for 
vigilance monday the day the un secretarygeneral announced a 
ceasefire in the long war with iraq but people in the iranian 
capital seemed ready for peace 
newspapers carried reports on a cabinet meeting in which members 
stressed the need for complete readiness and presence of 
combatants and more military volunteers state television said 
the iraqis shelled a village wounding three civilians and tehran 
radio reported several violations of iranian air space by iraqi 
fighters 
residents of tehran appeared convinced the end to the fighting 
was at hand even president ali khamenei who expressed serious 
doubts about the truce prospects a few days ago told an 
international conference the 8yearold war is apparently coming 
to a close 
he told a conference of islamic scholars however that iraqs 
conduct during negotiations at the united nations in new york 
gives us the right to have doubts about their real aims 
kayhan one of the main afternoon papers carried the headline 
ceasefire to be announced tonight inside were photographs and 
brief biographies of martyrs iranians killed in action 
javier perez de cuellar the un secretarygeneral announced 
monday in new york that the truce will begin aug 20 and peace 
negotiations between iran and iraq will open five days later in 
geneva 
a driver who spoke english and said he formerly held a wellpaid 
job in construction told a visitor my son romin has sent a 
message that he is coming home in four weeks now that the fighting 
ends he has been in the army for two years and eight months 
luckily he has not been wounded the place where is he is now is 
pretty quiet 
a 25yearold named fahrad said he was excused from military 
service because of injuries he suffered in a car accident while 
studying petrochemical engineering in los angeles 
many of my generation are dead he said in a way i was 
lucky to have been in that accident

on monday about the governments acceptance of a un security 
councils ceasefire resolution a year after it was passed 
brig gen morteza mohammadi described as commander of 
division 81 in khoramabad gave what seemed a typical answer 
being a follower of the imam ayatollah ruhollah kkhomeini 
we obey his decree whatever it is 
in fact there are three major reasons for our compliance 
first being moslems imam khomeini is our religious leader 
second being iranians imam khomeini is the leader of the leader 
of the islamic revolution thirdly we are the army and imam 
khomeini is the supreme commander of the armed forces 
private khazrullah panah said although i enjoy war the 
imams order is the ultimate order for us 
habibullah nasrullah tabar a 20yearold basij volunteer

if he deems it right to negotiate with the enemy we will too

it may not add up to a hill of beans 
but some 7eleven store clerks have been wrongly charging state 
sales tax on cold burritos 
the case is causing heartburn for 7eleven bosses and state tax 
authorities who say they may have to consider a refund of excess 
taxes charged on the mexicanstyle snacks 
the states tax agency the board of equalization is trying to 
work out just how much tax may have been mistakenly charged on 
burritos over the last three years at the 1500 7eleven franchises 
in california said paul hand a board supervisor 
there are no immediate plans for a refund but one may be 
considered hand said any refund would have to come from the 
state since thats where the money ended up hand said 
burritos fall into a sort of gray area when it comes to sales 
tax fast food prepared by a store worker is taxed 6 percent in 
los angeles county and 6 percent in most other counties but food 
that isnt prepared by employees isnt taxed 
three years ago tom mcfarland who estimates hes eaten about 
75 beef burritos from 7eleven noticed the tax got hot under the 
collar and complained to the company 
norman corlett a spokesman for southland corp which owns 
7eleven said clerks were notified to sell the burritos without 
tax 
but mcfarland 39 an unemployed electrical engineer from 
torrance noticed recently the tax was still being charged and he 
spilled the beans to the board of equalization 
corlett said southland has repeated its notice to clerks 
hand said state authorities dont know how many burritos may 
have been improperly taxed corlett refused to reveal the extent of 
7elevens burrito sales in california 
further complicating things is the fact 7elevens are equipped 
with microwave ovens if clerks cook the burrito in the microwave 
its taxable if the customer cooks his own its considered a 
grocery item and not taxable

vice president george bush exhorted 
republican platform writers monday to make gop policies clear 
including an ironclad commitment against a tax increase rather 
than turn out a document of deceit as he said the democrats had 
done 
bush said the republican platform must offer american voters a 
plan for the future a statement of solutions not an exercise in 
evasion 
he journeyed here from his vacation home in kennebunkport 
maine to put his personal stamp on the platform that the 
106member committee will draft this week and present to the 
republican national convention next tuesday 
committee members cheered when he depicted democratic nominee 
michael dukakis as the stealth candidate whose policies are 
invisible 
he said dukakis declaration in his acceptance speech that this 
is an election about competence not ideology was merely an 
attempt to convince america that ideas dont matter 
our campaign will be different because ideas do matter said 
bush adding that voters must choose between two entire sets of 
values 
i will not raise your taxes period and i hope the plaform 
will say the same thing he said i believe that the way to cut 
the federal deficit is to rein in spending not by rounding up more 
taxes 
on other issues he made a pitch for his proposed 22 billion 
childcare tax credit for lowincome families and pledged tough 
enforcement of fair trade laws 
he went over many other campaign stands including his calls for 
taxfree college savings bonds a ban on ocean dumping of sludge 
and imposition of the death penalty for narcotics kingpins and 
killers of police 
bush promised faster action to clean up toxic waste and a 
tougher line on acid rain 
he repeated his pledge to develop and deploy a strategic 
defense system as soon as possible and he accused dukakis of 
being silent at best and unsteady at worst on arms control and 
foreign policy issues 
nebraska gov kay orr the chairman of the platform committee 
hailed bush as a champion of traditional values 
she said that vague generalities in the democratic platform 
are going to cost the taxpayer close to 45 billion in 1989 
orr speaking with reporters provided no specifics but said 
that was the preliminary estimate of republican analysts who have 
taken a close look at both the democratic platform and dukakis 
campaign promises 
her committee spent most of the day divided into seven 
subcommittees hearing testimony from more than 200 witnesses 
including contra leader adolfo calero antiera activist phyllis 
schlafly and edward teller the hbomb inventor and father of the 
strategic defense initiative 
the 1988 gop platform was expected to hew closely to the 
antitax and antiabortion lines of the partys 1984 platform with 
new or reworded planks on such emergent issues as aids drugs 
education and child care 
calero urged the party of lincoln to renew its pledge of 
support for the nicaraguan rebels 
he told reporters dukakis an adamant opponent of contra aid 
doesnt understand the sandinistas apparently he doesnt 
understand the threat they represent he doesnt understand that 
they are bent on expanding the revolution 
in a subcommittee hearing on family and community witnesses 
clashed over whether the party should change its traditional 
conservative positions on such issues as child care and abortion 
bill hamilton director of planned parenthoods washington 
office said a poll conducted by his organization showed that the 
partys convention delegates disagree with many of the planks and 
with the tone of your 1984 platform around family planning and 
other reproductive health questions 
for instance he said the 400 delegates interviewed by 
telephone in late june and early july by the analysis group of new 
haven conn were evenly split on a constitutional amendment 
against abortion and a majority believed abortion a private matter 
between a woman her family and doctor 
but kay james of the national right to life and the black 
americans for life said that the righttoprivacy argument is the 
new catchword for abortion 
she and others urged the gop to maintain its condemnation of 
abortion 
sen phil gramm of texas one of the crafters of the 
grammrudman deficit reduction law told the subcommittee on the 
economy half of the growth in federal revenues ought to go back 
to people who pull the wagon who do the work who pay the taxes 
democrats want people who ride in the wagon to get all the money so 
they can watch michael dukakis and jesse jackson share the reins 
sen orrin hatch of utah told a family subcommittee that the 
democrats 25 billion childcare bill would throw money from 
the top down a washington bureaucratic approach 
sen bob kasten of wisconsin cochairman of the platform 
committee said in an interview generally speaking i sense 
were not likely to revisit in great detail some of the debates we 
had in 80 and 84 on era and abortion 
the seven subcommittees will vote on proposed planks tuesday 
then the full panel will spend three days trying to put the entire 
platform together

south africa cuba and angola 
on monday declared an immediate ceasefire in the 13year angolan 
war south africa also said it plans to begin granting independence 
to southwest africa on nov 1 
foreign minister roelof botha cautioned however that more 
talks are needed to reach agreement on a mutual date for the 
withdrawal of cuban troops from angola and independence for 
southwest africa commonly known as namibia 
botha said south africa cuba angola and mediators from the 
united states will seek to set a date when they hold peace talks 
the week of aug 22 at a site still to be announced 
a de facto cessation of hostilities in angola is now in 
effect botha told a news conference in pretoria 
this is the first step of a very long arduous road to peace 
angolas marxist government later said it had accepted the 
agreement along with its cuban allies its foreign ministry 
statement was reported by angolas official angop news agency and 
monitored in lisbon angola is a former portuguese colony 
the cuban government news agency prensa latina said an agreement 
in principle ending fighting in namibia and granting namibia 
independence this year has been converted into a permanent treaty 
and goes into force at once 
it said in a dispatch from havana monitored in mexico city 
that cuba angola and south africa agreed in geneva last week to 
make the tentative 14point agreement reached in july in new york 
an official treaty 
the southwest african peoples organization swapo which has 
fought since 1966 for namibian independence said it would abide by 
the ceasefire pact 
but unita the national union for the total independence of 
angola said there can be no effective ceasefire in angola if 
unitas position is not taken into account 
neither swapo nor unita was involved in the direct peace 
negotiations 
jonas savimbis unita rebel movement has said it will not be 
bound by any agreement unless unita is brought into negotiations 
it seeks a powersharing accord with the angolan government which 
refuses to negotiate with it 
in washington the state department released a joint statement 
in the name of cuba angola and south africa stating that the 
parties set a sept 1 deadline for agreement on a timetable for the 
total withdrawal of cuban troops 
other us officials said they believe agreement is possible if 
cuba and angola drop their insistence on a fouryear withdrawal 
time frame and agree to an 18month to 24month withdrawal period 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said cuba 
and angola also would have to agree on a substantial cuban troop 
withdrawal during the early phases 
the developments followed last weeks fifth round of peace talks 
held in geneva 
botha said south africa planned to pull its estimated 3000 
troops out of angola by sept 1 
south africa and the united states back unita in its fight 
against the angolan government which is supported by an estimated 
50000 cuban troops 
botha said south africa sent a formal recommendation to un 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar indicating his countrys 
willingness to begin withdrawing from namibia on nov 1 he said 
south africa invited perez de cuellar for a visit to discuss 
namibian independence 
south africa has administered namibia for 73 years and has an 
estimated 50000 troops in the territory 
botha said south africa will not begin pulling out of namibia on 
nov 1 unless namibias independence date is linked with the total 
cuban withdrawal from angola 
at geneva south africa proposed calling for namibian 
independence by next june 1 if cuba leaves angola by that date 
bothas announcement monday suggested the two sides were close 
to agreeing on a common date 
south africa would grant namibia its independence under terms of 
un resolution 435 which the security council passed in 1978 and 
which calls for unsupervised elections botha said 
the united nations in 1966 revoked south africas mandate over 
namibia a huge but sparsely populated land of 13 million people 
swapo which has bases in southern angola would be the clear 
favorite to win independence elections in namibia 
issues that would still have to be resolved include 
the future of unita 
african national congress bases in angola south africa says 
the anc the main black group fighting to overthrow south africas 
whiteled government has seven military bases in angola and south 
africa wants them shut down 
financial aid for namibia south africa now spends millions of 
dollars annually on namibia and guarantees its loans south africa 
wants someone else to help namibia pay its bills

one of the navys key contracting offices has 
become so dependent on outside consultants it has turned 
contractors into the watchdogs of other contractors according to 
an internal navy report 
the report by the navys inspector general which focuses on the 
naval sea systems command complains that in some case it has 
become difficult to determine where government workers functions 
stop and contractors begin 
there also is no question but that private consultants working 
for the navy have been given access to information which should 
be seen by only government personnel the report states 
contracts have been awarded to consultants to write 
specifications prepare cost estimates and monitor other 
contractors the report continues and it is arguable whether 
in the process the command hasnt abdicated to contractors whose 
primary motive is profit the responsibility for protecting the 
public interest the report concluded 
through budget and contract review it is estimated that the 
command will expend more than 500 million of its 708 million 
fiscal 1988 contract support services budget for program management 
support work more appropriately and traditionally performed by 
government employees it said 
the inspector general recommended the navy command slash its use 
of outside contractors by 50 percent over the next three years and 
hold in abeyance any contracts whose purpose could not be 
clearly established 
the navy said monday the sea systems command had yet to respond 
to those recommendations 
the inspector generals review was completed in april but did 
not become public knowledge until monday the navy declined to 
release the document after it was described in the new york times 
but a copy was obtained from sources 
the naval sea systems command is the arm of the navy responsible 
for procuring new ships and their onboard weapon systems 
the audit results are surfacing two months after the public 
disclosure of a longrunning justice department investigation into 
defense procurement fraud that probe has led to search warrants 
aimed at a variety of defense department and contractor officials 
and outside consultants although no indictments have been returned 
as yet 
the justice probe appears to focus on private consultants who 
sell their services to military contractors promising inside 
information on the governments procurement plans and the bids of 
other firms 
private consultants are frequently employed by the military 
services as well however and the inspector generals report 
criticizes the navy for its reliance on such consultants and the 
access to sensitive information they enjoy 
these problems with their potential for conflict of interest 
and misuse of information suggest the very circumstances involving 
consultants that appear to be at the very center of the current 
procurement fraud investigation asserted rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee 
the inspector generals report is greatly troubling aspin 
added in an aug 5 letter to navy under secretary lawrence garrett 
the navy said in a statement monday the sea systems command was 
carefully evaluating the recommendations concerning its use of 
contractor support services and would respond through the chain 
of command 
a navy official who asked not to be named said however the 
command had turned to consultants because there were not enough 
government employees familiar with the highly technical aspects of 
the sophisticated weapons now being purchased 
personnel restrictions imposed by congress and the office of 
management and budget in recent years have prevented the command 
from hiring more workers itself the source added 
thus consultants have been hired to help the navy decide what 
types of warships it should build how they should be designed and 
what yards should build them the official said consultants also 
are assisting in overseeing contractor performance the source said 
the navy does not have any basic factual problems with this 
report the source added but given the circumstances the sea 
systems command also doesnt think it had much choice

a soviet commission studying conditions in a 
disputed southern region may recommend giving it more autonomy to 
help end a standoff between two ethnic groups a prominent 
historian said monday 
the commissions work on the status of nagornokarabakh is 
connected with preparations for a longpromised plenum of the 
communist party central committee on ethnic relations said yevgeny 
ambartsumov 
among the compromise solutions the commission is considering is 
upgrading the enclaves status from an autonomous region within the 
azerbaijani republic to that of an autonomous republic which has 
its own constitution and laws he said 
we must find a realistic compromise that would take into 
account the aspirations of armenian people and the people of 
nagornokarabakh and contribute to better ethnic relations he 
said at a governmentsponsored news conference 
he said he did not know when the commission would issue its 
report 
ambartsumov a department head at the soviet academy of 
sciences institute of economics of the world socialist system is 
half armenian he appeared at a news conference sponsored by the 
government news agency novosti with azerbaijani writer chengiz 
guseinov 
nagornokarabakh is dominated by ethnic armenians who have been 
agitating since february to have their region taken from azerbaijan 
and annexed to armenia 
demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people have been held 
in yerevan the armenian capital there have been general strikes 
in nagornokarabakh and armenia ethnic rioting broke out in the 
azerbaijani city sumgait in early march killing 32 people 26 of 
them armenians 
on july 18 the presidium of the supreme soviet the nations 
highest executive body rejected demands to unite nagornokarabakh 
with armenia 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has said that the 
policymaking central committee should hold a meeting on ethnic 
relations but there has been no indication when it will be 
ambartsumov said poor reporting by soviet media contributed to 
the tension in armenia portraying armenians mourning those killed 
in sumgait as extremists and nationalists 
he called for full information correct information under 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
the situation was quieter but still tense in the southern 
republics 
the situation is not very good but it is more or less quiet 
and we have time to start a more profound analysis he said 
ambartsumov said armenians have gained more involvement in the 
life of nagornokarabakh in sharp contrast to past developments 
armenia today is engaged in discussion and solution of the problems 
of nagornokarabakh which is part of azerbaijan he said 
armenian construction workers are building roads and improving 
the airport and food deliveries are being made from yerevan he 
said

president reagan has directed federal agencies 
to develop responses in the event the soviet union refuses to tear 
down a radar installation considered by the united states to be in 
violation of an armscontrol treaty 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday that a 
third fiveyear review of compliance by the superpowers to the 
antiballistic missile treaty will be held in geneva beginning aug 
24 
he said the principal objective of the united states at the 
review session is to obtain the soviet unions agreement to 
correct its violations of the abm treaty and to satisfy other us 
concerns regarding soviet noncompliance with its obligations under 
the treaty 
fitzwater repeating a stand that reagan and other top officials 
have stated in the past said the soviet unions large 
phasedarray radar station at krasnoyarsk siberia is a 
significant violation of a central element of the abm treaty of 
1972 
in preparation for the upcoming review fitzwaters 
statement said the president has issued guidance that the us 
delegation should continue to make it clear that the existence of 
the krasnoyarsk radar violation calls into question the viability 
of the abm treaty 
it should be dismantled without further delay and without 
condition the statement said unless resolved the krasnoyarsk 
radar violation will force the united states to consider the 
exercise of its rights under international law to take appropriate 
and proportionate responses 
the statement did not define what those responses might entail 
but it did say that among the options would be for the united 
states to declare the krasnoyarsk radar to be a material breach 
of the abm treaty 
the president also has directed that the department of 
defense working with other executive branch agencies and the 
congress take the lead in developing a range of appropriate and 
proportionate responses for consideration if the soviet union 
continues to refuse to correct the krasnoyarsk violation the 
statement said 
after hearing what the soviet union has to say at the 
fiveyear abm treaty review it said should the situation 
remain unresolved the president will consult with the congress and 
our allies concerning next steps

really true we may be lucky 
another couple sarah and moshe said they would celebrate by 
having everything in eight lighting eight candles and arranging 
eight flowers we shall be happy after getting married on the 8th 
day of the eight month 88 
ayelet and shmuel had a difficult time reserving a wedding hall 
even for a fee of 9375 that included the cost of the wedding 
dresses recorded music and fried chicken for the guests the al 
hamishmar newspaper reported 
reservations for wedding halls where most israeli marriage 
services are performed had been streaming in

the official investigation report on last 
months shootdown of an iranian airliner by a navy cruiser was 
delivered monday to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm 
william j crowe defense officials said 
the report by a military board of inquiry was forwarded to crowe 
by gen george crist the head of the us central command which 
is responsible for all us military forces in the mideast 
last week sources disclosed that investigators had concluded 
the uss vincennes attacked and destroyed an iranian airliner on 
july 3 because of human mistakes made under the stress of combat 
because of the mistakes the captain of the vincennes believed 
his ship had survived its first combat only to confront an 
approaching hostile iranian jet fighter said the sources in 
reality the radar contact was a civilian airliner with 290 people 
aboard that had just taken off from a large military base at bandar 
abbas iran 
the defense officials said monday that crist had made some 
changes and inserted some of his own observations and 
recommendations in the inquiry report which was prepared by rear 
adm william fogarty 
but he made no bottomline changes added one official who 
like the others demanded anonymity 
it was not known how long crowe would take to review the report 
and forward it to defense secretary frank c carlucci the pentagon 
has said it will release an unclassified version of the report

federal safety investigators called monday for 
a backtobasics training program for air traffic controllers 
at chicagos busy ohare international airport because of an 
unusually high number of controller errors 
the national transportation safety board said that a majority of 
the controller errors recorded at ohares radar control facility 
during the first six months of the year involved a breakdown in 
basic controller skills 
but the safety board said problems at ohare the second busiest 
airport in the world with an average of nearly 2200 takeoffs and 
landings a day go beyond controller skills 
it called on the faa to take immediate actions to provide 
controllers at ohare with newer and better radar and computer 
equipment find ways to increase controller staffing reduce peak 
traffic loads improve controller training and develop better 
quality assurance 
the faa declined to comment directly on the ntsb 
recommendations which came out of a special safety board 
investigation of ohares air traffic operations because of a 
sudden increase in controller errors earlier this year 
the faa however announced that it planned a special 
broadranging review of ohare by a team of agency and aviation 
industry experts with a report to be submitted to faa administrator 
allan mcartor by sept 20 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the review will go beyond air 
traffic control questions and include an examination of the 
airports overall operation participants in the review will 
include representatives from the airlines pilots union various 
aviation organizations and the city of chicago farrar said 
overall more than 50 organizations have been invited to 
participate in the review said farrar 
ohare airport is the second busiest in the world with 796939 
arrivals and departures last year second only to atlantas 
hartsfield international last year ohare handled more than 56 
million passengers more than any other airport 
it also has been the subject of numerous investigations by the 
faa the ntsb and congressional committees because of safety 
concerns the latest investigation by the ntsb was prompted by 
reports in june that controllers had committed 19 operational 
errors where aircraft had been allowed to fly dangerously close to 
one another seven more than during all of 1987 
after examining these incidents ntsb investigators concluded 
that in many cases controllers failed to follow the procedures 
and in a majority of the cases the errors involved a breakdown in 
basic air traffic control skills 
the safety board said that in many cases the controllers 
performance was affected by excessive workload lack of 
attentiveness foregetting perceptual problems fatigue and 
excessive time on position without a break 
but the board said it was concerned that these controllers 
working at one of the nations busiest terminal radar facilities 
failed to act in accordance with basic controller standards and 
principles and questioned the effectiveness of the faas overall 
quality control program 
other areas of ntsb concern at ohare were 
continuing excessive overtime with many controllers saying 
they are required to work sixday weeks 
shortages in the number of controllers while the faa has 
authorized additional controllers at ohares radar facility the 
number of controllers there actually has increased by only five in 
the last two years investigators said 
the need for newer and better computer radar and 
communications equipment some of the equipment has been in use at 
other facilities for years the safety board said it said that 26 
other faa facilities are currently scheduled to received the faas 
most advanced terminal radar system before it is scheduled to come 
to ohare

the law enacted in 1970 allows a limited antitrust exemption 
to preserve independent editorial voices in a community where one 
newspaper is in danger of failing 
many agreements that had joined the operations of newspapers in 
other cities before the law was enacted were grandfathered under 
the act and allowed to continue in effect said terry maguire anpa 
senior vice president and general counsel those pre1970 
agreements had been reached by the newspapers themselves without 
need of any government action

two afghan airmen in a sovietbuilt 
mig19 abandoned a bombing mission over afghanistan on monday and 
flew their fighter jet to pakistan where they asked for political 
asylum authorities said 
pakistan officials meanwhile refused to confirm or deny 
newspaper accounts that the islamabad government was holding a 
soviet pilot shot down last week 
authorities at the northwest border village of parachinar said 
the two afghan fliers landed their fully armed plane handed over 
sidearms and asked for asylum 
they said the men told parachinar airport security that they 
along with another two fighters had been sent from kabul to bomb 
moslem guerrilla positions in eastern paktia province while the 
others attacked paktia the pilot swerved his aircraft toward 
pakistan they said 
airport security fired on the mig fearing it was coming in to 
bomb the airport although the pilot identified as maj munir and 
the other airman capt wazir advised the control tower they 
wanted to defect 
they circled the airport four times before they were allowed to 
land local authorities said the fighter was loaded with rockets 
and bombs 
newspaper reports said a soviet airman was flown to islamabad 
the pakistani capital after surviving the downing of his su20 
ground attack fighter by a usbuilt pakistan air force f16 last 
thursday the plane reportedly was shot down near the border 
village of miranshah 
over the course of the 10year war in neighboring afghanistan a 
halfdozen afghan pilots have defected to pakistan with their 
aircraft this was the first defection reported since the soviets 
began their withdrawal from afghanistan on may 15 
crossborder incursions in pakistani airspace have occurred 
frequently during the long conflict between the marxist government 
in kabul and islamic guerrillas 
an air force official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
there has been some increase since the signing of an april 14 
agreement providing for the phased withdrawal of more than 100000 
soviet soldiers from afghanistan 
guerrilla reports from north waziristan where miranshah is 
located said four afghan refugees were killed last wednesday when

javier perez de cuellar is mild of manner 
and would not boast of his diplomatic skill but he had reason for 
pride monday when he announced a ceasefire in the persian gulf war 
the iraniraq war is the latest in several seemingly intractable 
conflicts for which the united nations has been asked to help find 
a solution 
the soviet union is withdrawing its estimated 115000 soldiers 
from a 10yearold civil war in afghanistan under a unmediated 
agreement signed april 14 
combatants in cambodia southwestern africa and the western 
sahara have asked the world organization to find ways of ending 
their wars without a defeat for any party 
perez de cuellars diplomatic successes in afghanistan and the 
gulf contrast with his early disappointment in the 74day falkland 
islands war between argentina and britain it was fought in 1982 
the year after he became un chief executive 
the softspoken diplomat from peru now 68 is known for 
discretion and diligence he likes to quote the french aphorism 
le ton fait la chanson which means the melody makes the song 
not a loud voice 
the secretarygeneral tried to create harmony between britain 
and argentina as londons fleet of warships steamed toward the 
falklands but both sides hardened their positions after two weeks 
of talks argentina also claims the islands which it calls the 
malvinas 
before the falklands conflict ended israel invaded lebanon the 
israelis defied security council demands for a ceasefire and 
withdrawal and bypassed the 7000member un peacekeeping force 
in southern lebanon 
with infinite patience perez de cuellar insists it is much 
easier for a government to make concessions to the united nations 
than to make concessions to one another or to a big power 
that theory bore fruit in the past week when iraq abandoned its 
demand for direct talks with iran as a first step toward peace 
accepting perez de cuellars compromise suggestion for direct talks 
immediately after a ceasefire takes effect 
he announced monday that the truce would begin aug 20 and the 
peace talks aug 25 
after he became secretarygeneral perez de cuellar said he 
would not seek a second fiveyear term because the un chief must 
remain independent and not curry favor with the five permanent 
security council members he relented however and was reelected 
in 1986 with no serious opposition 
a career diplomat he was perus ambassador to the united 
nations from 197175 and served on the security council in 197374 
he was un special representative to cyprus in 197577 and in 
1979 was appointed undersecretarygeneral for political affairs 
he held that post until becoming secretarygeneral and also was 
special representative to afghanistan in 1981

the fivemonth writers strike that just ended 
will push back nbcs midseason replacements a month or so but 
otherwise the network is in good shape for the fall nbc 
entertainment president brandon tartikoff said monday 
nbc will have two weeks of primetime coverage of the summer 
olympics beginning sept 15 that made the network less vulnerable 
to delays in the new season of entertainment shows caused by the 
strike but had threatened to devalue the promotional platform 
afforded by the multimilliondollar olympics coverage 
weve had a lot of time to sort of digest what was happening 
and prepare for the day when it the strike would be over 
tartikoff told a news conference though he added i would say 
nobodys in fighting form 
most of nbcs schedule will premiere in october three shows 
that make up the tuesday lineup matlock in the heat of the 
night and midnight caller will be delayed until the end of 
november because of abcs airing of its miniseries war and 
remembrance that month not directly because of the strike 
tartikoff said 
premiering the week of oct 3 will be alf the hogan 
family unsolved mysteries highway to heaven the 
cosby show a different world dear john sonny 
spoon 227 amen golden girls empty nest and 
the magical world of disney 
the week of oct 24 will have tattingers something is 
out there hunter family ties and day by day the 
next week nbc will add baby boom night court cheers 
la law and miami vice 
its not going to be our tack to rush shows on the air 
particularly the new ones and diminish the possibility for 
longterm success to get on one week early tartikoff said 
we were prepared and we did give script orders early enough so 
they could be meaningful at this time i think thats why were 
getting on sooner than the other two networks he said 
besides the olympics nbc also had several series including its 
toprated the cosby show that were able to stay in production 
under independent contracts with the writers guild 
midseason might come after the february sweeps a delay of 
about a month tartikoff said 
hardy boys a remake considered during the strike will be 
made as a twohour movie but nbc has no series commitment 
the extensive research the network did in looking for old shows 
to reshoot was not an exercise in futility tartikoff said 
we did the entire history of television in a sevenweek 
period he said the one thing you realize when you go back is 
that television at one time was a much more varied marketplace and 
there were a lot more interesting ideas out there than are the 
tableaux today out of that there have been some ideas and 
offshoots that could become the germs of new series ideas 
tartikoff also announced that nbc has struck a deal with the 
networks former president grant tinker who now heads gtg 
entertainment for a twohour pilot called bay watch it would 
hit the air in the fall of 1989 
tinker currently is producing two shows for cbs

the last of five fullscale 
testfirings required to qualify the redesigned space shuttle 
booster rocket for flight is scheduled for aug 18 morton thiokol 
inc announced monday 
a successful test of the 126footlong rocket at the aerospace 
companys northern utah plant 25 miles west of here would clear the 
way for resumption of shuttle flights on hold since the jan 28 
1986 challenger disaster 
a faulty seal between sections of one of challengers two 
boosters was blamed by a presidential commission for the explosion 
that destroyed the spacecraft shortly after launch 
morton thiokol spokesman rocky raab said next weeks test 
following the successful fourth firing on june 14 will incorporate 
several intentional flaws to test backup systems to their limits 
its severely flawed it has flaws in every joint but one two 
of the three field joints and the casetonozzle joint are 
flawed he said 
we have already tested fullsized motors in short duration 
tests with these same types of flaws this test will allow us to 
demonstrate that with a fullduration test further adding to the 
confidence in the redesign raab added 
the twominute test will burn approximately 11 million pounds 
of solid fuel propellant sending a cloud of smoke and flame 
thousands of feet into the sky 
the redesigned rocket developed by morton thiokol to replace 
challengerera boosters incorporates new and additional oring 
seals made of coldresistant materials as well as improved 
insulation intended to further reduce the possibility of flaming 
exhaust gases leaking through a joint rather than the rocket motor 
such a leak ignited challengers exterior liquid fuel tank

three children have refused to testify in the 
mcmartin preschool molestation trial a prosecutor said monday 
placing in jeopardy 27 of the 99 molestation charges against the 
schools operators 
deputy district attorney lael rubin said outside court that the 
prosecution might try to prove the charges without the three 
children but its an extraordinarily difficult thing to do 
she said the children have refused to testify because they dont 
want to revive painful memories and because they remain 
traumatized two boys she said continue to have strong 
nightmares and one girl has lost her memory of all events prior 
to a year ago a sign of massive depression 
while we have a responsiblity to present all of the evidence 
we also have a responsiblity not to increase trauma to kids ms 
rubin told reporters of the decision not to force the children into 
court 
another child refused to testify last month and the judge 
refused a prosecution bid to use her videotaped preliminary hearing 
testimony from 1985 three charges were based on her allegations 
raymond buckey 30 and peggy mcmartin buckey 61 are charged 
with 99 molestations and one joint count of conspiracy with 82 of 
the counts naming only buckey the molestations allegedly took 
place at their nowdefunct mcmartin preschool in suburban 
manhattan beach 
the case has been in los angeles courts for five years and the 
trial has been under way for more than a year nine children have 
testified so far in the case which once focused on 41 youngsters 
with 30 charges resting on four children who will not testify 
the prosecution stands to lose nearly a third of the charges to 
dismissal if the judge finds insufficient evidence to support them 
buckeys attorney danny davis said outside court he was not 
surprised at the development and had suspected earlier that the 
prosecution would drop some of the child witnesses 
the remaining three witnesses had more contradictions and 
unbelievable accounts in their testimony he said they were 
a liablity to the prosecution 
i think the prosecution case is falling of its own weight 
davis said he would vigorously oppose any effort to have the 
childrens parents testify instead of the alleged victims 
prosecutors dropped charges against five other teachers at the 
school in 1986

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
announced monday that iran and iraq will begin a ceasefire in 
their 8yearold war on aug 20 and will open peace negotitions 
five days later in geneva 
the restoration of peace will bring to the peoples of both 
countries victories far greater than those of war he said in a 
statement capping a full year of un peace efforts and three 
weeks of intense delicate diplomacy 
the persian gulf war killed or wounded more than 1 million 
people and cost hundreds of billions of dollars 
the un chief told the 15nation security council the two sides 
would begin direct talks on a comprehensive peace settlement aug 
25 in geneva he said he would preside and the level of the talks 
was to be decided 
i now call upon the islamic republic of iran and the republic 
of iraq to observe a ceasefire and to discontinue all military 
action on land at sea and in the air as of 0300 gmt on 20 august 
1988 he said in his statement 
the starting time of 3 am greenwich mean time aug 20 is 11 
pm edt aug 19 
i have been assured by the two parties to the conflict that 
they will observe this ceasefire in the context of the full 
implementation of resolution 598 a peace plan adopted by the 
security council more than a year ago 
as he spoke the envoys of iran and iraq were both present in 
the security council for the first time since the war started but 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati and iraqi ambassador 
ismat kittani did not acknowledge each others presence 
the council will meet tuesday to authorize a 350man unarmed 
un peacekeeping force including a naval contingent to monitor 
the ceasefire and troop withdrawal 
perez de cuellar did not announce dates for all peace plan 
elements including troop withdrawal prisoner exchange direct 
peace talks and an investigation into which side started the war 
the agreement is the second un negotiating success this year 
moscow is withdrawing soviet soldiers from afghanistan under a 
unmediated agreement signed april 14 
this is not a personal success for me perez de cuellar said 
later in answer to reporters questions it is a success for the 
two parties for the security council for the un organization 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati later told a news 
conference 
i wish to declare my government is prepared to accept the 
demand of the secretarygeneral and that of the entire world 
community to refrain from any military action on land sea and air 
starting today 
let me express my sincere hope that todays historic 
announcement will be the first step in the implementation of all 
provisions of resolution 598 and the achievement of a just 
comprehensive and honorable setttlement returning peace and 
stability to all the region 
asked if iran was ready to make peace with iraq he said of 
course there is no question about it 
iraqs kittani told reporters this is a happy day i dont 
think anyone is unhappy we in iraq have been waiting for this day 
 
now we begin the arduous but happy march that begins from 
here i am sure it will not be a smooth road but it will be much 
more pleasant than fighting and bloodshed 
us ambassador vernon a walters told reporters this is a 
historic date for the participating countries a historic day for 
the united states which has pressed so hard to bring this war to 
and end and a truly historic day for the united nations 
iraq had foreign exchange reserves of 35 billion when the war 
began and now owes an estimated 60 billion iran has not borrowed 
but its foreign exchange reserves have declined to a few billion 
dollars 
a financial journal published in paris la tribune estimates 
iran needs 80 billion and iraq 30 billion to rebuild 
transportation oil installations housing factories schools and 
hospitals 
un negotiations had been deadlocked over iraqs demand for 
direct talks with iran before a ceasefire iran had rejected that 
demand saying it wanted a truce first then direct talks perez de 
cuellar proposed a compromise formula that includes direct talks 
immediately after a ceasefire 
people in tehran seemed convinced monday the fighting would end 
a 25yearold man named fahrad said he was excused from military 
service because of injuries suffered in a car crash while studying 
petrochemical engineering in los angeles 
he told an associated press reporter many of my generation 
are dead in a way i was lucky to have been in that accident 
diplomats in baghdad said efforts to keep the guns silent may 
continue for years because of border and other issues 
iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after border skirmishes 
president reagan said we may finally see an end to that long 
and bloody war i applaud and encourage the efforts of 
secretarygeneral perez de cuellar 
about two weeks will be needed to deploy the peacekeepers and 
their operation will cost 74 million for the six months 
authorized they will be drawn from about 25 nations each paying 
for the soldiers it sends 
a report by perez de cuellar said the un iraniraq military 
observer group will 
establish agreed ceasefire lines on the basis of forward 
defended areas existing when the truce begins with adjustments 
when the sides are too close 
monitor compliance with the ceasefire 
investigate alleged violations and restore the situation in 
each case 
use negotiations to prevent changes in the status quo pending 
withdrawal to internationally recognized boundaries 
supervise verify and confirm withdrawal 
obtain agreement on other arrangements such as weapons 
limitations near the border and patrolling of sensitive areas by 
un naval personnel

astronomers on monday announced the discovery 
of the most distant galaxy known a cluster of stars 15 billion 
light years away that formed long before the earth and the sun 
this is very unusual and very rare said ken chambers of 
johns hopkins university one of the codiscovers were seeing 
something from before the earth formed possibly before our own 
galaxy and when the universe was very different than today 
the distant galaxy known as 4c4117 is far too faint to be 
seen by the eye but it emits a radio signal a billion times more 
powerful than the suns radio signal 
it is one of the most powerful radio galaxies we know of 
said chambers 
though the galaxy was located by radio signals its distance 
from earth was established by analyzing the optical spectrum or 
type of light put out by the galaxy 
chambers said the galaxy puts out a sharp optical signal of the 
type characteristic of hydrogen and carbon the wavelength of the 
emission however is stretched by movement away from the observer 
this stretch causes the light color to shift toward red the 
socalled red shift by measuring this shift the astronomers 
could calculate the distance of the galaxy 
a red shift of 38 found for 4c4117 shows that it is about 15 
billion light years away a light year is the distance light 
travels in a year about 58 trillion miles 
chambers said at 15 billion light years the galaxy is about 90 
percent of the distance to what is thought to be the edge of the 
universe he said it also gives a view back in time and the galaxy 
as seen now is only few billion years after the big bang the 
massive explosion that is thought to have started the universe 
expanding outward 
the galaxy is thought to be primitive or in an early stage 
of formation chambers said 
to be able to study the dynamics as it is forming will tell us 
a lot of how galaxies are formed he said 
the earth and sun are thought to have formed about 46 billion 
years ago 
the study of the distant galaxy was announced at the 20th 
assembly of the international astronomical union chambers 
codiscovers were george miley a european space agency 
representative at the space telescope science institute and wil 
van bruegel an astronomer at the university of california

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said 
monday that pakistan is continuing destructive actions in 
violation of the pact intended to end the war in afghanisan 
tass the official soviet news agency said shevardnadze made 
the comment during a meeting at the foreign ministry with us 
ambassador jack matlock 
shevardnadze returned sunday from a fourday visit to 
afghanistan and tass said matlock requested the meeting 
while in kabul the afghan capital shevardnadze and afghan 
officials said pakistan was continuing to supply weapons to the 
rebels fighting afghanistans marxist government 
the soviet union sent troops into afghanistan in december 1979 
to help the government fight the anticommunist rebels under 
geneva accords signed april 14 by pakistan and afghanistan with 
the soviet union and the united states as guarantors the soviets 
are to withdraw all of their military units by feb 15 
it was estimated that the soviets had about 120000 military 
personnel in afghanistan when the withdrawal began may 15 the pact 
called for half the soviet forces to be out of the country by aug 
15 
tass reported that shevardnadze in his talks with matlock 
corroborated the viewpoint that an obvious imbalance emerged in 
the afghan settlement 
it quoted him as saying at a time when the afghan government 
and the soviet union consistently adhered to the course toward 
implementing in full the geneva agreements pakistan continued 
destructive actions 
shevardnadze also said the united states as a guarantor has an 
obligation to ensure the letter and the spirit of the pact 
according to tass 
it said matlock delivered a letter to the foreign minister from 
secretary of state george p shultz but said nothing about the 
contents 
us embassy spokesman richard gilbert declined to comment about 
the letter 
shevardnadze told reporters in kabul sunday that the soviet 
withdrawal would would proceed on schedule despite the pakistani 
infractions 
he said the soviet troops would be out of 25 of afghanistans 30 
provinces soon and half of the force would be out as promised by 
aug 15 
shevardnadze did not specify the five provinces where soviet 
troops would remain for some time afghan officials earlier this 
year announced formation of a special northern zone where the bulk 
of the nations natural resources are located and it is believed 
the government is establishing a stronghold

the house on monday passed legislation to 
combat illegal trafficking in african elephant ivory 
sent to the senate by voice vote the measure would prohibit 
imports into this country of any ivory taken in violation of the 
convention on international trade in endangered species 
that worldwide agreement uses a system of quotas and ivory 
markings in an effort to regulate the international trade in ivory

700000 from 15 million in 1979 
the bill would ban importation of raw ivory from any nation 
without a native elephant population and would prohibit exportation 
of raw ivory from the united states

all us commercial importers and exporters of ivory and to declare 
moratoria on ivory imports from nations lacking adequate elephant 
protection programs 
the department would have to do a countrybycountry review of 
the programs and decide by dec 31 1989 whether a particular 
nations preservation efforts are adequate 
violations of the proposed law would carry a maximum civil 
penalty of 5000 and a maximum criminal penalty of a 200000 fine 
and a year in prison

republican support for a democratic contra aid 
plan collapsed monday after gop senators and leaders of the 
nicaraguan rebels denounced it and white house officials said it 
might prove impossible to implement 
following an hourlong private meeting to discuss the democratic 
attempt to forge a bipartisan contraaid policy many republicans 
emerged to criticize the effort some calling it an attempt to 
provide political cover for opponents of contra aid 
the democratic plan is unsatisfactory said sen strom 
thurmond rsc i hope they will change their minds and do what 
has to be done 
they know that it wont work or they wouldnt be supporting 
it sen ted stevens ralaska said of the democrats he 
complained that many of the democrats who have added their support 
to the compromise effort are longtime opponents of arming the 
contra rebels to fight nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
sen christopher dodd dconn who took part in the initial 
negotiations last week told reporters negotiations are over 
with i dont think there is any more room weve gone as far as we 
can go 
he predicted democrats will hold together on the issue and he 
dismissed the gop complaints saying they really dont have a 
leg to stand on substantively 
despite the rancor senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
said he would take one last shot at meeting his colleagues 
objections to the proposal 
and majority leader robert c byrd dwva the chief architect 
of the democratic contraaid package said discussions had resumed 
between the white house and doles office and told his colleagues 
i still hope that we can have the cosponsorship of my amendment 
by mr dole and others on the republican side i would like to have 
an action by the senate that is strongly bipartisan 
dole said that in the hours after the breakup of the gop 
senators meeting some progress at compromise had been made 
but he added i wouldnt want to be overly optimistic 
sources inside the meeting said colin powell president reagans 
national security adviser reported that representatives of the 
government agencies that would have to implement the plan told him 
it does not provide sufficient funds to do the job 
powell told reporters on friday that he thought progress had 
been made in working out an acceptable package but a source quoted 
him as telling the gop senators that the white house now has 
serious reservations about it 
he said we cannot implement it weve talked with the 
people who would have to implement it and it cannot be done 
according to the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
they also said contra leaders contacted the white house and 
several gop senators monday morning to declare their unanimous 
opposition to the plan they quoted them as saying they would 
rather risk getting no aid at all than to accept restrictions 
drafted by the democrats 
bosco matamoros a spokesman for the contra resistance forces 
told the associated press that contra leaders see the democratic 
plan as unacceptable and resulting from internal politics in the 
united states which basically seek to reward nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega for not complying with the commitments of the peace 
process 
this new legislation will only increase the pressures on the 
resistance which brought the sandinistas to the negotiating 
table matamoros said it will place the option on us to 
surrender or become refugees 
virtually all senate democrats had endorsed the compromise 
drafted late last week by senate majority leader robert c byrd 
dwva dole and a handful of other leaders of both parties 
the democratic plan would permit 271 million in immediate 
nonlethal humanitarian logistical aid to the contras 
but it also would give reagan an opportunity to ask congress in 
september or october to release some 163 million in previously 
purchased arms ammunition and other military supplies now stored 
in warehouses in central america 
byrd and house speaker jim wright dtexas promised republican 
leaders last week that they would bring a military aid proposal to 
a prompt vote in both houses of congress if reagan certifies that 
nicaragua has disrupted the peace and stability of central 
america by taking two of three possible actions 
the three include an unprovoked military attack on the contras 
continued blatant violations of the regional peace plan and 
continued unacceptable levels of military assistance by 
sovietbloc countries including cuba 
but several republicans emerging from the meeting most of them 
contra supporters said the plan is fatally flawed 
stevens said a chief objection is that there is no effective 
method of getting the military supplies to the contras inside 
nicaragua from the warehouses in honduras 
they would have to come out of nicaragua to pick it up in 
honduras stevens said that wont work 
some senators also complained that the democratic plan bars us 
intelligence agencies and the pentagon from delivering military aid 
to the contras saying that because deliveries must be made in the 
face of the sandinista armed forces those are the only agencies 
equipped to do the job 
sen steve symms ridaho said the democratic plan is intended 
merely to provide political insurance for contraaid opponents 
we shouldnt give cover to the people who have been trying to 
destroy the freedom fighters for their entire careers in the 
senate symms said its just a political cover for people to 
use so they can say they are for contra aid when in reality its a 
death knell for the contras 
he said there was an apparent consensus inside the meeting that 
republicans should seek a vote on a proposal drafted earlier by 
dole that would not only provide humanitarian aid for the 
contras and a vote on releasing the stored arms already approved 
but would provide 20 million in new military aid as well 
if the byrd plan were adopted it could defuse a potential 
embarrassment for the democrats whose presidential candidate 
michael dukakis has opposed military aid to the contras while his 
running mate sen lloyd bentsen dtexas has voted for it in the 
past

the house approved legislation monday to 
temporarily bar the reagan administration from carrying out a plan 
to require shrimp fishermen to use devices to protect endangered 
and threatened sea turtles 
the bill sent to the senate by voice vote would prohibit 
making the devices mandatory before sept 30 a month after such 
regulations are slated to take effect 
the delay is to allow house and senate negotiators time to work 
out differences in their versions of legislation to reauthorize the 
endangered species act 
both bills would prohibit requiring the devices in inshore 
waters until may 1990 the senate bill also would ban device 
regulations for offshore waters until next may 
turtles often drown when snared in shrimp nets

proponents of making english the 
states official language got enough signatures with one day to 
spare to put their proposed constitutional amendment before the 
voters 
the group florida english thought it had enough signatures to 
get the issue on the november ballot but last tuesday learned it 
was 930 short 
they have made it ethel baxter assistant director of the 
division of elections said monday afteroon 
the deadline was tuesday at 5 pm 
now that its on the ballot we think it will pass 
overwhelmingly said pat fulton a spokeswoman for florida 
english 
we still have more work ahead of us fulton said in a 
telephone interview from miami we overcame some odds you know 
the last minute numbers problem 
the referendum would ask voters to designate english as the 
official language but would leave it up to the state legislature 
to decide what if any government practices would be changed 
in june a group called english plus launched a campaign 
against the constitutional amendment saying the law is 
discriminatory and could cripple business and tourism in a state 
with strong ties to latin america 
signatures of 8 percent of the floridians who voted in the last 
general election are needed to get an amendment on the ballot by 
initiative besides that statewide requirement of 342939 names 
the 8 percent minimum must be met in 10 of the states 19 
congressional districts which was what gave florida english some 
trouble 
the group collected 5273 signatures to make up for the

a fire alarm went off when a fatal blaze 
broke out at a retirement home but an employee turned it off 
because residents previously had activated the alarm as a prank 
police said monday 
one resident howard sheder 74 died in sundays fire at the 
golden age retirement home and 17 other residents were taken to 
hospitals mainly for treatment of smoke inhalation four rescue 
workers and a man who aided them also were treated for smoke 
inhalation and exhaustion 
the fire may have been caused by someone smoking in a room said 
cherian samuel owner of the 23resident home in this fort 
lauderdale suburb the official cause of the fire was still 
uncertain police spokesman ed plaisted said however 
the facility has smoke detectors and passed a fire department 
inspection in march 1988 plaisted said 
but when a detector went off the employee turned it off 
thinking the residents were playing with it some people in the 
neighborhood spotted the fire and called it in plaisted said 
the quick work of two police officers in the area when the call 
came in and a civilian who aided them saved lives in the nursing 
home as thick black smoke swept through it the spokesman said 
they went in there with reckless abandon kicking open bedroom 
doors he said 
damage to the onestory structure was not heavy no official 
damage estimate was released 
i think its a tragedy because one loss of life occurred 
fire chief robert pudney said but it could have been worse 
the blaze was put out within 11 minutes he said 
samuel said the fire began in sheders room he said sheder had 
been warned not to smoke in his room

the house approved legislation monday to 
prohibit political contributions for state and local campaigns from 
being used for a federal race a step critics say amounts to 
protection for members of congress 
the bill was sent to the senate by voice vote 
however several members disputed criticism voiced by fred 
wertheimer president of the selfdescribed citizens lobby common 
cause 
current election law permits some money raised for state or 
local races to be used in a campaign for congress so long as the 
candidate did not violate any federal restrictions on the sources 
or amounts of contributions 
in a letter last week to house members wertheimer said that 
with the proposed law incumbent members of congress would be 
making it far more difficult for a state or local official to 
challenge a sitting member of congress 
members of congress could continue as they now do to raise 
reelection campaign funds throughout their term while preventing 
challengers from using any money that may have been raised prior to 
declaring for federal office even though that money meets 
contribution limits in federal law he wrote 
wertheimer noted that the bill by rep bill thomas rcalif 
does not provide a similar prohibition on house members using 
money raised for house races to run for the senate 
the bills floor manager rep al swift dwash said the 
proposal is intended to close a loophole in campaign law 
created by a ruling by the federal elections commission 
swift said the ruling for example allows a state official to 
use contributions from corporations illegal for federal offices 
to cover some expenses connected with raising money for a 
congressional race 
wertheimer also criticized swift and other members of the house 
administration committee for failing to produce a single piece of 
meaningful campaign finance reform legislation in recent years 
swift said however that the panel wont propose any major 
reform package until the senate first passes one senate democrats 
ran into paralyzing republican filibusters in 1987 and 1988 when 
they tried to move a bill setting up spending limits for senate 
races

president daniel ortega of nicaragua 
and gen manuel antonio noriega the boss of panama declared 
monday that both their countries are victims of us imperialist 
policies 
noriega who is under federal us indictment on drug 
trafficking charges welcomed ortega personally when the nicaraguan 
leader arrived at a military air base for an unannounced threeday 
official visit 
ortega said his trip was a gesture of solidarity with panama 
we are here to emphasize the gratitude of the nicaraguan 
people to the people of panama who like the nicaraguan people are 
under attack by imperialist policies of the united states ortega 
said in a brief statement to reporters 
we are also here to ratify the friendly relations existing 
between the people and government of nicaragua and the people and 
government of panama noriega said ortegas visit shows the 
points of agreement that exist among peoples who are the object of 
aggression 
when pressed to explain noriega replied those of the empire 
against the weak ones 
the reagan administration supports rebels who have fought since 
1981 to overthrow ortegas leftist sandinista government 
washington also has tried economic and diplomatic means in the past 
year to force noriega out as head of the 15000member panamanian 
defense forces the position from which he runs the country 
a federal grand jury in florida indicted noriega last february 
on drug smuggling charges noriega has denied the accusations 
last week secretary of state george p shultz tried 
unsuccessfully to get the foreign ministers of el salvador 
honduras costa rica and guatemala to issue a joint declaration 
accusing nicaragua of not living up to a central american peace 
agreement signed aug 7 1987 
nicaragua was not invited to the aug 1 meeting of shultz and 
the central american foreign ministers in guatemala city shultz 
now is on a latin american tour and has scheduled meetings tuesday 
with the chief executives of honduras costa rica and el salvador 
he then will travel to the inauguration wednesday of ecuadors 
leftleaning presidentelect rodrigo borja which president fidel 
castro of cuba also plans to attend 
ortega also had planned to attend borjas inauguration but then 
postponed his trip to ecuador by one day 
nicaraguan officials in panama said he plans to arrive in quito 
capital of ecuador on thursday they did not explain the change in 
plans 
borjas predecessor president leon febres cordero broke 
diplomatic relations with nicaragua in 1985 after ortega made a 
remark febres considered offensive borja promised he would 
reestablish relations with the sandinistas the day after he was 
sworn in 
asked by reporters to comment on shultzs activities in central 
america ortega said it was the secretarys purpose to weaken the 
unity so necessary among latin american nations to defend their 
common interests

attorneys for ptl founder jim bakker have 
protested the sale of his deposition transcript to a newspaper and 
asked a bankruptcy judge to keep future depositions secret one of 
his lawyers said monday 
the charlotte nc observer on wednesday published excerpts of 
bakkers sworn statements to attorneys 
in the observer story bakker said he believed thousands of 
internal ptl documents had been destroyed since he resigned as 
president in march 1987 in a sex and money scandal ministry 
officials have denied that 
the ministry has been in chapter 11 reorganization proceedings 
since june 1987 and must sell off assets to pay debts 
bakker attorneys ryan hovis and james toms won a court order 
thursday to protect the defrocked minister from the release of 
further transcripts the observer had purchased the documents from 
the court reporter transcribing bakkers deposition 
toms said the observer obtained about half of 20 hours of 
deposition given by bakker so far and that about five more hours of 
testimony is yet to be given 
in his ruling us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds ordered the 
transcript sealed and filed with the court clerk at the federal 
courthouse in columbia 
he noted that neither bakker nor his attorneys had reviewed the 
transcripts before their sale 
the court reporter told toms she released the transcript after 
getting permission from the bankruptcy trustees attorney toms 
motion said 
the lawyer said monday he thought it unfair to bakker to release 
the transcripts piecemeal and before they had properly entered 
court 
if you release portions of it youre releasing it in 
fragments for one thing before the whole story is told he said 
from his office in hendersonville nc 
on friday bakkers attorneys asked reynolds to clarify his 
position on release of depositions before the process continues 
were going to basically ask him to say he meant what he 
said toms said monday 
the observer said it plans to protest the order but it is not 
clear when the bankruptcy court might take up the issue again a 
court official said monday the matter had not yet been added to the 
agenda of the next hearing which is scheduled for thursday 
observer managing editor mark ethridge iii said he believed the 
story based on the transcripts was fair accurate and would not 
interfere with justice 
its not as though it alters the truth ethridge said 
he said reporters frequently buy transcripts of trials before 
they are entered into the court record 
bakker is preparing to defend himself against a 52 million 
lawsuit filed by ptl that charges him with grossly mismanaging the 
ministry the business he founded but later left after 
acknowledging a sexual encounter with a church secretary 
the ptl lawsuit alleges that bakker and former aide david 
taggart took millions of dollars from the ministry for their 
personal use even though they knew ptl faced financial trouble 
on friday bankruptcy trustee mc red benton announced a 
tentative agreement to sell ptls heritage usa christian theme 
park satellite television network and 1700 undeveloped acres for 
113 million to a canadian company samoth capital corp

george bush teeing off on his democratic 
opponent during a rare preconvention platform appearance accused 
michael dukakis on monday of being the stealth candidate 
pushing policies that can be neither seen nor heard 
dukakis whose lead in the national polls has triggered an 
avalanche of bush attacks in the past week told reporters in 
boston he was not going to respond every day to what some 
speechwriter has put in front of mr bush 
george bush has some of the highest negatives ever recorded in 
the history of american politics and i think one of the reasons for 
it is people have seen his campaign as an essentially negative 
campaign dukakis said 
while the presidential contenders engaged in longdistance 
sniping the republicans convention city turned much of its 
attention to weather reports concerning tropical storm beryl which 
was near the louisiana coast and forcing evacuations from oil rigs 
on land and in the gulf of mexico the storm was described as 
moving slowly and erratically away from land 
bush flew into and out of new orleans in a matter of hours 
taking time to tell the republican platform committee he wanted to 
campaign on a crystalclear statement of party principles 
bush campaign manager lee atwater said again monday that bush is 
intentionally playing coy on his selection of a running mate in 
order to build interest in a convention that promises no other 
surprises he will have a maximum television audience im for 
doing anything that will help build up a tv audience atwater 
said 
bush has said he will withhold his choice until the last day of 
the convention and his only comment monday was still working on 
it 
he was equally uninformative at a family dinner sunday night in 
kennebunkport maine where he had spent the weekend 
we went around the table last night at dinner some popped off 
and argued i sat silent like a sphinx bush said according to 
his oldest son george w bush we bombarded him at dinner 
nothing no expression on his face 
president reagan warming to his role as bush campaigner 
boasted of the accomplishments of the past seven years of 
republican control of the white house though he stayed away from 
the specifics of the bushdukakis matchup in a speech to the 
nations governors in cincinnati 
our states like our citizens have known the blessings of the 
longest peacetime economic expansion on record reagan said in 
the last seven and onehalf years we have broken the federal 
government of its compulsion to control every breath the states 
take 
bush and reagan are not scheduled to appear together at next 
weeks convention but the vice president said a joint airport 
appearance was possible on the second day of the meeting 
i think the grand planners are working on it bush said 
such a joint appearance would be good for me there are no 
questions on where the president stands on his support for me 
strong 
bush stepped to center stage in the city that will host his 
nomination trailing dukakis in the polls the week before the gop 
convention opens he made an unusual appearance for a nomineetobe 
speaking in person to the platform committee about what he wants 
in the document to be adopted here next week 
he dismissed the democrats platform adopted last month in 
atlanta as a document of deceit and he told the platform 
committee we need to make this campaign a plan for the future a 
statement of solutions not an exercise in evasion we should make 
our principles and our policies crystal clear to the american 
people 
he missed no opportunity to attack dukakis 
hes the stealth candidate the vice president said for 
while he cant decide about the stealth bomber he favors instead 
stealth policies they can be neither seen nor heard his 
campaign jets from place to place but no issues show up on the 
radar screen 
their nominee spoke for 50 minutes in atlanta and failed to 
mention the most important issue of our time how to make the world 
a safer place he added 
the stealth bomber is a supersecret craft designed to evade 
detection dukakis has said he supports development of the bomber 
but would not commit to deploying the craft until he saw how well 
it would operate 
touring the superdome where he will receive the partys 
nomination next week bush denied that he was engaging in negative 
campaigning 
no no very positive bush told reporters 
but he did say weve got to get these differences in focus 
as he toured a large room where teenagers were making signs for 
the convention 
then refering to the democratic convention where he was a 
frequent target bush said that was negative campaigning 
bush had a brownbag lunch turkey sandwich and potato chips 
with the construction workers who are turning the giant football 
arena into a political hall 
this is my life man and i tell you its looking great 
bush said as he looked around the mostly empty building 
members of the partys committee on contests spent monday trying 
to resolve challenges to as many as 39 of the 48 delegates from 
georgia bush won the primary there but supporters of television 
evangelist pat robertson made a run at taking over the party 
machinery 
regardless who is seated the delegates must vote for bush 
in washington the house approved legislation to prohibit 
political contributions for state and local campaigns from being 
used for a federal race a step critics say amounts to protection 
for members of congress 
the measure goes to the senate on a voice vote

the city will not enforce a 1 am curfew at 
most parks this summer to prevent violence similar to a weekend 
riot that left 38 people injured officials said monday 
the weather is very hot the beaches are closed people are 
really angry about the curfew mayor edward i koch said of the 
confrontation early sunday in tompkins square park on manhattans 
lower east side 
koch also blamed provocateurs saying they incited the 
violence by throwing bottles and fireworks at police 
there are people looking for confrontation and if they 
take on a cop its at their peril he said 
four hundred fifty police officers tangled with 250 
demonstrators who gathered in the street outside tompkins square 
park to protest its closing witnesses charged that protesters and 
bystanders were beaten without cause 
police commissioner benjamin ward said police tried to close the 
park at the request of residents who complained of loud music and 
drug dealing 
neither koch nor ward would say if officers used undue force 
ward said news footage of officers beating people had to be viewed 
in context 
i dont know of any extreme use of force ward said but the 
civilain complaint review board said it had received 23 complaints 
about police conduct at the riot 
one alleged victim had a broken finger three had cuts that 
needed stitches 14 had bruises they said were caused by 
nightsticks and five said they were shoved or pushed said sandra 
marsh the boards executive director if there was extreme use 
of force i urge those people to come forward and their complaints 
will be investigated ward said even if officers were attacked 
he said provocation is not a defense to the illegal use of 
force 
koch aides distributed photocopies of flyers at a news 
conference said to have been handed out by demonstrators one 
warned landlords around tompkins square that if the curfew were 
enforced our organization will destroy your homes another was 
bordered with drawings of guns and explosives koch called them the 
work of provocateurs and ward said professional 
demonstrators were involved 
curfews at two parks one in greenwich village and one on 
manhattans east side will still be enforced to combat drug 
dealing koch said

a remotecontrolled bomb exploded on a 
road monday amid the motorcade of secretary of state george p 
shultz shattering the window of his wifes car but causing no 
injuries 
shultz part of whose visit to bolivia was to express us 
support for this south american nations antidrug efforts said he 
will not be intimidated the war against drugs will be won 
the bolivian government blamed cocaine traffickers for the 
assassination attempt on the outskirts of la paz and for an 
earlier bombing monday at the us commissary in the capital city 
no injuries were reported but the commissary door was damaged in 
that explosion which happened at 630 am 
speaking at a news conference monday afternoon shultz praised 
the bolivian governments fight against narcotics 
when the history of the war against narcotics is written 
bolivia will rank high millions who are young still more millions 
not yet born will owe you a priceless debt of gratitude shultz 
said 
he told reporters we will not be intimidated by the tactic of 
using violence to try to scare government officials the war 
against drugs will be won and we will not be deterred 
shultz described the bombing as antidemocratic and against 
human decency the united states supports and will continue to 
support bolivias strenuous efforts to combat cocaine trafficking 
in washington state department officials said a team of state 
department security agents will fly to bolivia tuesday to help 
investigate the bombings 
police said the bomb which they believe was several sticks of 
dynamite was set off by someone on a grassy hill overlooking the 
road seconds after shultzs car had passed 
at the time of the blast about 920 am dozens of people were 
on the hill watching the 11car motorcade travel from the airport 
to the city 
three cars were damaged including one in which shultzs wife 
helena was traveling 
the explosion witnessed by this reporter from a vantage point 
several cars behind the official motorcade blew a hole in the road 
and scattered chunks of pavement rocks and dirt over a wide area 
afterward dozens of police officers hurriedly sealed off the 
road and climbed a nearby hill to search for the bombers they 
found a wire they said had been used to detonate the bomb 
in a statement released at the white house presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said terrorist tactics such as used 
against secretary shultz and his motorcade in bolivia today are 
always repugnant 
thankfully the secretarys party was not injured but the 
fact remains that an attack on us officials cannot be tolerated 
we ask the government of bolivia to bring those responsible to 
justice he said 
shultz was riding in the first few cars of the motorcade apart 
from his wife mrs shultz was in the first car that was damaged 
medical personnel were in the second and shultz spokesman charles 
redman was in the third said state department spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley in washington 
the bomb which exploded between the sixth and seventh cars 
smashed windows and blew tires on the three damaged cars 
shultz had been scheduled to go the hotel la paz but instead was 
rushed directly to the us embassy which was cordoned off by 
police and had sharpshooters dispatched to the roof 
the rest of shultzs schedule was unchanged ms oakley said 
no claim of responsibility was made but foreign minister 
guillermo bedregal said both bombings were the work of cocaine 
dealers bedregal was riding in shultzs car with us embassy 
charge daffaires david greenley 
shultz told a group of government officials and business leaders 
in la paz that the united states as the biggest consumer of 
drugs in the world has a special responsibility in this battle 
he listed us antidrug efforts and then noted passage of a law 
here that declares 90 percent of coca plants illegal and imposes 
stiff penalties on cocaine producers and traffickers 
the pirates and warlords of the drug business have fought you 
at every step with money intimidation and violence shultz told 
the gathering but there can be no question that bolivia has made 
the right choice we salute you for that choice 
active us cooperation with government efforts to fight the 
drug trade has angered the 350000 farmers from among bolivias 
67 million population who depend on coca leaf farming and 
cocaine production for a living they say the us and bolivian 
governments are not doing enough to assist in the transition to 
other crops 
the issue of us economic aid topped the agenda in shultzs 
meetings here planning minister gonzalo sanchez de lozada said 
shultz said the us government will revise its financial 
commitments here and speed up disbursements of funds already 
approved by congress he reported 
on monday evening the secretary flew to santa cruz 420 miles 
east of la paz to meet former military strongman hugo banzer 
suarez before continuing on to costa rica banzer now reads the 
nationalist democratic action party 
the 67yearold shultz has been secretary of state since 1982 
he has traveled widely during that time but has never been attacked 
before 
shultz on a 10day ninecountry latin american tour aimed at 
gaining support for reagan administration policies flew to bolivia 
from brazil his tour began aug 1 in guatemala city and is 
scheduled to end wednesday in ecuador

the owners of a boarding house where 
eugene oneill wrote his first plays agreed monday to give 
preservationists a chance to save the building by moving it to 
another location 
the owners wanted to raze the house built around 1860 to make 
way for a summer home but the state won a temporary injunction 
blocking the demolition 
the agreement which still must be formally presented to the 
court gives everybody at least something of what they want 
said state assistant attorney general lawrence russ representing 
the state historical commission 
the owners gave the state until january to decide whether the 
1story building can be moved and until march 1 1989 to remove 
the building from its site on a sandy stretch of the thames river 
in southeastern connecticut 
edward moukawsher attorney for the four owners said the house 
is rundown and that it would have been too much of a burden to 
restore it moukawsher had argued that the house built in 
carpenter gothic style was only of minor historical significance 
and that its importance had been exaggerated 
the oneill familys summer home monte cristo cottage is 
located only a block away from the boarding house and is listed as 
a national historic landmark 
the boarding house could not receive that designation because of 
its historical similarity to the cottage russ said 
oneill was convalescing from tuberculosis when he was taken on 
as a winter guest at the boarding house in 191314 while the rest 
of his family traveled on a theater tour 
during that time he produced four oneact plays that were 
incorporated into his first published work thirst and other one 
act plays and his first fulllength play bread and butter 
said historic preservationists 
while moving the house would strip it of some of its historical 
significance it still would be the building where oneill began 
his career as a dramatist russ said 
oneill who died in 1953 won four pulitzer prizes for his 
plays and the nobel prize in literature 
the agreement was reached on the same day a superior court 
hearing was set on whether the injunction should remain in effect 
pending a trial russ conceded that the state would not have been 
able to prevent the homes ultimate destruction if a trial had been 
held

as the tv generation comes of age more 
companies are turning to video magazines brochures catalogues and 
annual reports to get their message across with sound sight and 
action 
its very much a growing trend were in the television 
generation said international television association spokesman 
paul kleyman 
the groups us members who operate corporate video efforts 
have grown from 1600 to 9000 since 1978 corporate video outlays 
reached 55 billion in 1987 up from 11 billion in 1980 
according to a recent study kleyman said 
using telegenic visuals sharp graphics and background music 
video publications are becoming the way to reach teens and adults 
who prefer the tube some of the slickly produced videos are 
televised companions of printed media others stand alone or 
supplement facetoface meetings 
little by little younger employees are asking for more things 
on video said ron hale of southern california gas co which 
began newsline a tv show for staffers in 1984 the 
generation that has grown up on television expects to get their 
information quickly and on the tube 
much like a company newspaper the magazineformat show features 
segments on gaining customers how to safely use torches when 
cutting gas lines and how gas delivery to some customers was 
curtailed during a winter shortage 
programs are produced four times yearly for 20000 to 25000 
each the utilitys 9500 employees view them at 200 sites 
throughout the company some take videocassettes home to watch 
hale said 
allstate insurance produces its own videos to welcome new 
workers show corporate policyholders how to reduce accidents and 
help claims adjusters standardize estimates this year some agents 
are visiting families with a new life insurance video they can play 
on home recorders 
hell pop the video in the vcr and it will show how the 
product can really benefit them said allstate assistant vice 
president deborah kamp its an emotional product that were 
selling the use of emotions can help people understand the 
importance of the product to their familys livelihood 
video publishing also is moving into stockholder meetings 
instead of speeches from top executives some corporations show a 
companyproduced video before taking questions from the floor said 
george hobgood who prepares corporate annual reports 
three years ago i wasnt doing any video work said hobgood 
who expects to produce five to six annual report videos this year 
people will watch a 10 or 12 minute video you may or may not be 
able to get them to read the same thing on paper 
since companies must file printed reports with government 
agencies hobgood doesnt see television replacing print cost and 
portabability are other print advantages 
i dont see them replacing print said jody uttalgold who 
has produced corporate videos for five years unlike print she 
said people cant take the video home 
theres still a lot of resistance from some corporations 
she said they dont want to spend that kind of money and they 
dont think people are going to view it 
still video uses are growing as a tv generation finds new 
applications for its favorite medium redlands calif produced a 
video windshield tour of itself when officials presented a 7 
million municipal bond issue to new york firms setting the citys 
credit rating last spring 
normally it is done verbally and maybe with some flip charts 
or slides showing the city or project thats going to be 
financed said john fitzgerald of the firm organizing the bond 
issue 
video publishing has natural advantages for some topics and 
audiences said victor livingston executive producer of business 
television report a quarterly videocassette magazine for 
television industry executives 
we cover the business of television on television said 
livingston in a telephone interview from new york the video 
magazine is sent on cassettes to targeted industry leaders and 
distributed by satellite to tv stations 
several printed trade magazines cover the television business 
but livingston a former cablevision magazine editor started the 
video magazine last autumn because he wondered why the television 
industry did not use the power and impact of its own medium to 
report on itself 
the television magazine shows examples of programs and screens 
new technologies along with oncamera interviews also included 
are commercials geared for tv executives such as the nickelodeon 
cable channel and video equipment makers 
other video publishing includes colleges sending tapes to high 
schools to recruit students and companies issuing video catalogues 
of wares hardware stores and supermarkets screen videos in their 
aisles to demonstrate how products are used 
video publishing is growing simply because organizations 
understand they have to communicate in ways that people are 
comfortable being communicated with said marcy rothenberg a 
university of southern california journalism professor its a 
format people are used to seeing its visual 
video costs are steep compared to print southern california 
gas hale said one production of newsline costs more than a 
year of the utilitys employee magazine production costs are going 
down but video producers have found they cant sacrifice quality 
to save money 
i dont think you can go cheap and have a good result said 
ms rothenberg people dont want to see home movies they want 
to see something like what they see on television

if not for a bunch of guys sitting around a 
bar in denver a few years ago there would be no roseanne on 
abc this coming season 
well maybe it isnt world peace but it has changed the life of 
comedian roseanne barr who will star as the wisecracking domestic 
goddess in the halfhour comedy that might just be abcs best bet 
for a new season hit 
i was a cocktail waitress my customers encouraged me to go 
down to this comedy club i didnt know it was there so i went 
down there and watched everybody she said 
a year later she had written five minutes worth of material 
that led her to los angeles where was called from the secondary 
stage at the comedy store to main room and discovered by comedy 
producer george schlatter 
the routine at the root of this frenzy of success was described 
by barr for a group of television critics i go hi im a 
housewife domestic goddess then i tell jokes about my kids and 
then i tell jokes about my husband and then i get off 
her remarkable poise as a woman busting into a mans 
standupcomic world came from the backandforthing with the 
boys in the bar 
if those guys hadnt laughed i probably wouldnt be doin 
this now 
she is pressed on just what oneliners so impressed cocktail 
purchasers that they would encourage her to go pro 
most of it is so filthy you couldnt print it she says 
well ok 
this guy goes do you know any married women that dont want 
to get a divorce but want to have an affair with a married guy 
wholl treat em real good and spend a lot of money on em and make 
love a lot and all this stuff and i go yeah your wife 
barrs hapless and seemingly worthless husband is the butt of 
many of her jokes but in real life bill pentland was an early 
supporter of her career helping develop her material he is a 
writer and likely sometime performer on the sitcom scheduled to 
debut probably in november john goodman raising arizona 
plays her tv husband 
my real husband is like a lot more bizarre than my character 
husband barr said hes very funny hes like the funniest 
person i ever knew my whole life and hes very bizarre and he 
doesnt have any respect for anything and hes very much an 
anarchist 
they met when she was living in a commune in the rocky mountains 
and he had the only toilet in the county since he worked as the 
night manager at a motel we were really hippy people 
me and him went to this club the first time i ever went down 
there we sat there together and we were both like really appalled 
at what they were saying on stage and like whats happened to 
comedy all the pig jokes about women convinced the two of 
them that barr should take on the comedy establishment and offer 
the other side 
barrs humor is more than yocks it has a political 
workingclass edge that will likely find its way into the sitcom 
she doesnt like the sitcom moms offered to the tv public so 
far youre just a working stiff and this is your job i wish 
people would stop thinking it was destiny and start thinking its a 
job 
you try to keep everything light and funny as you can because 
theres no other way to survive being a workingclass person 
without any money 
barr said she loves carol burnett because shes so real and 
she seems like your neighbor and somebody youd like to know but 
she says she was baffled by the popularity of the old i love 
lucy show 
i like lucy but i hated that show because she has to beg her 
husband for five bucks and he spanks her i never ever understood 
that even as a little girl 
ralph and alice kramden on the honeymooners are her 
favorites cause you know they love each other and theyre just 
picking at each other which is kind of the thing i want on our 
show rather than married with children and that mean thing 
i just want to like this nice lady thats funny and has this edge 
which is how i see myself

from the its a joke file bryant gumbel is still steamed 
about the potshots that david letterman has taken at him since the 
megaphone incident a couple of years ago at a recent news 
conference gumbel even impuned lettermans masculinity for not 
doing the guys thing and calling up and apologizing i dont 
expect david to do a mea culpa on the air but i would have thought 
hed be enough of a man to pick up the phone and say its gotten 
out of hand im sorry that hasnt happened im not asking for 
it to happen im really not i guess what im saying is the fact 
that it hasnt happened tells me a lot about the guy in an 
interview last year letterman suggested forming a support group to 
meet in a church basement to help gumbel get over his distress the 
feud stems from the today shows primetime special in 1986 
when letterman shouted out his window with a megaphone as today 
was taping gumbel thought it was unprofessional letterman 
maintains he was invited by the shows producer to pull such a 
prank but someone apparently didnt warn gumbel

editors note nineteen years ago a contingent of hare krishnas 
founded a community in the appalachians and their palace of gold 
became a big tourist attraction in recent years their enclave 
also drew its share of trouble 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they flocked to west virginias hill 
country to build their hare krishna community seeking peace and a 
higher consciousness now theres been talk of demons whirling in 
the upper air to menace their faith 
more tangible threats have bedeviled the community below a 
murder a year ago a mysterious death last spring arson lawsuits 
harassment by dissidents excommunication by the larger hare 
krishna movement ugly accusations of child molestation and abuse 
even an fbi raid 
through it all the remnant of adherents at new vrindaban down 
to 150 to 300 from perhaps twice that strength several years ago 
is carrying on 
whatever was wrong in their community in the past the faithful 
say has been straightened out and they place their hopes for the 
future in their children children whose upbringing is admittedly 
different 
a 7yearold worries about the afterlife he asked me if you 
think of godhead when you die do you get to godhead his 
spiritual teacher says 
the boy had special reasons to wonder his fathers body 
charred a bullet wound in its head the remains gnawed by his own 
pit bulls was found near krishna property this spring 
donald bordenkircher the marshall county sheriff wont say 
that todd schenker was murdered he says 
what we have is a male adult who apparently shot himself in 
the head set himself on fire and then threw the gun away like 
everything at new vrindaban this case is very suspicious and 
bizarre 
in 1987 the fbi seized truckloads of computers financial 
records and sports souvenirs the krishnas were selling but never 
filed charges and returned most of the goods 
new vrindaban named after a holy town in india was founded 19 
years ago here the devotees built their palace of gold a 
dazzling little shrine that once drew some 250000 tourists a year 
there are far fewer now 
the remaining believers live below and beyond the hilltop 
shrine scattered in the valleys and ridges in mostly makedo 
houses 
the community was rocked by formal charges against two ashram 
teachers that they sexually abused their wards a former member 
claims in a court deposition that new vrindaban leaders ignored the 
sexual molestation of her son even told her it would advance the 
youngster spiritually 
other former members say the communitys leader kirtanananda 
swami bhaktipada forced them into childhood marriages they tell 
of beatings and other abuses 
it was when these and other troubles thickened that bhaktipada 
a former columbia university student and the son of a baptist 
minister spoke of the demons trying to bring misfortune on the 
palace of gold 
the krishnas have made changes new ashram leaders have been 
brought in some krishna children now attend public schools and 
community teachers have been trained to spot sexual abuse 
but child molestation charges still are pending against one 
former ashram teacher schenkers death is unsolved one swami 
still must stand trial on charges he killed a devotee who turned 
against the sect and a twoyear federal investigation of the 
community continues 
devotees are weary 
i feel like an animal in the zoo complains gopi an 
18yearold who moved to new vrindaban with her parents when she 
was 12 she left once but soon returned 
this is my religion this is what i believe my home she 
says 
the krishnas believe in reincarnation the level of each 
succeeding life determined by spiritual attainments and a higher 
consciousness they are vegetarians and allow no drugs illicit sex 
or gambling 
menial tasks are considered acts of devotion when performed in 
the name of krishna the krishna who rewards and punishes for the 
deeds of past lives krishna controls destiny krishna is all

i was crazy and i was lazy until i offered a daisy to krishna 
with love and devotion 
hari kirtan croons offkey as he plunks on the piano 
10yearold fingers stretching to hit the right keys 
about 30 children live in the ashram a long building with 
rustic bedrooms surrounding a central hall large enough to 
rollerskate in each of six teachers cares for a halfdozen 
children boys on the right girls on the left their parents work 
in the community or raise money on the outside 
the children rise early for a 5 am twohour worship service 
at the gold embellished temple next door men on the right women 
on the left 
small boys jump wildly through the incense to the rhythm of 
drums and cymbals ponytails flying saffron robes riding high 
above white athletic socks small girls in long skirts and scarves 
wind through the chanting dancing crowd with flowers or small 
flaming lamps cradled in their hands 
they attend school either krishna or public eat vegetarian 
meals sing religious songs and play 
they look happy they look healthy 
former devotees have told of a darker side to ashram life 
kanka dasi her krishna name contends her 12yearold boy told 
her in 1986 that his ashram teachers sexually molested him for five 
years 
she testified in a court deposition that she told bhaktipada 
about the abuse 
he became angry kanka testified he said i was just a 
stupid woman how much sex have i had in my life and i told him 
that it didnt compare that two consenting adults and a child 
being molested by a teacher are two different things and its very 
demonic 
kanka said bhaktipada threatened to expel anyone who supported 
the allegations other parents did nothing she said 
kanka told her story in a lengthy deposition given for christina 
mills a former devotee who left her children with their father at 
new vrindaban two years ago and now is trying to get them back 
mills lawyers filed depositions from several former adherents 
who told stories of intimidation beatings filth and sexual abuse 
according to marshall county circuit court records kanka said 
she was discouraged from being too close with her child lest it 
interfere with his spiritual development 
she left with her son while the accused teachers remained in 
the ashram until the county prosecutors office filed charges 
against them 
teachers aide frederick difrancisco known as lalita and 21 
at the time pleaded guilty to thirddegree sexual assault and 
served six months in a state correctional center headmaster gary 
gardner fled the country rather than face a criminal charge

but in the offseason hamilton county reports some of the 
highest unemployment rates in the nation 
we have a terrible depression every year lorenzen says 
in january hamiltons unemployment rate hit 158 percent more 
than double the national rate while just 80 miles to the southeast 
albany had a 44 jobless rate 
the spring is the slowest time for us says neil mcgovern 
who operates an inn in speculator between the bugs and the mud 
we have a lot of trouble convincing anyone to come up here in the 
spring partly because we dont believe it ourselves 
summer eases the job pinch by the fourth of july hamilton 
county has virtually full employment 
when the tourists are not around everything stops the two 
modest movie theaters shut down restaurants and hotels close and 
highway workers stop maintaining the back roads where no one lives 
to lure winter visitors to the area which usually gets about 
150 inches of snow the local people created 750 miles of trails 
for snowmobiles 
the snowmobiler is the largest contributor to our wintertime 
economy usually they come in at least overnight and often stay a 
friday and saturday night while the skiers and ice fishermen are 
daytrippers lorenzen says 
a furniture maker employs about 20 people in indian lake a 
lumbering operation over in long lake keeps about 30 people working 
and the county has a work force of about 40 people 
the lack of economic opportunity forces the children to leave 
home when they grow up 
they can make a living here but if they want a career to be 
a doctor or a lawyer they have to move away says loretta 
bancroft who has had five of her children leave the county when 
they grew up 
about the only way young people can afford to stay in hamilton 
county is to follow their fathers footsteps sheriff parker 
followed his father into law enforcement and he can rattle off 
several examples of sons who took their fathers place at garages 
contracting and other jobs around the county 
while the forces of nature provide local residents with what 
economic base they have it also works to isolate them officials 
have been forced to shut down onethird of the runway at the 
countys only airport because the tops of pine trees in the dense 
forest are intruding into the flight path state officials have 
said it would take an amendment to the state constitution to cut 
the trees to allow full use of the runway 
there has been talk of town house and condominium developments 
going up in speculator and inlet those proposals can generate 
heated arguments between people who resent the zoning restrictions 
for holding back the local economy and folks who worry about 
preserving the wilderness 
neil mcgovern who moved his family to speculator nine years ago 
from long island says hes not worried about development turning 
speculator into the kind of suburban sprawl common to so many other 
communities 
i moved here from long island so i would not have to hear 
somebody elses john flush says mcgovern we are so far away 
from any saturation point 
some conveniences taken for granted most places are not to be 
had in hamilton county 
we have to go out of town for our haircuts mcgovern says 
there are no bagels and it took my wife and motherinlaw some 
time to get used to the 120mile roundtrip to the mall 
lorenzen says its a myth that living in hamilton county is 
inexpensive we have to truck everything in here food is higher 
gas is higher people try to do their shopping outside 
you do try to fix the little things when you can rather than 
call a serviceman says bill abrams who still drives the chevy 
pickup truck his father bought new 21 years ago 
there are only 892 more people living in the entire county now 
than there were in 1925 and the population is not expected to 
reach 6000 for the next two decades 
lorenzen who moved to the shore of piseco lake 19 years ago 
says actually its a very fine bit of americana that is slipping 
away a lot of business is carried on on just a handshake and 
trust we dont have to lock our cars its an unusual bit of 
americana

editors note for 16 days they held out against the japanese 
invasion force some 1200 civilians fighting alongside 449 
marines 68 sailors and six army air corps men all were either 
killed or captured when wake island fell on dec 23 1941 a 
momument to the military men was erected shortly after the war but 
it was not until this summer that the civilian defenders got their 
monument many returned to wake island for the dedication some for 
the first time since the war 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
palm trees and 
evergreens grow where once there was only ironwood brush the 
oncecountless rats and gooney birds are gone the coral runway has 
been replaced 
its strange everything looks so different that walking 
around here looking at the monuments and the old rustedout guns 
its almost like looking at someone elses life like it never 
happened to me says darwin dodds of denver a retired radio and 
television broadcaster 
dodds was a 22yearold civilian construction worker captured 
when the japanese invaded this remote tropical atoll in late 1941 
he was one of the defenders of wake island who recently returned 
for a dedication of a monument in honor of the civilians who fought 
alongside the soldiers sailors and marines all of whom were 
either killed or captured 
a memorial to the marines was erected shortly after the war but 
the civilians including construction workers building military 
installations and others who worked for pan american airways got 
little credit it was 1981 before they were deemed eligible for 
veterans benefits and for 47 years there was no official monument 
to them 
the dedication ceremony drew 42 civilian defenders 14 military 
men and about about 100 family members for many of them the 
reunion june 1316 was their first visit to the island since the 
war 
ival dale milbourn 64 a retired construction contractor who 
lives in santa rosa calif still has occasional nightmares about 
his war experiences by bringing his wife two sons and his 
85yearold father to the reunion he hoped to put some of the old 
ghosts to rest 
this has been a 47yeardream milbourn said as he looked 
over the post he manned on the day of the first attack on dec 8 
1941 i just cant explain how i feel but by having my family 
here i feel like they understand why im the way i am why i did 
the things i did 
milbourn was 18 years old and a private in the us marine corps 
when he landed on wake in late 1941 he still recalls the details 
of that first attack only hours after the japanese struck pearl 
harbor wake is west of the international dateline so it was the 
next day there 
we werent prepared at all says milbourn who manned a 
3inch antiaircraft gun we hadnt even filled the first 
sandbag we ran to our positions and trained right on those planes 
but we were expecting reinforcements and we thought they might be 
our own guys 
the next 16 days were a blur of daily bombing raids thwarted 
invasions and closefought battles 
the outnumbered us troops shot down 21 japanese planes and 
sank at least two destroyers with outmoded weapons salvaged from 
warships from world war i but with no reinforcements and little 
ammunition they surrendered to the japanese on dec 23 1941 
we were among the last marines to get the order to 
surrender milbourn recalls and when we were told to give up 
our guns well that was the first time we ever told an nco 
noncommissioned officer up your bucket because wed been told 
the japanese take no prisoners 
the americans were ordered to strip and march down to the old 
airstrip where a ring of machine guns awaited there they were 
tied up and ordered to crouch in the middle of the circle 
we were scared and praying and crying and everything else 
milbourn says then at the last minute they took the guns down 
because they learned there were civilians among us 
the americans 449 marines 68 sailors six army air corps men 
and 1200 civilians were left on the airstrip overnight still 
naked and tightly bound 
the next day they were each given a small piece of bread and a 
drink of gasolinetainted water it was dec 25 1941 
that was our christmas dinner and we had no idea how much 
worse it would get milbourn recalls 
most of the prisoners were eventually transferred by boat to 
prison camps in shanghai and japan several prisoners were beheaded 
and all were poorly fed along the way the japanese kept 98 
civilians on the island as slave labor 
roger chick bamford of texarkana ark lied about his age 
to join the marines when he was 15 years old so he had not even 
turned 20 when he was released from prison camp in september 1945 
after the japanese surrender 
i got the name chick in boot camp because i was such a 
kid says bamford in prison camp the older guys looked out for 
me tried to get me food because i was in my growing years 
across the atoll the survivors many of whom hadnt seen each 
other since they were liberated from through all those years in the prison 
camps well it just 
makes you happy to be alive 
of the americans 120 were killed in the fighting and 231 died 
in captivity the 98 civilians kept on wake were executed on oct 
7 1943 
they left behind a reminder of their plight a large coral 
boulder painstakingly handcarved with their initials and the 
stilllegible message that reads98 us pw for prisoners of war 
51043 five months later they were machinegunned on the beach 
in retaliation for a devastating american air strike the day before 
the memory of those civilians and how they died has haunted many 
of the survivors 
when i heard about this trip i thought i wasnt sure i wanted 
to go i didnt know what kind of memories it would bring said 
oscar ray 67 now credit manager of a hospital in boise idaho 
the execution of the civilians affected me so profoundly that i 
couldnt sleep for weeks after hearing about it i thought it was a 
religious duty that i should come back

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
you wont find webster mich on any map

webster and its founder cloyce webster 
i guess everyone knows about me webster says hands thrust 
in the pockets of his worn overalls 
webster is proprietor of a ramshackle general store on a dirt 
road 7 miles north of fremont a sign outside reads 
webster michigan 
open 7am to 10 pm 
closed sundays 
he has no post office in his store but hes so wellknown 
locally that mail addressed to webster mich reaches him 
since first setting up shop here in 1932 webster has been 
collecting derelict automobiles and gadgets pop bottles and 
hubcaps batteries and milk jugs toasters and sewing machines all 
kinds of litter that together comprise something of a scrapbook of 
the 20th century indeed a trip to webster throws the visitor into 
a time warp back to the days of cocacola thermometers and 5cent 
soda pop 
cloyce webster a youthfullooking 70yearold pack rat 
storekeeper cobbler mechanic storyteller artist husband and 
father 
surrounded by dairy farms that dot the rolling hills of 
westcentral michigan some might call websters 27 acres a 
junkyard but among the rusting hulks of 1930s and 40s automobiles 
are some treasures 
sure i know some of these things are worth a lot he says 
and i sell some of em 
he rummages through a box full of antique bottles heres one 
of them old dr pepper bottles betcha never seen one of them 
before 
webster will sell you anything you want but if you cant pay 
hes been known to make a deal cut him some wood and hell fix a 
battery free of charge 
batteries are his specialty but he says he can fix just about 
anything if i can get the part 
chances are he has it already 
even more remarkably he knows where it is 
inventory i keep it all up here webster says pointing to 
his soiled green cap 
indeed there is a touch of organization amid the apparent chaos 
see that 36 hudson webster asks pointing to the 
mosscovered automobile partially imbedded in the ground outside 
the back of his shop its filled with tablemodel radios that 
35 chevy over there filled with gaskets only gaskets 
webster bought most of the old cars and bicycles although some 
were abandoned after being dropped off for repairs i used to buy 
everything that came along he says 
all are for sale 
i can make any one of em run webster insists 
entangled in vines and weeds are probably 500 bicycles and 
cars webster estimates not including all the ones in hundreds of 
pieces about 2 tons of hubcaps are piled up reaching the 
branches of the trees 
id clean it all out but even if i took 10 tons a day out it 
would still take seven or eight years to get rid of it all 
webster says 
inside the weathered building is a cluttered maze of spare parts 
and cases of soda bottles stacked to the ceiling dark and narrow 
aisles leading to several rooms theres a grocery section and a 
shoe repair section where webster uses car tires to make rubber 
soles guaranteed not to wear out 
this is where i do my painting webster says indicating a 
cramped area by a window there are enamel paints on a cluttered 
flat surface but no room to sit down 
it is here that webster gets away from it all painting wildlife 
scenes on aluminum printing plates 
ten dollars apiece i sell lots of em webster says 
pointing to the hundreds of finished products piled in his art 
department 
his subjects come from postcards photographs other paintings 
or from memory 
i start about 30 of em at a time he says proudly 
displaying his favorite nature scenes 
i started drawing on little scraps of paper when i was in the 
air force so id remember what everything looked like webster 
says taking out a pile of the aging pencil drawings on a shelf 
an 11thgrade dropout webster spent four years in the air 
force from 1942 to 46 closing the shop while he was gone 
when he returned he married and he and his wife elaine have 
been running the store ever since living in a rickety house next 
door websters 94yearold father a former farmer lives down the 
road 
the websters have three grown children one of whom lives nearby 
and sometimes helps out at the store and eight grandchildren 
asked if any of his children might take over the business after 
he retires webster hesitates as though it was the first time hes 
thought about it 
i dont know he says but im not retiring any time 
soon 
thats good news to his regulars 
ive been a regular for five or six years says customer 
floyd christner who was here this time for a battery part 
whenever i get a flat tire cloyce always fixes them he fixes 
everything 
and though some days are slower than others webster insists he 
does a hearty business especially considering he doesnt own a 
telephone 
if someone wants something theyd better see me directly 
he says

editors note at age 81 and at work on his memoirs hugh 
maclennan keeps a surprisingly low profile for a man the readers 
guide to the canadian novel calls a writer of unique stature 
hes written only seven novels and one book of essays in half a 
century but five of those novels won the countrys highest 
literary prize the governor generals award and he may have 
helped shape canadas political system 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
hugh maclennan secured a place in canadian 
letters and the nations political lexicon when he explored the 
cultural schism between french and english canada in his evocative 
1945 novel two solitudes 
the title became a code word for the linguistic divide and 
maclennan was credited with almost singlehandedly creating can 
lit a new wave of writing set in canada that also spelled 
success for margaret laurence robertson davies and margaret atwood 
in a conversation at his makeshift office in an old ymca 
building maclennan 81 said two solitudes is a book a 
frenchcanadian couldnt have written they couldnt even do it 
now theyre too close to it 
questions draw a stream of observations from a man hooked on 
history and the classics and has thomas wolfe and gabriel garcia 
marquez on his shelves and praises hemingway as the american 
byron 
in quick succession he says canada is a nation founded by 
losers but thats no bad thing cites aristotles maxim that 
drama depends on the familiar theorizes that the fall of the 
roman empire was due to currency devaluation and praises harry 
trumans fluency in latin 
now collecting thoughts for a book of memoirs maclennan keeps a 
surprisingly low profile for a man the readers guide to the 
canadian novel calls a writer of unique stature 
the nova scotia native lives with his invalid wife tota in a 
redbrick apartment building just below mount royal and takes a cab 
most afternoons to the small office concordia university puts at 
his disposal 
in a voice retaining the gaelic lilt of his native cape breton 
as well as the rasp of a chainsmoker maclennan says he never made 
much money from two solitudes after sacrificing royalties to 
get it published i only got 40 percent still do 
seldom interviewed or mentioned on radio and tv maclennan has 
published only seven novels and one book of essays in half a 
century i endlessly rewrite he explains 
but five of those novels won the countrys highest literary 
prize the governor generals award and two solitudes has been 
translated into at least eight languages 
critics reserve their highest praise for later books such as 
each mans son and the watch that ends the night but it is 
two solitudes that struck the strongest chord in both english 
and french and was made into a movie 
built around frenchcanadian aristocrat athanase tallard and his 
son paul the novel describes the clash between french quebec 
with its almost medieval catholicism and the mercantile english 
who once ran the province 
i remember my publisher thought it would be too gloomy a 
title but i said no leave it said maclennan who recently 
reread the book for the first time in years and concluded its 
better than i thought 
the title came from a letter written by the german poet rainer 
maria rilke who said that even in love there were two solitudes 
maclennan met an icy critical reception when he returned to the 
subject of quebec in his prophetic 1967 novel return of the 
sphinx which predicted separatist violence in the province with 
fathers and sons on opposite sides 
three years later he was vindicated when revolutionary violence 
erupted changing quebec politics forever 
i feel sympathy for these people he says referring to the 
oneinfour canadians who speak french at home this continent is 
never going to start speaking french 
he didnt anticipate the dramatic advances frenchcanadians 
would make by the 1980s taking political and economic control of 
their province embracing the entrepreneurial spirit and breaking 
the shackles of the priests 
it was like lightning they started going to college and 
became more prosperous says maclennan who arrived in montreal 
in 1935 to teach latin and greek at lower canada college boys 
school and has never left 
he credits an old montreal friend former prime minister pierre 
trudeau with keeping the country together during quebecs 
separatist explosion and having the vision to build a more 
tolerant bilingual nation 
pierre was the only man who could have handled that situation 
when it came hes absolutely without peer he says adding with 
a chuckle that trudeau is also a mysterious fellow who in his youth 
liked to drive around montreal on a motorcycle wearing a german 
helmet 
the son of a presbyterian doctor the young maclennan knew more 
about hitlers germany and stalins soviet union than he did his 
own country after going to oxford as a rhodes scholar and using the 
opportunity to travel across europe 
it was the best education i could ever have for about a year 
i thought i was a communist but it didnt last long he says 
echoing a theme explored with great understanding in his 1958 
novel the watch that ends the night 
he recalls disillusionment on a moscow visit in the 1930s when 
commissars tried to claim that since the revolution cows could be 
milked four times a day 
maclennan met his american first wife dorothy on the ship back 
from oxford and credits her with shaping his career she really 
woke me up to the fact that canada was a different country than the 
states 
her slow death from heart disease is also the heroines fate in 
the watch that ends the night which maclennan completed as she 
was dying 
after his first two novels were rejected by publishers they 
said he doesnt write like an american and he doesnt write like 
an englishman maclennan found his voice in 1941 with a story 
set in canada 
barometer rising is a world war i saga based on a harrowing 
moment in maclennans childhood the halifax explosion of 1917 he 
narrowly escaped death when a french munitions ship filled with 
explosives collided with a freighter in the harbor it was the 
largest nonnuclear explosion in history and killed more than 1600 
people 
i was this far away from being beheaded said the author 
cupping his hands 2 feet apart 
its eight years since the book maclennan swears will be his 
last novel voices in time which links nazi germany 
separatist quebec and the world after a cataclysmic future conflict 
dubbed the destructions 
i spent 12 years writing it i was lost in it i finally came 
to the conclusion that the most lethal people in the world are 
politicians

game show veteran alex trebek host of both 
jeopardy and concentration sees a big difference in the 
two television contests 
jeopardy contestants have to be smarter and the producers 
are more fussy about who gets to play 
jeopardy harks back to the quiz shows of the 1950s when you 
had to have intelligence and skill trebek says you need 
brains knowledge and quick reflexes 
concentration is more of a traditional game show the 
contestants match numbers and then get a chance to solve a puzzle 
the important part is solving the puzzle but getting a match lets 
you see more of the puzzle 
jeopardy is a quiz in which answers are provided in six 
categories and the contestants must come up with the questions 
each category has five answers and the higher the prize money the 
tougher the question 
seen on 191 stations around the country jeopardy is the 
secondhighest rated show in syndication topped only by wheel of 
fortune 
its tough to get on jeopardy game shows merely pick 
contestants from the audience wouldbe contestants for 
jeopardy must pass a battery of tests after a written test 
contenders are matched against each other in a mock game to see how 
they react to pressure and competition 
trebek relaxing in the living room of his hillside bachelor 
home is wearing a pair of wellworn blue jeans and an old blue 
jacket he got for participating in the bill cosby celebrity tennis 
tournament in 1975 
his house overlooking the san fernando valley has a hightech 
look of stark white walls and shiny metal surfaces but his 
collection of chinese paintings and statuettes religious icons 
carvings of african animals other antiques and comfortable 
furniture make it homey 
trebek grew up in canada where he got a degree in philosophy 
from the university of ottawa and worked 12 years for the canadian 
broadcasting corp he had no desire to be a game show host but 
when alan thicke a transplanted canadian offered him a job in the 
united states as host of the wizard of odds he took it 
that job lasted a year and he went on to high rollers hes 
also been the host of the 128000 question double dare 
and battlestars hes been with jeopardy for four years and 
concentration for a year 
my real ambition he says is to get into production 
producing jeopardy for the last three years has whetted my 
appetite i think i can do it its just a question of finding the 
right projects ill produce whatever movies for tv series game 
shows 
ive done a little acting but you get typecast doing game 
shows besides i have a very tight schedule 
trebek says he has learned that a contestants education and 
other background is no indication of how he or she will do on 
jeopardy 
you get people from both sexes from all kinds of 
backgrounds he says generally speaking people who are bright 
and about 30 years old will do best young people have quicker 
reflexes and that counts on the show people slow down as they grow 
older i know i have 
trebek says he created a seniors tournament for people over 50 
so that older people can compete against their peers it will be 
seen in may also a teen tournament is scheduled for february 
although many people play along at home trebek says the viewers 
dont do as well as the contestants 
its the only show where the contestants are ahead of the 
viewers he says with most game shows the people at home are 
ahead still it hooks people they want to play the game its 
best if there are a number of people watching what good is it if 
you know all the answers and theres nobody there to see you

scott bakula took on a broadway musical right 
after he went into a primetime television series with the 
understanding that it would be goodbye new york if the tv show 
turned into a hit 
instead eisenhower amp lutz was canceled by cbs and romance 
romance a modest little musical that uses only four actors and 
minimal scenery has blossomed on broadway 
the timing was incredible bakula said the other day 
sitting in his dressing room at the helen hayes theater we 
wrapped the series in midfebruary and started rehearsals for 
romance romance in march 
i came into it saying ive got a tv series and may have to 
go back in midjune he recalls and the producers said 
ok 
romance romance two separate oneact musicals looks at 
love in two very different places turnofthecentury vienna and 
trendy modernday east hampton long island 
bakula plays a rakish man about town in the first act and an 
anguished yuppie contemplating an affair with a friends wife in 
the second 
the show and bakula were nominated for 1988 tony awards neither 
won but the musical received national exposure on the tony 
telecast and has found a growing audience a recording by mca 
classics is scheduled for release in late summer 
for bakula the recognition secured a stage reputation that 
sprouted before he first went off to california to do television 
the 33yearold bakula is one of those actors who looks at ease 
in both mediums although he says he is more comfortable on stage 
than on television 
i find the camera to be confining but ive gotten over 
that he says i tend to like to be physical on stage to move 
and to do things 
television requires a certain precision he says hitting your 
mark and then being still 
how can you act bakula asks but thats the trick of it 
when youre coming from the theater now im used to it 
bakula who hails from st louis found performing a part of his 
life while growing up 
i always sang and that led to doing theater he says he 
went to the univerity of kansas to study business but later 
switched to theater 
i left school and came here to work in 1976 not study 
theater bakula recalls but i ended up studying my head off 
all over town for years 
still bakula had a job in show business the third day he was in 
new york although he had to leave town again to get it the work 
was in a dinner theater in north carolina which was doing 
shenandoah a musical that supported him a lot during his first 
years in new york 
whenever times got lean it seemed like a company of 
shenandoah would come up he says 
the actor finally made it to broadway in 1983 seven years after 
arriving in new york he survived marilyn an american fable a 
shortlived and muchmaligned musical based on the life of marilyn 
monroe in it he played new york yankee legend joe dimaggio one 
of monroes husbands 
the troubled show which had 13 producers listed above the 
title went through weeks of previews after the first director 
choreographer and leading lady were replaced 
it was very frustrating bakula says now but it was my 
first broadway show so it also was very exciting 
the experience led bakula almost immediately into a much happier 
effort 3 guys naked from the waist down the offbroadway 
musical written by michael rupert and jerry colker was a hip 
offbeat look at the world of standup comedians one job in show 
business bakula had never tried 
now i know why people are standup comics he says when 
you are really cooking you feel like you can stay out there for 
two hours and theyll laugh at anything you say its a real heady 
kind of feeling to be totally in control of an audience 
bakula went west to appear in a los angeles production of the 
offbroadway musical nite club confidential he moved into 
television with an occasional role on cbs designing women as 
annie potts exhusband and a major part in abcs gung ho 
which died quickly in a brutal time slot where it faced both 
dallas and miami vice 
bakula was cast as the flybynight lawyer in eisenhower amp 
lutz in july 1987 but the first episode wasnt filmed until 
october cbs didnt require a pilot because of the sterling 
reputation of the shows producers alan burns and mtm 
the 13 episodes that eventually were made didnt set the 
nielsens afire though the ratings had started to improve when the 
show was canceled 
i cant really explain what cbs did to the show he says 
we did everything they asked of us we even got the 18 to 
40yearold audience that sponsors love 
the network only has six halfhour shows on the schedule for 
the fall he adds there were not that many slots to fill 
fortunately while in new york to publicize eisenhower amp 
lutz bakula did an informal audition for keith herrmann and 
barry harman the composer and directorlyricist of romance 
romance 
i hadnt sung in a while and my voice was out of shape he 
says but he got the job 
its kind of like a storybook ending bakula says we 
survived opening night which is a rarity these days and then got 
all those tony nominations and business has been getting better 
im not going anywhere else for a while

the upcoming 1988 olympics have become a symbol 
of progress and hope in south korea which has achieved an economic 
miracle in the four decades since it was founded now after years 
of government by a small elite south korea is searching for the 
keys to political stability and economic fairness aps seoul 
bureau chief provides a look 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
forty years after its creation and 35 
years after a devastating war south korea is trying to end decades 
of authoritarian rule and build a stable democracy to match its 
colossal economic achievements 
south korea founded on aug 15 1948 has become one of the 
most modern and rapidly expanding economic powers in asia but its 
politics have not changed as quickly 
despite liberal reforms in the last year a powerful elite of 
government bureaucrats military commanders and business leaders 
still dominates the nation as it has for most of south korean 
history 
political leaders analysts intellectuals and others agree the 
nation must build an enduring democratic system and stabilize its 
turbulent politics if it is to find domestic peace and continue to 
modernize and grow the question is how 
this nation of 41 million people also faces the challenge of 
more fairly sharing the benefits of economic expansion the 
industrial workers who helped build and fuel the economy are 
clamoring for change 
the 1988 olympic games being held here in september will be 
dramatic proof of how far south korea has come since the korean war 
ended in an armistice in 1953 the war which began with an 
invasion by communist north korea left more than 1 million killed 
and injured 
north korea still has not given up its hopes of reuniting korea 
divided by us and soviet troops at the end of world war ii 
the two governments are locked in a bitter struggle for 
supremacy on the peninsula and both sides claim to be the sole 
legitimate korean government hundreds of thousands of troops face 
each other in constant tension along a 150mile demilitarized zone 
including 40000 us troops supporting the south 
but signs of progress on the domestic political front and 
tentative moves to reduce tension with the north have stirred hope 
that south korea can overcome its challenges 
after decades of authoritarian rule by military and civilian 
strongmen a desire for change sent hundreds of thousands of people 
into the streets in the summer of 1987 the demonstrators ranged 
from students to middleclass businessmen and forced president chun 
doohwan who seized power in a 1980 military coup to agree to 
elections and reforms 
roh taewoo an ally of chun who had backed the call for 
reforms won the presidential elections with a slender victory over 
a divided opposition roh a former general like chun took office 
feb 25 in south koreas first peaceful transfer of power 
roh a mix of pragmatist and populist promised to end decades 
of authoritarian rule and usher in full democracy now nobody 
will be able to reverse the current of democracy roh declared 
south korea has seen rapid liberal reforms during the past year 
political intellectual and artistic freedom has flowered with the 
government no longer trying to regulate almost every aspect of life 
restrictions and controls on opposition groups labor unions 
dissidents the press and other groups have been lifted or reduced 
most opposition groups operate freely after years of repression 
peaceful protests strikes and political rallies have become 
commonplace in a nation where a year ago riot police suppressed 
almost all independent political activity 
roh who cultivates a common man image has gained growing 
support for his programs a recent poll said 53 percent of koreans 
approve of the president but just 21 percent support his 
democratic justice party because of past abuses 
despite the recent changes some observers fear the divisions 
and antagonisms that have plagued south korean politics for years 
have not been resolved and the nation could again face chaos 
opposition groups are determined to end the governing elites 
power and insist they alone can build full democracy 
hardline opposition dissident and labor groups claim roh is a 
front for military rule and say they wont end their struggle to 
oust the administration radical students a small but powerful 
minority on campuses continue to stage violent protests 
factionalism continues to dominate korean politics with cliques 
under autocratic leaders constantly struggling for power factions 
are seen as a barrier to democracy because they do not tolerate 
differing views and reject compromise as weakness 
some political leaders fear the political calm could end after 
the olympics the opposition intends to keep roh to his promise of 
letting voters evaluate his performance after the games 
opposition leaders want a referendum and say roh must step down 
if he loses government leaders say there can be no question of the 
president surrendering power 
some officials say government hardliners have tolerated moderate 
policies because they dont want to offend international opinion 
when the olympics focus world attention on south korea but the 
hardliners may try to crack down on the opposition later they say 
while south korea seeks political stability it faces a related 
challenge from workers the poor and others for a much larger share 
in the rewards of the economic success they helped create 
south korea grew from being one of the poorest asian nations 
with a gross national product of 18 billion in 1955 to a gnp of 
119 billion last year once almost dependent on foreign aid seoul 
now has a 10 billion trade surplus with the united states and its 
exports flood markets around the world 
industrial workers who produce the cars electronic goods and 
other items that have fueled the export boom want dramatic 
improvements after decades of poor pay spartan lifestyles and long 
work hours 
the government which in the past backed business and suppressed 
labor groups agrees there must be major changes roh has 
encouraged business to work with workers and unions 
high economic growth has been a national driving force but 
now attention must also be given to greater distribution of wealth 
to help the needy government democratic justice party chairman 
yoon gieljoong told the associated press 
some labor leaders contend the concessions are token and many 
workers lead poor and bleak lives they complain of cramped 
squalid housing poor food and long exhausting work hours in 
dangerous and oppressive working conditions 
the government rejects opposition claims that 25 percent of the 
populations of seoul and other cities live in poverty officials 
say about 6 percent of city dwellers are below the official poverty 
line of about 300 a month 
the government underestimates the number of the poor to give 
themselves legitimacy and to project korea as a prosperous 
nation said rev kim kwangsoo a dissident who helps the poor 
young soogil an economist at the korea development institute 
said managers and workers must find a new relationship to increase 
living standards without hurting productivity and exports by 
driving up costs too much 
it will take some doing he said

while south korea has developed into 
one of asias success stories north korea is one of the worlds 
most engimatic nations 
the north occupying the top half of the 600mile long 
peninsula is feared for its often wild irrational policies and 
its willingness to use violence against its opponents 
north korean president kim il sung now 76 rules with a 
monolithic personality cult that teaches north koreans to idolize 
him 
giant statues of kim called great leader dot the country 
the staterun media are filled with slavish praise of the president 
and north koreans are taught that he is loved around the world 
north koreans generally wear badges bearing kims picture 
the centralized control which demands total loyalty to the 
leader has produced a pervasive and almost suffocating cult of 
personality the institute of international affairs in london 
said in a recent report 
kim is attempting to build the worlds first communist dynasty 
his son kim jung il has been designated to succeed him a 
personality cult is also being built around the son who is called 
dear leader 
the ruling korean workers party enforces rigid control over all 
aspects of life independent political groups or other 
organizations are not tolerated religion is outlawed and dissent 
or opposition is suppressed 
but the north faces mounting problems chronic mismanagement 
rigid state planning and massive military spending have crippled 
the economy and there are reports of food shortages 
north korea in 1987 because the first nation ever to be declared 
in default on its foreign loans by international banks north 
korean diplomats have been caught selling drugs liquor and watches 
in western europe in desperate schemes to raise hard currency 
the north invaded the south in 1950 to trigger the bloody korean 
war it maintains the worlds sixth largest army and has repeatedly 
carried out terrorist attacks against the south 
the north was blamed for the bombing of a korean air lines 
commercial airliner that crashed near burma last nov 29 killing 
115 people the north koreans deny any involvement

raiders of the lost ark the steven spielberggeorge lucas 
homage to the saturday matinee serial spawned a host of films in 
the same genre ranging from the good romancing the stone to 
the poor the golden child 
now comes vibes which lands somewhere in between 
the new columbia pictures release most resembles romancing the 
stone in that an antagonistic couple are thrown into a fortune 
quest in the south american wilderness falling in love along the 
way vibes has some other attributes as well including 
stunning ecuadorian scenery and the movie debut of rock superstar 
cyndi lauper 
the story begins promisingly in a manhattan psychic lab operated 
by julian sands room with a view among his subjects is jeff 
goldblum a museum worker who can reveal peoples secrets by 
touching their personal possessions and miss lauper a blond bimbo 
who can foretell the future with the help of a spirit companion 
named lucille 
the pair take an instant dislike for each other and their 
feelings intensify when they arrive in ecuador what are they doing 
in ecuador well it seems that a shady character resembling the tv 
detective columbo has enlisted them to help find his lost son why 
they would trust such a person is one of the many mysteries 
contained in the script 
expectably peter falks ruse is exposed what he is really 
after is incan treasure hidden for centuries in the andes the 
search has already claimed two lives but the lure of fortune has 
still attracted thugs and adventurers who will use any means to 
snatch it first 
such goingson provide a reasonable basis for a hightech 
actionadventure so what goes wrong for one thing the leading 
characters sound like vintage damon runyon and the script writers 
lowell ganz and babaloo mandel have supplied oneliners that only 
now and then zing 
ken kwapis directed with a good eye for action but his actors 
seldom shine goldblum who has created a number of memorable 
characters is strangely restrained falk veers from the amusing to 
the annoying 
that brings us to the celebrated miss lauper she is typecast as 
the wisecracking babe in search of a man and her role seems to 
duplicate judy hollidays billie dawn in born yesterday 
yet there are no false notes in the singers portrayal and at 
times she can be quite touching a film career could be assured if 
a big if she can slip into roles that depart from her music

walker mca home video vhsbeta 7995 rated r 
 
walker based on a true story about an early american 
incursion into nicaragua is one of those movies that flopped at 
the boxoffice but sounds as if it might be an unappreciated gem 
just waiting to be rediscovered on ideo 
unfortunately even on the home screen walker is still a 
flop though with its timely subject it can hardly fail to 
generate some interest 
the film directed by alex cox retells the story of william 
walker a soldier of fortune who led a bloody invasion of nicaragua 
in the 1850s 
walker as portrayed by ed harris is a ruthless idealist who 
as he orders mass slaughters of civilians mouths platitudes about 
americas duty to protect our neighbors from oppression and 
apparently believes what hes saying 
according to the filmmakers walker sets out on his expedition 
at the urging of cornelius vanderbilt played here by peter boyle 
as a flatulent foulmouthed old tyrant who wants to protect his 
railroad line running through nicaragua from rival nationalist 
groups 
the climax of the film is an impassioned speech walker gives 
shortly before his oneman rule is toppled and he is executed in 
which he tells the nicaraguan people that america will never 
leave you alone 
chilling words but cox runs the contemporary angle into the 
ground by littering the movie with deliberate anachronisms like 
helicopters cigarette machines and personal computers 
much of the dialogue and direction seems sloppy and confused 
and there hasnt been so much blood spilled on screen since the 
wild bunch 
oscarwinner marlee matlin has about five good minutes early on 
as walkers deaf girlfriend but once she dies of cholera both he 
and the movie go downhill fast

the lost weekend mca home entertainment vhsbeta 5995 
not rated 
 
it is fascinating and frightening to watch ray milland as the 
literate desperate alcoholic don birnam in the lost weekend 
his performance earned him an academy award in billy wilders 1945 
movie which also was named best picture 
milland and jane wyman are the films stars but alcohol is the 
main character 
taken from the charles jackson novel of the same name the 
lost weekend shows three days in birnams life horrible drunken 
days when birnam sinks to the depths of his soul tormented by his 
failure as a writer 
he rummages madly through his brothers apartment in search of a 
bottle of whiskey he himself hid but lost trudges relentlessly 
through manhattan in search of an open shop to pawn his typewriter 
in one of the films saddest moments he chooses a sip from his 
tumbler of liquor over the kiss of helen wyman who loves him 
still birnam who talks of writing a novel called the 
bottle is witty and eloquent drink he tells a bartender may 
shrink his liver and pickle his kidney but what does it do to my 
mind it tosses the sandbags overboard so the balloon can soar 
it makes no difference that the movie is 43 years old or that 
its in black and white even today there could be no more 
persuasive advertisement against alcohol abuse

children who ride along in bicyclemounted seats 
should wear approved crashtested safety helmets experts say as a 
growing number of children are being seriously injured in cycling 
accidnts 
in a study of injuries to bicycle passengers dr james sargent 
a pediatrician at boston city hospital found that 65 percent of 
the injuries to children in bicyclemounted child seats are to the 
head and face 
the reason for that preponderance of head injuries we 
believe is that these seats put children high off the ground and 
that when the bicycle falls over the childs head is the highest 
part of the whole bicycle 
you combine that with the fact that toddlers dont have much 
head control their heads are heavy in relation to their bodies 
and they dont have the muscle development an older child has 
sargent said 
california highway patrol records of bicyclerelated injuries 
and deaths to children under age 6 from 1977 to 1986 showed that 
the number of injuries to cyclists remained relatively constant 
but injuries to passengers jumped from 17 percent of the total in 
1977 to 28 percent in 1986

an optical telescope destined to float 
next year from a space shuttle orbiting beyond the haze of 
atmosphere will let scientists peer into the depths of the universe 
and 14 billion years intothe past 
in orbit the edwin p hubble space telescope should see seven 
times as far as the 2 billion light years of the most powerful 
earthbound telescopes 
first scheduled for an august 1986 launch it so far hasnt 
looked at anything it sits in a windowless room wrapped in 
silvery thermal blankets running up bills 
after the jan 28 1986 challenger accident halted the shuttle 
program a nasa official told congress the telescope would be 
expensive to babysit 
babysit makes it sound like the telescopes sitting there 
all ready to go said bert bulkin director of scientific space 
programs here at lockheed missiles and space co inc you put it 
in the cocoon and just before flight take it out of the cocoon and 
fly it well thats not the case 
beyond 15 billion to build the telescope the cost of 
continuing work during the first 30 months of delay will reach 400 
million according to nasa project manager fred s wojtalik faulty 
devices installed originally have led to dozens of alerts and 
driven up costs by as much as 10 million a year 
thats for a project approved in 1977 at 572 million 
the telescope was built to work in the vacuum of space and must 
be protected from even minute amounts of dust moisture and noise 
its 945inch primary mirror has been kept virtually free of 
contamination 
in the clean room giant fans cleanse the air through 
filters that can screen particles 200 times thinner than a hair 
the 350 scientists engineers computer experts and others 
attending the craft must wear uncomfortable white bunny suits 
masks and rubber gloves anyone entering must be covered completely 
and pass through an air shower 
the 42foottall 25000pound aluminumframed spacecraft has 
been taken apart and almost put back together in preparation for 
shipping in november to cape canaveral via the panama canal the 
scientific instruments designed to be serviced every three to five 
years in space have been pulled out more than a dozen times for 
inspections repairs and improvements 
the hubble got a clean bill of health two years ago after what 
bulkin calls 57 nightmarish days of aroundtheclock testing 
using extreme cold and heat to simulate space the longer it sat on 
the ground though the more problems it developed 
we had alerts coming out of the bazoo bulkin said 
when a part fails an alert is signaled and contractors of other 
devices using that part are notified reams of computer printouts 
have to be analyzed 
if its a problem like the thermostats where six out of about 
150 of them were bad and youre sitting on the launch pad you 
replace the bad ones and go he said if you have time like 
weve had for the last two years then you pull the boxes and fix 
them all 
defective thermostats and resistors were replaced and more 
efficient solar cells and batteries added 
for its 17day trip to florida the telescope will be placed in 
a 27by19by60foot hermetically sealed steel container moved 
by barge to the oakland army terminal across san francisco bay in 
alameda and be loaded on a ship 
there is a lot of anxiety about the move the canal is not the 
safest area said bulkin every time you lift it up youre 
sitting there and your heart goes boom boom boom im not going 
to be happy until its in orbit from the time it leaves here 
in the future such telescopes will be moved by a specially 
modified army transport plane but the plane wont be ready in time 
meanwhile budgetminded officials arent the only ones 
concerned about the delay so are astronomers and the european 
space agency which paid 15 percent of the building costs and 
provided the sophisticated faint object camera 
the international astronomical union decided five years ago to 
hold its 1988 meeting in baltimore near the goddard space flight 
center in greenbelt which is managing the hubble instruments 
mission operations and data 
it was to be the centerpiece of the meeting they expected to 
have their first views ready by now said lisa hooker a 
spokeswoman for johns hopkins university which was host for the 
assembly last week 
were all frustrated by having to wait so long but its going 
to be fantastic fun when its in orbit said jim westphal 
professor of planetary science at california institute of 
technology and a principal investigator on the telescope i 
suspect were going to find many amazing things that will thrill 
the public not once a year but maybe once a week 
the hubble is named after an american astronomer who used the 
100inch hooker telescope in pasadena to examine stars in the 
andromeda galaxy the first conclusive proof of galaxies other than 
our milky way 
the space telescope is smaller than many landbased 
observatories but should transmit much sharper images because it 
will be stationed more than 350 miles above the distorting effects 
of the atmosphere it also will be able to make images in the 
ultraviolet or black spectra that cant be made on earth 
telescopes that follow the hubble into orbit will study xrays 
gamma rays and infrared radiation 
the new view of the universe scientists for westphal said is 
similar in impact to the vision a very nearsighted person would get 
by putting on glasses for the first time im prejudiced but i 
think it is well worth the money because it will help solve some of 
the puzzles man has wondered about for thousands of years he 
said 
ill let you know after it sends back some pictures bulkin 
said 
astronomers plan to look for evidence of planets in other solar 
systems study planets in our solar system in greater detail 
search for black holes in galaxies and measure the distance 
between stars more accurately 
they will try too for a better understanding of the origins 
and possible fate of the universe as they gaze at light that took 
14 billion years to get here close to the beginning of time in 
the universe 
scientists will be able to explore a region 350 times larger 
than they can said italian astrophysicist duccio macchetto 
looking far away means going back in time macchetto said 
we hope to go back to those periods in which galaxies and quasars 
were formed

baby should have his first checkup 
some experts believe about five months before birth 
all women should have careful ultrasound in the fourth month 
of pregnancy as though it is the babys first physical exam said 
dr judith g hall of the university of british columbia 
most people think about prenatal diagnosis as preparatory to 
early termination of the pregnancy said hall but really its 
not it allows us to begin early treatment 
doctors may recommend abortion if ultrasound finds a severe 
defect but this isnt always the case 
ultrasound in which the echoes of sound waves make pictures of 
the fetus inside the womb often is a routine part of prenatal 
care but hall believes it can be employed much more effectively to 
thoroughly examine a growing fetus 
some of us in the business of doing highrisk obstetrical 
ultrasound can probably pick up most of the major congenital 
abnormalities agreed dr beryl r benacerraf a radiologist at 
harvard medical school 
about 5 percent of babies have significant congenital 
malformations physical defects present at birth that require 
extensive treatment or change a childs life while the newborn 
death rate has fallen dramatically over the years the liklihood of 
serious birth defects has not changed 
at a recent genetics conference at the jackson laboratory here 
hall contended that at least half of all these birth defects could 
be spotted before birth through ultrasound exams 
benacerraf has shown that doctors can accurately identify 
fetuses with downs syndrome by looking for thighbones that are 
slightly shorter than usual and an extra roll of skin on the back 
of the neck 
even though many women already have ultrasound during pregnancy 
hall said it is not ordinarily used to take a careful look at the 
unborn childs health instead it is primarly intended to measure 
the size of the babys head and the length of his arms so 
physicians can determine how old the fetus is 
among other things she said ultrasound can be used to check 
the severity of osteogenesis imperfecta a birth defect in which 
the child suffers broken bones the scan can help determine whether 
the child would benefit from caesarean section to avoid fractures 
during birth 
ultrasound can also help spot fetal heart block a condition in 
which the fetuss heart fails to beat strongly enough this 
condition can be treated before birth by giving the mother 
digitalis 
benacerraf said she believes all pregnant women should have 
ultrasound but she cautioned that many doctors are not trained to 
spot birth defects 
physicians who have socalled level one training she said 
are just getting a couple of measurements and counting heads 
while those with more sophisticated skills look for the often 
subtle signs of abnormalities 
benacerraf said a major study sponsored by the national 
institutes of health is trying to determine whether routinely 
doing the more sophisticated ultrasound is worth the expense which 
is between 150 and 300 but even if it turns out to make economic 
and medical sense on a large scale it will not immediately be 
available everywhere 
there are not that many people trained in this field she 
said if all of a sudden we decided to scan everybody whos 
pregnant we couldnt possibly handle the volume

a mama bear is a crowdpleaser 
especially with a rolypoly cub romping at her side but whats a 
zoo to do when baby grows up 
too often surplus penreared black bears are sold traded to 
dubious buyers or killed and the mother bred again so zoo visitors 
wont be robbed of the baby bear experience said michael pelton a 
wildlife science professor 
pelton of the university of tennessee and doug scott of the 
tennessee wildlife resources agency are tracking radiocollared 
bears released from zoo areas into the cherokee national forest 
penraised black bears have been used in research in tennessee 
but this is the first time weve made a concerted effort to keep 
track of them pelton said we want to learn more about how 
they react to a new environment after having been born in 
captivity 
the main thrust of the study is to determine simply if these 
animals will make it in the wild and if theyre suitable for 
release scott said thats the big question should we even 
take these bears off the hands of zoos or should we just allow 
them to be bought and sold 
six bears wearing radio collars have been released three each 
from the ober gatlinburg and grandfather mountain resort zoos one 
bear grew dependent on area residents for ice cream and other food 
handouts when the zoo that had housed it declined to take it back 
the bear had to be killed the resort later relented and took back 
another bear after similar problems arose scott said 
a third bear was found dead in the forest foul play is 
suspected and an autopsy is pending radio contact has been lost 
with a fourth bear 
despite the problems neither pelton nor scott is ready to give 
up 
about 20 penraised black bears have been released into the wild 
in tennessee over the last 10 to 15 years but without radio 
collars theres no way of knowing their whereabouts pelton said 
in the past tattoos and ear tags were used on penraised bears 
at least three have turned up dead as the result of legal hunts 
which tells researchers they managed to adapt at least to nature 
the handling of bears in captivity has a lot to do with their 
odds of making it in the wild pelton said often theyre fed 
dried dog food rather than berries and acorns and are given treats 
by zoo visitors neither practice boosts their chances of adapting 
in addition their cages are sometimes bereft of places to climb 
and hide a more natural environment and theyre allowed too much 
contact with humans 
several years ago the state prohibited the caging of tennessee 
black bears in areas other than bona fide zoos or zoological parks 
the law doesnt require special diets or cages to help the bears 
survive in the wild if the need arose 
my hope is that the state game people say to the people who 
generate these animals we need to do abc and d otherwise we 
cant work with you pelton said

the edwin p hubble space telescope is 
to float next year from a space shuttle beyond the haze of 
atmosphere to let scientists peer into the depths of the universe 
and 14 billion years into the past 
it should see seven times as far as the most powerful 
earthbound scopes 
originally scheduled for august 1986 launch it so far hasnt 
looked at anything it sits wrapped in silvery thermal blankets 
running up bills 
beyond 15 billion to build it the cost of work during the 30 
months of delay since the challenger explosion will reach 400 
million nasa says faulty devices have driven up costs by as much 
as 10 million a year 
thats for a project envisioned in 1977 as costing 572 million 
the telescope must be protected from even minute amounts of 
dust moisture and noise in the clean room giant fans cleanse 
the air through filters that can screen particles 200 times thinner 
than a hair 
the 42foottall spacecraft has been taken apart and almost put 
back together in preparation for shipping in november to cape 
canaveral scientific instruments designed to be serviced every 
three to five years in space have been out more than a dozen times 
for inspections repairs and improvements 
meanwhile budgetminded officials arent the only ones 
concerned about the delay so are astronomers and the european 
space agency which paid 15 percent of the building costs and 
provided a sophisticated faint object camera 
data from the hubble was to be the centerpiece of the 
international astronomical unions 1988 meeting scheduled five 
years ago and held last week in baltimore the goddard space flight 
center in nearby greenbelt md is managing the instruments 
mission operations and data 
the hubble named for an american astronomer who provided the 
first proof of others than our milky way is smaller than many 
landbased telescopes but should give sharper images because it 
will be 350 miles above the atmosphere 
astronomers will look for evidence of planets in other solar 
systems study planets in our solar system in more detail search 
for black holes and measure the distance between stars more 
accurately they will try too for a better understanding of the 
origins and possible fate of the universe

baby should have his first checkup 
some experts believe about five months before birth 
all women should have careful ultrasound in the fourth month 
of pregnancy as though it is the babys first physical exam said 
dr judith g hall of the university of british columbia 
most people think about prenatal diagnosis as preparatory to 
early termination of the pregnancy said hall but really its 
not it allows us to begin early treatment 
in ultrasound the echoes of sound waves make pictures of the 
fetus 
about 5 percent of babies have significant congenital 
malformations physical defects present at birth that require 
extensive treatment or change a childs life while the newborn 
death rate has fallen dramatically over the years the liklihood of 
serious birth defects has not changed 
hall contends at least half of all these birth defects could be 
spotted before birth through ultrasound exams among other things 
she said it can be used to check the severity of osteogenesis 
imperfecta a birth defect in which the child suffers broken bones 
the scan can help determine whether the child would benefit from 
caesarean section to avoid fractures during birth 
ultrasound can also help spot fetal heart block in which the 
fetus heart fails to beat strongly enough this can be treated 
before birth 
dr beryl r benacerraf a radiologist at harvard medical 
school said a major study sponsored by the national institutes of 
health is trying to find if routinely doing the more sophisticated 
ultrasound is worth the expense between 150 and 300 but even if 
it turns out to make economic and medical sense on a large scale 
it will not immediately be available everywhere

a mama bear is a crowdpleaser 
especially with a rolypoly cub romping at her side but whats a 
zoo to do when baby grows up 
too often surplus penreared black bears are sold traded to 
dubious buyers or killed and the mother bred again so zoo visitors 
wont be robbed of the baby bear experience said michael pelton a 
wildlife science professor 
pelton of the university of tennessee and doug scott of the 
state wildlife resources agency are tracking radiocollared bears 
released from zoo areas into the cherokee national forest 
the main thrust of the study is to determine simply if these 
animals will make it in the wild and if theyre suitable for 
release scott said thats the big question should we even 
take these bears off the hands of zoos or should we just allow 
them to be bought and sold 
six bears wearing radio collars have been released three each 
from two resort zoos one grew too dependent on people for food 
handouts when the zoo declined to take it back the bear had to be 
killed the resort later took back another bear a third was found 
dead and radio contact was lost with a fourth 
the handling of bears in captivity has a lot to do with their 
odds of making it in the wild pelton said often theyre fed 
dried dog food rather than berries and acorns and are given treats 
by zoo visitors neither practice boosts their chances of adapting 
in addition their cages are sometimes bereft of places to climb 
and hide a more natural environment

algae growing in ponds in the israeli desert 
could lead to new products to bring agriculture to arid regions 
we are seeding plants that would never grow in the desert 
said duke university botanist joseph ramus this project is in 
its infancy what we are developing now will come to fruition in 
the year 2000 and later 
ramus and ben gurion university researchers are growing algae in 
labs and transferring them to ponds in the valley of arava in the 
negev the ponds fed by fossil water from 3000foot wells each 
hold a different type of algae 
they also are growing saint peter fish in the ponds the fish 
produce nitrogen to help the algae grow and bring a good price at 
market aquaculture of saint peter fish is becoming a big 
industry there its a real delicacy for them ramus said one 
fish is enough for a meal its like the catfish or crawfish 
industry in the southeast 
the algae can be used to produce beta carotene a source of 
vitamin a phycolloids which are food thickeners and 
biliproteins which can be used in food colorings he said

researchers in this small town are 
watching the grass grow and hoping to protect coastal wetlands 
from wind waves and development that erode thousands of acres a 
year 
the grass grown on 11 acres of ponds arent protected from 
disease or weather theyre not fertilized and the only thing out 
of the ordinary they get is a daily dose of saltwater from pumps 
that simulate the tide 
us soil conservations service researchers hope the smooth 
cutgrass giant cutgrass and gulf cord grass will prevent the 
coastal erosion that takes some 32000 acres a year of louisianas 
32 million acres of coastal wetlands 
a tough reedy carpet of such marsh grass can form a natural 
barrier against tides waves wind and the effects of dredging 
canals and exploring for oil while the roots hold the soil in 
place said the agencys jack cutshall 
the project began in 1984 on land owned by the louisiana land 
and exploration co an oil and gas company and researchers expect 
to know within a year what types are promising and within five 
years those that are suitable for seed production and aerial 
seeding projects 
weve learned an awful lot with these plants cutshall said 
there was virtually no information on how gulf cord grass grows 
so weve done some original work there and weve done some 
original work on smooth cutgrass 
what remains he said is to find a plant that has the best of 
everything

chickens die during heat waves because 
they cant sweat but heating chicks seems to make them more 
resistant as adults says a researcher who doesnt have the 
foggiest idea why 
chickens exposed to 95 to 100 degree temperatures when they are 
5 days old and again when they are 6 weeks old seem to have a 
survival rate 70 percent to 95 percent better than unheated 
chickens said michael denbow a virginia tech associate professor 
of poultry science its kind of neat 
asked how it works he said we dont have the foggiest idea 
chickens cool off by panting which evaporates water through 
their respiratory systems said denbow who has spent three years 
testing the birds broilers are usually ready for market at about 
six to seven weeks

after last years record growth 
furniture industry analysts projected business would flatten out in 
1988 
so far their projections are on the mark but that doesnt mean 
the furniture manufacturers many of them in north carolina are 
sitting on their hands 
faced with the industrys first prolonged nogrowth period since 
1982 the manufacturers are developing innovative ways to attract 
retailers and consumers 
some are pushing new furniture lines to catch the eyes of 
potential customers others are working to improve services prices 
have been sharpened and new marketing strategies devised 
the people who will be successful will do their homework come 
out with some new lines and sharpen their pricing said high 
point designer randy culler 
culler who designs furniture for 10 different companies feels 
it will take good business acumen rather than exotic designs if 
manufacturers are to entice consumers to buy as they did in 1987 
ive always said 80 percent of what we do is merchandising and 
20 percent is design he said in an interview 
william dipaolo vice president of the southern furniture market 
center in high point said the business slowdown during the first 
few months of this year caused some difficulties for some factories 
their cash flow has become squeezed he said in an 
interview we might start seeing some shorter work weeks 
marty reddan an economist for the american furniture 
manufacturers association said shipments and orders from factories 
to retailers have been flat this year when compared with the 
record levels of a year ago 
first quarter shipments measured by units were up less than 1 
percent over the same period in 1987 he said 
jerry epperson a furniture industry analyst with wheat first 
securities a richmond va brokerage house said the reductions 
could lead to shorter work weeks and smaller backlogs in orders 
its not that business is not clipping along at a good rate 
he said retailers are not ordering as far in advance because the 
backlogs arent as large business in the popular price points has 
been tough most of the year but its more complicated than to just 
say consumers arent buying furniture 
epperson said many furniture retailers have been struggling to 
comply with the federal tax reforms of 1986 no longer can they pay 
their taxes on an installment basis and defer some payments he 
said 
now they have to prepay the government before taking out of 
their inventories he said they are less generous in credit 
terms and stricter in inventories 
weve seen a year of significant inventory liquidation 
epperson said 
reddan stressed that 1987 was a record year for shipments and 
orders 
you must remember that employment is at an alltime high in 
the furniture industry he said flat is very good a lot 
better than some people had feared 
until last octobers stock market crash optimism was strong in 
north carolina the nations leading producer of household goods 
in 1987 manufacturers shipped nearly 158 billion worth of 
furniture a 10 percent increase over 1986 retail sales last year 
advanced 5 percent to 272 billion 
topping those figures is difficult when the growth in the 
national economy has slowed especially when new home starts 
housing resales and interest rates also reflect a slowdown over 
1987 
it will be a flat year at retail down between 3 to 5 percent 
below last year in unit terms epperson said 
prior to last aprils southern furniture market in high point 
some analysts were predicting that manufacturers would bring out 
many new product lines to generate business 
epperson said that didnt turn out to be the case 
if anything many factories are cutting back on the number of 
items they offer he said when you produce 600 sofas at one 
time the cost is less 
many manufacturers are working to strengthen their relationship 
with a smaller number of retailers by providing better services 
such as accelerated delivery guaranteed delivery or better credit 
terms epperson said 
richard barentine executive director of the furniture 
factories marketing association of the south said prospects are 
picking up for the fall furniture market 
if interest rates remain stable as well as housing starts and 
consumer demand is strong well be ok he said 
barentine said many manufacturers have decided to stay with 
successful lines rather than try to push new ones they also follow 
consumer preference for example in case goods 
theyre willing to pay and in return they demand high 
quality barentine said 
judith cushman of furniture today a trade publication based in 
high point said she doesnt anticipate that manufacturers will 
respond to sluggish sales by introducing more new lines of 
furniture than they usually do at the twiceyearly markets in high 
point 
i dont think we can say across the board there will be a lot 
of innovation in order to boost sales she said

one controversial furniture industry 
marketing tool has become the focus of a lawsuit filed by 13 north 
carolina retailers against thomasville furniture industries which 
implemented a policy in april restricting catalog and telephone 
sales 
to continue as dealers of thomasvilles highend products 
thomasville said its 51 retailers in north carolina must install a 
gallery like other manufacturers thomasville started a gallery 
program in 1982 in which its furniture is displayed in a roomlike 
setting 
its a period of adjustment said judith cushman of 
furniture today a trade publication the gallery alignment is a 
challenge facing the industry it creates a strong relationship 
between the manufacturer and the retailer 
ms cushman said many smaller stores are reluctant to devote 
valuable floor space to one manufactures furniture the result is 
fewer dealers selling the products she said 
in thomasvilles case it was a profitable move in 1982 
thomasville reported sales of 130 million through 4000 retailers 
last year the number of dealers stood at 555 with sales at 260 
million 
however the 13 plaintiffs allege that restrictions on telephone 
and catalog sales violate antitrust laws the 13 are among 40 north 
carolina retailers that have signed up for the program

does it require a really experienced decorator to get the 
maximum decorating mileage out of a dollar 
not at all say designers mary meehan and robert metzger who 
have come up with a few topdrawer ideas that wouldnt cost all 
that much 
although both ignored budgetary constraints this spring in rooms 
they decorated at new yorks kips bay showhouse they were able to 
suggest some lowcost quickfix ideas for imparting special style 
to your home 
cost is irrelevant says miss meehan a new york designer 
whose clients usually can afford not to pay much attention to the 
expense it is the unexpected that makes for interest not the 
dollars she says 
in my house in southampton long island ny i have a lot 
of junk furniture from secondhand stores that ive painted she 
says put that junk in a room with one thing thats really good 
a rug painting chair armoire for example and it will still 
look terrific 
she says you can find the money for the splurge item by saving 
in other places i prefer to buy an old sofa and put a slipcover 
on it and then spend the difference on something with value and 
impact she says 
another factor that distinguishes rooms created by good 
designers she says is attention to detail details make the 
difference between a room that look wellplanned and one that 
doesnt people notice but they dont know that they do 
an example is to upgrade the lampshades you can turn ordinary 
lampshades into custom wonders with storebought dye and commercial 
trims applied with glue she says 
for about 35 she created a shade by dyeing a plain white 
lampshade a very pale pink and then applying a fringe trim in pink 
and green at the base and a thinner braid trim with the same colors 
at the top it took only a few minutes and less than a yard of 
trim she says to create something that would cost about 200 if 
custommade 
many people are afraid to do things that are not formula 
says miss meehan that is what decorators do until they actually 
see it in place they dont know for sure if their choices will 
work together i dont care how good you are the very best 
decorators try some things that wont work and they take them out 
designer metzger advises dealing with bad walls by slipcovering 
them in inexpensive fabric he seams fabric top and bottom and then 
installs it in readymade hardware that fastens to the ceiling or 
wall or he uses velcro fasteners on the wall and fabric or simply 
staples the fabric to the wall 
metzger says that sheeting and remnants you can buy for 99 cents 
a yard work as well as more costly fabrics and the effect can 
completely change the room 
if cost is a factor he says disguise the bad condition of wood 
and concrete floors with paint 
when carpeting a stairway paint stripes to the left and right 
of the carpeted tread to create the illusion of a costly border 
treatment 
to create height and emphasize a mood of grandeur at windows he 
suggests hanging curtains right at the ceiling line if the 
preferred treatment is a shade it too can be hung above the 
actual window 
if you need substantially more storage room dont overlook the 
possibility of converting the unused space under a staircase 
metzger says remove the sheetrock surround and install shelves 
then cover the space with a hinged door and different sheetrock or 
pullup panels he suggests painting or wallpapering it to match 
the rest of the room

nature provides the outdoor beauty of a landscape but only you 
can improve your indoor view with an eyecatching wallscape or 
tablescape 
surround that single photo on the wall or the single vase on the 
table with complementary objects such as candles flowers and 
souvenirs suggests bette rosenberg home fashions director for 
spiegel catalog marketer and merchandiser 
the most important thing to remember when designing a scape 
is to include the things you love she says 
for a wallscape she says try to gather wall pieces of 
different sizes and shapes such as paintings in round square and 
rectangular frames keep the larger and heavier items at the bottom 
of the wallscape and visualize the result by arranging them on 
the floor before hanging them on the wall 
when creating a tablescape says rosenberg gather items such as 
small photographs lace candlesticks dried flowers and silver 
trinkets and arrange them in alternating shapes and sizes drape 
lace over the table to soften the look 
tablescapes she says can change as often as a mood and the 
objects dont have to be nailed down 
wallscapes and tablescapes can be complementary if they are 
near each other rosenberg says 
if you coordinate the colors youre halfway there for a more 
complete picture try repeating an object in a painting on the 
table if theres a candle in the painting put a candle on the 
table 
make sure objects on the wall dont overwhelm objects on the 
table all of the items should be in proportion to one another

one picture may be worth a thousand words but in todays 
decorating climate the frame may be more valuable than the picture 
the professional picture frames association reports an increase 
of interest in elaborate frames as well as a trend toward framing 
everything from needlepoint and family heirlooms to mementoes and 
memorabilia 
the lazarus department store in columbus ohio recently opened 
a frame shop next to its stationery department to handle the 
increased interest in framed photographs as a decorative accessory 
a new book displaying pictures and photographs offers 
guidance on aesthetic and practical issues in framing arranging 
and lighting art works 
caroline cliftonmogg coauthor of the book with piers 
feethman says selecting the right frame is not a simple matter 
each instance is unique frames can not only show off the art work 
to best advantage but can add luster to insignificant works 
until recently it was considered most appropriate to hang 
pictures against a white wall now pictures may hang against 
patterned wallpaper or a decorated and colored wall surface 
busy backgrounds however need strong pictures and frames 
choose pictures that complement the decorative period of the room 
or introduce a color of the wallpaper in the mat or frame 
surrounding the artwork 
for the best arrangement for framed artwork says miss 
cliftonmogg consider the style and mood of the room or area in 
which the work will hang as well as the relationship of the mat 
and frame to the rest of the decor 
in a small room with low ceilings for example dont hang 
several large pictures close together dark walls are good 
backdrops for monochrome works line pen and ink drawings or 
strong linear architectural prints 
when hanging pictures over or near furniture relate the frames 
and subject matter to the furniture perhaps aligning them in a 
symmetrical arrangement by matching the two woods or by tying the 
mat to the upholstery color 
if your double bed lacks a headboard hang a large picture or 
group of pictures above the bed make sure the edges of the picture 
dont extend beyond the edges of the furniture beneath it 
when a picture is hung alone it should be at eye level when it 
is part of a group choose a darker broader or heavierlooking 
frame to give extra weight to one element 
a group of framed artworks may be improved by exploiting an 
interplay of shapes says miss cliftonmogg introduce a circle 
oval or lozenge shape among the squares and rectangles for a 
surprisingly dramatic effect 
framed family photographs often are displayed on a table or 
mantel in a mix of old and new frames and often small 
knickknacks are mixed in a style that is particularly appealing in 
countrystyle rooms 
photographs and small works also are hung in hallways and 
staircases 
the professional picture framers association offers these tips 
to protect the artwork 
use acidfree matting and adhesives to prevent deterioration 
if framing needlework have it mounted so it can be removed 
without harming the needlework lacing is one such method 
for threedimensional objects such as medals use ultraviolet 
glass to protect art from the suns rays

if youre thinking of updating your bathroom youre among an 
estimated 7 percent of american households with similar plans 
a survey in late 1987 for the trade magazine kitchen and bath 
business indicated that between 52 million and 65 million baths 
would be remodeled during 1988 the 25000 consumers surveyed 
showed the total dollar outlay for the remodeling would range from 
89 billion to 116 billion says ed pell executive editor 
last year consumers spent 83 billion on bath remodeling by 
professionals about 70 percent remodeled a master bath 41 percent 
remodeled another bath 21 percent remodeled a halfbath and 7 
percent added a master bedroom bath thirteen percent added a full 
bath and 8 percent added a powder room nine percent enlarged an 
existing bath 
for many years almost no one paid any attention to the 
bath says pell it was strictly a utility area and the focus 
was to get all the equipment into the smallest possible space 
now he says the bath has become a kind of focus of the 
twoperson household 
typically he says between 3000 and 6000 is spent to redo a 
bath although many jobs are on a much smaller scale for 300 he 
says consumers may put in a new sink or new faucets a new vanity 
or mirrored medicine cabinet in general people want heaters 
ventilation equipment skylights especially in windowless baths 
and in baths with small windows and cabinetry for more storage 
the more expensive remodelings may substitute a whirlpool for a 
standard bath or add exercise equipment even a small 
refrigerator cooktop and bar sink 
new york interior designer nina hughes says some clients want a 
luxurious bath with a whirlpool or steam shower and amenities 
ranging from heated towel racks and extra heaters to bidets 
pipedin music and lighting on dimmers 
the transformation of the bath into a luxury room is partly a 
result of interest in fitness partly a response to stressful 
times she says some people have the disposable income to 
create a spa environment at home its less expensive than actually 
going to a spa and home hydrotherapy can be justified as a luxury 
because it has a health component 
her biggest problem as a designer she says is space what 
people want in a bathroom today takes more than 5by7 feet she 
says she advises increasing space by invading another room or 
taking a closet 
among the more popular new bath additions she says is a steam 
shower with a folding seat she may hide the steam generator and 
controls in a vanity so the unit looks like an ordinary stall 
shower 
one company makes a prefabricated sauna that fits into a space 
just less than 4 feet square according to finnleo which imports 
the dryheat units from scandinavia no plumbing and little 
carpentry is required if the space is available cost is about 
2000 
if the addition of all this equipment leads to a closedin 
feeling mirrors can expand visual space and recessing storage 
units can help alleviate the problem

redecorating with wallcoverings has become a popular 
doityourself project and manufacturers are encouraging the trend 
by offering more coordinated patterns and borders in wallpaper 
books 
at the retail level many shops offer guidance on how to hang 
the covering and what types of adhesives to use 
retailers suggest you order all the wallcoverings you need at 
the same time so they are all from the same color run 
before starting the job check the lot numbers before unwrapping 
the rolls and inspect the full length of each roll before you cut 
it if there are damaged rolls return them 
consider what is on the walls in adjacent rooms before deciding 
on color and pattern you can choose a covering in a similar color 
with the same pattern scale or with the same feeling in mind 
such as a small floral pattern that coordinates with a larger 
bolder floral in the same colors 
in general light colors textures and small overall prints are 
unobtrusive while large splashy prints shiny and metallic papers 
dramatize space to minimize bad walls choose a lowgloss 
textured covering or a large overall print as long as it isnt 
shiny 
small and dark rooms will seem more spacious if you choose pale 
colors and small patterns 
lower a ceiling by covering it in a bright color or strong 
pattern limit the use of a bold print by papering a foyer or hall 
or small bath since large busy expanses of any pattern can become 
tiresome 
when its time to apply the wallcovering cover the pasting 
table with plain brown wrapping paper or inexpensive tablecloths or 
dropcloths dont use newspapers because the ink may come through 
to the new covering 
if youre working on top of old wallpaper its best to strip it 
from the wall strippable or vinyl wallpaper peel off easily when 
you grasp a corner and pull wash the walls with warm water and 
scrape off the remaining glue with a putty knife after youve done 
the stripping if the wallpaper to be covered is in good tight 
condition you can paper over it 
at worst rent a wallpaper steamer or apply wallpaper remover 
they soften the paper so you can scrape it off with a wide putty 
knife after scraping wash the walls and allow them to dry before 
hanging the new wallcovering 
for a betterlooking job work slowly and dont try to finish 
the projct in one day wallcovering paste dries slowly enough so 
that you can adjust a strip and eliminate seam mismatches and 
bubbles if necessary 
save extra wallpaper which can be used to fix small tears and 
loose edges without repapering for loose seams apply the paste to 
both the wall and the wallpaper press the paper in place smooth 
it with a seam roller and then wipe away the extra paste 
to patch a small damaged area paste a new piece of wallcovering 
larger than the tear over the damaged areas matching the patterns 
exactly allow the patch to set but not to dry entirely then cut 
through both areas clean the empty area and repaste the top piece 
wait 15 minutes and roll the edges smooth 
other ways to use wallpaper 
if there is a pattern cut out some of the motifs and apply 
them to lampshades and accessories 
wallpaper a closet 
create custom waste receptacles perhaps from large round ice 
cream cartons or plastic or metal wastepaper cans 
use wallpaper inserts on kitchen cabinets bathroom counter 
tops 
use for picture frames 
wallpaper borders can update and enliven old furniture just 
glue them on

the difference between a room that looks right and one that 
looks all wrong may be a matter of scale 
when marilyn glass decorating editor of ladies home journal 
surveyed eight common decorating mistakes she found seven involved 
errors of scale mainly combining furnishings in mismatched sizes 
scale according to glass refers to the size of objects and 
their relationship to each other and the space around them 
a room works better she says if the objects are on the same 
general level for examples of good scale check out model rooms in 
stores and in decorating magazines and books noting the relative 
sizes of major pieces of furniture and accessories 
some typical errors of judgment include selecting armchairs that 
are too shallow and too highbacked for the sofa in the room 
choosing end tables that are too narrow and too high for the 
seating placing a coffee table that is too small in front of a 
sofa using lamps that tower over the furniture and accessories 
by keeping a set of general decorating guidelines on hand when 
you go shopping you may be able to eliminate all or most of these 
errors 
a sofa should measure a little less than half the length of the 
wall it is placed against if the room is large enough try 
placing a love seat on one side of the sofa and an upholstered 
chair on the other 
for toss cushions to go with the upholstery choose a 20 or 
24inch square for a standarddepth upholstered piece 
tables next to the sofa should be about a quarter to onethird 
the length of the sofa and their height no more than 4 inches 
taller than the top of the arms of the sofa 
instead of choosing two matched end tables select different 
styles for example an antique chest or a skirted table for one 
and a standard rectangular table for the other 
a coffee table should be about half the length of the sofa and 
at a comfortable height in relation to the sofa seat an 
alternative to the single large coffee table is two matching 
smaller ones with a little space between them 
an area rug should be large enough to generously border the 
coffee table 
a painting above the sofa should be about the size of the coffee 
table top 
to camouflage empty corners in a room use an interesting 
panelled folding screen one or more large plants or a large piece 
of furniture

a growing interest in traditional interiors has helped pave the 
way for the return of the grandfather clock to a place of honor in 
many american homes 
originally known as a tall or a long case clock it is still so 
called in the antique circuit it became a grandfather clock 
because of the popularity of the song my grandfathers clock 
around 1875 
according to john snellenburg a vice president at christies 
and a specialist in clocks and watches interest in buying 
grandfather clocks is high though the clocks dont get much 
publicity sales figures indicate such clocks are highly desirable 
home accessories he says 
those seeking a grandfather clock for the home have to compete 
with serious collectors of fine american furniture as well as clock 
fanciers who are interested in the development of horology 
snellenburg says there are plenty of grandfather clocks to go 
around however 
the most important consideration in selecting an antique clock 
is the condition of both the case and the works clocks are usually 
survivors he says and unless one has been especially abused it 
probably can be put in good working order 
a good quality english long case clock dating from the 18th 
century or early 19th century costs from 1000 to 3500 at an 
auction the clock is likely to feature a painted white dial often 
with an arch and a case of mahogany or oak the same clock might 
cost 3000 to 5000 in an antiques store says snellenburg 
american clocks from the same era tend to be more expensive 
especially if signed by a famous maker it would not be uncommon to 
find prices of 40000 to 100000 for a signed willard family 
clock he says american country clocks might range from 4000 to 
10000 
snellenburg recommends considering grandfather clocks that are 
neither antique nor new 
some of the 80yearold clocks are a very good buy now he 
says they have good movements and are usually copies of the 
traditional english style 
when buying an old clock choose a reputable dealer if buying 
from a dealer who doesnt normally deal in clocks ask a specialist 
to look at it before you buy 
old clocks most likely have appreciated in value as they age and 
are likely to continue to appreciate if they are in good condition 
but there are advantages to buying a new grandfather clock 
todays clocks offer more features as well as sizes appropriate 
for todays interiors they are dependable as timekeepers and offer 
such features as triple chimes ornate pendulums and a beveled 
glass section to reveal the interior workings 
prices for new grandfather clocks range from 600 to 7000 
depending on complexity of design size and expense of materials 
rare burls carvings beveled glass goldplated dials bigger 
movements cost more 
most contemporary grandfather clocks play as many as three 
different melodies or chimes says philip miller executive vice 
president of howard miller clock co few of the old clocks are 
truly musical they tell the time and strike the hour 
contemporary clocks chime the whole tune on the hour and partial 
tune on the quarter half and threequarter hour the melodies are 
based on church chimes for example the westminster chimes are 
taken from a portion of the messiah by handel as rendered at 
londons big ben the whittinton chimes are from londons st mary 
le bow 
in clocks that play three melodies the chimes are like a music 
box with a selection lever you can set the tune you want to hear

there are almost as many prescriptions for choosing attractive 
color combinations as there are colors 
some suggest selecting color schemes by looking in your clothes 
closet and picking colors you enjoy wearing one advises a trip to 
the supermarket to buy fruits and vegetables and taking them home 
to play with until you decide on a combination you like 
another idea is to use a favorite painting to identify colors you 
enjoy living with 
whatever method you choose finding the colors you like is only 
the first hurdle there are problems that come up no matter what 
colors you decide on says john pile author of interior design 
pile says many people select too many colors for one room their 
rainbow coalition becomes too chaotic and random or they 
choose an intense color like fire engine red for large areas 
others he says eschew bright colors altogether and choose safe 
neutrals resulting in dull uninviting rooms 
the answer says pile is to learn which color schemes work and 
then adapt them to your own environment and color preferences 
color harmony is a key to color schemes the easiest color 
schemes to duplicate are harmonious schemes that includes 
monochromatic and analogous combinations 
monochromatic schemes use a single color in a variety of hues 
neutrals like white beige and gray predominate an example would 
be a room in which various shades of blue or red were combined any 
possible monotony could be relieved by colorful artwork 
accessories or even the costumes of the occupants pile says 
analogous color schemes use hues closer together on the color 
wheel examples are blue with bluegreen or blueviolet or green 
with bluegreen and yellowgreen 
complementary schemes use hues from opposite ends of the color 
wheel red with green orange with blue yellow with violet but 
safeguard against overbrightness by choosing a quiet hue for one 
of the color and covering large areas with it 
texture pattern and shine affect the appearance of colors as 
does the placement of one color in relation to the others light 
colors appear lighter when seen against a darker background dark 
colors become darker against a light background a medium tone can 
be made to seem either light or dark by its contrast with its 
surroundings 
warm colors advance and appear closer cool colors appear to 
recede placing sharply contrasting colors together can cause a 
sense of vibration these optical illusions can be used to make 
small spaces seem larger and to render oddly shaped rooms less 
noticeable 
a long narrow room for example will seem shaped more normally 
if end walls are painted a strong warm color while side walls are 
painted a light cool color 
a dark ceiling will seem lower than the same ceiling in a light 
tone 
painting a door and wall the same color will cause it to blend 
into the room painting them different colors will make them stand 
out 
knowing how colors appear and react with other colors can help 
you choose a color scheme that not only appeals to your senses but 
also minimizes flaws and creates an atmosphere that can be calm 
restful stimulating exciting or dignified 
in general it is suggested you select the dominant colors 
first these are the hues that will occupy the largest spaces 
whether floors walls or ceilings then consider the secondary 
areas such as furniture window treatments and accessories add 
small streams of color in strong values as accents in the form of 
throw cushions and artwork

theres an unusually wide choice these days with upholstered 
furniture as the fashionable style variations range from the 
formality of 19thcentury parlors through the simplicity of country 
kitchen or porch to the ageless look of fine leather 
a fashionable interest in novelty conjures an image of an 
adventurous hostess entertaining in a room made to look like the 
inside of an indian wigwam a parisian sewer or a 1950s american 
diner 
the 19thcentury style appears to be the way to go ellen 
frankel editor of 1001 home ideas magazine says that at the 
recent furniture market in north carolina there was a return to 
dressmaker details reminiscent of the victorian era with contrast 
welting bows beautifully detailed skirts a slipcover look on 
furniture that is actually upholstered and pleats and double 
ruffles 
robert herring vice president of schumacher a fabric supplier 
to high end furniture companies also endorsed the 19th century as 
a treasure trove of ideas for today his company is preparing a 
natchez collection dominated by highstyle victorian 
watermark silks damasks brocades moires and velvets with 
embossed effects 
according to sterling collett vice president at drexel 
furniture co more formality in fabrics is the watchword besides 
the damasks and brocades of traditional luxury needlepoint and 
tapestry fabrics are growing popular at the expense of casual 
stripes plaids and textured fabrics that have been a mainstay over 
the past several years 
among the most popular fabrications in the drexel showroom this 
spring were upholstered pieces covered in medium green moire velvet 
and ruby red figured damask extensive multicolored fringe and 
braid trim were applied to the pieces 
for the future schumacher is betting on the ethnic look by 
and large said herring american consumers have become more 
sophisticated and are often influenced by museum exhibitions such 
as the gauguin exhibition at the smithsonian institution 
schumachers ethnic collection will be based on peruvian and 
inca documents in the american museum of natural history its 
introduction this fall will coincide with the opening of a new 
museum wing devoted to those cultures 
according to frankel leather remains very popular she advises 
care however in choosing leather furniture try to make sure the 
leather will keep its good looks over the year and not crack she 
says 
whats out mauve apparently is being recolored to look like 
rose in many fabric lines and there is an increase in green at the 
expense of blue 
should you care whats in and whats not not necessarily but 
if you are redecorating over several years it will be easier to 
find coordinating accessories if you choose something that is 
beginning its time rather than at its end

furniture bargains are out there somewhere says a prominent 
furniture restorer theyre just hiding where youd least expect 
to find them 
one way to find them says homer formby is to run an ad in the 
local newspaper announcing i buy used furniture its better 
to say used furniture rather than antique he says to keep 
prices reasonable then make appointments with callers and go out 
on weekend treasure hunts 
youd be surprised at the number of people who have 20000 
worth of old furniture stuck in a dusty attic or musty basement 
says formby 
other places to look flea markets junk shops and auctions 
real estate sales and garage sales often people have lived 
with this furniture all their lives and theyre eager to get rid 
of it 
take your time looking and be thorough look in all the nooks 
and crannies even behind doors 
formby says furniture doesnt have to be 100 years old to be 
worth restoring 
ive come across a lot of 50 and 60yearold reproductions 
worth as much or more than some 100yearold antiques he says 
so think twice before passing over any piece thats made of solid 
wood

you can save money and still have custom touches when remodeling 
your kitchen says jim krengel a kitchen designer 
some tips from krengel who is design director of the maytag 
kitchen ideas center 
instead of buying a readymade floortoceiling pantry 
combine two readymade base cabinets by stacking one on top of the 
other use the base cabinet with drawers right side up on the 
bottom then top it with a twodoor base cabinet turned upside down 
with its toe kick space removed 
base cabinets are deeped than top cabinets so you can get more 
canned goods and staples into the door cabinet than you could with 
an abovecounter cabinet 
if theres still room use the cabinet top to hold an 
attractive but seldom used serving dish or salad bowl if the 
cabinet top is close to the ceiling install molding to hide the 
edges and give a builtin look 
attach wall cabinets to the sides or back of a work island or 
dining island in the kitchen the cabinets can provide footdeep 
storage and if you use 42inch high units behind a 35inch high 
island the work area is hidden from view 
for a decorative way of storing staples buy a 15by30inch 
or 18by30inch glass door cabinet and turn it on its side the 
glass door will then open out and down and can be fitted with 
tiltout bins for staples such as beans peas rice macaroni 
snacks even dog biscuits 
for more storage space for narrow items recover the wasted 
space between the wall studs the space about 3 inches deep is 
behind the sheetrock walls it can be exposed and then painted or 
lined with patterned adhesivebacked plastic to house spices 
canned goods glasses and other skinny items 
if you dont want to eliminate a window but it is keeping you 
from installing a needed storage cabinet consider installing a 
cabinet with glass sides in front of the window then place items 
like glasses in the cabinet so that the light and view are diffused 
but not altogether removed 
if a window is too low and you want to put a counter in front 
of it cut out the counter in front of the window so that a narrow 
well is created you can use the well to hold plants or herbs and 
spices

before selecting your tableware you should decide on the point 
of view you want to take and choose a pattern that reflects your 
individual style 
dinnerware will be the foundation of your welldressed 
table says alice kolator director of public relations for lenox 
china and crystal keep a close eye on pattern and color when 
mixing and matching patterns follow the basic rule that background 
colors should always match 
flatware she says can repeat and enhance a motif 
established by a dinnerware pattern or it can make a statement all 
its own it offers great flexibility when mixing and matching 
patterns 
as for crystal the crowning jewel of your table ms 
kolator advises a more heavily cut crystal is best when joined 
with simple dinnerware delicately cut crystal is more versatile 
and can be used with a wide variety of dinnerware patterns 
the younger generation is fascinated with food and its 
spreading to their dinnerware says peter jungkunst executive 
vice president of jungkunst china people are investigating the 
consumer benefits as well as the aesthetics of china 
jungkunst says eating from china encourages food variety in a 
meal people are more likely to include all four of the food 
groups when serving a meal on china he says while eating on

toothpaste and credit cards are among the tools a furniture 
restorer says can use to clean up water spots cigarette burns or 
gashes on wood finishes 
toothpaste says homer formby is a gentle abrasive and can be 
used to remove water spots and rings on wood furniture just 
squeeze toothpaste on to a wet cotton rag and buff the spotted 
area he says for stubborn rings combine the toothpaste with 
equal parts of baking soda 
for cigarette burns dip a cotton swab into nail polish remover 
and rub it lightly across the burned area if any discoloration 
remains scrape it gently with a pen knife if a slight hollow is 
left mix equal parts nail polish remover with clear nail polish 
and apply the mixture with the nail polish brush allow each coat 
to dry for several minutes until the hollow is filled it may take 
seven or eight coats 
for scratches melt a crayon the color of your wood finish and 
let the colored wax drip into the gash until it overflows says 
formby let the melted crayon dry 30 minutes and use a credit card 
to gently shave off the residue

more than 11 million women are currently working from home 
either full time or part time according to a 1987 survey by link 
resources a new yorkbased consulting firm 
as a result finding room for a workathome office has become a 
common remodeling goal 
to ensure that work at home is satisfying rather than 
frustrating it is important to set up a special place dedicated to 
the work says kathleen christensen author of women and 
homebased work the unspoken contract 
if theres no space for a separate office use part of another 
room but redo the space so it functions as a real work space 
interior designer elaine ryan suggests using a corner of a room 
that is large enough for a small desk and two chairs 
create visual separation by removing personal items such as 
knickknacks and family photographs instead hang your diplomas 
certificates and other documents on the wall near the desk 
paint or wallpaper the office area in a slightly different shade 
from the rest of the room for example if your walls are white 
cover the office wall with a striped wallpaper with an offwhite 
background 
conceal the space for privacy or when not in use by enclosing 
it with one or two threepaneled screens in a neutral color 
if your work does not require client visits consider converting 
a closet into an office work space remove the door and use the 
closet space for shelving file cabinets and other supplies 
few closets are roomy enough to accommodate a desk as well but 
you can place a desk next to the closet at right angles to it 
cabinets or shelving used to create an lshape or small separate 
work area can also serve the same purpose while adding work 
storage space at the same time 
home office designers say that storage and other needs vary 
depending on the tools you will use in general plan for a 
telephone and a typewriter or personal computer and printer all 
need electrical outlets 
the most comfortable height for typing at a typewriter or 
computer keyboard is 3 to 4 inches lower than standard desk height 
if it is impossible to provide a surface for that use a desk chair 
with an adjustable height 
if youre working with computers youre likely to find that 
computer desks and storage components either custommade or 
readymade work best if you plan to place computer equipment on a 
desk be sure to measure first and take into account the depth 
needed for installation dont forget to allow for the bulky wires 
and plugs at the back of the components 
when planning the location of the printer allow space for 
continuous feed paper 
good lighting is essential for any task including desk work 
choices of light sources vary from floor and table lamps to 
adjustable desk lamps with goosenecks and spotlights but most 
important is to have the light fall on the work not on the worker 
avoid glare by proper placement of the light 
for a desk chair choose seating that is adjustable in several 
ways especially if more than one person will be using the desk 
look for a chair that has an adjustable seat and back height a 
tilting back and a contoured seat and casters for added mobility

the condom market is leveling off 
after heavy growth spurred by fear of aids and the nations two 
biggest manufacturers hope to maintain consumer interest by 
targeting female buyers according to industry officials 
carterwallace inc of new york and schmid laboratories of 
little falls plan soon to release products in femininestyle 
packaging that they hope will encourage more women to buy the 
prophylactics 
women account for an estimated 40 percent of condom purchases 
industry experts say schmid laboratories the nations 
secondbiggest condom seller with 35 percent of the market wants 
to shore up declining sales by appealing to them 
last month the company laid off 150 temporary workers at its 
anderson sc manufacturing plant because of a drop in demand 
one reason for the slower sales was the higher prices condom 
manufacturers recently began paying for malaysian latex used to 
make most of the products officials also say new regulations by 
the us food and drug administration have trimmed profit margins 
by mandating a tenfold increase in condom testing 
schmid president don falk said sales remain strong but are not 
near the lofty numbers that followed surgeon general c everett 
koops advice last year to use condoms to avoid transmitting 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
people realized the initial impact was not going to continue 
forever falk said of the sales surge but we are at a higher 
production level now than preaids 
diana temple a salomon brothers inc analyst who follows 
carterwallace says women can be important to the market if more

the dollar regained lost ground against the 
japanese yen today in tokyo while stock prices accumulated further 
losses 
the dollar closed the day at 13397 yen up a strong 085 yen 
from its close friday at 13312 yen it traded briefly today at a 
high of 13405 yen 
the dollar moved up mainly because of the activity around the 
west german mark said a dealer at a major japanese securities 
firm speaking on condition of anonymity 
the dollar rose to a 19month high against the deutsche mark in 
new york on friday propped up in part by strong earnings and 
payroll figures in the july us employment report released last 
week 
according to the us labor department the nations jobless 
rate rose to 54 percent in july from a 14year low of 53 percent 
in june 
in a separate report the department said the number of nonfarm 
payrolls in june was revised upward showing much stronger job 
creation than preliminary figures indicated 
on the tokyo stock exchange meanwhile the nikkei average of 
225 selected issues a 6020point loser during saturdays halfday 
session slid a further 10960 points or 038 percent to close 
the day at 2825312 points 
dealers said the market was plagued by interest rate concerns 
continuing from the us employment report 
volume on the first section of the exchange was estimated at 600 
million shares down from 800 million shares friday the most 
recent full day of trade

us farm sales to east asia are expected to 
rise by 2 billion this fiscal year according to the latest 
forecast from the department of agriculture 
the increase which should bring agricultural sales to east asia 
to 10 billion or 11 billion a year will come during an overall 
expansion of farm exports to the pacific rim usda says 
it says farm exports to canada also are likely to increase and 
cites the lower dollar as one major reason 
pacific rim sales probably will account for nearly onethird of 
total us agricultural exports this fiscal year according to a 
department report 
farm production declined in most of the pacific rim last year 
the report said 
in east asia it said rice consumption is down in part because 
of urban growth and a stronger economy but at the same time wheat 
consumption is on the upswing both because of changed eating 
habits and increased use of wheat as feed for livestock 
similarly east asias coarse grain consumption is expected to 
increase 6 percent because of large livestock inventories strong 
industrial use and eased south korean quotas 
drought plaguing the farm belt remains an uncertainty the 
report said it said the heat and lack of grain should reduce 
soybean production but it also said longterm prospects for 
soybean exports to east asia appear promising 
fastfood restaurants and higher incomes are expected to 
increase east asian consumption of meat over the long term but 
higher livestock feed costs and lower meat product prices mean 
growth of production should be slow this year the report said 
it said the key to us access to the market depends on east 
asian access to the american textile and clothing markets 
easing of japanese restrictions on beef imports also is expected 
to spur consumer demand according to the analysis

the agriculture department is continuing to 
open emergency programs to additional farmers as drought spreads 
maryland and west virginia are the latest states declared 
eligible for farmers home administration emergency loans because of 
droughtrelated crop losses 
the order from agriculture secretary richard e lyng applied to 
all 23 counties in maryland and all 55 counties in west virginia 
to be eligible farmers must have crop insurance if available to 
offset crop losses usda said 
they also must be able to repay the loan and any other loans 
they have outstanding and be unable to obtain credit elsewhere the 
statement said it said adequate security would be required 
designation of maryland and west virginia brought the number of 
entire states eligible to eight the others are alabama indiana 
missouri ohio wisconsin and delaware 
this disaster designation only makes fmha emergency loans 
available in the affected counties and does not ensure family 
farmers eligibility for such loans lyng said in letters to 
governors of the states 
thus far usda has approved hay cutting and grazing on acreage 
conservation reserve and conservation use acreage as well as hay 
cutting on soundalike but separate conservation reserve program 
land in 2184 counties in 42 states the department said friday

have been approved for 1600 counties in 37 states the department 
said 
it said a program under which farmers get 92 percent of their 
payments while producing no crop have been authorized for 107 
counties in 21 states

rock n rollers have mtv sports fans have 
espn and investors have the financial news network now theres 
rfdtv for farmers an idea its developers hope will reap a 
bountiful harvest of profits 
were a whole new concept and were delivering stories that no 
one else is delivering said patrick gottsch chairman and chief 
executive officer of the satellite network scheduled to go on the 
air aug 15 
it seems like theres always something going on with 
agriculture he said but one problem is farmers are not 
getting accurate or timely information on a daily basis or even an 
hourly basis 
rfdtv hopes to change that with 24hour sevenday a week 
programming available to households with a satellite dish gottsch 
said in a recent interview as workers scrambled to build sets and 
uncrate equipment in time for the network premiere 
he said plans call for rfdtv named after the us postal 
services old acronym for rural free delivery to grow like the 
crops that will be its subject matter expanding to cable and 
lowpower television systems 
gottsch who was raised on a farm near elkhorn and later worked 
as a commodity broker and satellite dish dealer said he came up 
with the idea for rfdtv about three years ago 
there are 28 million home satellite dishes in the united states 
and 250000 in canada about 60 percent are in rural areas gottsch 
said 
its just a common sense project he said if you take a 
drive in the country you see a lot of dishes and theyre going to 
be watching us 
the programming wont be reruns of heehaw the real 
mccoys or mayberry rfd gottsch said 
he described the network as a cross between the financial news 
network espn and the cable news network but geared toward rural 
america 
universities in all 50 states will produce shows for rfdtv and 
a live primetime interview show in which viewers may phone in 
questions is planned 
rfdtv also will have its own barnyard takeoff on home shopping 
video livestock auctions to give farmers a chance to expand their 
herds without leaving their living rooms gottsch said 
were very confident people are going to like what they see on 
our air were not doing things halfcocked gottsch said 
theyre going to see a very shiny farm network that theyre going 
to want to watch 
the fledgling omahabased network has a 21member news staff 
with bureaus in chicago washington kansas city mo and fresno 
calif gottsch said 
the staff will produce seven hours of live news weather and 
markets coverage every week day and several halfhour summaries 
daily 
currently agricultural programming is scattered throughout 
the television system gottsch said there is hitandmiss 
coverage on local stations and some largely irrelevant feature 
material on the major networks 
advertisers and home satellite dish dealers are excited about 
the network 
there is a definite what do we have to lose attitude among 
major advertisers gottsch said because of satellite 
communications our ad rates are lower than a local tv station 
agricultural advertisers also have been supportive because 
theres a need for a rifle shot approach to the farmer instead of 
the shotgun approach he said 
because rfdtv is a free unscrambled service the network could 
spur lagging satellite dish sales gottsch said 
were the first free and clear channel on satellite in the 
last two years were good news for the home satellite dealer we 
are definitely a reason for someone to buy home dish he said 
despite high startup costs of more than 3 million gottsch 
predicted the channel will turn a profit in its first year 
we have builtin shows with builtin audiences with builtin 
advertisers said gottsch who is among the networks investors 
we only have to sell 13 percent of our available ad time to 
turn a profit

it may be junk mail to some people but 
more than one american in four would like to receive more 
advertising mail according to a survey done by the postal service 
thirtyone percent of the people surveyed said they found the 
information in mailed advertising useful and 27 percent said they 
would like to receive more reports john r wargo assistant 
postmaster general for marketing 
in contrast 15 percent said they wish they received less 
advertising in the mail 
thirdclass has been the fastestgrowing category of mail in 
recent years raising the us postal service to the status of the 
nations third largest advertising medium trailing only newspapers 
and television said wargo 
the reason that were in business is because of the receivers 
and we need to find out what they want and we need to tell the 
senders wargo said of the survey covering 5300 homes across the 
nation 
the study done last year was disclosed to business mailers at 
a meeting in los angeles and later discussed by wargo in an 
interview 
he said the study found that the postal service handles 17 
percent of advertising compared to 27 percent for newspapers and 
22 percent for television 
we believe that weve got a better opportunity to grow if our 
receivers are satisfied they react favorably and they read it 
what were trying to do is help the sender improve their ability to 
get a favorable reaction and more business and thats going to 
keep us in business its a straight business proposition 
thirdclass advertising mail increased 173 percent between 1972 
and 1987 while other categories increased by only 44 percent 
for the average household third class mail went from three 
items a week in 1972 to 87 last year over the same period the 
volume of firstclass mail per household went up from 74 to 86 
items a week while newspapers and magazines dropped from 23 to 
16 according to wargos study 
but while americans are getting more advertising mail do they 
read it 
as volume increased readership has declined wargo found 
last year 51 percent of thirdclass mail was read according to 
the study down from 83 percent in 1972 
the higher the household income the more advertising mail 
received but the less that was read the study found and yet the 
higher income households were more likely to order something and 
ordered more often via mail 
the most important factor in getting someone to open the ad 
read it and perhaps buy something wargo found was familiarity 
with the advertiser 
the highest openandread rate is a result of the person 
knowing who the company is and having done business with them 
said wargo 
the increase in mail advertising places conflicting demands on 
the postal service he said including a need to see that those 
receiving the mail are not offended or bothered by it 
i think there are going to be some senders who say your job 
is only to take what we give you i dont think were going to 
accept that on the other hand the receivers are going to say you 
should screen everything and i dont think were going to do 
that wargo said 
were very very concerned that if this audience does not 
continue to have a high level of satisfaction we wont have 
anything to sell to other advertisers he said

a lawyer seeking legislation to promote 
safety on movie sets says filmmaking is more dangerous now than 
when three people were killed on the set of twilight zone the 
movie 
with pressure for bigger and more spectacular special effects in 
movies attorney jerry kroll says stuntmen and women are risking 
injury and death daily 
first they were jumping out of cars then it was jumping off 
buildings then out of airplanes next it will be the concorde 
said kroll 
i think hollywood is more dangerous today than ever 
kroll who is handling six lawsuits resulting from movie and tv 
set accidents says the situation is unlikely to change without 
legislation 
the twilight zone focused public attention on safety 
kroll said of the 1987 trial that ended with the acquittal of 
director john landis and four codefendants on involuntary 
manslaughter charges 
but the public got to watch john landis being acquitted and 
the question is was that an acquittal of the industry i say he was 
on trial and not the industry 
if we learned anything from twilight zone its that the 
criminal justice system isnt going to make the industry safer 
said kroll we have to do it some other way 
he is pushing for passage of a bill that would require licensing 
of stunt coordinators and special effects coordinators and would 
forbid moviemakers to use film footage of any stunt that resulted 
in injury or death 
one of krolls clients stuntman max maxwell was injured in a 
special effects explosion during filming of a 1985 action movie 
the film contains footage of my client getting blown up 
said kroll its just not right 
if filmmakers know they cant use that kind of footage said 
kroll they will have a financial motivation to make sure the 
scene is safe when they shoot it

six years after hollywoods deadliest movie 
accident and a year after a celebrated trial the twilight zone 
remains a nagging dilemma for the movie industry 
scrutiny of the helicopter crash that killed veteran actor vic 
morrow and two child actors has resumed with the publication of a 
book about the trial of the director john landis and four 
codefendants another book on the subject is due next month 
participants still debate details of the crash that occurred 
july 23 1982 during filming of a vietnam war scene for twilight 
zone the movie the helicopter crashed during special effects 
explosions also killing 6yearold renee chen and myca dinh le 7 
attorney james neal who successfully defended landis against 
manslaughter charges in los angeles county superior court says the 
case should be over and done with 
the reason it wont go away says attorney harland braun 
is because the system never assessed moral responsibility and no 
one accepted moral responsibility 
landis has never said i did the wrong thing said braun 
who represented associate producer george folsey jr at the trial 
despite a jurys acquittal of landis folsey and the 
codefendants of involuntary manslaughter braun and two other 
defense attorneys arnold klein representing special effects 
coordinator paul stewart and eugene trope representing pilot 
dorcey wingo believe an acknowledgment of responsibility was 
called for 
i dont think much of landis said klein he had a 
cowardly defense where he blamed everyone else he never came out 
and said he was deeply sorry for that which he was responsible 
for 
author ronald labrecque whose book special effects is due 
next month said landis fuels controversy with his own actions for 
example 
in early summer landis gave a dinner party at a trendy beverly 
hills restaurant on the first anniversary of his acquittal 
attorney leonard levine a guest said it was a nice gesture by 
landis to thank those who stood by him 
in june landis invited the trial jurors to a private screening 
of coming to america the eddie murphy film he directed the 
jurors accepted and landis action drew more criticism 
in their newly published book outrageous conduct art ego 
and the twilight zone case authors stephen farber and marc green 
sharply criticize landis the prosecutor who lost the case and the 
movie industry that failed to penalize landis for the deaths 
there are elements of hollywood that are morally bankrupt 
said green they believe only in the bottom line and as long as 
john landis name is above the title of a movie that is the highest 
grossing nonsequel in history coming to america john landis 
will be welcome in those quarters 
no one asks questions said farber 
landis refused to be comment on the matter his los angeles 
lawyer joel behr said the director was in europe and would not 
comment even if he were here 
neal said landis acknowledged his role in the accident when he 
testified at the trial and should be allowed to get on with his 
life 
they did wrong and certainly it can be argued they were 
guilty of violating child labor laws but it should be over and it 
should be done with he said 
neal his associate james sanders and levine who represented 
production manager dan allingham in the manslaughter trial have 
cameo roles in coming to america 
another key player in the twilight zone drama continues to 
make news 
lea purwin dagostino the deputy district attorney who spent 10 
months prosecuting the case ran for district attorney against her 
boss ira reiner in june she lost and has been transferred to a 
lesser job she calls the reassignment retaliation 
no one is letting me forget it she said probably 
because its hollywood but theres also the enormity of the 
horror the absolutely needless loss of life for a lousy movie 
but chief deputy district attorney gilbert garcetti denied the 
reassigment was vindictive he said plans to move mrs dagostino 
to the other job were made several months ago and were not related 
to the twilight zone verdict

from his farm in the berkshire hills 
frank patterson wages war on smalltown autocrats wresting from 
them the minutes of meetings that even he admits can make pretty 
boring reading in his bulletin 
so boring in fact that patterson recently cut back publication 
of his newsletter from twice monthly to once a month i got an 
inkling that too much was too much he said 
but the tree farmer has vowed to keep publishing the recorded 
gatherings of selectmen assessors school and health boards for 
his 250 readers as long as the money holds out 
weve been operating in the red and i guess we will always 
be he said 
the notforprofit newsletter celebrates its first anniversary 
next month it has grown to six editions one for each of the six 
towns that hand over their minutes and contains as many minutes as 
patterson can get they include such mundane revelations as this 
from the may 5 meeting of the hancock board of selectmen 
mr bowman appeared before the board with 104 lbs of rocks 
stating that they had been picked up on 1000 ft of road frontage 
on his property 
and this from the may 8 meeting of the hancock health board 
ruth bush came to request rent for the landfill she says she 
was not paid for 1987 we will check 
about 100 copies are sent free to libraries post offices and 
other town offices but patterson has managed to talk the rest of 
the subscribers into donations ranging from 5 to 100 without 
such gifts he said the paper would not survive 
he applies the same persuasive logic to advertisers recalling a 
restaurant that recently pulled a 50 ad the size of a business 
card patterson said i couldnt convince them that this is a 
civic thing no one is going to come to their restaurant to eat 
because of that ad it costs 100 to eat there anyway 
patterson said he founded the newsletter to keep busy in his 
retirement he is a former purchasing agent for an electric company 
who now runs a christmas tree farm with his wife eleanor 72 who 
heads the board of selectmen in their town 
im 71 and at my age if you dont take up something new your 
mind begins to fall into pieces he said 
the newsletter proudly lists among its supporters two 
newspapers a retired publisher and pulitzer prizewinning 
historian james macgregor burns who called patterson a local 
friend doing what i think are good things 
but some apparently disagree 
patterson said officials in a few towns balked at releasing 
their minutes and complied only after the state attorney generals 
office told them they were obligated to make the minutes public 
in at least one case patterson said his request prompted town 
officials to take minutes of their meetings for the first time 
he said he is still trying to get minutes from new ashford and 
richmond but is loathe to ask the state for help again 
im afraid to stir them up he said of the town officials 
then theyll never give them to me 
the head of the board of selectmen in new ashford one of the 
states smallest towns with a population of 150 people said he 
has refused to mail the minutes to pattersons home because of the 
expense 
the records are there all hes got to do is come and get 
them said head selectman john h haig 
marguerite rawson head of the richmond board said she hasnt 
sent minutes to patterson because she has no time to edit them for 
publication by the time they are typed up usually several weeks 
after the meeting 
if he wants he can sit down at our meetings and take notes 
she said but i dont have time to play around with his 
newsletter its a sticky situation im not trying to keep 
anything from him but im a busy woman i work days and do this 
board business at night 
patterson said hes lost 2500 so far on the newsletter but he 
plans to get it up to 20 editions before calling it quits 
if i can do it here by george i can do it anywhere he 
said

though murder is not one of new yorks selling 
points people are paying for the privilege of reliving some of the 
citys macabre moments 
a tour company with the innocuous name of sidewalks of new york 
is offering walking tours of murder sites to curiosity seekers who 
want to know where some of the citys betterknown victims took 
their last breath according to a report in todays editions of the 
new york post 
i love a good murder publicity agent marnie goodman said 
while on her tour last saturday 
the sites in the 10 twohour tour include the omni park hotel 
on 56th street and seventh avenue formerly the park sheraton 
where organized crime figure albert anastasia was riddled with 
bullets while getting a shave in a barber shop in 1957 also 
featured are the tree in central park under which the body of 
jennifer levin was found two years ago and the dakota building on 
72nd street and central park west where beatle john lennon was 
murdered 
a real estate broker who happened to be walking by the tour 
group with a prospective client for an apartment on west 72nd 
street last week was no doubt less than pleased to hear the guide 
refer to a seventhfloor studio as the place where the looking 
for mr goodbar victim was strangled

share prices were higher early monday afternoon 
but below their best levels as market makers responded to a hike in 
british interest rates with widespread markdowns 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was up 26 
points or 01 percent at 18785 at about 1230 pm after 
reaching as much as 93 points higher in early trading the index 
was up 85 points moments before the rate hike flashed across 
traders computer screens 
prices rose to their best levels in early business on the back 
of an early round of buying by institutional investors also 
boosting shares was widespread positive sentiment reinforced by 
favorable weekend press comment about london equities 
but the signal by the bank of england at about midday for a rise 
in the commercial banks base lending rate to 11 percent from 105

terry holsapples rather unconventional 
approach to farming began with a simple observation one crop can 
help another crop grow 
when we plowed down a crop of alfalfa we had the best corn 
ever said holsapple i had been taught to use all these 
chemicals that really gets you to thinking 
so holsapple decided five years ago to abandon chemically 
intensive agriculture and experiment with plants like hairy vetch 
and rye they control weeds add nutrients and organic matter to 
the soil and protect the land from erosion the natural way he 
said 
the yields have not suffered in fact they might have picked 
up a hair said holsapple who now raises corn and soybeans with 
fewer commercial fertilizers and pesticides thats money in your 
pocket 
holsapple 33 recently showed other interested farmers some of 
the techniques successful and unsuccessful that he uses on his 
400acre farm in cumberland county 
it is one of 14 farms across the nation cooperating in 
experiments sponsored by the rodale institute of emmanus pa a 
nonprofit group doing research on regenerative agriculture 
we need to diversify crops and methods stop soil erosion and 
rely less on fossil fuels said ken mcnamara rodales midwest 
research coordinator the systems we develop here will be around 
for our children and our grandchildren 
during a wagon tour of his farm holsapple offered some pointers 
fallplanted hairy vetch can be turned under the soil in the 
spring to supply nitrogen for corn eliminating the need for that 
fertilizer in commercial form 
these cover crops dont let weeds get started in the spring 
said holsapple that vetch will even smother out horseweed 
a field of tall lush corn was cultivated to kill weeds and 
grasses before they got a good start herbicides are a last resort 
youve got to have a rotary hoe or you might as well throw up 
your hands and go to town said holsapple who paid 15 for a 
small used one at a sale if that doesnt work you can always 
come back and spray later 
a field of dead vetch and little corn demonstrated the problem 
of planting the grain into the vetch without plowing during a dry 
year the vetch sucked all the moisture out and the corn didnt 
germinate 
holsapple also experiments with spring peas as a cover crop to 
provide nitrogen for corn 
he raises melons and other produce in small irrigated fields to 
sell locally 
he produces his own seed for vetch rye and soybeans buying 
only commercial hybrid corn seed 
and he adds fertilizers only when a soil test indicates it will 
be cost effective 
we just keep trying things said holsapple the more i do 
this the more enthused i get 
holsapple said the trialanderror and the work involved in this 
kind of farming operation are worthwhile from a social and 
economic standpoint 
theres more profit no doubt about it

nearly 3300 of the 8717 applicants for 
insurance by the chubb group of insurance companies in ohio and 
nine other midwestern states have accepted the companys offer to 
refund double their premiums 
chubb made the offer last month after agents sold 400 million 
in drought insurance coverage to farmers the underwriter had 
authorized only 30 million worth of the coverage to be sold chubb 
contends that a flood of applications in the last days the 
insurance was available caused it to be oversold 
the company operated a 125person telephone bank during the 
weekend to call 3500 other applicants even though the deadline 
for the doublepremium refund expired friday 
chubb said friday that 852 farmers had accepted the drought 
insurance policies originally offered and 106 farmers who were 
offered policies decided instead to take the doublepremium offer 
another 359 farmers were ruled ineligible for the insurance because 
their applications were too late 
chubb offered up to 40 million of insurance nationwide in july 
to the applicants on a firstcome firstserved basis other 
farmers who met the deadline were offered double their premiums 
back 
ohio regulators investigating the drought insurance issue will 
subpoena more people next week to explain how the insurance was 
marketed 
more questions have been triggered by some of the testimony 
weve heard during the first week of public meetings said george 
fabe director of the ohio department of insurance 
the department next week will try to sort out which questions 
remain and who should be called in to answer them fabe said 
public meetings will probably resume the following week 
the drought insurance was structured to pay farmers for the lack 
of rain between june 1 and aug 31 based on a sliding scale about 
600 ohio farmers applied for the insurance

china will open a nationwide bond market at the 
end of this year to curb black market trading in soughtafter 
government bonds the finance ministry said 
a ministry spokesman said the decision to open the market for 
treasury bonds came after experiments with bond markets in 61 
chinese cities in the first half of the year the official peoples 
daily reported monday 
a main purpose of the new market will be to stop 
bondspeculating lords who purchase nonmatured bonds at low 
values and resell them at higher prices the newspaper said 
bonds have become popular among the chinese because they offer 
higher interest rates than regular savings accounts bonds issued 
in 1985 earn an annual interest rate of 9 percent redeemable after 
five years while 1986 and 1987 bonds pay 10 percent interest 
china issued 362 billion yuan or about 98 billion worth of 
government bonds from 1981 to 1987 to help finance its economic 
development programs 
the government also has permitted some state and collective 
enterprises to raise funds by issuing bonds and stocks and small 
stock exchanges are operating in shanghai beijing and some other

cashrich cbs inc announcing its first 
television station purchase since laurence a tisch took over as 
president nearly two years ago said today it has agreed to buy 
wcixtv in miami for 59 million 
cbs said it also agreed to assume certain program obligations 
valued at about 13 million as part of the deal for the station 
which operates on channel 6 in miami and is owned by tvx broadcast 
group inc of norfolk va 
completion of the deal is subject to regulatory approval 
wcix is an independent station and its acquisition would 
increase the number of tv stations that cbs owns and operates to 
five reaching about 208 percent of the country cbs also operates 
the cbs television network 
cbs has faced criticism from its affiliates for failing to 
expand its station holdings particularly in light of the 3 
billion in cash that the company has built up as it sold 
nonbroadcast assets such as its records and magazines divisions 
over the past two years 
the companies that own the other two major networks each own 
more stations abcs parent owns eight stations and nbcs parent 
owns seven 
tisch has responded by saying that while he wanted to make a 
station purchase the prices being asked were too high 
cbs currently owns stations in new york chicago los angeles 
and philadelphia that reach about 194 percent of the countrys 
viewers 
federal regulations limit a network to owning no more than 12 
stations reaching a maximum 25 percent of the country 
cbs already has an affiliate in miami but the station wtvj 
was acquired by nbc last year for about 270 million that station 
has continued to carry cbs programs however under an affiliation 
agreement that ends in january 
miami is the nations 16th largest television market the 
exciting and fastgrowing maimi market offers a terrific expansion 
opportunity for us said eric ober president of the cbsowned 
television station division 
tisch was quoted in a statement as saying the purchase 
reflects the commitment of the board and senior management to 
make sound investments in good broadcast properties in attractive 
local markets 
we are continuing to evaluate other potential properties with 
an eye toward further acquisitions he said 
ths acquisition would be the second major purchase by tisch in 
the past four months cbs bought the broadcast rights for 1992 
winter olympics for 243 million in may

the city of light is a treasure trove of cultural 
archeological and historical gems oil companies hope it also holds 
black gold 
on tuesday societe nationale elf aquitaine plans to begin 
drilling an exploratory oil well on the southern doorstep of paris 
at ivrysurseine the first of several wells in a program that 
also envisions exploring within the city itself 
i dont think paris will ever be houston said jean perrot 
elfs assistant director of exploration in france but there is 
still oil to be found in the paris basin 
the basin is a 50000squaremile expanse stretching eastward 
from paris to the west german frontier 
exploration surged in the basin after the discovery in april 
1983 of considerable oil deposits at the chaunoy field which is in 
a rural region about 50 miles south of the capital best known for 
its tender white brie cheese 
the ivry site barely a mile outside the paris city limits is 
being explored under a permit awarded in december 1985 to elf 
total compagnie francaise des petroles and british petroleum the 
587 square miles covered by the permit includes the city of paris 
where limited seismic tests already have been carried out 
it will take as much as four weeks to determine whether ivry 
contains marketable reserves and whether they might extend inside 
the city but perrot said it is quasicertain that even with a 
total failure in ivry there will be other exploratory wells 
total said it definitely will drill an exploratory well likely 
before the end of the year 
in their exploration campaign the companies say they have 
already spent more than the 70 million francs about 116 million 
required under the fiveyear permit mostly for seismic tests 
there are more than 1000 exploratory wells in the paris basin 
which produces nearly twothirds of frances modest oil output 
some oil also is being pumped from the aquitaine region of 
southwestern france and minimally from alsace on the eastern 
frontier all the regions together produce less than 5 percent of 
frances needs 
the ivry well is the first to be drilled so close to paris 
if we are encouraged by ivry we will be encouraged to do more 
studies of paris said alexis poutchkovsky a spokesman for elf 
we could easily find locations for derricks within the city 
he said look at the number of wells in los angeles 
oil derricks would not rival the eiffel tower for attention 
though experts say stadiums disused factories or even a 
discretely moored boat on the seine river could serve as sites for 
horizontal drilling by which oil is extracted sideways 
we are looking at all solutions poutchkovsky said 
limited seismic readings of the capital were carried out in 1986 
when specially equipped trucks sounding out the city depths rolled 
down the champs elysees while paris slept 
more extensive seismic readings showed favorable structures in 
ivry nearby orly chenevieres to the east and roissy to the 
north according to elf and total the two operators on the permit 
which gives elf a 50 percent share total 35 percent and british 
petroleum 15 percent 
to the uninitiated exploring for oil in the highly urbanized 
paris region may be akin to searching for water in a desert but 
specialists say about one in five exploratory wells in the paris 
basis are successful or about twice the industrys standard ratio 
still you will never find a giant oil field in the paris 
basin said poutchkovsky nothing the basin has proven reserves 
of only about 280 million barrels by contrast the biggest oil 
basin in the united states prudhoe bay has 8 billion barrels of 
known reserves and saudi arabia has 167 billion barrels 
france knew it had oil centuries ago when miners in alsace 
caught drippings in buckets 
the paris basins first well was discovered in 1958 but it was 
not until the chaunoy find by esso saf the french subsidiary of 
exxon corp that the industry took serious notice 
about 15 companies were operating in the region at the time of 
the chaunoy discovery today there are as many as 90 many of them 
foreign 
triton france a subsidiary of triton energy corp of dallas 
has been established in france since 1980 the first foreign 
company to operate in the paris basin it now ranks no 4 overall 
with a production rate of 10000 barrels a day said emmanuel 
mousset triton frances director of exploration 
france had a record year in 1987 producing 224 million barrels 
of oil but that was dwarfed by the 4647 million barrels it 
imported 
industry executives say costs of extracting the crude are higher 
than in the united states and benefits remain marginal 
exploration is a long affair to recover investments is a long 
process and we are now beginning to recover ours said mousset at 
triton france 
mousset said triton france which is associated with total in 80 
percent of its operations was disappointed not to have a slice of 
the exploration permit for the area around the capital 
they have as much chance of finding oil there as anywhere 
else he said

a group of 19 institutional investors filed suit 
monday charging that american brands inc violated securities laws 
by misstating facts when it offered to buy 15 billion in debt as 
part of its acquisition of eii holdings inc 
the complaint filed against both companies in us district 
court in manhattan seeks 350 million in damages 
holders of eiis longterm debt passed up an opportunity to 
sell out in late february american brands offered to buy two 
issues of debt at 103 percent and 104 percent of face value plus 
accrued interest but the offer expired without the company 
receiving anywhere near the 51 percent response needed to trigger 
the purchases 
the bonds currently are trading below the price offered by 
american brands 
the bondholders led by prudential insurance co columbia 
savings and loan association and forstmannleff associates claim 
they based their decision not to sell on american brands assertion 
that it would retain eii as a wholly owned subsidiary 
the plaintiffs who hold about 600 million of eiis 15 
billion in outstanding debt had expected american brands to sell 
only a few segments of eiis businesses that did not fit into 
the core business strategy 
four months later however american brands announced it would 
sell most of eii including its debt to riklis family corp 
american brands paid riklis to retain five eii businesses 
eiis outstanding debt is now the obligation of riklis 
in their lawsuit the bondholders allege american brands 
pursued a secret strategy completely inconsistent with the 
statements made in the tender offer document when it was 
acquiring eii shares in february for 1705 a share or about 27 
billion including debt 
american brands spokesman daniel conforti said the company had 
been advised that the suits are without merit he said american 
brands made it clear at the outset that we would not assume the 
indebtedness 
american brands disclaimed any legal responsibility for the 
bonds before the merger with eii was completed saying the debt 
would remain eiis responsibility once it became a subsidiary 
the suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages the two bond 
issues in question come due in march 1997 and march 1999 interest 
payments on the debt total about 194 million according to 
published estimates

labor secretary ann mclaughlin announced a 
148 million plan monday to meet the emergency survival needs of 
thousands of migrant and seasonal farm workers left without money 
or jobs because of the drought 
but rep albert bustamante dtexas said the labor departments 
package is not enough to help migrant workers stranded across the 
droughtparched midwest without a job or enough money to finance 
the return trip home 
when youre looking at the amount of money big farmers 
agriconglomerates are getting they really are not providing for 
the bottomrung people who do the harvesting and stoop labor 
bustamante said 
they should have been more fair in trying to bring relief to 
these people said bustamante himself a former migrant worker 
bustamante said he had sought 20 million to 25 million which 
would have come closer to meeting shortterm survival needs 
a 39 billion package of drought assistance for farmers 
ranchers and dairy producers passed the senate on monday and could 
receive final legislative approval as early as tuesday in the house 
bustamante said he was working with house majority whip tony 
coelho dcalif and house agriculture committee chairman e 
kika de la garza to free up more money for the migrant workers 
mrs mclaughlin promised the labor department would marshal 
funds quickly she said she also was writing to state governors and 
agencies to recommend special employment services and 
unemployment insurance consideration for migrant farm workers 
the severe drought in some parts of the nation has had a 
devastating effect on migrant farm workers and their families 
mrs mclaughlin said in a statement some are stranded without 
work or money to return home while others face extreme hardship at 
their home base 
mrs mclaughlin said she has authorized existing migrant worker 
programs operating under labor department grants to use up to 15 
percent of their current funding for emergency services such as 
health care transportation and temporary shelter the agency said 
that could mean up to 95 million may be spent 
she said another 5 million has been set aside from a job 
partnership training act reserve account for displaced workers to 
be used specifically for migrant farm workers hurt by the drought 
the labor department also said portions of some states may be 
declared disaster areas triggering a disaster unemployment 
insurance program 
twentytwo states have asked the department of agriculture to be 
designated droughtdisaster areas these states have an estimated 
200000 migrant and seasonal farm workers the labor department 
said 
they are alabama delaware idaho illinois indiana iowa

phillips petroleum co will sell its 
oil and gas holdings in the williston basin of montana and north 
dakota to conoco for an undisclosed sum company officials 
announced monday 
the sale is part of phillips strategy to divest nonstrategic 
assets company spokesman dan harrison said 
it did not have a good fit for us harrison said of 
williston basin 
since 1985 phillips has sold gas plants at williston and tioga 
nd harrison said 
conoco a subsidiary of du pont co will obtain phillips 
interest in about 175 oil and gas wells that produce about 4000 
barrels of oil and 28 million cubic feet of natural gas a day 
also included in the sale are 234000 undeveloped acres in 
eastern montana and western north dakota 
harrison said phillips interest in the williston property 
amounted to about 2000 barrels of oil and 1 million cubic feet of 
gas a day he said phillips us production last year was 113000 
barrels of oil and 772 million cubic feet of natural gas a day 
industry analysts say the amount of domestic oil and gas 
reserves up for sale has about doubled in the past year because of 
the market created by high exploration costs 
the transactions usually reflect the sellers need to reduce 
debt and the buyers desire for proven production at a cost lower 
than that of exploring for new reserves the analysts said

because the smaller free press was in danger of financial failure 
stemming from years of steady and apparently irreversible losses 
attorney general edwin meese iii said monday 
in approving the application for a joint operating agreement 
meese rejected the recommendation of a justice department 
administrative law judge who said the two newspapers pricing 
policies were unrealistic 
meese however said there was little prospect for the free 
press to return to profitability in detroits highly competitive 
market 
for me the continuing and persistent operating losses 
suffered by the free press over the course of nearly a decade with 
no prospect of unilaterally reversing that economic condition in 
the foreseeable future describes a newspaper in danger of 
financial failure meese said in his opinion 
meese told reporters that the free press losses were not 
manipulated but came from intense competition 
the detroit joint operating agreement was the fifth approved by 
the justice department under the newspaper preservation act of 
1970 which allows limited antitrust exemption to preserve 
independent editorial voices in a community where one newspaper is 
in danger of failing 
previous partial mergers were approved for newspapers in 
anchorage alaska in 1974 cincinnati in 1979 chattanooga tenn 
in 1980 and seattle in 1982 
the free press owned by knightridder inc and the news owned 
by gannett co inc had asked permission in may 1986 to merge 
their advertising circulation and production operations under a 
law designed to preserve newspaper competition 
the newspapers which rank among the nations 10 largest said 
the free press was in danger of going out of business without the 
joint operating agreement knightridders directors had voted to 
shut down the free press if the justice department had rejected the 
application for a joint operating agreement 
knightridder said in january that the free press operating 
losses had totaled 100 million since 1979 and that the news had 
lost about 75 million in the same period the free press lost 18 
million on revenues of 172 million in 1987 
this decision reaffirms the will of the congress that two 
independent editorial voices should be preserved wherever possible 
in the cities of america alvah h chapman jr knightridder 
chairman said in a statement issued in miami 
free press publisher david lawrence said this is the best 
single day of my years at the free press it leads the way to the 
next century of service for the free press which already has been 
part of michigan for more than a century and a half 
gannett chairman allen neuharth and president john j curley 
also expressed gratification 
we said all along that the joa was the only way to preserve 
two independent news and editorial voices they said in a 
statement issued from gannett headquarters in suburban arlington 
va the attorney generals decision is in the best interest of 
the community the readers the advertisers and the employees 
said jerry w friedheim president of the american newspaper 
publishers association while the administrative law judge in the 
detroit case misapplied the statute in some important ways we are 
pleased that the attorney general appears to have taken a view more 
consistent with the intent of congress 
a justice department administrative law judge morton needelman 
recommended in december 1987 that meese deny the request on grounds 
that the newspapers losses were due to unrealistic circulation and 
advertising discounts aimed at forcing each other out of business 
the newspapers denied needelmans assertion saying he lacked an 
understanding of the newspaper business 
bruce mcintyre publisher of the oakland press one of several 
suburban detroit papers that had criticized the joint operating 
agreement request said he was quite surprised that meese had 
ignore the advice of the judge who had heard all the evidence in 
the case and made a very studious decision 
while meese was still considering the case free press editor 
joe stroud rejected three cartoons about meese by staff cartoonist 
bill day another knightridder paper the miami herald also 
decided not to publish editorial cartoons about meese while the 
case was pending 
newspaper employee unions and detroit mayor coleman young 
initially opposed the partial merger but most dropped their 
opposition after knightridder directors voted to shut down the 
free press if they failed to win approval of a joint operating 
agreement 
meese said the owners threat to close the free press was noted 
in the record of the case but was not the deciding factor in his 
decision 
the newspaper guild the last employee union to oppose the joint 
operating agreement dropped its opposition july 25 
michigan gov james blanchard and most of the michigan 
congressional delegation supported the agreement 
the free press had circulation in march of 647763 daily and 
721676 on sundays the 10th largest circulation in the nation 
according to the audit bureau of circulation the circulation of 
the news was 688211 daily and 836331 on sundays the eighth 
largest nationally the bureau said 
the free press was founded in 1831 and purchased by a 
predecessor of knightridder in 1940 the news was founded in 1873 
and purchased by gannett in 1986

the nations biggest airline company texas air corp reported 
monday that its secondquarter net loss widened sharply while 
trans world airlines inc said its profit after taxes nearly 
doubled 
houstonbased texas air said its net loss widened to 2559 
million from a loss of 27 million in the second quarter of 1987 
the company blamed a significant part of the loss on government 
investigations of alleged safety problems at its two main 
subsidiaries continental airlines and eastern airlines 
texas airs secondquarter revenue slipped 14 percent to 213 
billion from 216 billion a year earlier 
the department of transportation and the federal aviation 
administration launched investigations of eastern and continental 
in midapril that were unprecedented in their scope the probes 
which continued for most of the second quarter concluded that both 
airlines were being run safely 
however a federal report concluded that labor turmoil at 
miamibased eastern must be defused before it creates risks to 
passengers 
texas air said monday the investigations cost eastern and 
houstonbased continental a total of more than 60 million in lost 
revenue and 14 million in expenses such as overtime advertising 
and legal and accounting fees 
both airlines have implemented various marketing and service 
programs to counter the effects of these investigations on consumer 
confidence but the companies have continued to experience some 
revenue losses beyond the second quarter due to them texas air 
said in a press statement 
at eastern the secondquarter net loss was 898 million 
compared with net income of 271 million a year earlier easterns 
revenue in the most recent quarter declined to 1 billion from 12 
billion 
continental posted a 199 million loss before a 131 million 
adjustment associated with a reestimation of its air traffic 
liability the adjustment had been announced earlier and had no 
impact on continentals cash position texas air said 
including the adjustment continental lost 1509 million on 
revenue of 11 billion in the second quarter in the same period a 
year earlier the airline lost 711 million on revenue of 1 
billion 
the results in the latest quarter brought texas airs net loss 
for the first half of the year to 3801 million widened from a 
loss of 1277 million in the first six months of 1987 
texas airs firsthalf revenue rose 14 percent to 426 
billion from 420 billion 
new yorkbased twa said its net profit almost doubled in the 
second quarter from a year earlier largely due to a cash payment 
it received from a lawsuit against its former owner the late 
howard hughes 
the nations seventhlargest airline said its net income jumped 
to 972 million or 270 a share from 528 million or 128 a 
share in the second quarter of 1987 
in addition to a 499 million gain from the hughes lawsuit twa 
said its earnings also benefitted in the quarter from cost 
controls a rebound in international passenger traffic which had 
been hurt by fears of terrorism and the longterm advantages of 
twas merger with ozark air lines 
twas secondquarter revenue rose 86 percent to 114 billion 
from 105 billion a year earlier 
profit in the latest quarter includes the 499 million gain 
from a cash judgment awarded to twa in 1987 in its longstanding 
lawsuit against hughes the twa managements suit originally filed 
in 1962 alleged that the eccentric multimillionaire failed to 
provide the carrier with adequate aircraft 
although a delaware court decided in twas favor last year the 
payment was not made until the second quarter 
in the first half of the year twa earned 447 million or 50 
cents a share compared with a net loss of 2 million in the first 
six months of 1987 
firsthalf revenue increased 96 percent to 206 billion from 
188 billion

hershey foods corp deciding to jettison 
its nineyear venture into the restaurant industry said monday it 
is selling its friendly ice cream corp to tennessee restaurant co 
for 375 million 
richard a zimmerman hersheys chairman and chief executive 
said the company felt it could better use its resources 
concentrating on its primary business consumer food products 
although friendly has been a significant part of hershey 
foods our decision to sell friendly is based upon our continuing 
review of our strategic plan and evaluation of our business 
portfolio zimmerman said in a statement 
hershey spokesman carl andrews said declining income and other 
difficult conditions in the restaurant industry figured in 
hersheys decision 
income from the restaurant chain fell to 456 million in 1986 
from 504 million in 1986 
in its 1986 annual report hershey noted heightened competition 
lack of real sales growth a decrease in customers and difficulty 
finding workers 
twothirds of the companys sales gain in the restaurant 
division from 1985 to 1986 came from new and acquired restaurants 
rather than from higher volume at existing restaurants 
besides its chocolate and confectionery products hershey also 
produces several brands of pasta including san giorgio skinner 
and american beauty 
friendly based in wilbraham mass owns and operates a chain 
of about 850 restaurants which feature moderately priced menu 
items and ice cream specialities friendlys 1987 sales were 572 
million 
hershey foods said the transaction which will give it an 
aftertax gain should be completed within three months subject to 
government approval 
trc a private restaurant holding company based in chicago owns 
about 51 percent of perkins family restaurants a publicly traded 
limited partnership and 100 percent of perkins management co inc 
perkins owns and franchices more than 330 restaurants primarily 
in minnesota ohio pennsylvania new york and florida 
we are pleased to enter phase two of trcs development with a 
company boasting the highquality reputation of friendly said 
donald n smith trc chairman and chief executive officer 
he said friendly has strong name recognition andd excellent 
market penetration in the northeast friendly will provide a solid 
foundation for future growth smith said 
perkins and friendly will be operated as separate companies 
smith said 
hersheys move comes shortly after it announced plans to 
purchase the us confectionery operations of cadburyschweppess 
plc of england for 270 million plus the assumption of 30 million 
in debt 
the purchase still in progress will give hershey a wide array 
of candy lines stretching from its own wellknown products 
including reeses peanut butter candies to cadburys peterpaul and 
york products and ludens 5th avenue bar and cough drops 
what were finding is our area of strength is manufacturing 
with a primary focus on snacks and confectionery products 
andrews said 
we do think that puts us in a leadership position of the total 
us confectionery market he added

interco inc on monday rejected as inadequate a 
sweetened 268 billion buyout offer from a washingtonbased 
investor group and took moves to strengthen its defenses against 
an unwanted takeover 
the manufacturer and retailer of apparel and furniture stated 
that in addition to rejecting the 70 a share merger proposal 
offered earlier monday by city capital associates its board of 
directors approved a plan to sell the companys apparel division 
which accounts for nearly a fourth of its sales 
the interco board concluded that the interests of the 
companys shareholders were better served by the companys 
continued pursuit of the restructuring of the company which is 
presently under consideration the company said 
interco stock which rose by more than 13 a share when the 
groups initial offer of 64 a share was announced july 28 rose 
412 to 7250 a share on the new york stock exchange 
the interco board also amended its poison pill defense 
against hostile takeover so that it takes effect if a suitor 
acquires 15 percent or more of intercos 384 million outstanding 
common shares 
the company said the change was aimed at preventing an 
openmarket stock accumulation program following the announcement 
of a proposal to acquire interco or a street sweep that could 
accompany or follow a tender offer for the company in which all 
interco shareholders would not participate equally and at a fair 
price 
city capital owns 87 percent or 314 million of intercos 
outstanding common shares 
when it made its initial 64 a share offer valued at about 
246 billion city capital said it might increase its bid based on 
further review of information about interco 
the company had sales of 334 billion last year with the 
apparel group contributing about 24 percent 
interco manufactures mens and womens apparel footwear 
furniture and home furnishings some of its brand names are among 
the best known in the united states including london fog clothing

furniture

newspaper employees and executives by turns 
praised and criticized attorney general edwin meeses approval 
monday of a partial merger of the detroit free press with the 
detroit news 
champagne flowed in the newsroom at the free press where the 
decision brought relief after months of uncertainty over whether 
meese would approve the joint operating agreement between the 
newspaper the nations 10thlargest and the rival news 
it was like a rush waiting for the decision is like living on 
death row said senior managing editor neal shine who had been 
assigned to write the newspapers obituary if the joint operating 
agreement with the news was denied 
but critics labeled the deal a blow to competition in the 
newspaper business 
this is a travesty of the newspaper preservation act said 
lou mleczko a news reporter who is president of newspaper guild 
local 22 the two largest media companies in the world can take 
two newspapers that are in a dead heat and get a monopoly 
knightridder inc had said it would close the 157yearold free 
press if the joa with the news owned by gannett co inc was 
denied 
in miami top knightridder executives praised free press 
employees for persevering under difficult conditions and praised 
meese for approving the joa 
this is good news for the loyal readers and advertisers of the 
free press for our hardworking and dedicated employees in detroit 
and for our shareholders who have shared the burden of enormous 
operating losses in detroit since 1979 knightridder chairman 
alvah h chapman jr said in a statement 
gannett chairman allen neuharth and president john j curley 
also praised the decision 
we said all along that the joa was the only way to preserve 
two independent news and editorial voices they said in a 
statement issued from gannett headquarters in arlington va the 
attorney generals decision is in the best interest of the 
community the readers the advertisers and the employees 
newspaper guild local 22 the last of the newspapers unions to 
drop its opposition to the joa nevertheless was critical of the 
decision the guild which has 1100 members in the two newsrooms 
held out for better economic terms before agreeing to withdraw its 
opposition 
the losers in this are going to be the readers and advertisers 
in southeastern michigan and it could set a precedent where youll 
see the elimination of competitive journalism in cities throughout 
the united states said mleczko 
mike lloyd editor of the grand rapids press the states 
thirdlargest paper said he was pleased as a journalist that the 
merger was approved 
the loss of any daily newspaper would be considered a bad day 
in journalism by even those of us who think of the free press as 
serious competition said lloyd 
bruce mcintyre publisher of the oakland mich press said he 
was surprised meese would disregard the recommendation of the 
administrative law judge who presided over hearings on the proposed 
joa 
judge morton needelman sat and listened to these things and 
made a very studious decision on it and its hard to believe the 
attorney general would so easily overturn what his own 
administrative law judge recommended mcintyre said 
reactions from michigan politicians also varied 
state senator john kelly of detroit who unsuccessfully sought a 
new law blocking the joa said what has really happened is the 
annihilation of the free press it will be gannettized and the 
quality staff will be reduced because there will be no incentive 
without any real competition 
but us sen carl levin a longtime meese critic complemented 
the attorney general 
todays announcement shows what a united community can do and 
what a united michigan congressional delegation can do attorney 
general edwin meeses response to that united community is very 
gratifying indeed levin said

a federal judge ruled monday that the tiny south 
pacific island republic of palau must pay an international 
consortium of banks more than 44 million on defaulted loans 
the republic a 200island archipelago in the south central 
pacific ocean about 600 miles east of the philippines borrowed 
more than 30 million to build an electric power generating station 
in the early 1980s 
the nation once a us trust territory in march defaulted on 
the loans and the consortium that had guaranteed the loans had to 
pay them off the banks sued the country population 14200 for 
repayment 
under the decision the banks morgan guaranty trust morgan 
grenfell amp co ltd bank of tokyo ltd bank of scotland and 
orion royal bank ltd are entitled to collect some 443 million 
in unpaid loans capitalized interest insurance premiums fees and 
expenses 
in his 57page opinion us district judge robert w sweet said 
the case presented an involved factual matrix and complicated 
issues of sovereignty and commercial law arising out of the 
struggle of the unsophisticated island people of palau to achieve 
independence both economic and political 
but the judge concluded the banks were entitled to collect the 
amounts they had guaranteed 
sweets ruling was the latest round in a threeyear legal battle 
between the banks some of the largest in the world and palau 
whose main industry is fishing 
this decision is but one step along what may turn out to be a 
long road but at least this phase has been completed said sweet 
after a weeklong trial in april and final arguments in june 
sweet ruled that palau willingly waived its right to sovereign 
immunity and thus protection from lawsuits when it signed the 
loan agreements sweet also ruled that palau failed to prove its 
contention that the banks had misrepresented how the power plant 
would pay for itself or that palauan officials signed documents 
they did not understand
