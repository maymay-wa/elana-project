margaret thatcher is not the only grocers 
daughter to disturb the old order lady shirley porter is trying to 
dust the cobwebs off westminster which includes buckingham palace 
and westminster abbey 
as leader of westminster city council since 1983 lady porter 
has struggled to make one of britains richest municipalities run 
as efficiently as her fathers supermarket chain 
the sprawling metropolis of london has no citywide government or 
mayor each of the 32 boroughs elects its own council which in 
turn picks a leader westminsters 60 councilors are up for 
election in may 
lady porter wholeheartedly embracing prime minister thatchers 
free market revolution has sold the boroughs garbage collection 
and recreation facilities to private contractors 
since she became head of the council more than 9000 
councilowned apartments have been sold to their occupants as part 
of a national effort to turn tenants of public housing into 
property owners 
she is an international expert on litter and often is seen 
walking around her bailiwick picking it up lady porter entered 
politics in 1974 specifically to tackle trash and lists her 
recreations in whos who as cleaning up london and 
wastehunting 
her animated brand of radical conservatism invites frequent 
comparisons with mrs thatcher who grew up above her fathers 
grocery store 
sir jack cohen lady porters father parlayed an east london 
vegetable stall into the tesco supermarket chain and imbued his 
younger daughter with his motto you cant do business sitting on 
your armchair 
lady porter became head of westminster council as a freemarket 
conservative determined to eradicate the socialist structures that 
had long dominated local government in britain 
her strongwilled sometimes autocratic style has inspired 
allegations of financial mismanagement most notably after 
westminster sold three old cemeteries for the equivalent of 8 cents 
each critics claimed it was a case of desecrating the dead to cut 
costs 
in addition to councils some boroughs have ceremonial lord 
mayors westminsters handles the extensive ritual associated with 
a 400yearold district in the heart of a pageantryloving country 
an americanstyle mayor is more to lady porters taste and she 
would like to be one she said its the best way to cut through 
the bickering and the red tape and serve the interests of the 
people 
she sees her goal as saving westminster from becoming home to 
only the very rich and very poor lady porter says she wants to 
give westminster back to the middle classes to encourage them to 
stay so that we dont finish up like new york 
a recent survey by the magazine harpers and queen said lady 
porter was the 20th richest woman in europe with an estimated 
personal fortune of 50 million pounds 845 million her title 
derives from the knighthood of her husband sir leslie porter 
lady porters family background was reflected in her comment 
recently to a meeting of foreign journalists we believe in 
services to the customer we are a serviceoriented council its 
in my blood that people should be treated as customers 
her 170000 customers are westminsters permanent residents 
they include the members of the royal family who live at and 
around buckingham palace and the prime minister currently mrs 
thatcher who lives down the road at 10 downing street 
every day the population is swollen to more than 1 million by 
tourists shoppers and workers who throng the oxford street 
shopping district west end theaters hyde park victoria station 
the houses of parliament the government offices of whitehall and 
the local church westminster abbey 
they leave enough litter to fill trafalgar square to the height 
of admiral nelsons column five times a year 
westminster claims no council has done more than lady porters 
to fight rubbish prince philip who once accompanied her on 
garbage inspection detail has taken to greeting her at social 
functions by calling across the room how are the litter bins 
businesses pay for the upkeep of 500 garbage cans and 31 
uniformed wardens can fine litterers of 10 pounds 17 on the 
spot a telephone hotline is planned for residents to report 
litterers noise and curbfouling dogs 
permanent residents get discounts on tourist attractions 
residents can deal with officials by telephone or fax and 
onestop services mean the availability at one counter of 
everything from election registration to parking permits 
westminster is among the first british boroughs to introduce 
glass recycling bins 
the national and local government officers association said 70 
ranking officials had quit the westminster government since lady 
porter took over one was chief executive rodney brooke who left 
last year with a retirement package said to be worth 1 million 
pounds 17 million 
brookes retirement deal enhanced a controversy already swirling 
around the sale in 1987 of the three rundown and unused cemeteries 
the council said it wanted to save 450000 pounds 760000 in 
annual maintenance the cemeteries on prime development land have 
been resold several times 
scotland yards fraud squad found no criminal wrongdoing after a 
year of investigation but the district auditors report concluded 
the council had no authority to dispose of the cemeteries 
westminster council is suing the lawyers who advised it on the sale 
opposition labor party councilors also have attacked the council 
for building britains most expensive parking lot 100 spaces in 
soho that cost 4 million pounds 676 million and for giving 
grants to private landlords to repair luxury apartments

in the venerated church of the holy sepulcher 
the center of easter week activities exactly 43 lamps burn over 
the tomb where tradition holds the crucified christ was buried 
thirteen each are tended by greek orthodox roman catholic and 
armenian clerics and four belong to the egyptian copts 
the jealously guarded division of duties reflects a complicated 
system of caretaking that applies to church altars candlesticks 
icon sites and other church property 
the system was set up in the 1850s by ruling ottoman turks to 
resolve centuries of unseemly squabbles among christian sects for 
control of the shrine 
the tolerance of the four main christian sects caring for the 
church is tested anew each easter season when thousands of pilgrims 
from all denominations flood the church to commemorate the passion 
death and resurrection of christ 
daniel rossing an israeli expert on christianity who formerly 
served as a government mediator in church disputes says that 
problems during the holy days generally are unintentional 
processions get going the wrong way or zealous tourists block 
aisles he said 
fistfights broke out in the past when exhuberant youth groups 
danced out of their assigned spaces and onto the turf reserved for 
others he added 
pity the police who have to sort it all out rossing said 
not only in arabic and english but in russian greek 
armenian 
the church will be more congested than usual this year because 
the eastern rite and latin churches are celebrating easter 
simultaneously for the first time since 1987 and for the last time 
this century 
their feasts generally are a week to five weeks apart because of 
differences in the julian calendar of the eastern churches and the 
gregorian calendar used in the west 
the potential for problems is greatest on good friday when the 
procession route of pilgrims retracing christs walk to calvary 
crosses the paths of moslems headed to friday prayers and jews 
going to sabbath evening prayers at the western wall the last 
remnant of the ancient jewish temple 
moslems and jews may be out in greater numbers than usual too 
because easter week also overlaps ramadan the moslem holy month of 
fasting and passover the eightday jewish holiday commemorating 
the israelites flight from egypt 
israels tourism ministry says 45000 visitors are expected in 
jerusalem for the holidays the highest number since the start of 
the palestinian uprising against israeli rule more than two years 
ago 
we will have plenty of police at sensitive spots police 
spokesman uzi sandori said 
the fire department is prepared too for the dazzling and 
potentially inflamatory miracle of the holy fire by orthodox 
christians on saturday 
as the flame from torches in the sepulcher is passed to 
thousands of candlecarrying worshipers inside the church more 
than two dozen jerusalem firefighters will wield special 
extinguishers to douse the inevitable hair and clothing fires 
the church of the holy sepulcher a dark and dusky doubledomed 
basilica that covers the sites where tradition holds christ was 
crucified and buried is sacred to many christians 
the first church on the site was built in the 4th century by the 
byzantine emperor constantine whose mother queen helena traveled 
to jerusalem in 327 ad to identify the scenes of christs passion 
orthodox domination of the church gave way to roman primacy 
after the byzantine basilica was destroyed by a fanatical egyptian 
caliph and it was rebuilt in the 12th century by the european 
crusaders 
in succeeding years under arab and then ottoman turkish rulers 
the orthodox and latin rites resorted to bribes secret agreements 
and international diplomacy in their battle for supremacy 
the jealousy is such that it took the rival church leaders until 
1959 to agree on a stillincomplete restoration program to repair 
damage from a massive 1808 fire and devastating 1927 earthquake 
the greek orthodox are working alone to fix the dome over 
christs tomb so their control of the area wont be challenged 
the rev jerome murphyoconnor a dominican priest and new 
testament scholar says the ottoman status quo agreement may have 
resolved most property disputes but has not resolved spiritual ones 
one hopes for peace but the ear is assailed by a cacophony of 
warring chants he wrote in his guidebook the holyland one 
desires holiness only to encounter a jealous possessiveness

saladino de souza gonzalez says he 
has the perfect solution for brazilians wanting to protect their 
homes from burglars guard lions 
with a lion for a guard the thief may enter but he wont 
leave said gonzalez a 45yearold book wholesaler from belo 
horizonte brazils thirdlargest city 
gonzalez has raised lions for the past 10 years on his farm in 
the interior he said brazils soaring crime rate has helped create 
a steady demand 
i recommend a large backyard the construction of a gate and 
plenty of space then let them roam free at night gonzalez said 
in a telephone interview three lions guard gonzalezs home 
gonzalez started with three lions smuggled from africa and 
raises a litter every three months when the cubs are 30 days old 
he puts them up for sale for 300 using classified ads so far he 
has sold 30 lions 
they adapt remarkably well to life at home i never have a 
problem selling them he said 
gonzalez said a baby lion needs to be fed two to three big 
chickens a day supplemented with a few cans of dog food adults 
require four chickens and about nine pounds of meat daily which 
can run to about 250 a month 
keeping lions at home is legal in brazil said capt allan 
salazar of the forestry police in minas gerais of which belo 
horizonte is the capital he said nonnative animals are 
unprotected by law 
exotic animals can be kept at home if conditions are good the 
owner is responsible for security and the animals actions he 
said 
gonzalez says he visits the homes of all his clients after they 
buy their lions to make sure there are no problems 
lions are as loyal as dogs in fact i recommend getting a dog 
to keep your lion company because they learn to play together he 
said 
he said lions are no problem with children either as long as 
the animal is purchased when small so they can get used to each 
other 
and he says a lionguarded home is a safe home 
thieves are smart they always scope out their targets if 
theres a lion on the premises they wont try robbing the house 
he said 
one happy customer is ana maria conceicao de oliveira who lives 
with her husband 13yearold daughter and mikey the 
20monthold family lion who occupies a large pen in the backyard 
we bought mikey to scare away burglars and im sure no thief 
would enter our house people around the neighborhood know we have 
a lion so the word is out she said 
her daughter raquel christina plays with the lion in the 
backyard and feeds him a daily ration of 20 pounds of chicken 
necks lungs hearts and kidneys 
burglars are afraid of dogs imagine how they would feel about 
mikey she said 
gonzalez denies having any problems with customers but the rio 
newspaper jornal do brasil reported at least one woman was unhappy 
with her lion and resold it because he had ripped up her bathroom 
when she gave him a bath 
in practice i learned that a lion is a lion and a dog is a 
dog said the woman identified only as maria celia a lion is 
temperamental and difficult very different from a puppy

another fugitive student leader of the crushed 
prodemocracy movement has escaped china through an underground 
railroad which is still operating 10 months after the crackdown on 
dissent a reliable source said 
i want everybody to know that the channel is still alive 
theres still hope said the source who is close to the 
railroad the source refused to be identified further and asked 
that the date of the interview not be published for security 
reasons 
he refused to divulge details of the escape route 
the source said wang chaohua fled china on or about jan 7 she 
was on a list of 21 students sought by the chinese government for 
leading demonstrations last spring for more freedom in the 
communist country wang 38 was by far the oldest person on the 
list and exerted a strong influence over the others 
the source said he did not know where she has settled in the 
west 
the chineselanguage hong kong economic journal reported 
thursday that wang had escaped to an unnamed destination and would 
meet with other exiled dissidents at an appropriate time 
the underground railroad brought out several prominent student 
and intellectual dissidents soon after june 4 when the chinese 
army killed hundreds if not thousands of people in central 
beijing as it crushed the prodemocracy movement 
in late december china announced the arrests of five residents 
of this british colony and of macao a nearby portuguese enclave 
on charges of trying to smuggle dissidents out of the country the 
prodemocracy movement had widespread support in the territories 
which both revert to chinese rule later this decade 
chinas official xinhua news agency quoted police as saying the 
arrests dealt a major blow to the overseas reactionary forces who 
attempted to use hong kong and macao as sanctuaries for criminals 
it said china would punish severely those who dare to plot and 
ship wanted criminals out of the mainland 
but prodemocracy chinese fugitives are continuing to reach the 
west 
student leader chai ling and her husband feng congde recently 
emerged in france after fleeing china about two weeks ago both 
were on the mostwanted list 
the source refused to comment when asked if the railroad played 
a role in their escape but he said the channel was responsible for 
the escape of wang and a few less prominent people this year he 
refused to name the others 
the lengthy period the three student leaders were able to spend 
as fugitives inside china would indicate there is still popular 
support for the prodemocracy movement 
wang was a postgraduate student at the chinese academy of social 
sciences she played a role akin to that of senior adviser to other 
movement leaders who were much younger and generally less mature 
wang did not have the charisma that thrust other student 
leaders such as wuer kaixi into the international limelight but 
in private she would speak passionately about democracy in china 
the hong kong economic journal said wang wanted to seek 
democratic change through dialogue with the government it said she 
was opposed to the tiananmen square hunger strike that other 
students called to press their demands 
on the first night of the hunger strike last may wang sobbed in 
the middle of the square as arguments raged around her over what 
tactics students should take to keep the movement alive 
five of the 21 students on the wanted list are now known to have 
escaped china to the west wang chai feng wuer and li lu 
about 10 others are either known to be in jail including wang 
dan whose name topped the wanted list or are believed to have 
been apprehended by authorities 
when asked if he thought the underground railroad would be able 
to bring any remaining fugitive student leaders out of the country 
the source said im not optimistic and im not pessimistic ill 
say the chances are 5050

texan phil gramm one of the senates most 
ardent foes of abortion is backing a proposal by homestate 
republicans that would ban most abortions only after pregnancies 
pass the halfway mark 
yet republican gramm who has cosponsored five constitutional 
amendments to ban abortions even in cases of rape or incest 
insists he isnt waffling 
state sen hugh parmer a prochoice democrat who is running 
against gramm sees a smokescreen and is accusing gramm of 
trying to project a more moderate image on abortion to voters back 
home without really changing his stance 
the legislative action plan was issued last week by leaders 
of the texas republican party and endorsed by gramm and gop 
gubernatorial candidate clayton williams 
abortions would be prohibited when medical tests performed by 
a licensed physician determine that the child is viable except 
when medically necessary to save the life of the mother the plan 
also calls for a ban on sexselection abortions and advocates 
parental consent before minors can obtain abortions 
the partys focus on abortion comes as a number of democratic 
and republican candidates around the country have moved away from 
antiabortion positions since antiabortion candidates were 
defeated in the virginia and new jersey governors races last year 
there has been a growing perception that electoral majorities favor 
legal abortions 
bill price president of the largest antiabortion organization 
in texas said he saw no compromise in the limited reach of the 
republican plan but added this is a recognition of political 
reality 
price who heads texans united for life acknowledged the 
release of the plan was meant to coincide with the election season 
why should republicans have the democrats bang them over the 
head on the abortion issue he said 
phyllis dunham executive director of the texas abortion rights 
action league said the gop proposal could backfire 
the antichoice republicans wont think it goes far enough and 
prochoice republicans will see right through it ms dunham 
said the prochoice will see it for being a piece of political 
maneuvering that it is 
fred meyer chairman of the texas republican party said the 
plan is a reasonable responsible program that supports the 
rights of the unborn as well as the rights of women 
meyer said gramms position on the constitutional amendments 
stems from his national perspective while the legislative action 
plan addresses statelevel issues 
gramm spokesman larry neal said the senators position on 
abortion remains unchanged and that the proposed constitutional 
amendments speak for themselves 
but dunham said gramm seems to act more prochoice when hes up 
for reelection 
i think the question which prochoice republicans will have to 
ask themselves is is phil gramm looking out for the lives of 
texans or is he looking out for his own political hide she said 
parmer said gramms support of the gop plan is an attempt to 
confuse people because he knows his own position is totally 
unacceptable to a vast majority of the voters in texas 
he is prepared to take a position opposed by almost everybody 
in texas because he thinks its good politics for him to maintain 
conservative support around the nation in case he runs for 
president in 1996 parmer said 
three antiabortion leaders in texas endorsed the gop plan this 
week saying it points the party in the right direction 
if the people in the prolife movement in texas were to make a 
wish list we would ask for much more but in todays political 
climate and considering the strength of proabortionists with the 
media and political left we feel this legislative package is 
immediately achievable the three wrote

president bush will have to use prescription 
eye drops the rest of his life to control glaucoma in his left eye 
the white house says but he is not expected to suffer vision 
problems 
bushs eye problem characterized by the white house as an 
early glaucoma was diagnosed during his routine annual physical 
examination on thursday 
if not detected early and properly treated the condition 
stemming from pressure in the eye can lead to blindness 
but in bushs case there has been no visual impairment doctors 
said none should be anticipated 
the 65yearold president was pronounced otherwise in 
excellent health by his personal physician dr burton lee he 
continues to keep extremely fit through vigorous physical 
activities lee said in a statement 
asked about the glaucoma at a photo session after he returned 
from the fourhour physical at bethesda naval medical center in 
suburban maryland bush said 
i havent felt a thing felt it at all im taking drops now 
one in the morning and one at night but the vision is very 
good 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said dr lee 
does not anticipate any future problems with the presidents 
vision 
glaucoma expert dr mansour armaly concurred although he did 
not examine the president 
armaly chairman of ophthalmology at george washington 
university medical center here said in a telephone interview that 
early detection is the key to controlling glaucoma 
bush is taking betagan eye drops twice a day and will do so 
permanently aides said betagan is the brand name for the 
betablocker drug levobunolol similar to betablockers that treat 
arterial high blood pressure it lowers the ocular pressure armaly 
said 
glaucoma stems from abnormally high pressure of the fluid within 
the eye and is not uncommon for a person of bushs age it has no 
cure and if the drugs fail to control it surgery is an option 
according to doctors 
bushs eyedrop therapy is standard for glaucoma and proper 
treatment should keep his eye from going blind to the disease said 
dr m bruce shields of the duke university eye center in durham 
nc 
he probably will have to use medicines the rest of his life 
its not something you can treat and then its gone said 
shields who is chairman of the glaucoma committee of the national 
society to prevent blindness 
shields also said that once glaucoma is found in one eye it 
often appears in the other but treatment can also save the sight 
in the second eye he said 
bush has had a stye in his right eye for the past week but it 
is nearly gone after treatments with soaks and antibiotics 
fitzwater said 
doctors also found mild degenerative osteoarthritis in the 
presidents hips and neck which has been also detected in past 
years 
the white house said he also underwent chest xrays which were 
normal an electrocardiogram and stress tests which were normal 
urinalysis showing no abnormality blood tests which were normal 
and a dermatology exam showing no significant problem or 
change 
his allergy problems remain minimal and unchanged fitzwater 
said

an fbi proposal to allow agents to seize some 
evidence in criminal investigations without a subpoena is meeting 
resistance from the justice department capitol hill and civil 
libertarians 
this would give far too much power to individual fbi agents 
said rep don edwards chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee 
on civil and constitutional rights and a former agent himself 
its every agents dream but its subject to too much abuse 
the california democrat said thursday 
justice department spokesman david runkel said prosecutors who 
have been discussing the proposal with the fbi are concerned the 
proposed expanded powers might go too far 
under the proposal fbi agents would be allowed to seize 
documents such as office and bank files and other records without a 
grand jury subpoena issued through a justice department prosecutor 
and without a search warrant they would need only an 
administrative summons that they could issue on their own 
however law enforcement officials still would have to obtain a 
courtapproved search warrant before they could enter a persons 
home or office without the persons approval 
colleen oconnor of the american civil liberties union 
criticized the proposal saying if the justice department goes 
in that direction we dont expect it to last long without a court 
challenge 
weve seen a pattern of the government attempting to change 
its own rules of operating and this is another indication of 
it she said thats why we have courts 
the comments followed a new york times report on the proposal 
thursday 
the fbi and the drug enforcement administration got the expanded 
authority for drug investigations several years ago 
in 1987 the fbi also got the right to secretly obtain bank 
records without a warrant in investigations of foreign spies upon 
certification by the fbi director 
at this point were exploring the possibility of extending 
that to other criminal matters said fbi spokesman mike kortan 
the fbi believes such authority carefully limited by statute 
and regulations would be a useful investigative tool which would 
not pose any threat to individual privacy kortan said 
he said the expanded authority would save time during 
investigations eliminating the need for agents to travel long 
distances to secure a subpoena 
the fbi first proposed the expansion of authority in 1988 said 
a congressional source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
their proposal has been bottled up in the justice 
department specifically in the us attorneys advisory 
committee the source said adding that a turf battle is to 
blame for the lack of action 
attorney general dick thornburgh has not gotten involved in 
discussions between the fbi and the prosecutors committee runkel 
said 
if it gets to him he will get involved he said it may 
be resolved prior to getting to him 
legislation to give the fbi the expanded authority only for bank 
and savings and loan investigations was proposed as part of the sampl 
bailout bill passed by congress last year 
however edwards and several other congressmen objected saying 
it would give individual fbi agents too much authority and the 
measure was dropped 
no legislation on the proposal is currently before congress 
the congressional source who supports the proposal said the 
fbi needs the expanded authority at least for financial 
institution investigations because there are more than 2000 
bank fraud and sampl cases languishing because the fbi doesnt have 
enough people

environmentalists and lawmakers are hailing a 
decision by three us tuna canners including the worlds largest 
not to buy or sell tuna captured along with dolphins 
environmental groups predicted the move by companies selling the 
starkist bumble bee and chicken of the sea brands will save some 
of the estimated 100000 dolphins that die annually in huge nets 
used to catch schools of tuna 
starkist seafood co said thursday it will not purchase any 
tuna caught in association with dolphins and will sell only 
dolphinfree tuna 
the action was taken in recognition of increased consumer 
concern for the environment and because the greatest concern in 
the tuna industry is dolphin mortality said anthony af 
oreilly president of the hj heinz co which owns starkist 
starkist has a 35 percent share of the us tuna market and is 
the worlds largest tuna canner the change could cost consumers 
a couple or more cents per can oreilly said 
bumble bee seafoods inc a chief competitor followed suit a 
few hours later saying it would now implement its plan to end the 
purchase of tuna caught in association with dolphin 
our tuna cans will begin to reflect the dolphinsafe label in 
us stores within the next three months the statement said 
van kamp seafood of st louis seller of chicken of the sea 
brand said it would discontinue buying tuna caught in 
association with dolphins according to a statement from jose e 
munoz jr company president 
to do this we are asking our few existing contract vessels to 
relocate their operations to the western pacific where the dolphin 
mortality problem does not exist munoz said 
leslie scheele of the environmental group greenpeace which 
backs a worldwide boycott of tuna caught with nets said the action 
could finally end the killing of dolphins by tuna nets forever 
others are going to have to follow suit 
sen joseph biden ddel who is sponsoring legislation to 
require canners to label tuna that is caught by nets that ensnare 
dolphins said the announcement made starkist not only the 
largest but the most enlightened tuna canner in the world 
now charlie the tuna has a reason to smile said rep 
barbara boxer dcalif author of the dolphin protection consumer 
information act of 1990 in a statement read by biden charlie the 
tuna is an animated character used in starkist advertisements 
i think it means defining a new corporate ethics for the 90s 
in america said sam labudde a biologist who gained prominence 
in 1987 when he sailed for five months undercover as a crewman 
aboard a foreign fishing boat he brought back graphic film footage 
of dolphin kills during tuna catches 
however the american tunaboat association criticized the new 
policy as politically and marketing motivated 
august felando ata president said the move was devastating 
for the us tuna fleet basically we have now lost our market 
the eastern pacific is the most productive area in the world for 
yellowfin tuna fishing and its our traditional grounds he said 
us boats will be forced to other fisheries or even go 
out of business while foreign boats will sell their tuna to 
nonus buyers felando added 
starkists new policy was aimed at purse seine net fishing in 
the eastern pacific ocean because it is the only fishery where 
dolphin swim with tuna the nets are intentionally dropped below 
schools of dolphins to capture the tuna underneath when a 
drawstring is pulled to close the net 
but the company said it also would continue to refuse to buy 
fish caught anywhere with gill or driftnets 
gill or driftnets are set on the water overnight and trap 
anything fish birds and other marine life that enters the area 
covered by the net 
experts say most of the approximately 2 million tons of tuna 
caught worldwide each year is caught in purse sein nets without 
snaring dolphins ten percent is caught using driftnets or 
encircling dolphins in purse sein nets 
the united states the only country that regulates dolphin 
mortality in connection with fishing allows a maximum of 20500 
deaths and stations observers on board all usflagged vessels to 
verify the number of deaths

wool and mohair producers are collecting 100 
million in support payments under a controversial program critics 
say should be revised or scrapped 
others contend the national wool act of 1954 has stemmed the 
downward plunge in us wool production and has helped keep 
thousands of small producers in business by providing payments when 
market prices are low 
the agriculture department announced thursday that the 100 
million in payments for 1989 which are to begin immediately will 
be split equally between wool and mohair producers 
last years federal support level for shorn wool was 177 per 
pound but the national average market price was only 124 per 
pound mohair supports were set at nearly 459 per pound while 
the 1989 average market price was 158 per pound 
the usda announcement on wool and mohair subsidies followed a 
report this week by the general accounting office urging that the 
congress should consider the need for the wool and mohair program 
as lawmakers draft the 1990 farm bill 
since price supports for wool and mohair were established in 
1954 federal subsidies to producers have totaled about 2 billion 
the gao said 
when congress wrote the law wool was considered a strategic 
material required for national security it has not been classified 
as such since 1960 said the gao the investigative arm of congress 
one of the objectives was to encourage the production of wool in 
such a way as to assure a viable domestic industry the report 
said 
although mohair which is clipped from angora goats was not 
included in the wool programs broad objectives the law also 
includes mohair in its payment provisions 
the gao reported in 1982 that despite subsidies us wool 
production has continued to decline and the new report which was 
prepared at the request of rep charles e schumer dny said 
those findings are still valid 
from 1981 through 1988 about 665 million in wool payments 
were made the report said during this period domestic wool 
production continued its morethan30year decline from 110 
million pounds in 1981 to 89 million pounds in 1988 
but the gao acknowledged that studies by the industry and others 
show that wool payments have provided income assurance to 
producers have had a stabilizing effect on the industry and have 
helped slow the decline in us wool production 
even so gao estimated that in 1988 the additional output of 
wool attributable to the program cost taxpayers 304 per pound 
while the average market price of wool produced that year was only 
138 per pound 
the report said that usda wool payments in 1986 the most 
recent year available to investigators totaled 104 million and 
were made to 125378 producers 
of the total 51868 payments were less than 100 each 
representing more than 41 percent of the total more than 102000 
were less than 500 each representing almost 82 percent of the 
1986 total 
but in dollars those 500orless payments made up only 134 
percent of the 104 million total the biggest category for payment 
size was in the 1000to25000 range in which 12209 producers 
collected 485 million or about 47 percent of the years total 
payments of more than 25000 went to 673 producers who got 
344 million or 33 percent of the total 
although there was no comparable breakdown for mohair the gao 
report showed that mohair payments in 1986 totaled 427 million 
and have increased significantly since then 
in 1988 mohair producers collected 471 million compared with 
414 million for wool that was the first time since the program 
began that mohair payments exceeded wool subsidies 
the report said there are only about 12000 mohair producers 
roughly onetenth the number of wool producers and that their 
payments in 1988 averaged about 3925 each compared with 360 for 
wool 
most of the wool payments of less than 100 are concentrated in 
the midwest and the southwest the report said thus elimination 
of the program would affect producers in those areas more than 
others 
according to the director of the navajo wool and mohair 
marketing industry in shiprock nm an estimated 10000 to 15000 
sheep producers are located on the navajo reservation 
while not all of those producers receive wool program 
payments about 7000 to 10000 do and each maintains an average 
of about 20 sheep the report said the director said that 
about 90 percent of the participating producers receive wool 
payments of less than 100 each year 
most of these producers are in the four corners area of arizona 
new mexico utah and colorado and elimination of the small 
payments would likely have a detrimental effect on them the 
report said 
furthermore it added because most of the lamb meat 
produced is used by the navajos as a food source wool sales 
combine with the wool payments general provide the principal income 
derived from their sheep 
the gao also was told by a spokesman for the wool forum inc of 
henning minn that the small payments are a worthwhile 
investment in the wool industry of the future because many new 
producers are from nonfarm backgrounds and are reluctant to risk 
large investment because of their lack of experience 
in his opinion the wool program adds that little extra 
financial encouragement that makes these new producers go ahead 
with their investments the gao said

the veterans affairs department is moving to 
head off a loss of registered nurses with legislation that would 
bring their pay in line with what nurses elsewhere receive 
by introducing its bill this week the va also is moving the 
bush administration closer to embracing competitive pay for all 
government employees 
federal agencies have been looking at competitive or locality 
pay as a means of recruiting and keeping workers 
competitive pay bases salaries on current rates paid in a 
community for comparable positions the federal office of personnel 
management has proposed a system that includes adjustments for 
local pay but also for certain employees links pay raises to job 
performance 
the house and senate veterans affairs committees have separate 
proposals for raising nursing pay as well 
under the new bill a va hospital nursing home or other 
facility would be able to use pay data from nonva facilities in an 
area to establish community rates the community rates would be 
paid only if those local rates exceed the national pay scale for va 
nurses 
the va employs 35000 registered nurses at its hospitals 
clinics and nursing homes making it the largest such employer in 
the country 
the nationally set base pay for a va registered nurse is 
18174 the american nurses association says the national average 
starting pay for a registered nurse is 25261 
the va already has been able to adjust pay to meet local rates 
but the process is so slow that the agencys salary levels still 
fall behind those of private employers 
the department was paying special rates at 130 of its 172 
medical centers a year ago veterans affairs secretary edward j 
derwinski said in a letter accompanying his legislative proposal 
even with the special rates va has not been able to offer 
competitive salaries at certain geographic locations such as 
boston southern california and new york city derwinski said

east germanys first freely elected 
government is destined to become a historical footnote a 
negotiating team chosen by voters to dissolve their country 
parliaments decision to put in power the government of prime 
minister lothar de maiziere was not contingent on a vision for east 
germanys future but a blueprint for its demise 
de maiziere who managed to build a coalition government 
encompassing most of the major political factions has but one 
mandate lead east germany to a merger with west germany 
but his decision to cobble together a united front of 
wideranging opinions was a masterstroke that may give west germany 
less room to dictate the terms and timing of unification 
as the diverse composition of de maizieres government 
indicates no longer is the infant known as east german democracy 
willing to toddle into the waiting arms of the west german 
fatherland without asking for a bigger allowance 
de maiziere and his christian democrat coalition which finished 
ahead in east germanys first free elections on march 18 have kept 
their promise to voters to seek unification as quickly as possible 
but on thursday they joined with the leftleaning social 
democrats in a broad coalition government that will present a 
united east german front at the negotiating table 
the very existence of the coalition acknowledges a growing fear 
among east germans who once starstruck by the prospect of sharing 
west german wealth are now grappling with the reality of 
abandoning a vast welfare system for the wilds of the free market 
de maiziere already has begun distancing himself somewhat from 
his political mentor west german chancellor helmut kohl 
he assumed a tougher negotiating posture just hours after 
parliament named him prime minister saying on west german 
television that unification may not come next year as kohl has 
said 
he said he wants to make sure east germans dependent on heavy 
social benefits are not disadvantaged by the process 
he even portrayed east germany as the proverbial david to west 
germanys goliath 
the 50yearold lawyer and former viola player presented an 
image far different from the man who campaigned across the east 
german countryside this year with kohl willingly giving center 
stage to the west german chancellor 
the wideranging agreement on which de maiziere has built his 
coalition still includes major points the bonn government is 
demanding 
it says that the countries must be merged en masse not one east 
german state at a time and that a united germany should remain 
part of nato it also says the monetary systems must be merged by 
july 1 as kohl has demanded 
but it also includes many of the demands of east germanys 
social democrats who have close ties to kohls main opposition 
the west german social democrats 
the east german agreement demands east germans accustomed to 
cheap food cheap homes and government jobs receive broad housing 
and employment guarantees 
it also demands most east german marks be traded at a 11 
exchange rate when the currencies are merged rather than the 21 
rate recommended by the west german central bank 
even the commitment to nato membership hedges the accord says 
membership should be temporary and nato troops should not be based 
in what is now east germany a nod to the soviets who want a 
neutral germany 
the coalition agreement also declares that germany should not 
seek to reclaim former german lands ceded to poland after world war 
ii 
that is something kohl has not been willing to guarantee as he 
courts archconservatives before west german elections in december 
he is likely to face a stiff challenge from the west german social 
democrats 
de maiziere has had to fight the perception he is a puppet of 
kohl and his tough comments may just be prenegotiation bombast 
and political expediency aimed at calming the fears of an 
increasingly worried populace 
but by forging a coalition with the social democrats de 
maiziere has made a break with bonn and acknowledged a growing fear 
that east germans could become a secondclass tier of a new german 
society 
now kohl may have to try to cut a deal with his own social 
democrats when he negotiates with the east germans 
neither west german party wants to alienate west german voters 
who fear higher taxes and interest rates and deflated buying power 
as they bail out the doddering east german economy 
de maiziere meanwhile can head to the bargaining table knowing 
that while unification is inevitable the price just may be 
negotiable

millions of americans havent sent back their 
census forms millions of others didnt get forms in the first 
place local governments are suing the census bureau 
all in all the 1990 national head count is off to a rough start 
years went into the planning before roughly 100 million census 
forms were sent to households at the end of march 
promptly things started to go wrong 
forms began pouring into the bureaus jeffersonville ind 
clearinghouse but they werent completed responses from citizens 
they were undeliverable forms being returned by the post office 
census director barbara bryant estimated thursday that between 4 
million and 45 million forms were undeliverable for various 
reasons largely incorrect addresses 
that is being fixed by sending out workers to handdeliver 
forms she said 
but even many of those who received their forms havent 
cooperated bryant said pleading with those who havent filled 
them out and mailed them back to do it now 
if the response doesnt pick up she said the price of taking 
the count could escalate by 80 million 
bryant said that so far only 57 percent of the forms delivered 
to american homes have been returned 
at that rate she said the total will be only 62 percent by the 
time the bureau starts sending workers out to count those who 
havent answered starting before the end of april 
officials had hoped to get back 70 percent of the forms and 
bryant said counting people on the doorstep will cost an extra 
10 million for each percentage point below that level the census 
already is expected to cost 25 billion 
wisconsin is leading the states with a 734 percent return rate 
while alaska is last at 442 percent she said 
among major cities indianapolis has a relatively high 667 
percent return rate and boston only 417 percent 
others include new york atlanta 572 percent chicago 493 
dallas 535 denver 559 detroit 537 kansas city 511 los 
angeles 515 memphis 582 minneapolisst paul 628 new 
orleans 443 new york 469 philadelphia 526 phoenix 460 
and seattle 574 
the lagging response is only the most recent problem facing the 
nations 21st national head count 
addressing trouble meant that 4 million to 45 million people 
failed to get forms at all a difficulty bryant said is being 
handled by handdelivery of forms that is still less than the 5 
percent to 6 percent rate of nondeliverable mail sent out by 
commercial firms she said 
several local governments announced wednesday that they were 
filing suit charging that the results whatever they are will 
be unfair 
census figures are used to distribute seats in the house of 
representatives and to allocate billions of dollars in federal 
funds 
the cities and other local governments that sued contended their 
residents will not be fully counted resulting in a loss of 
representation and money 
new york city was joined in the suit by chicago los angeles 
houston and dade county fla as well as the state of california 
the us conference of mayors the naacp and the league of united 
latin american citizens 
among the reported problems 
more than 100000 forms in san antonio and south texas couldnt 
be delivered because of incorrect addresses said sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas who also complained of a shortage of 
spanishlanguage forms 
in many communities like ross calif that still get their 
mail in post office boxes the census forms had only street 
addresses so the post office returned them 
in new york city forms sent to some giant apartment buildings 
failed to include apartment numbers without the numbers mailmen 
couldnt deliver them to the residents some forms were reportedly 
left in lobbies 
in los angeles city attorney james hahn estimated that the 
bureau had missed entire city blocks and apartment complexes with 
up to 70000 forms being sent back because of wrong addresses 
tollfree phone lines for people to call in were jammed and had 
to be expanded last week

former gov arch a moore a republican 
who served three terms in a heavily democratic state could serve 
up to 36 years in prison for kickbacks coverups and other crimes 
committed in his last term and two campaigns 
his democratic successor gov gaston caperton said moores 
decision thursday to plead guilty to five federal charges helps 
explain the states current severe financial woes 
i am confident that west virginians will realize that not only 
did i inherit a government that was financially bankrupt but 
ethically bankrupt as well caperton said 
this is a tragic day for west virginia caperton added 
a grand jury indicted moore on thursday and he signed a plea 
agreement later in the day us attorney michael carey said he 
said moore had agreed to help prosecutors in other unspecified 
corruption probes 
moore the charismatic silverhaired patriarch of the state 
gop admitted to extortion mail and tax fraud to get elected in 
1984 during his term as governor and in his unsuccessful 1988 
reelection campaign carey said 
moore also admitted blocking a federal grand jury investigation 
of him during 1989 and 1990 
this news will be greeted with a great joy by some in the 
state of west virginia moore said in a statement there will 
be others who will be sincerely grieved by reason of their devotion 
to me and my family i know i have their understanding and love 
moore who turns 67 on monday faces up to 36 years in prison 
and 125 million in fines carey said moore should appear in court 
within two weeks 
many west virginia politicians have either become involved in 
corruption scandals or resigned recently since december 1988 a 
state attorney general a state treasurer two state senate 
presidents a senate majority leader a top aide to a senate 
president a house member and two lobbyists have lost their jobs 
it is the second time moore has been indicted by a federal grand 
jury for alleged wrongdoing in office 
moore was governor from 1969 to 1977 but was constitutionally 
barred from seeking a third consecutive term he and his 1972 
campaign manager were indicted in december 1975 on a charge of 
extorting 25000 from a businessman seeking a state charter for a 
new bank both were acquitted in 1976 
the indictment said moore used his position to extort 573721 
in october 1985 from maben energy corp of beckley a coal mining 
and processing company and h paul kizer the companys chairman 
moore allegedly agreed to help kizer and maben energy receive a 
refund of more than 2 million from the states black lung fund 
which provides benefits to coal miners with the respiratory 
disease in return moore received a 25 percent kickback the 
indictment said 
it said moore created fake backdated documents purporting to be 
legitimate contingent fee legal agreements to cover up the 
extortion 
the indictment also said moore filed false federal income tax 
returns for 1984 and 1985 failing to report 72500 in income and 
that he defrauded the state of his salary and benefits by funneling 
about 100000 into his 1984 campaign fund 
it said moore committed the crimes to influence votes and win 
the governors race 
moore also agreed to plead guilty to one count of obstruction of 
justice the indictment said he falsified documents tried to 
persuade witnesses to lie to a grand jury and lied in an interview 
with federal investigators 
in early january 1990 moore met with former aide and 1988 
campaign manager john leaberry unknown to moore his meeting 
with leaberry was recorded carey said 
moore allegedly told leaberry that he had received and used 
illegal cash in the 1988 campaign and told leaberry how they would 
both falsely deny the existence of the cash the prosecutor said 
moore first was elected to the house of delegates in 1952 he 
won a seat in the us house in 1956 serving six twoyear terms 
before his first gubernatorial bid in 1968

once barred by the communists from a 
highschool diploma markus meckel worked as a janitor and read 
nietzsche to pass the time now the 37yearold east german is 
europes youngest foreign minister 
the lumbering bearded lutheran church pastor in many ways 
symbolizes the changes that thrust some of the countrys political 
outcasts into power after last years revolution 
just days before east germanys historic elections on march 18 
reporters could easily find meckel dressed in baggy trousers and 
an outdoorsmans ribbed sweater for a chat about communisms 
demise 
more recently the foreign minister who now sports a 
chalkstriped suit has dealt with journalists peppering him with 
questions about the countrys headlong rush to german unification 
the democratically elected parliament approved meckel and the 
rest of prime minister lothar de maizieres cabinet late thursday 
difficult negotiations with us secretary of state james a 
baker iii soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and other 
leading diplomats are on meckels agenda 
the west german newspaper die welt says the dramatic changes in 
meckels life would have been difficult to even dream about 
weeks ago when he was still the secondranking official in the 
social democratic party 
meckel stepped into the leftleaning partys top spot on march 
26 after his predecessor ibrahim boehme was forced out by 
accusations he cooperated with the former secret police boehme and 
meckel helped found the party last year 
that left to meckel the difficult task of forming a coalition 
with the christian democrats while he and other party leaders were 
still reeling from the unexpected conservative romp at the polls 
last month 
meckel has one main goal speedy unification with west germany 
although he and others of the countrys young democratic leadership 
face an uncertain political future after the states are joined 
meckel was born aug 18 1952 near frankfurt an der oder along 
the polish border 
his resistance to the former hardline communist rulers kept him 
from a high school diploma so he took the path preferred by many 
likeminded young people he studied theology under the auspices of 
the relatively independent lutheran church from 1971 to 1978 
after finishing his training in berlin meckel worked as a 
janitor and caretaker for two years during that time he told 
reporters he avidly read two of the major german philosophers 
as a janitor he read hegel and nietzsche now he can put his 
own ideas into practice wrote the berliner morgenpost newspaper 
meckel served as a church pastor in the northern village of 
vipperow from 1982 to 1988 more recently he has run an ecumenical 
meeting and education center in the western city of magdeburg 
he is married for the second time and has two children 
east germanys government continues to have close ties to the 
lutheran church which helped lead the nations peaceful revolution 
last year 
another lutheran pastor rainer eppelmann heads the disarmament 
and defense ministry

mary matalins home phone rang at a quarter to 
seven hey whats movin asked the familiar raspy voice 
calling from his new york hospital room lee atwater was hungry for 
the latest political news 
the early morning phone calls to the republican partys chief of 
staff arent likely to let up now that party chairman atwater is 
back home after 10 days in new york where he underwent treatment 
for a brain tumor 
not for two or three months will doctors know how effective the 
latest treatment was for the tumor described as aggressive and 
dangerous by dr paul kornblith 
experts at treating such tumors have said the fiveyear survival 
rate can range from 50 percent to as low as 10 percent depending 
on a range of characteristics 
kornblith who led the team that treated atwater at montefiore 
medical center in new york maintained a firmly optimistic attitude 
hes in fighting trim and ready to fight the wars of his 
profession kornblith said thursday shortly before releasing 
atwater from the hospital 
the doctor predicted the gop chairman would resume working to 
some degree probably next week 
atwater aides and friends described him as maintaining his 
interest in political developments even while hospitalized 
matalin said the early morning call from atwater was typical and 
that they talked up to six times a day the party chairman was 
eager to get the latest news of the vicious gubernatorial primary 
between texas democrats or the developments in florida where former 
democrat lawton chiles was rumored to be planning a challenge to 
republican gov bob martinez the former senator entered the race 
on thursday 
invariably atwater would start the conversation by asking 
whats moving she said his way of asking what was happening 
there also were the calls from president bush and donald trump 
the book from richard m nixon the visits from cabinet members 
like treasury secretary nicholas brady and commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher 
nixon sent atwater a copy of his new book in the arena it 
was inscribed to lee atwater i cant think of anyone id rather 
be in the arena with 
while atwater was in the hospital the rhythm and blues album on 
which he plays guitar and sings with such stars as bb king isaac 
hayes and billy preston reached stores in the nations capital it 
quickly sold out 
sally atwater was due to give birth to the couples third child 
atwaters ordeal began march 6 when he collapsed during a speech 
at a political breakfast doctors at george washington university 
medical center found a small tumor on the right frontal lobe of his 
brain an astrocytoma which they said was nonmalignant and could 
easily be treated by radiation 
that early diagnosis proved overly optimistic the tumor grew 
and the effect was felt on atwaters left side 
the 39yearold party chairman appeared at the white house with 
clayton williams immediately after williams won the republican 
nomination for governor of texas 
when they came out of the west wing reporters were startled by 
atwaters appearance he was pale and was dragging his left foot 
asked about the daily radiation treatments he was receiving 
atwater said he felt like doctors were putting me in a xerox 
machine 
within days he was back in the hospital aides said he was 
suffering from an imbalance in medication he was receiving to 
prevent seizures and combat nausea from the radiation treatments 
a week later he flew to new york to go under kornbliths care 
matalin conceded the daily radiation treatments were not a 
good procedure it just didnt match his personality it was too 
slow a process for him 
kornblith implanted radioactive isotopes directly into the 
tumor for five days the isotopes bombarded the cancerous tissue 
with radiation 
atwater could receive visitors but they had to stand behind a 
lead shield 
after the isotopes were removed kornblith followed up with 
chemotherapy designed to kill any tumor cells on the periphery of 
the growth atwater will receive additional doses every six weeks 
if the combination of treatments succeeds in killing the tumor 
described as olivesize it will stop growing either it shrinks 
or stays the same said kornblith 
in that case he said it was unlikely surgery would be needed to 
remove the dead tissue 
unless it causes lots of swelling in the brain which so far 
it hasnt wed just leave it alone and eventually the body would 
absorb it said the doctor

the political paralysis in israel and the 
muscleflexing of iraqi president saddam hussein are the latest 
examples of how limited us influence really is in the middle east 
despite an annual us aid outlay of 3 billion the bush 
administration cannot steer israelis into choosing a government 
responsive to the us landforpeace formula 
and despite the purchase of about 2 billion a year in iraqi oil 
and support for bank loans for baghdad the administration cannot 
deter saddam hussein from stockpiling dangerous weapons and 
threatening to wipe out half of israel with poison gas if it 
attacks 
israels political problems evidently are impervious to outside 
pressure while iraqs drive for prominence in the arab world is 
not going to slow down just to please the united states 
the upshot is no negotiations for the indefinite future between 
israel and palestinian arabs and frayed nerves as the militant 
iraqi leader bids for leadership in the arab world and gains 
support from such reputed moderates as king hussein of jordan and 
president hosni mubarak of egypt 
iraq is not a country which wants or calls for war mubarak 
said after showing support for saddam hussein last weekend with a 
visit to iraq the jordanian king registered similar sentiments in 
aqaba 
free in offering political advice to the soviet union to latin 
america and to south africa among others the state department is 
holding its tongue about the situation in israel 
clearly shimon peres the leader of the labor party is far 
more likely than yitzhak shamir of likud to go along with secretary 
of state james a baker iii and hold talks with palestinians in 
cairo 
but the state department kept quiet after the defection of two 
religious members of parliament on wednesday stopped peres from 
putting together a coalition government 
spokesman richard boucher was instructed to say nothing even 
about suggestions that israel reform its political procedures to 
prevent minority blocs from controlling the balance of power 
its a matter for them to decide boucher said 
on iraq the state department is a little more voluble but 
again without any apparent effect 
the department called thursday for a halt to the development and 
production of biological weapons amid reports iraq is acquiring the 
capability to wage this particularly horrible form of warfare 
but boucher would not confirm reports that iraq is in fact 
building a stockpile of biological weapons he said that would 
involve disclosing the extent of us intelligence efforts 
in general the united states is very concerned about the 
spread of this particularly horrible form of warfare in the 
world boucher said we do believe some nations are at work on 
a biological weapons capability 
the political deadlock in israel and the growing military might 
of iraq are beyond the range of us influence largely because they 
are based on strong domestic and political considerations 
roughly half of the israeli parliament reflecting anxieties of 
a large percentage of the populace is unwilling to set up a 
government that would surrender control of the west bank and gaza 
to palestinian arabs 
so peres who would give up the land is unable to muster a 
majority to form a government and the bush administration is 
powerless to help him in fact any signal that the state 
department prefers him to shamir could boomerang israel like most 
small countries does not respond happily to bigpower pressure 
saddam hussein meanwhile is driven partly by hostility to 
israel and to iran he has not accepted the idea of a jewish state 
in the middle east at least one that controls the west bank and 
gaza and he has felt the sting of israel which destroyed iraqs 
nuclear reactor outside baghdad in 1981 
for eight years iraq fought a bloody war with the 
fundamentalist shiite regime in iran losing an estimated 300000 
to 400000 men until the united nations arranged a ceasefire 
american warships guided iraqi oil through the persian gulf 
during the war but that tilt was a minor event in baghdads view 
of the world

the defense department estimates that the 
price tag for bringing 95 major weapons programs from design to 
full production is 8438 billion 31 billion more than 
projections made three months earlier 
in issuing its report thursday the pentagon blamed the 
significant jump in the last quarter of 1989 on revised inflation 
rates and a slight increase in the number of missiles aircraft and 
other weapons president bush sought 
among the major increases were the estimated costs for the 
landbased midgetman nuclear missile the c17 cargo plane and the 
ddg51 destroyer the pentagon is reconsidering the latter two 
programs 
the socalled selected acquisition report provides a 
snapshot as of last dec 31 of expected overall costs for 95 
major weapons systems if bushs defense budget is enacted as 
proposed 
however the overall estimate may change because congress or 
defense secretary dick cheney may limit production on or terminate 
some weapons systems including several under review 
the previous report released in september predicted the 
overall cost of the major systems would be 8066 billion 
the difference in the two figures is 372 billion which 
includes the 31 billion increase and an estimate of 62 billion 
for the navys fixed distributed system a classified ocean 
surveillance project 
among the estimated increases was the cost of the midgetman 
missile which rose 19 billion or 35 percent to 73 billion 
the pentagon said the jump was primarily the result of restoring 
costs expected all along but excluded last year because of the way 
bush and congress handled the missile program in the current 
defense budget 
the fiscal 1990 budget contains less than 250 million for the 
mobile singlewarhead missile with those funds the midgetman 
program amounted to a research and development project the 
pentagon said 
this is a reinstatement of the costs said roy lietza a 
spokesman for the air force 
among the increased costs for the midgetman are 13 billion for 
the missile and its basing with a goal of initial operation in 
1997 458 million for six additional research and development 
missiles and 87 million for inflation 
the estimated cost of the multiplewarhead mx nuclear missile 
dropped 39 billion from 23 billion primarily because of a 
reduction in the number of planned missiles from 255 to 193 the 
drop was partially offset by revised inflation rates with an 
estimated increase of 236 million 
the estimates consist of the annual costs of research and 
development purchase of the weapon itself and associated 
construction added together for the several years each weapon will 
be bought sometimes extending into the next century cost of 
operations such as fuel and crew wages are not included 
the arleigh burkeclass destroyer or ddg51 increased 4 
billion from a previous estimate of 28 billion the navy cited an 
increase in the number of ships from 33 to 38 and revised inflation 
rates as the reasons for the 15 percent jump 
the other navy program the defense secretary may curtail the 
ssn21 seawolf attack submarine dropped in estimated cost from 
20 billion to 16 billion because of a decrease in the number of 
submarines from 12 to nine 
the estimated cost of the c17 cargo plane increased 44 
billion from a previous price of 374 billion the air force 
blamed the rise on inflation and schedule changes due to plans to 
stretch out the program 
slower production rates frequently raise total costs by reducing 
production efficiency 
one of the largest increases in army programs was in the medium 
tactical vehicles in which the estimated cost jumped from 86 
billion to 161 billion or 88 percent 
the army attributed the rise to an increase in the number of 
trucks from 79157 to 102322 an extension of the modernization 
program from 15 to 30 years schedule changes and inflation 
the estimated cost of the m1 tank program which cheney has 
proposed canceling in the budget for the fiscal year beginning oct 
1 dropped 6 billion due to a decrease in the number of tanks

an iowa environmental official says hes 
waiting for a federal agency to accept its moral responsibility 
for selling off 12755 bushels of corn it knew was contaminated 
with a deadly toxin 
the mound of grain is believed to have the highest concentration 
of cancercausing aflatoxin ever found in this country as much as 
1600 times the maximum allowable limit for human consumption 
state and federal officials say 
an order thursday from the iowa division of environmental 
protection gave the farmers home administration and the pruess 
elevator co of lowden until april 20 to remove the corn and held 
them equally liable 
but a lawyer representing the fmha which sold the grain from a 
foreclosed farm at chouteau okla and knew it was tainted 
insisted the agency has no responsibility the owner of the 
elevator harlan pruess who bought the corn declined comment 
the corn has been placed under quarantine in a sparsely settled 
area three miles from lowden in eastern iowa 
whatever is going to be done is not going to be cheap said 
allan stokes director of the state environmental agency were 
waiting to see if they the fmha will accept their moral 
responsibility 
stokes estimated the cleanup cost at around 100000 while 
iowas secretary of agriculture dale cochran has placed it as 
high as 15 million the fmha sold the corn for 9566 
if the deadline is not met the state could clean up the grain 
and then sue the fmha and the elevator stokes said 
aflatoxins are chemical substances produced by certain soil 
fungi the food and drug administration says aflatoxin 
concentrations above 20 parts per billion are unsuitable for human 
consumption and concentrations above 300 parts per billion are 
unsuitable for animal feed 
fda tests of the corn found concentrations as high as 32300 
parts per billion in one sample in its bill of sale the fmha 
disclosed that the corn contained aflatoxin concentrations greater 
than 5000 parts per billion and assigned any liability to the 
purchaser 
robert bird a us department of agriculture attorney 
representing the fmha said i dont see how the state of iowa 
could hold the fmha coresponsible because the fmha has no 
ownership interest 
the fda and the oklahoma department of agriculture both knew in 
advance of the intended sale and if either told the fmha to 
destroy the corn the fmha would do it bird said 
gary dean director of compliance at the fdas regional office 
at kansas city said the correspondence between the fda and 
oklahoma department of agriculture advised the fmha of the 
guidelines he said the fda could not become involved until there 
was an interstate shipment 
under federal law contaminated grain cannot be moved from one 
state to another 
oklahoma officials notified counterparts in iowa once tests 
disclosed the aflatoxin concentrations in the early march shipment 
from the foreclosed farm and iowa inspectors were on hand to 
quarantine the corn as it arrived 
their action prevented the grain from being fed to animals or 
winding up in milk or meat products but inhaling dust from the 
corn could prove a health risk and state officials are in no rush 
to disturb the pile until they have an acceptable cleanup plan 
aflatoxin is produced by two soil fungi aspergillus flavus and 
a parasiticus state officials said they believe the toxin 
flourished because the corn was unusually moist when harvested and 
became heated as it dried

government plans to borrow 453 billion this 
quarter could unsettle debt markets but they are a welcome sign 
the bush administration plans to speed up its savings and loan 
bailout analysts say 
the resolution trust corp oversight board the treasury 
departmentled panel that controls the policy and purse strings of 
the program announced bailout borrowing plans for the apriljune 
quarter on thursday 
the amount authorized is more than four times larger than the 
11 billion authorized in the januarymarch period 
these are enormous numbers but i think its a very good 
sign said bert ely an sampl analyst in alexandria va for the 
first time the government is finally putting realistic amounts 
of money on the table to get this cleanup process moving 
the administration will raise the money by auctioning shortterm 
treasury bills or notes its to be repaid when the government 
sells the real estate and other assets owned by failed sampls 
economists caution that government debt buyers may have a hard 
time absorbing the heavy borrowing and that shortterm interest 
rates may rise slightly as a result 
but they said the plans come at a good time usually 
government borrowing needs are lighter in the quarter because of 
income tax collections 
treasury traditionally allows its cash balance to rise 
rapidly between april and june what it will do this time is not 
allow that balance to rise as much said economist samuel d 
kahan of fuji securities inc 
the administration has been under pressure from congress and 
private critics to speed up the closing and sale of insolvent 
thrift associations which are losing 29 million a day 
regulators have disposed of only 52 thrifts out of the slightly 
more than 400 sampls seized since early last year however theyve 
announced plans to sell or close 141 by the end of june currently 
they are marketing 87 to 1000 prospective buyers 
in order to attract buyers the resolution trust corp recently 
relaxed its standards to give sampl purchasers as long as 18 months 
to return bad assets such as sour loans to the government the 
previous deadline of six months was thought to discourage many 
potential buyers 
but as a result of the new policy the government will be 
holding more sampl assets after it sells institutions 
ely estimated that the sampl buyers will get about 1 in assets 
and 2 in government cash for every 3 in deposits they agree to 
take 
my hope is theyll keep it rolling ely said 
the question is why now he said i think the bush 
administration is really starting to worry the whole sampl mess 
will quickly turn into a political disaster

their souls but the jury rejected lists defense that he was 
innocent because of his mental condition 
the jury also turned down defense attorney elijah l miller

charles h keating is depicting himself as a 
victim of a vendetta by traditional savings and loan operators and 
regulators who wanted government controls clamped back on the

loan association to finance his multibilliondollar hotel real 
estate stock and junk bond empire incurred the wrath of thentop 
sampl regulator edwin gray and the us league of savings 
institutions the industrys biggest trade group 
ultimately keating told us district judge stanley sporkin it 
was the son of the leagues president a top official for the

regulators claim that through fraud and racketeering keating 
and his associates looted irvine califbased lincoln of federally 
insured deposits that ultimately will cost taxpayers up to 2 
billion to repay 
keating cited documents news articles and letters that quoted 
gray the bank boards former chairman and thenleague president 
william b oconnell as criticizing him harshly years before 
it became a personal vendetta in my opinion keating said 
testifying for a sixth day on his suit challenging the seizure of 
lincoln 
keating said gray and oconnell used him as a stalking horse 
to justify the reregulation of the sampl industry by the bank board 
in 1985 after its deregulation by congress two years earlier 
i had a high visibility because i had taken a staid sampl 
namely lincoln and proceeded to invest in opportunities that were 
not compatible with the historic role of home financing but 
in conformance with california and federal law were compatible 
with the regulations he testified 
sporkin who has presided over 23 days of hearings on keatings 
suit asked if william oconnell was related to kevin oconnell 
who as the official assigned by the bank board in 1988 to supervise 
the regulation of lincoln is the governments chief witness 
we found out in 1988 that this oconnell is that oconnells 
son keating responded nodding in the direction of kevin 
oconnell who has sat government attorneys through much of the 
hearing 
keating said his aides on several occasions asked kevin 
oconnells supervisors to remove him from lincolns case but were 
told that the bank board had no one else who could handle it he 
said the requests were made before he knew the two oconnells were 
related 
keating pointed to a bank board memo dated april 7 1989 seven 
days before the government seized control of lincoln from kevin 
oconnell to alvin smuzynski deputy director of the bank boards 
office of regulatory activities 
even our lawyers are finally getting the message oconnell 
said in the memo under every document is another scam and they 
seem to finally understand what type of thieves we are dealing with 
and why we need to get them out 
in an accompanying memo oconnell said that just one day 
earlier april 6 40 million was removed from lincoln 
subsidiaries despite a december 1988 directive from regulators not 
to engage in transactions above 10 million without notifying them 
asked by reporters about the memo during a break in the hearing 
oconnell said they are selfexplanatory 
keating defended the april 6 transaction saying the money was 
noninsured deposits that he ordered transferred to bankers trust 
a major money center bank in new york 
theres no difference for those assets except now they are 
deposited in bankers trust instead of lincoln he said we were 
concerned they wanted to take over lincoln we moved the deposits 
to another institution where it wouldnt be so easy for them 
regulators to freeze them 
government attorney james murphy objected several times to 
keatings testimony as irrelevant to the grounds for the takeover 
that lincoln was being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner in 
violation of the law 
i want to give mr keating a chance to present his position 
sporkin said overruling the objections its his lawsuit that 
the purported reasons are masking the real reasons which was a 
vendetta of some kind

large crowds visiting a museum being 
prosecuted for showing sexually graphic photographs reveal that for 
many residents this citys cleancut conservative reputation is 
an unwanted burden 
city police last week charged the contemporary arts center and 
its director with pandering obscenity and other charges when the 
museum opened an exhibit by the late robert mapplethorpe 
the charges seemed characteristic of a city that gained its prim 
reputation by closing all of its adult bookstores banning the sale 
or lease of xrated videos and starting one of the first citizens 
antipornography groups the city is also a center for the 
righttolife movement 
cincinnati is a conservative town we dont have a district 
with a lot of streetwalkers and nude shows and i dont think 
its the appropriate thing said fred lohman a retired 
controller for a tailoring company im not for censorship but i 
am for morality 
but while antipornography advocates have attended rallies 
against the exhibit open pending a court ruling more than 14000 
people have lined up to see the 175photograph exhibit since it 
opened last friday the museums list of duespaying patrons has 
increased from 1600 to 2300 in two weeks 
i think the people in cincinnati are like people in any 
city said todd kamm a social worker and artist its just 
that the people in power in the county are pretty archaic 
a researcher who surveyed local attitudes in 1988 says 
antiabortion and antipornography groups are led by talented 
conservative leaders who happen to live in the city 
cincinnati is no more conservative than the rest of the 
nation says al tuchfarber director of the university of 
cincinnatis institute for policy research 
tuchfarber says antipornography groups draw much of their 
strength from the traditionally workingclass roman catholic west 
side of the city which he said is slightly more conservative than 
the east side 
the city of 370000 is home to dr john willke president of 
national right to life and the rev jerry kirk founder of the 
national coalition against pornography phoenix financier charles 
h keating jr grew up in cincinnati and founded the 
antipornography group citizens for decency through law 
in 1977 a cincinnati jury convicted hustler magazine publisher 
larry flynt of pandering obscenity a state appeals court in 1979 
ordered a new trial but charges were dropped in 1985 
the mapplethorpe exhibit appeared in philadelphia washington 
dc chicago hartford conn and berkeley calif without 
attracting criminal charges 
but police and a grand jury raided the arts center the day after 
the show opened here and charged the center and its director 
dennis barrie with pandering obscenity and using children in 
nudityrelated material both misdemeanors 
a federal judge has barred local authorities from taking further 
action until the arraignment monday in hamilton county municipal 
court 
two pictures in the exhibit feature nude children and five 
depict sex acts if convicted barrie and the museum each would 
face fines of 6000 and barrie six months in jail 
the citys last public debate over art came after the 1988 
announcement of plans to erect sculptures of winged pigs to 
commemorate the cincinnatis history as a hogbutchering center 
the pigs eventually were unveiled in a city park although many 
argued they were ridiculous 
arts center visitor michael moore said the city is doing itself 
more harm than good by casting itself as a defender of outdated 
standards 
theyre pushing for corporations to locate here moore said 
i think if im the head of a corporation in new york or san 
francisco i could imagine my employees saying why do i want to 
go to cincinnati 
the chamber of commerce has spent 6 million since 1984 on its 
blue chip campaign to promote the citys cultural attractions 
and to cite economic reasons for companies to move to cincinnati 
the city however wont attract the new york citybased college 
art association national convention in 1995 the group told city 
officials it has dropped cincinnati from consideration because of 
the mapplethorpe dispute 
jane dieckmann a homemaker who is particularly outraged at the 
exhibits photograph of a seminude girl said prosecutors shouldnt 
worry about criticism in pressing charges against the museum 
i dont care what other cities think mrs dieckmann said 
ive seen what other cities are like and i dont think they have 
anything more than we have

the fbi is investigating residents 
of this coastal community after several unearthed millions of 
dollars believed hidden by drug traffickers and went on a buying 
binge the us attorney says 
us attorney daniel lopez romo said late thursday that the 
money was believed inside drums dug up two weeks ago in a farmers 
field in vega baja 35 miles northwest of san juan 
lopez said officials became suspicious after residents began 
buying luxury items with great sums of cash 
authorities found one drum with 15 million still inside but 
others had been emptied he said newspapers said between 10 and 11 
empty drums were found nearby 
so you can speculate that were talking about extraordinary 
amounts of money lopez said 
the fbi is interviewing a number of people to find out where 
the money came from and what legal action to take he said but 
we cant make anything public about the investigation 
newspapers reported residents were snapping up new houses 
boats cars and vcrs with the cash they said federal authorities 
descended on the town after a car mechanic paid 170000 cash for a 
house and a sports car and deposited 50000 cash in a bank 
lopez said the fbi interviewed several people and many local 
residents were returning goods bought with the found cash 
many also werent he said 
el vocero the tabloid that broke the story said the fbi had 
confiscated millions mostly in 100 and 20 bills from 
residents and from the drum recovered by agents 
vega baja a bustling community of 30000 nestled between a 
pristine beach overlooking the atlantic ocean and tropical hills 
was quiet thursday and few residents would talk about the money 
most said they didnt know anything about it 
city hall was closed and many shops shuttered their doors early 
in preparation for good friday parents took children to the beach 
and fishermen climbed atop coral hills to cast for red snapper 
if i found that money i wouldnt have touched it for anything 
in the world its dirty money thats for sure something real 
fishy about it said one woman who ran an outdoor cafe and gave 
her name only as carmen 
there was some confusion as to where the money had actually been 
buried many said the beach others said a field 
lopez said the location of the buried treasure couldnt be 
revealed because there would be a gold rush to the site 
we cant give that information we shouldnt and we wont 
he said 
the us attorney said it was a good bet the cash was drug 
trafficking money 
thats one of the strongest possibilities but i cant say 
with certainty he said its probable that somebody knew where 
it was buried and blew the whistle 
el vocero quoted unidentified sources as saying the puerto rico 
justice department had estimated up to 20 million may have been 
buried 
miguel rodriguez a police narcotics agent in vega baja said 
thursday a car and a motorcycle had been turned in to fbi agents 
investigating the case 
this is so confidential the fbi is not even telling us 
anything rodriguez said there is a report of lots of money 
floating around but we dont know from where 
the fbi office in the capital of san juan has refused to discuss 
the case until the investigation is completed because the 
caribbean island of puerto rico is a us commonwealth its 
investigatory matters come under federal jurisdiction 
under puerto rican law anyone who finds treasure on private 
property is entitled to half with the remainder going to the 
commonwealth 
but the fbi could invoke a federal law entitling the us 
government to confiscate funds tied to the illegal drug trade to 
pay for the costs of the investigation

harvard university president derek bok 
struck back at conservative critics of higher education saying 
problems stem from a decade of tax cuts and federal deficits rather 
than liberal education practices 
in his 19th annual report issued thursday bok warned that the 
criticism could end up hurting higher education 
conservatives who rose to prominence in the political climate of 
the 1980s saw universities as liberal strongholds populated by 
cocksure opinionated professors bok wrote in the 40page report 
these conservative critics have attacked higher education more 
savagely during the past 10 years than at any time in my memory 
bok said 
most of the charges are flawed because they ignore basic 
conflicts and contradictions in the demands society makes on 
universities he wrote 
continued criticism of this kind threatens to do needless 
damage to the public confidence so important to maintaining a 
strong system of colleges and universities 
what is needed is not an end to criticism but a criticism 
that is less given to rhetorical excess more careful with its 
criteria for judgment bok wrote 
bok addressed several areas of controversy including the 
conflict between teaching and research last month the faculty of 
harvard medical school approved a set of guidelines governing 
outside work for faculty members 
one signal comes from all the critics who deplore the neglect 
of teaching and the stress that universities place on published 
work bok said the other makes the opposite point through a 
system of powerful incentives and rewards that offers fame fortune 
and ample funding to successful scientists and scholars 
bok said teachers are not always motivated by private gain when 
undertaking outside pursuits and said that research usually 
benefits a university but bok did say schools need to delineate 
how much time can be spent on outside pursuits he said 
restrictions are inadequate at many institutions 
bok also decried what he called hostile publicity about 
rising tuition costs bok said most news reports about expensive 
tuition are focused on a few highpowered universities such as 
harvard stanford yale or princeton when in fact most 
undergraduates attend public universities where tuition is less 
than 2000 per year

the mayors of oakland and san francisco 
heaped scorn on the federal emergency management agency over its 
handling of housing relief for people left homeless after the 
october earthquake 
san francisco mayor art agnos accused the agency of behaving as 
if it were protecting the public treasury against the victims of 
the disaster in testifying thursday before the house subcommittee 
on housing and community development 
the 71magnitude quake that struck northern california on oct 
17 killed 67 people and did millions of dollars in property damage 
 
agnos and oakland mayor lionel wilson complained that the agency 
displayed arrogance and a lack of compassion toward people 
stunned and suddenly homeless 
alameda county supervisor don perata said im here to 
communicate a lot of anger a lot of frustration oakland has over 
the way fema has treated us if these people worked for me in 
alameda county they would be summarily dismissed 
there may be difficulties within a bureaucracy but there 
should be no excuse for treating people you are empowered to serve 
with disrespect callousness and as though they were the enemy 
seeking to come into your home in the dark of night to steal your 
silverware perata said 
one fema rule required that applicants had to have lived in a 
building at least 30 days to qualify for assistance wilson said 
those who live in a place for short periods then move on were the 
hardest hit he said 
only when fema was challenged by a lawsuit did fema agree to 
meet the needs of such persons an agreement which was not 
implemented in good faith said wilson pointing to a letter 
containing an official objection 
agnos suggested that house equity should be available as 
collateral for loans to repair damaged houses not just cash this 
would help retired people who own or have large equity in their 
homes but who havent got immediate cash resources to get the job 
done he said 
agnos also recommended that 44 million from the presidents 
discretionary fund be allocated to help rebuild affordable housing 
another 2200 rental assistance vouchers be provide until units are 
rebuilt and an extension of fema assistance 
lorri jean fema deputy regional director said the agency had 
been heavily burdened with hurricane hugo relief when the 
earthquake hit many agency members in her region already were 
committed to the hugo program she said 
it was necessary for fema to initiate a concentrated hiring 
and training program in order to meet the shortages of personnel 
she said 
the elected officials generally praised the actions of the 
federal housing and urban development agency red cross volunteers 
and the state department of housing and community development for 
their response to the disaster 
according to reports made to the association of bay area 
governments santa cruz county lost between 4000 and 5000 
dwellings some 3400 homes were lost or damaged in alameda county 
and more than 5000 units were damaged or destroyed in san 
francisco city and county 
local officials have said the need 3 billion in state and 
federal aid to recover from the earthquake figures on how much 
fema has spent werent available

the united states believes north korea has the 
facilities to build nuclear weapons but is not moving rapidly on 
the work says a senior pentagon official 
us officials have evidence the north koreans have built a 
reactor as well as a reprocessing facility to separate plutonium 
the material used to make nuclear weapons henry s rowen 
assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs 
said thursday 
i would not want to characterize it as a slow pace but a 
deliberate pace rowen told reporters at a news briefing in which 
he assessed north koreas work on manufacturing nuclear weapons 
however its not galloping ahead at a great rate its a 
concern to us and the japanese 
the pentagon official said the united states raised the issue of 
north koreas building nuclear weapons in talks in washington last 
weekend between secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
we hope that their influence would be enough to get it under 
control get at least inspectors in there preferably to end the 
whole thing end the separation business rowen said so far 
it hasnt borne fruit 
the united states hopes the soviet union would have some 
influence with the communist regime in north korea 
us officials have expressed concerns about the potential 
proliferation of nuclear weapons cia director william webster said 
in congressional testimony last year that 15 or more nations 
including many from the developing world could possess nuclear 
weapons early in the next century 
webster also has said that many developing countries are working 
on ballistic missiles which could be used to carry nuclear or 
other weapons to their targets 
five nations have said they have nuclear weapons the united 
states the soviet union china great britain and france india 
exploded a single atomic device in 1974 but said it was a 
nonmilitary explosion

the justice department is investigating charges 
that immigration guards beat and sexually harassed inmates at a 
detention camp for aliens seeking political asylum 
mike lempres who oversees the immigration and naturalization 
service detention centers flew to miami on thursday to check into 
the charges which have been turned over to justices civil rights 
division 
should any of these allegations lead to a finding that there 
are abuses the abuses will not be tolerated lempres said after 
touring the krome avenue camp 
krome is the only center in florida that holds illegal aliens 
while immigration considers their claims for asylum most are 
cubans haitians and central americans who claim political 
persecution in their homelands 
lempres said he suspects the abuse allegations stem from a few 
bad apples 
the conditions i see there are not inhumane he said 
refugee advocates spoke of sexual harassment and beatings that 
have prompted some refugees to give up their appeals and accept 
deportation 
things there are so unbelievably bad said cheryl little an 
attorney for haitian refugee center inc acts of serious abuse 
abound 
ms little said she has more than 100 affidavits from detainees 
and said she has been seeking a thorough government investigation 
for more than a year 
i left home trying to escape the violence of haiti said 
lavidieu conserve a former krome detainee and i come here and 
am badly beaten 
another haitian immigrant chantale pierre said camp guards 
repeatedly fondled her and propositioned her 
the women sometimes give in to guards sexual advances because 
they are promised they will be released those gathered thursday at 
the haitian refugee center said 
women are subjected to repeated searches and are manhandled 
during these searches ms little said people are threatened 
with deportation if they complain she said 
i have had countless clients tell me they can no longer take 
the conditions at krome they made the decision to return to haiti 
living in hiding there said attorney esther cruz 
lempres asked about this charge responded i can tell you we 
dont discourage these people from filing the asylum applications 
immigration officials said detainees usually spend only 41 days 
at krome but that if they fight deportation they can remain as 
long as a year 
the camp a former nike missile base on the edge of the 
everglades has been used since 1980 to hold undocumented aliens 
the compound of onestory nondescript dormitories held 444 
detainees thursday 
ms little said an earlier federal probe was flawed because the 
detainees werent safeguarded against retaliation 
ignacio lopez 27 from guatemala said each guard is like a 
dictator with his own rules while food is plentiful at the camp 
he said guards sometimes force them to rush their meals throwing 
away their food after a few minutes 
former detainee sony dujon compared camp guards to tontons 
macoute the feared secret militia of haitis deposed duvalier 
regime 
the rev thomas wenski called for an end to the practice of 
detaining aliens at krome while their appeals are heard he said 
there are willing sponsors to take responsibility for them and 
they pose no threat to the community 
there is humiliation and indignity said the roman catholic 
priest who ministers in miamis little haiti neighborhood the 
worst problem is the people are innocent they came here only to 
seek freedom

chinese leaders are warning of domestic religious 
and ethnic conflict apparently fearing the nationalist tumult in 
neighboring central asia could spread to mongols manchus moslems 
and tibetans in china 
a spread of ethnic violence and religious fundamentalism from 
soviet asia and democratic impulses from mongolia could threaten 
beijings longnurtured concept of unity and harmony between han 
chinese and the nations 55 minorities 
martial law has been in effect in the tibetan capital of lhasa 
for more than a year following recurrent antichinese riots 
last week troops were reportedly dispatched to three cities 
near the soviet border to put down unrest among moslem ethnic 
groups the government has barred foreign travelers and journalists 
from the region 
premier li peng in february said a tiny number of separatists 
under the mantle of nationalism and religion oppose socialism and 
sabotage the unity of all chinese nationalities 
china he told officials in charge of minority affaris should 
wipe out all separatist activities while they are still in the 
embryonic stage 
beijings minority problem pales before that of the soviet 
union where almost 50 percent of the population is nonrussian in 
china the 86 million members of nonhan ethnic groups are less 
than 8 percent of the 11 billion population and many have long 
been assimilated into chinese culture 
but ethnic groups inhabit lands comprising 60 percent of chinas 
territory stretching from the himalayas of the southwest to the 
silk road deserts of the west and the endless steppes of the north 
tibet has been the most volatile region many tibetans 
stubbornly resist chinas claims to sovereignty and dozens have 
died in antichinese riots in lhasa since late 1987 
at least 4000 tibetans demonstratd in lhasa last month to mark 
the anniversary of martial law according to spokesmen for tibets 
exiled spiritual leader the dalai lama but china denied the 
report beijing refused entry to all foreign journalists and 
tourists and operators didnt put phone calls through 
the buddhist tibetans deeply resent chinas past policies of 
religious and cultural persecution their feelings are shared by 
the uygurs and other moslem groups more than half the 14 million 
people of arid xinjiang uygur autonomous region to the north 
xinjiang borders on soviet kazakhstan kirghizia and 
tadzhikistan and shares cultural ties with their restless peoples 
in addition to 73 million huis and 6 million uygurs scatterings 
of kazaks kirghiz tatars russians and tajiks are also found in 
xinjiang and other border provinces 
asian diplomats in beijing said a dispute over a mosque in 
xinjiangs remote western desert town of kashgar sparked last 
weeks unrest in which up to 50 were killed according to 
unconfirmed reports they said the rioters were from the kirghiz 
ethnic group 
the disturbances were the worst since may when about 150 
moslems were arrested for attacking the communist party 
headquarters in urumqi they were upset over a chineselanguage 
book they said blasphemed their religion 
foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua on thursday denied any 
knowledge of the reported clashes in kashgar chinese officials 
have sought to keep news of the unrest from spreading by barring 
foreigners from the region and refusing to answer queries from 
foreign journalists and diplomats 
but chinese officials have frequently warned of potential 
trouble in the area 
the regional communist party chief song hanliang said after a 
tour of kashgar and other areas of southern xinjiang in february 
that every place and work unit now has hot spots 
he called for greater control over religious activities saying 
the government must not allow religion to be used to promote 
separatist tendencies 
xinjiangs government chief tomur dawamat also warned last 
month of social scum aided by foreigners who sought to oppose 
xinjiang remaining in the big family of the motherland 
china has said little about the democratic pressures in mongolia 
that forced that countrys communist party leadership to resign 
but according to one soviet diplomat the chinese believe there is 
a real danger the mongol reform movement will spill over into 
chinas inner mongolia 
some 35 million mongols live in the region more than the 2 
million ethnic brothers across the border in mongolia but chinas 
mongols who conquered the country under genghis khan in the 13th 
century are outnumbered in inner mongolia by 18 million hans they 
also lack the cultural and religious unity of the tibetans and 
moslems 
chinas antireligion and forced assimilation policies of the 
1950s and 1960s led to bloody clashes including a failed tibetan 
uprising in 1959 that drove the dalai lama into exile 
since the late 1970s beijing has tried to make amends by 
rebuilding places of worship and encouraging traditional culture 
and language 
minorities are exempted from the onechild population policy and 
are beneficiaries of educational and antipoverty programs the 
government pledges it will improve its record of appointing 
nonhans to official positions 
at least in the south along the border with vietnam laos and 
burma the policy seems to be working 
the 14 million zhuangs chinas largest minority group the 
55 million yi people and the 5 million miaos live quietly in 
remote farming villages known more for festivals and colorful 
costumes than political consciousness

a pilot on a sentimental journey 
once upon a time could pick up a surplus world war ii fighter for 
about 2000 but the asking price now can soar higher than 1 
million 
hoping to cash in on a craze that has become a rich mans hobby 
the museum of flying in this city with a rich aviation history 
plans an auction of historic aircraft on may 19 and 20 
we believe this will be the most historic auction of antique 
aircraft ever museum president david price said its like 
mounting a broadway show you dont know if its going to work 
until opening night 
apollo astronauts wally schirra and buzz aldrin were among 
aerospace notables who showed up thursday to lend their support at 
a preview of the planes listed for sale 
planes that were once abandoned in rusty hangars and barns have 
been lovingly restored p51 mustang fighters that once escorted 
bombers through nazi flak sport fresh paint jobs and jaunty names 
like stiletto 
a few years after the war price said a shrewd bargainer could 
pick up a surplus mustang at a country air field for as little as 
2000 the same plane now commands a 500000 pricetag or better 
a rare restored p38 lightning twinboom fighter of the sort 
that once knocked down japanese zero fighters in the pacific is 
on the auction block for more than 1 million rarity dictates 
price 
unfortunately they are perishable price said if you 
dont fly them they deteriorate and sometimes they crash 
proceeds of the auction will support aviation scholarships and 
museum restoration price hopes some investors or altruists will 
buy airplanes then keep them at the museum where they will be 
maintained in flying condition 
a rich history has flamed the passion for buying and flying such 
planes said price who operates golf courses for a living but 
comes to life when he is flying a spitfire dubbed evelyn 
hundreds of thousands of people attend air shows every year and 
the air amp space museum in washington is the best attended of all 
the smithsonian institution displays 
the fighter planes hark back to chivalry and knighthood 
price said the men who flew them were heroes and everyone 
responds to that i think 
children particularly are drawn to the flying exhibits price 
said 
the kids can smell the gasoline and they can see that these 
airplanes are not relics price said theyre not mummified 
these planes are works of art in their own right said 
donald douglas jr whose father built the dc3 and countless other 
planes made famous in war and peace 
the auction will be held at the museum grounds next to the 
santa monica airports runways on the site where army air corps 
planes built by douglas departed in 1924 on a historic 
roundtheworld flight 
one of the biplanes from that flight hangs in the museum 
another is at the air amp space museum in washington

gold that sank with the ss central america 
rested at the bottom of the atlantic for more than 130 years no 
one knows when the answer to who owns the treasure will emerge from 
the courts 
there has to be some end to this said us district judge 
richard b kellam as he closed the record on the case thursday 
after eight days of arguments over who should have ownership of the 
fortune columbusamerica discovery group which located the 
treasure or a group of insurance companies which paid off the 
loss in 1857 
originally more than 40 insurance companies filed for a stake 
in the treasure that has been whittled down to about 10 
columbia university and two treasure hunters also are seeking 
part of the pie the new york city school claims sonar surveys done 
by one of its researchers and paid for by the two businessmen were 
used to locate the wreck kellam gave all sides 60 days in which to 
submit briefs on their arguments followed in 21 days with replies 
to the briefs oral arguments are scheduled for july 11 
after reading the voluminous file of the proceedings and going 
over the boxes of exhibits kellam will issue a decision 
attorneys from all sides have said any ruling most likely will 
be appealed to the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
the gold was lost when the ss central america sank 1 miles 
below the atlantic surface off the coast of south carolina in an 
1857 hurricane the ship was en route from panama to new york city 
carrying gold and passengers from the california gold fields 
the portion of the gold cargo insured was estimated at 12 
million at the time columbusamerica officials say the current 
value of the gold could be as high as 1 billion the ohiobased 
group has raised about one ton of gold ingots and coins about two 
tons remains on the ocean floor they said 
columbusamerica attorneys have argued that only through 
scientific research and technology was the group made up of more 
than 100 investors able to locate the wreck columbusamerica 
said it spent 10 million in the 13year search and is entitled to 
the ownership of the treasure 
the insurance companies say they paid off on the loss and never 
abandoned their implied ownership of the treasure not all of the 
gold was insured business records that would include descriptions 
of the insured cargo and proof the claims were paid no longer exist

years of financial hardship have touched 
off record numbers of suicides and raised the incidence of 
drugtaking depression and child abuse in rural america officials 
say 
mental health problems are growing faster in rural areas than in 
cities but rural mental health services remain woefully 
inadequate according to a parade of witnesses thursday at the 
first of three nationwide hearings by the national advisory mental 
health council and the national mental health leadership forum 
rural america has gone through some wrenching times said 
bob bergland executive vice president of the national rural 
electric cooperative association 
mining timber and farming went to pot in the past decade 
he said the repercussions were painful record numbers of farm 
foreclosures high unemployment and a death spiral for many rural 
enterprises 
paul lasley associate professor of sociology at iowa state 
university said the isolation fierce independence and fear of 
being stigmatized set rural residents apart from urbanites with 
mental disorders 
when adversity struck in rural america the victims were often 
left alone to deal with their problems he said 
lasley recalled how one central iowa farmer asked to resign from 
his churchs board of deacons once it was learned he had lost his 
farm 
at the very time that social support was needed his own 
church cast him aside he said 
myrt armstrong executive director of the mental health 
association in north dakota said that out of 70 suicides in north 
dakota last year 20 were directly farmrelated 
in the heartland we have always lived by rules like where 
theres a will theres a way or hard work never killed anyone 
or even you reap what you sow she said 
but those who have had a steel determination and have worked 
extremely hard are reaping a bitter harvest often ending in 
depression and suicide 
that stoic independence admired in rural people has become a 
roadblock to seeking help bergland said 
heaven knows youll never get a farmer to walk voluntarily 
into a mental health center and ask someone to hold his hand he 
said 
several who spoke described farm families who cling to their 
privacy and fear letting others in on their problems that in 
turn deepens their isolation raises their anxiety and leads them 
to feeling guilty and ashamed 
the key to restoring the fabric of rural america the experts 
said lies in dispelling the fear of reaching out for help 
bergland suggested that mental health facilities be combined 
with other healthcare centers to lessen the stigma and that 
mental health training be geared more toward the needs of rural 
communities 
said armstrong the only hope for people in this kind of 
trouble lies in other people people who can listen help sort 
things out and make intelligent referrals to other resources 
the fabric of rural life has been torn and once mended will 
never be quite the same again she said healing is possible 
and we hope that if we pay attention to the healing process and 
mend the fabric with care we will wind up with a whole cloth once 
again

sidelines to watch movements in the foreign exchange and bond 
markets 
yoshihide koyama an equity analyst with nikko securites also

foreign minister roland dumas said france had been 
the victim of a false trial after newspapers across europe 
criticized his praise of libya for aiding the release of three 
hostages held by palestinian guerrillas 
the hostages a french woman her belgian companion and their 
young child were freed in beirut this week and emerged from 
seclusion thursday when they met briefly with the media 
but they refused to answer questions saying any comment might 
jeopardize efforts to free four other belgians being held 
since arriving in france on tuesday jacqueline valente fernand 
houtekins and their daughter sophieliberte had stayed at a 
military hospital outside paris 
later thursday the three left for belgium according to ms 
valentes brotherinlaw andre metral 
at the news conference houtekins said the belgian government 
had requested total discretion while it negotiated to free four 
of his relatives still in captivity 
meanwhile france insisted it did not deal directly with the 
fatahrevolutionary council led by terrorist abu nidal and denied 
obtaining the hostages freedom by agreeing to give libya three 
mirage fighter jets 
dumas questioned thursday by the senate committee on defense 
and foreign affairs said there were no transactions with the 
abductors and no link between the hostages and the three 
warplanes 
the hostages release was obtained through contacts with several 
arab countries including syria morocco and egypt as well as 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi he said 
president francois mitterrand thursday sent telegrams of thanks 
to moroccos king hassan ii egyptian president hosni mubarak and 
algerian president chadli bendjedid 
dumas said the release of the airplanes which had been held 
for four years after libya sent them back to france for repairs 
did not violate a european community embargo on arms deliveries to 
libya 
since the hostages release questions have emerged about 
several details of their abduction 
the daughter of houtekins and ms valente was widely described 
as a 2yearold born in captivity after the familys yacht was 
seized in the eastern mediterranean in november 1987 
but metral said wednesday the girl was 4 roughly the age she 
appears to be physically that led to speculation in the french 
press that the group may have been abducted much earlier than 
previously reported 
metral also said the exhostages were held in lebanon not libya 
as widely believed 
the abu nidal group reportedly has linked freedom for the 
remaining belgians to the release of a palestinian jailed in 
belgium for a terrorist attack 
in addition to the hostages held by abu nidals organization 18 
westerners are held in lebanon mainly by proiranian shiite moslem 
groups 
they include eight americans the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
he was kidnapped on march 16 1985

the county coroner announced his resignation 
amid reports that the high homicide rate is straining his staff 
slowing autopsies and causing bodies to be left on the streets for 
hours 
ronald kornblum 57 will step down july 1 after eight years on 
the job because the administrative job was unfulfilling and he 
wants to resume teaching and writing coroners department 
spokesman bob dambacher said thursday 
the office has come under fire for moving too slowly on 
autopsies leaving bodies at crime and accident scenes for hours 
and most embarrassingly bouncing corpses onto freeways from old 
coroner vehicles with bad door locks 
a recent audit found that staff shortages coupled with a high 
homicide rate is straining the coroners office to the breaking 
point 
kornblum who declined to comment on his resignation took over 
as coroner for the nations most populous county in 1982 
he replaced thomas noguchi who was removed for serving as a 
consultant on cases outside the county 
the lowkey kornblums style contrasted with noguchi the 
coroner to the stars who wrote a bestselling book about his 
betterknown cases 
as the chief medical examinercoroner kornblum directed a staff 
of 160 responsible for an annual caseload of about 18000 deaths 
including 7000 bodies that require autopsies 
overall the report indicates the coroner is fulfilling his 
legal responsibilities but is experiencing operation and managerial 
difficulties los angeles county auditorcontroller mark 
bloodgood said in a letter accompanying the audit 
kornblum said he agreed with most of the reports suggestions 
and that the office was implementing some of them but he said 
certain changes such as processing all bodies in 24 hours were 
impossible 
considering the limited size of the departments budget and 
the overwhelming workload this goal is neither achievable nor 
realistic although highly desirable he said 
kornblum was defended by some county officials including 
supervisor pete schabarum who first disclosed kornblums 
resignation 
he has made significant improvement in the department and 
demonstrated leadership and strength he has really turned that 
operation around schabarum said in a statement 
kornblum previously served as the departments chief of 
forensics medicine before that he was medical examinercoroner 
for ventura county

a judges ruling legally protecting 
seven frozen human embryos gives them greater rights than much more 
developed fetuses have under abortion laws a laywer says in an 
appeal 
judge w dale young saying that life begins at conception 
issued the ruling in september in the divorce case of junior lewis 
davis and mary sue davis 
the only contested portion of the divorce was what to do with 
the seven embryos which the davises created in december 1988 in an 
in vitro fertilization program at a knoxville hospital 
the twodayold embryos have been frozen since then testimony 
at the divorce trial indicated the embryos have developed to 
between four and eight cells each 
mrs davis 29 testified that said she wanted control of the 
embryos in an attempt to have children she cannot have children 
naturally 
davis 31 said he did not want the embryos used in any fashion 
especially by his exwife without his consent 
after hearing four days of testimony young accorded the embryos 
the same legal status as children would have in a custody dispute 
between their parents he then awarded custody of the embryos to 
mrs davis though he also barred her from using them until appeals 
are decided 
davis lawyer janet mayfield filed an appeal thursday in the 
state court of appeals 
inexplicably judge young determined that all the previous 
decisions and statutory guidelines were irrelevant for determining 
when the unborn enjoy a protectable legal status the appeal says 
the appeal also contends young should not have strayed into the 
field of morals and ethics in reaching his decision 
judge young has independently quantified the value 
attributable to the existence of a four to eightcell embryo being 
maintained in frozen storage notwithstanding that such conclusions 
have eluded scholars legislators philosophers religious leaders 
ethicists and theologians since the inception of the technology 
mayfield wrote 
and despite his ruling that life begins at conception young 
did not have the authority to give the embryos legal standing the 
appeal argues 
neither the state laws nor the federal constitution confer 
any protectable legal status upon the unborn before viability 
the appeal says adding that the decision cannot even be 
reconciled with wellaccepted methods of birth control 
attorneys for mrs davis who is remarried and living in 
florida have 30 days to respond to the appeal

christian pilgrims carried crosses along the 
traditional route of jesus christs martyrdom today to mark good 
friday amid tensions over a jewish settlement established in the 
christian quarter of the old city 
thousands of pilgrims began processions along the via dolorosa 
at 9 am stopping to sing hymns and pray at the stations of the 
cross leading to the church of the holy sepulcher venerated by 
many christians as the site of christs tomb 
dozens of paramilitary border police armed with assault rifles 
and tear gas grenades walked in the narrow streets of jerusalems 
old walled city along with christians from around the world 
the heavy police presence followed rioting thursday near the 
church of the holy sepulcher but most of the pilgrims seemed more 
intent on tracing the path of christ than in getting caught up in 
the friction between jerusalems christians and jews 
jerusalem is beautiful i could not imagine it until i saw 
it said mervat azer a travel agent from jersey city new 
jersey we are praying near the place where christ was buried 
tomorrow his light will be very bright 
paul christiansen of copenhagen denmark said he was saddened 
by the pain jesus suffered on the cross and by the current 
religious trouble in jerusalem 
we noticed yesterday there was tear gas and fighting said 
christiansen 29 it is sad why it is necessary for people to 
fight 
the rioting came as christian clerics and their supporters 
protested the settling of 150 jews in the old citys christian 
quarter 
police fired tear gas to disperse the protesters after a priest 
tore down a poster showing the israeli star of david that had been 
placed over a cross on the door of a disputed building 
greek orthodox church officials maintain the sale of the 
building to the israelis was illegal and have taken their case to 
court lower court rulings have said the jewish settlers must 
return the property to the church decisions which are being 
appealed 
jerusalems old city is divided into jealously guarded ethnic 
quarters that are home to 50000 moslems about 7000 christians 
and 4000 jews 
the entire area is caught up in the israelipalestinian struggle 
since the old city is part of the land captured by israel in the 
1967 middle east war 
israel has annexed the walled city which includes the last 
remnant of the ancient jewish temple and surrounding arab east 
jerusalem into its capital but the citys 140000 arab residents 
want to be part of a palestinian state the annexation of the 
territory also is not recognized by most foreign governments 
palestinian christians whose numbers are shrinking compared to 
both moslems and jews saw the settlement of the jews under police 
guard as particularly offensive since it occurred during easter 
week 
todays colorful processions appeared to come off without any 
trouble beyond the usual pushing and shoving along the narrow stone 
streets 
as the greek orthodox began their procession at about 1030 
am women ran from the crowd to kiss the 2yardlong cross partly 
supported by diodorus i the greek orthodox patriarch of jerusalem 
who collapsed during the police tear gasing thursday 
waves of pilgrims were pushed along the via dolorosa sometimes 
with israeli police holding hands to clear a path 
the city was especially crowded because both the eastern 
orthodox churches and the western latinrite churches were 
celebrating easter on the same day 
the easter celebrations by the two churches which can sometimes 
be five weeks apart also came amid the jewish passover festival 
and the moslems ramadan month of fasting 
israeli officials estimated 45000 foreigners would visit 
jerusalem during during easter week 
in the past scuffles have broken out on days in which the latin 
and orthodox easter processions intersect but rene koutroulis of 
new york city said members of the two churches seemed to have put 
aside their conflicts for the holiday 
everybody i think is united and i see on their faces that 
they came in good faith said ms koutroulis who is active in 
greekamerican welfare work today we are united tomorrow we may 
fight again

a judge ordered psychiatric care instead of 
prison for a woman who tried to murder a man with an ax in a ritual 
she allegedly hoped would resurrect jack the ripper 
circuit judge william d gardner found deborah kazuck innocent 
by reason of insanity of attempted firstdegree intentional 
homicide and ordered her sent to a psychiatric hospital a jury 
earlier thursday had convicted her of the charge 
ms kazuck 27 allegedly told police that in a previous life 
she was the mother of the 19thcentury serial killer who stabbed 
and disemboweled at least five london prostitues in the autumn of 
1888 
she testified wednesday that she never plotted the may 29 attack 
and only struck the man with the ax when he tried to sexually 
assault her 
but two codefendants ramona barry and catherine lipsham said 
ms kazuck had asked them to lure the victim jeffrey meka 27 to 
an apartment where they planned to kill him the plot they said 
was called a kacking a word combining jack and killing 
the two pleaded guilty to the same charge last week under a plea 
agreement that lawyers said included a recommendation for lenient 
sentences they are to be sentenced on may 25 
they said ms kazuck proposed killing meka draining his blood 
and eating his kidneys during a ritual to revive jack the ripper 
meka said he was lured to the apartment and discovered ms 
kazuck behind a shower curtain he said she lurched at him with the 
ax and opened a gash over his eye that required 50 stitches 
i honestly feel the judge did the right thing here defense 
attorney alan a olshan said adding he didnt think ms kazuck 
understood either decision in the trial 
a first phase of the trial involved the criminal charge the 
second phase during which ms kazuck waived her right to a jury 
involved her plea of innocent by reason of mental disease or defect 
ms kazuck admitted she was fascinated with jack the ripper and 
regularly carried a backpack containing a hatchet a drill and 
knives 
defense psychiatrist william cowley said ms kazuck suffered 
from paranoid schizophrenia and could not understand her acts were 
wrong 
a state psychiatrist frederick fosdal said she suffered from a 
schizoid personality disorder but had no mental illness and should 
be held responsible for the crime

reporting and photographs from the oct 17 
earthquake won pulitzers for the oakland tribune and the san jose 
mercury news while their competitor the san francisco chronicle 
won for architecture criticism 
the tribune award for spot news for photojournalism was its 
first pulitzer since 1950 
the work of this staff prevailed over all of the other entries 
because of its incredible clarity the intensity the closeness to 
the action the way our staff really got in close and the 
compassion for the victims robert maynard the tribunes 
publisher said as the newspapers staff celebrated noisily in the 
background 
the tribunes photographers recorded the devastating 
earthquakes traumatic detail including rescue efforts on the 
collapsed highway in oakland the san francisco marina district 
ablaze and chaos across northern california after the 71magnitude 
temblor struck 
the photos were picked up by wire services and used in

years ago many people gave the tribune poor odds of surviving in

on monday tamar stieber taped a plastic 
bag over the hole where her cars passenger window used to be and 
wondered how she was going to pay for the repairs 
on thursday the albuquerque journal reporter won the top prize 
in journalism a pulitzer for specialized reporting her stories 
late last year led to the national recall of a popular dietary 
supplement ltryptophan 
ms stieber mused that she might use her prize check of 3000 
to fix her car which flipped last weekend when she swerved to 
avoid a tumbleweed north of albuquerque she escaped unhurt 
ms stieber 34 became an instant celebrity in the journals 
santa fe newsroom when the pulitzer awards were announced thursday 
in new york she was swamped with congratulations from friends and 
fellow reporters and with telephone messages requesting interviews 
she later traveled to albuquerque but not in her own car to 
receive the wellwishes of staffers at the journals headquarters 
she joined the newspaper last may 
i didnt expect it the pulitzer she said i was writing 
stories working on deadline and i wasnt thinking of prizes 
her horoscope this week talked about love not the pulitzer 
prize she said 
ms stieber first reported in november that three doctors in 
santa fe and los alamos had uncovered an unusual connection between 
their patients and ltryptophan 
the patients were suffering from a sometimes fatal blood 
disorder called eosinophiliamylagia syndrome which caused severe 
muscle and joint pain 
a week after ms stiebers first article appeared reports of 
eosinophiliamylagia syndrome surfaced in arizona oregon 
mississippi texas and missouri 
thats when i realized that this wasnt just a local 
phenomenon she said 
the us food and drug administration issued a donotuse 
recommendation ltryptophan an amino acid fermented mainly in 
japan has since been recalled by the fda more than 1400 cases of 
ems have been identified 
ms stieber said covering the story was grueling and 
timeconsuming she said she had to overcome the apprehension of 
doctors to act on thenunproven allegations that the common 
supplement may have been dangerous 
the first week i couldnt sleep she said describing the 
laborious week spent with her adrenalin really going 
ms stieber credited her colleagues on the staff of the journal 
north the newspapers northern edition for covering her regular 
beats during the hectic first weeks of the ltryptophan story 
it was a story that required persistent reporting by tamar 
working closely with her editor tim coder said gerald crawford 
editor of the journal in albuquerque 
they had to overcome a number of obstacles including 
considerable skepticism and resistance from some state officials 
who feared it would trigger a scare 
without these stories its difficult to say when or even if 
the relationship between ltryptophan and eosinophilia would have 
been made he said

tom toles the buffalo news cartoonist once 
labeled the rodney dangerfield of editorial cartooning has 
gotten journalisms most respected prize the pulitzer 
and the best thing about winning the pulitzer for editorial 
cartooning toles told colleagues who crowded into his cubicle 
thursday to celebrate was that it came to him in the place he 
holds most dear 
all i can say is i really wanted to win it in buffalo and now 
i have the softspoken cartoonist said im from here ive 
had job offers from other cities but buffalo has a special meaning 
to me 
buffalo has had its hard times and i have a special feeling 
for the city he said 
toles 38 grew up in suburban hamburg his father was the 
business editor of the buffalo times until it folded in 1939 but 
toles said he never planned to go into journalism much less 
cartooning 
i drew as a kid every kid draws but i never took an art 
lesson he said 
toles was a staff artist for the campus newspaper at the state 
university of new york at buffalo he was hired in 1973 as a 
graphic artist at the nowdefunct buffalo courierexpresss 
he initially did caricatures and other illustrative work but 
found his vocation when douglas l turner then the papers editor 
asked him to do an editorial cartoon one day 
since toles joined the buffalo news when the courierexpress 
folded in 1982 his work has been syndicated nationally by 
universal press syndicate and he was a finalist for the 1985 
pulitzer in editorial cartooning 
a cover story in the washington journalism review in december 
1988 called toles the rodney dangerfield of editorial 
cartooning because he was wellrespected in the profession but 
not well known nationally 
his barebones style of drawing unconventional use of multiple 
frames selfdescribed strange sense of humor and employment by 
a newspaper not prominent nationally all contributed to his 
obscurity the magazine said 
murray light editor of the news said he knew that obscurity 
would someday vanish 
we always had confidence that this day would come he told 
toles were just absolutely so totally gratified for you and 
your talent 
toles known for his environmentalism and outrage at military 
spending at the expense of social programs was honored for a 
selection of 10 cartoons representing his best work of 1989 
he said he thinks of his cartoons as an ongoing series rather 
than specific ones but singled out cartoons on the subjects of 
flagburning and former president reagans farewell as among his 
favorites 
toles is the second buffalo news cartoonist to win a pulitzer 
the late bruce shanks won the 1958 prize for a cartoon portraying 
an american worker pondering newspaper accounts of corruption among 
union leaders

filipino penitents were nailed to 
crosses today and others whipped themselves bloody as asias only 
predominantly christian nation marked the crucifixion of jesus 
about a dozen people were nailed to crosses in several 
communities of central luzon island including a woman faith healer 
in kapitangan in her 14th good friday crucifixion 
police said another 10 penitents were nailed to crosses in 
cutud about 15 miles west in pampanga province 
penitents were nailed to the crosses for up to 10 minutes 
about 500 people filled the yard outside a church in this 
farming village to watch the crucifixion on a concrete stage at the 
edge of a rice field they shouted at photographers and onlookers 
to make room for them to see the event 
about the same number of people jostled each other to watch the 
crucifixion from an adjacent lot where vendors sold food and 
drinks and others set up gambling tables 
a man wearing dark glasses chanted latin prayers under a blazing 
noontime sun as two men dressed as roman centurions hammered 
fourinch nails into the palms and feet of faith healer lucila 
lucy reyes 32 
her followers mostly women burned incense and sang religious 
songs others wept as miss reyes went into a trance her body 
shaking on the wooden cross 
a follower placed a bottle of coconut oil at the foot of the 
cross for benediction in treating ailments 
hours earler male penitents with clothcovered faces whipped 
their backs with wooden sticks tied to a lash in an annual ritual 
to wash their sins or repay god for some miracles 
they would lie face down on the concrete pavement on churchyard 
in front of pictures of the 14 stations of the cross while being 
whipped on the buttocks by their companions 
in cutud about 3000 people including foreign tourists turned 
out to watch the crucifixions which took place after flagellants 
wandered through the dusty streets flogging themselves with sticks 
of bamboo pitted with bits of glass 
those crucified in cutud included mario castro 40 who was 
nailed to a cross for his 10th straight good friday 
castro said he pledged to undergo the bizarre ritual to give 
thanks for the recovery of his mother from a serious illness 
castro said todays ordeal marked the end of his crucifixions 
because he was now spiritually fulfilled 
the crucifixions are a major tourist attraction but they 
brought a mixed response from foreigners 
the philippines is free to do this said didier moreau 44 
of digon france this is just a filipino play 
but a japanese christian hiroko kawashima 26 stared in 
disbelief at the cutud festivities and said if japanese 
nonchristians could see this they would not want to convert 
origins of the annual crucifixion are difficult to trace local 
residents say the practice was introduced by spanish friars in the 
16th century but others claim it is a more recent phenomenon

premier li peng will visit the soviet union april 
2326 becoming the first chinese head of government to travel to 
moscow since 1964 the foreign ministry said today 
the ministry said in a statement that li will have an 
extensive and indepth exchange of views with soviet leaders on the 
bilateral relations and major international issues of common 
concern 
li was invited to visit the soviet union in may when soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev made the first trip to beijing by a 
soviet leader in three decades prodemocracy activists in china 
used the visit to promote their demands for reforms but the 
movement was crushed in june 
chinas leaders have since taken a hardline communist approach 
ignoring moscows reform program of glasnost and perestroika 
the exchange of visits has marked the end of decades of 
hostility between the two socialist states and signaled a gradual 
warming of political and economic relations 
soviet sources said li will meet twice with gorbachev in moscow 
and will make a oneday trip to kiev they said it is likely the 
two leaders will sign an agreement to promote bilateral trade and 
an accord of general principles on easing military tensions along 
the 4300mile common border 
china and the soviet union split over ideological differences 
around 1960 and fought a brief border war in 1969 
relations have steadily improved since the mid1980s when 
gorbachev came to power particularly after gorbachev withdrew 
soviet forces from afghanistan and pledged to reduce soviet 
military forces in asia 
however china has emphasized it will never return to the close 
relations with the soviet union it had in the 1950s 
chinese leaders have also distanced themselves from the 
democratic reforms now taking place in the soviet union and east 
europe 
although china has not publicly commented on such actions as the 
soviet communist partys renunciation of its monopoly on power 
internal documents reportedly have branded gorbachev a revisionist 
li studied electrical engineering in the soviet union in the 
1950s and favors traditional sovietstyle central planning and 
emphasis on heavy industry

reported cases of hepatitis a in the united 
states increased 58 percent between 1983 and 1989 the federal 
centers for disease control said 
hepatitis a a liver inflammation usually linked to poor hygiene 
or drug use causes fever fatigue and aches in rare cases it can 
be fatal 
the cdc said the number of cases increased from 92 per 100000 
population to 145 per 100000 from 198389 however the 
atlantabased agency noted thursday that many who get the illness 
show no symptoms and their cases go unreported 
the bestknown method of spreading hepatitis a is when a 
hepatitis carrier handles food such as salads sandwiches or other 
items that are not cooked 
however it is important to stress that a majority of 
hepatitis cases are not associated with foodborne outbreaks 
said dr miriam alter a cdc hepatitis specialist 
about a third are associated with close personal contact with 
someone else who has the disease about 12 percent are associated 
with daycare centers and there too the disease is also acquired 
from someone else who had it she said 
six percent of the cases are brought back to the united states 
from developing countries where hepatitis is endemic and the 
cause of about a third of the cases cannot be traced she said 
there also are increasing reports of the illness being spread 
through sharing of contaminated needles by drug users 
there is no vaccine for hepatitis a but infection can be 
prevented with gamma globulin shots after exposure takes place

gorbachevs comment to visiting us senators that moscow can solve 
the secession crisis in lithuania without any lectures from

that the soviet view is largely an internal matter because of 
history we dont view it that way i will continue to say what i

something i feel very strongly about

bush wants to go into the session with gorbachev with a firm view 
of the attitudes of other members of the alliance

unrest in lithuania and german reunification headed the agenda for 
todays the daylong session 
bush planned to brief mrs thatcher on his talks last week with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze at the time the 
soviet union indicated it might be willing to accept a unified 
germany that is not neutral

slower approach toward german reunification than the united states 
and the rest of the nato alliance 
on lithuanias strive for independence from the soviet union

most important fitzwater said the united states is firmly

likud leader yitzhak shamir said today he is 
certain his political rival shimon peres will not be able to form a 
government and that he will succeed where peres failed 
the rightwing likuds efforts to thwart a coalition led by 
peres labor party picked up steam today when legislator avraham 
sharir who defected from likud to labor last week indicated he 
would return to his old party 
another legislator who announced wednesday he was quitting 
parliament to avoid following his ultraorthodox agudat israel 
party into a labor coalition withdrew his resignation today before 
it took effect 
that could mean one more vote for peres but even with that vote 
and if he manages to hold on to sharir he still would only have 
60 votes in the 120member parliament not enough to get his 
coalition approved 
peres who only last week boasted he had the necessary support 
to head israels first labor government in 13 years appeared glum 
today listen if everything is lost everything is lost he 
told israel radio 
israeli media reported grumblings in the centerleft labor party 
that peres should be replaced by the partys no 2 man yitzhak 
rabin who gained popularity among voters as a hardline defense 
minister 
rabin was the last holdout in labor for continuing the partys 
coalition with likud that collapsed march 15 labor engineered the 
fall after likud refused to accept us middle east peace proposals 
shamir meanwhile said in a newspaper interview he was 
convinced that peres would not be able to form a coalition by the 
time his mandate expires april 26 
i think i have a chance to form a government when i receive 
the mandate shamir now caretaker prime minister told the 
conservative daily maariv 
peres was given three weeks to form a new government by 
president chaim herzog on march 20 the term was extended by two 
weeks on wednesday after defectors from agudat israel robbed him of 
a majority 
if peres does not succeed herzog could then turn to shamir 
peres argued today that while the likud leader may be able to 
sabotage labors efforts shamir does not have enough votes for a 
majority either 
shamir said thursday he didnt rule out another coalition 
government but peres said such a partnership was impossible 
because of differences over peace moves 
labor has accused likud of thwarting peace efforts by refusing 
to accept proposals by us secretary of state james a baker iii 
to hold preliminary israelipalestinian peace talks in cairo 
peres troubles began wednesday when lawmaker rabbi avraham 
verdiger resigned fellow agudat legislator eliezer mizrahi then 
announced he also could not support labor because of its readiness 
to trade land for peace with the palestinians the defections 
deprived peres of his 6159 majority

a soviet helicopter pilot who stopped radiation 
spewing from the chernobyl nuclear reactor by dropping tons of sand 
and concrete will undergo a bonemarrow transplant in the united 
states this month doctors say 
anatoly grishchenko 53 made five flights in three days through 
heavy ionizing radiation in a mission to entomb the reactor he 
apparently is the first chernobyl victim to come to the united 
states for medical treatment doctors at fred hutchinson cancer 
research center said thursday 
this is not the normal type of patient we do hope to 
learn some things said dr patrick g beatty an associate 
professor of medicine at the university of washington its new 
territory 
grishchenko has preleukemia typified by low counts of 
platelets needed for clotting and of white blood cells to fight 
infection and disease he said he will stay in seattle for about 
three months after the surgery planned for april 27 beatty said 
soviet authorities said two people died in an explosion and fire 
that destroyed the atomic reactor north of kiev april 26 1986 and 
29 more people later died of injuries 
dr margulis yakovlyevna a soviet hematologist who acted as 
translator for grishchenko at a news conference said the test 
pilot is afraid over the treatment but he is sure everything 
will be all right by the end of the trip 
the name of the donor a french woman located through bone 
marrow registries in nine countries is being withheld said dr 
john hansen clinical research director at the center 
hansen said the operation was not performed in the soviet union 
because doctors there felt they lacked sufficient experience the 
soviet union plans to open half a dozen bonemarrow transplant 
centers within the next two years and while chernobyl is not the 
sole reason its the first factor she said 
hospital officials said the soviet government will pay for the 
operation bonemarrow transplants usually cost between 150000 to 
185000 
grishchenko recovered from an initial bout with radiation 
sickness but was found to have preleukemia in september 1988 
hansen and beatty rated his chance of recovery at 25 percent to 75 
percent 
grishchenko said he could see little of the plant through the 
heated air but could tell it was destroyed 
despite lead plates on the mi28 helicopters and a leadlined 
suit he wore grishchenko said heat from the radiation was intense 
no one he knew resisted orders to participate in the operation 
although no one in his group of pilots didnt speak of the 
danger the translator said he knew something about the order 
of danger to himself 
grishchenko and a handful of others in the operation were named 
heroes of the soviet union a designation equivalent to the 
congressional medal of honor

east germanys newly named prime minister 
lothar de maiziere said he is ready to begin the process of 
uniting his economically troubled nation with west germany 
i am very satisfied all the excitement of the last days and 
weeks is over and we can get down to work he told west german 
television thursday night 
west germanys foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said in 
an interview published today that it is time for the two german 
nations to prepare for unification talks with the superpowers 
genscher told the cologne express newspaper there was the 
highest measure of agreement between the two germanys and that 
with such a common interest we germans could be the architects of 
an undivided europe 
genscher has called for a meeting with his newly appointed east 
german counterpart markus meckel to begin laying the groundwork 
for a united german position in the unity talks 
parliament chose de maiziere as prime minister on thursday and 
embraced the christian democrat leaders sweeping plan for rapid 
reunification of germany 
one of de maizieres first acts as prime minister was to ease 
travel restrictions between the germanys during the fourday easter

lebanons civil war entered its 16th year 
today and an arab league envoy renewed efforts to settle the 
conflict which has killed 150000 people 
the latest stage of the war a battle for power in lebanons 
christian enclave continued with artillery and machine gun 
skirmishing 
pope john paul ii meanwhile issued a new appeal for a halt to 
the fratricidal fighting saying dialogue and negotiation are 
the only solution to lebanons conflicts 
the drama of lebanon must end lebanon must live again 
the pontiff said in a good friday message to maronite catholic 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir 
lakhdar ibrahimi an algerian diplomat arrived in beirut late 
thursday with proposals for implementing a peace pact to end the 
conflict 
the pact was worked out by lebanese legislators under arab 
league auspices in the saudi arabian resort of taif in october 
it calls for equal distribution of political power between 
moslems and christians 
the plan has not been carried out however because it has been 
rejected by renegade gen michel aoun whose troops have been 
fighting the rival lebanese forces militia for 73 days in a 
struggle for control of the christian enclave 
aoun accuses lebanese forces chief samir geagea of trying to 
force implementation of the taif accord in the 310squaremile 
enclave northeast of the capital 
aoun has described the accord as a pact of capitulation 
because it does not include a fixed timetable for the withdrawal of 
syrias 40000 troops from lebanon 
syrian soldiers have been deployed in predominantly moslem 
regions of lebanon since nov 1976 in line with a peacekeeping 
mandate from the 22nation arab league 
aouns troops and geageas militiamen skirmished today in east 
beirut and the christian hinterland of kesrouan province 
the savage intrachristian confrontation broke out jan 30 and 
by police count it has killed 875 people and wounded 2369 
aouns rejection of the taif accord has prevented syrianbacked 
president elias hrawi elected nov 24 from spreading his 
authority to the christian enclave 
a government source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the taif accord will not be put into effect before a settlement 
to the aoun obstacle 
geagea has declared loyalty to president hrawi and has called 
on the legitimate government to spread its authority to his areas 
of influence aoun is the obstacle now the source added without 
elaboration 
ibrahimi held a twohour meeting thursday night with hrawis 
prime minister salim hoss in moslem west beirut 
ibrahimi told reporters later that he informed hoss of a plan 
worked out by the foreign ministers of algeria morocco and saudi 
arabia to carry out the taif accord 
heads of state of the three nations were asked by an arab summit 
last may to form a special committee to work out a settlement to 
the lebanese conflict and their effort resulted in the taif accord 
the national leaders then asked their foreign ministers to 
prepare the plan to carry out the accord and they reached 
agreement in meetings last week in rabat the moroccan capital 
its a very important report ibrahimi said without further 
elaboration

cia director william h webster foresees a 
deep and prolonged crisis in the soviet union with a 
deteriorating economy and ethnic unrest accompanying president 
mikhail gorbachevs reforms 
us specialists on the soviet union generally agreed with the 
assessment offered by webster in a speech in boston on thursday 
although some said better times may be ahead for the soviet economy 
i would say its just one side of the story said stephen f 
cohen professor of politics and director of russian studies at 
princeton university its the downside of the story i think 
theres an upside of the story too 
generally there is continued decline said vladimir petrov 
professor emeritus of international affairs at george washington 
university at least people complain more but russians are used 
to deprivation how long their patience will last is another 
matter 
some say that maybe they are coming to a turning point with 
the economy in a year or two but who can tell petrov added 
eric green soviet analyst with the american committee on us 
soviet relations said i think the events in the soviet union 
would tend to justify that they are deteriorating the one bright 
spot is that talk is now turning toward really radical economic 
reforms 
webster addressing the world affairs council of boston said 
the crisis we now see in the ussr will likely be deep and 
prolonged 
gorbachevs reforms have undermined the stalinist system that 
he inherited and have put the soviet union on the road to a new 
political system but the new system that he is trying to create is 
not yet ready to take the place of the old one that he has 
discarded the cia chief said 
economic conditions have deteriorated crime is increasing 
ethnic turmoil is escalating and now moscow faces perhaps its 
greatest challenge attempts by individual states to secede from 
the union 
speaking of lithuanias declaration of independence webster 
said the situation is tense and cool heads are needed all 
around 
regarding the soviet economy he said that attempts to head 
off consumer discontent have met with very little success 
gorbachev has some very unhappy consumers on his hands 
webster said 
analyst green agreed saying they perceive that the situation 
is getting worse in terms of food and it is exacerbated by the fact 
their wages are increasing without any increase in goods to buy 
there are some indications that this could lead to widespread 
unrest 
as to gorbachevs future petrov said obviously concern is 
major for a while he could get away with it because everybody 
realized the economy was in such a mess that no one could be held 
responsible but now that he has achieved the ultimate power he is 
the man to point at 
on the other hand petrov said to challenge him you would 
need somebody and something which today in my view simply is not 
available 
webster also said that elections in eastern europe do not 
guarantee an easy transition from communism 
they will have to be accompanied by tough reforms reforms 
that are going to bring home the hardship of unemployment higher 
prices and inflation he said 
webster said unemployment in poland has jumped from 55000 in 
january to more than 250000 and is expected to reach the million 
mark by the end of the year

iraq has already received 44 pieces of tubing 
identical to eight sections seized as suspected parts of a gigantic 
gun the british manufacturer said today 
i am sure that most people will recognize the absurdity of 
suggestions being made that these pipes are in fact guns said 
tony peck spokesman for sheffield forgemasters 
he said the eight sections are random parts of a 26section 
assembly that would be 511 feet long press reports have described 
the tubing as possibly making up a 131footlong gun barrel which 
would be the longest ever made 
iraqi officials have said the tubing formally seized by customs 
officers on thursday was intended for use in a petrochemical plant 
customs officers seized the eight sections of forged steel 
tubing on the docks at middlesbrough after a ministry of defense 
expert determined that it could be a weapon 
there is no question it could be used as a barrel of a large 
artillery gun to fire a projectile of some considerable size it is 
definitely subject to export licensing controls said douglas 
tweddle chief investigator for the customs and excise office 
the company said it had two contracts for 26 sections each and 
it had delivered 44 sections to the ministry of industry and 
minerals in baghdad 
all consignments to date have been cleared by customs and 
excise the company said 
peck said each contract for 26 sections would form a tube 511 
feet long the eight sections seized by customs were random parts 
of one 26segment order and do not join up in any way shape or 
form he said 
those who claim the pipes are part of a gun peck said may 
now care to make some new calculations which hopefully will 
persuade everyone how farfetched the story is 
iraq claims it is the target of a smear campaign orchestrated by 
britain and israel since last months execution of a londonbased 
journalist in baghdad 
even if we buy a box of chocolate from britain they will say 
iraq will use it to produce an atomic bomb iraqi foreign 
minister tareq aziz told reporters on thursday 
the paper of the ruling baath party althawra criticized the 
british government for collaborating with the us administration 
to reimpose its hegemony in the arab world and to help the israelis 
to maintain their occupation of the arab land 
this flagrant hostility toward iraq reveals that the 
predecessors of the british empire want to avenge the strikes dealt 
to their empire by the iraqi people the paper said 
the army daily alqaddissiya said iraq will not heed what it 
called a systematic campaign of slander launched by the british 
government and will continue its efforts to acquire modern 
technology 
iraq which fought for eight years in defense of its 
sovereignty and existence in the iraniraq war will not 
surrender even a minute part of its rights and dignity 
alqaddissiya said 
iraq has been the focus of international criticism for two 
months over a series of incidents the latest was president saddam 
husseins statement that he would use binary chemical weapons if 
attacked by israel chemical weapons are banned under a 1925 
international agreement 
saddams threats came after iraq ignored international pleas and 
hanged an iranianborn british journalist branded by baghdad as an 
israeli spy they also followed accusations by the united states 
and britain that iraq had tried to smuggle atomic bomb triggers 
into the country a charge iraq has denied

northeastern state of assam at least 43 people have died since the 
beginning of the year 
all major train traffic was halted in the state after the 
bombings thursday night and early today the main road connecting 
assam to the rest of the country also was cut when a bomb blew up 
the bridge on the national highway police launched a dragnet for 
the militants but no arrests were reported 
the violence occurred in assams kokrajhar district 80 miles 
northwest of guwahati the state capital the area has been the 
scene of a bodo tribe bush war against the assam state government 
for two years

want to carve out their own state in the hills between the 
brahmaputra river and the kingdom of bhutan the region is about 
280 miles northeast of calcutta 
the area where most of the 4 million bodos live covers 
onethird of assam tribal leaders say they need their own state 
within the indian nation to protect their ancient culture from 
discrimination by the assamese who are mostly hindu 
violence began thursday morning when a bomb blew up a small 
truck on a road outside kokrajhar town killing eight civilians 
police said the target of the bomb was a police patrol that was to 
pass that way in the evening

stalling tactics of the central government may add an 
unwarranted dimension to the agitation 
a fifth round of talks on the bodo issue is scheduled to begin 
april 18 
about 98 percent of the bodos follow a religion called bathou 
which includes the worship of spirits believed to inhabit trees and 
rocks most of the others are christians

here is the text of a statement by the official 
soviet news agency tass admitting soviet responsibility for the 
massacre of about 4000 polish officers in the katyn forest during 
world war ii the text was translated into english by tass 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the need to elucidate the circumstances of the death of polish 
officers interned in september 1939 has long been raised at 
meetings between representatives of the soviet and polish 
leadership and in broad public circles 
historians of the two countries have conducted a careful 
investigation of the katyn tragedy including a search for 
documents 
just recently soviet archive workers and historians discovered 
some documents concerning polish servicemen who were kept in the 
kozelsk starobelsk and ostashkov camps by the nkvd security police 
it follows from these documents that in aprilmay 1940 394 of 
the 15000 or so polish officers kept in the three camps were 
transferred to the gryazovetsk camp the larger part however were 
turned over to the nkvd administrations in the smolensk 
voroshilovgrad and kalinin regions and never mentioned in nkvd 
statistical accounts since 
the discovered archival material puts direct responsibility for 
the atrocities in the katyn forest on secret police chief 
lavrenti beria vn merkulov and their henchmen 
the soviet side expressing profound regret over the katyn 
tragedy declares that this tragedy is one of the gravest crimes of 
stalinism 
copies of the discovered documents have been passed over to the 
polish side the search for more archival material continues

king birendra today agreed to let an 
opposition alliance form an interim government a top opposition 
leader said ending five days of uncertainty following the 
legalization of political parties 
ganesh man singh leader of the centrist nepali congress party 
said the new interim government will be formed by the end of next 
week he said the king made the decision during a 65minute meeting 
at the royal palace in katmandu 
a statement by the nepali congress party at the end of the 
meeting said 
his majesty approved the idea submitted by mr singh that it 
formation of a new govermnment should not be delayed any longer 
and in case his majesty is not prepared to head the government 
permission be granted to the multiparty leader 
the nepali congress party and its ally a leftwing coalition 
called the united left front had said they would not join the 
interim government unless the king or their own nominee heads it 
singh told reporters after the meeting that it was possible the 
44yearold king would head the government he did not elaborate 
but political observers have said it is unlikely the 
harvardeducated monarch will accept the post the spokesman for 
the royal palace was not available for comment today 
on sunday king birendra bowed to nationwide protests and lifted 
a 29year ban on political parties but did not explain how a new 
government would be formed or what role he would play in it 
political parties were banned in nepal when the democratically 
elected government formed by the nepali congress party was 
dismissed by king mahendra birendras father 
 
the nepali congress party went underground to push for a 
restoration of multiparty democracy and the leftwing coalition 
joined the campaign 
the movement was formally launched feb 18 and drew support from 
academicians professionals and peasants it peaked with a 
series of strikes and demonstrations last week 
 
witnesses said 200 people were killed april 6 alone when police 
fired on prodemocracy protesters the government said only 10 
people were killed 
birendra is the heir of the shaha dynasty that has held the 
throne since the middle of the 18th century many nepalis 
especially illiterate farmers who form the bulk of the countrys 17 
million people view him as the reincarnation of the hindu god 
vishnu

event will defuse tensions and provide a positive role model of 
peaceful demonstration for teenagers in this borough of 37000 
people eight miles from new york city 
about 1000 people attended wednesday nights candlelight vigil 
in which they called for a special prosecutor to investigate

the katyn massacre of polish officers has 
seared the national consciousness for 50 years and poles received 
soviet acknowledgement of responsibility today with tears from the 
memories and anger at the delay 
i regret that my mother could not live until this day said 
wanda zadrozna crying as she recalled her fathers murder in the 
russian woods 
a statement and apology by the official soviet news agency tass 
today reversed decades of insistence that the nazis murdered the 
4000 officers as well as 11000 others killed elsewhere the 
soviets had rejected the crush of evidence by historians worldwide 
but for poles for whom katyn symbolizes a long series of soviet 
crimes against their nation the impact was defused by the decades 
it took to set the record straight 
there is a great regret that it took 50 years and the wives of 
those people didnt live until this day mrs zadrozna said 
but whatever happens now it is good that the truth will be 
finally written in history she added 
a leader of an organization called the katyn family bringing 
together relatives of victims expressed happiness at the 
admission i feel a great joy now that after so many years the 
truth has been revealed said bozena lojek whose fatherinlaw 
died at katyn 
i have already received dozens of telephone calls from members 
of the katyn family for us it is a great success 
she said there is no statute of limitations on such a crime so 
the admission will have many political and economic 
consequences 
in london the british government welcomed moscows admission 
foreign secretary douglas hurd said the terrible things that 
stalin did cannot be forgotten 
its good that criminals admit their crimes solidarity 
leader lech walesa said in gdansk walesa called the soviet 
admission an act of moral justice which has been awaited for a 
long time 
he said there must also be punishment of those guilty of the 
genocide reparations stemming from the soviet occupation of 
eastern poland in 1939 and free access to soviet territory that is 
emotionally important for poles 
the tass statement came during a threeday soviet visit by 
polish president wojciech jaruzelski jaruzelski met with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and planned to visit katyn on 
saturday where an outdoor mass in polish was scheduled to honor the 
victims 
about 4250 bodies of the officers the cream of polands 
intelligentsia called up from the reserves at the start of world 
war ii were found in mass graves near the western russian city of 
smolensk 
the soviets interned the officers at a camp in kozielsk shortly 
after the red army invaded poland at the outbreak of the war at 
the time the soviet union and germany were joined in a 
nonaggression pact 
the remains of more than 10000 other officers held at camps in 
starobielsk and ostashkow have never been found and word on their 
fate remains as a key demand by organizations representing their 
families 
the katyn bodies shot in the back of the head and stacked in 
layers were found by the nazis in april 1943 and immediately used 
for propaganda purposes against the allies 
the soviets maintained that the nazis killed the officers in 
1941 after they invaded the soviet union 
polands communist governments after the war echoed the soviet 
explanation but most poles and western historians concluded that 
the massacre of class enemies was committed by the soviet 
secret police on josef stalins order in late april and early may 
1940 
we have been missing those people for so many years mrs 
zadrozna said they were not ordinary people they were people of 
science good wise people and unfortunately nothing can make up 
for this loss 
it is not only i who have been missing them personally but 
the whole country has been missing them she said

a senior official says a recent supreme 
court decision means colombia will have to return most if not all 
of the property seized from drug traffickers dealing a grave blow 
to the antidrug campaign 
judges have already returned 33 of the 430 farms houses and 
other properties worth at least 23 million that were 
confiscated by presidential decree the official said thursday he 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the supreme court ruling late last year overturned the 
presidential decree the officials comments indicated the 
government now realizes how devastating the courts decision was 
i think this may mean the war against traffickers is lost 
he said 
some judges have taken bribes from alleged traffickers who want 
their farms back and those judges who resist will almost 
certainly be killed the official said 
the governments 8monthold war on drugs that began when the 
leading presidential candidate was slain by traffickers the 
government began confiscating properties and extraditing drug 
barons to the united states for trial 
at the same time traffickers announced a counteroffensive in 
which 200 people have died barcos order to seize properties of 
suspected traffickers was one of his main weapons in his fight 
against drugs according to his decree a federal court was to 
determine the final status of the properties 
owners were to present themselves before the court and prove 
they had no ties to drug trafficking in order to recover their 
possessions 
however the supreme court late last year shifted the burden of 
proof to the administration ruling no property can be permanently 
seized unless the owner has been found guilty of a crime 
many of the owners are charged with crimes but have not been 
found guilty traffickers have traditionally bribed or intimidated 
colombian judges 
since august 15 people have been extradited but authorities 
have not captured many people considered leading traffickers 
including reputed medellin cartel leader pablo escobar that drug 
cartel is considered among the leading groups smuggling cocaine 
into the united states 
pablo escobar has not yet been found guilty of any crime 
legally he has a right to his properties said the official 
the government official accused barco of lacking foresight in 
his handling of the antidrug campaign 
before the supreme court decision i told president barco that 
we should target the 50 farms that we knew belonged to pablo 
escobar he said 
the seized farms could provide land for 20000 peasant families 
if the state could carry out a program to redistribute the 
property he said 
but he said such a program was virtually impossible 
the only way for the government to maintain control of these 
properties is through new legislation he said and any law would 
have to be passed by congress which is controlled by drug 
traffickers the official said 
his comments came one day after a car bomb exploded in the 
cocaine trafficking center of medellin killing 20 people 
including eight members of an elite police antidrug squad drug 
traffickers have been killing police officers in medellin in 
retaliation for the crackdown on drugs 
in medellin anonymous callers to local media said the cartel 
had carried out wednesdays attack in retaliation for the torture 
and murders of traffickers by police 
the government has denied the charge against the force 
authorities say the drug lords have offered to pay 4300 for 
each police officer killed in the city of 2 million colombias

president bush said today he was encouraged by 
signs that the soviet union is eager to conclude the main elements 
of a treaty to reduce longrange nuclear arms before his may summit 
with president mikhail s gorbachev 
during a flight to bermuda for a meeting with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher bush told reporters he welcomed 
gorbachevs statement to some democratic senators in moscow on 
thursday that he expected to initial the framework of a strategic 
arms treaty at the washington summit 
he was quite upbeat there the president said i viewed 
that as a very positive statement we are sending the same signals 
to our negotiators and policymakers 
after a week of mostly downbeat comments about the outlook for 
overcoming major negotiating obstacles the bush administration 
switched to a more optimistic tone on thursday 
ronald lehman director of the arms control and disarmament 
agency said in an interview with the associated press i think 
it is highly likely we will get all the major issues resolved by 
the summit 
in remarks to senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
and six other senators gorbachev stressed his determination to 
make enough progress in the strategic arms reduction talks to allow 
the main provisions of a treaty to be initialed at the washington 
summit that begins may 30 mitchell told reporters 
the start treaty is aimed at reducing the superpowers arsenals 
of longrange nuclear weapons by up to 35 percent and may provide 
the impetus for followup negotiations to make deeper reductions 
lehmans prediction marked a departure from earlier comments by 
other administration officials following last weeks meeting 
between secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
that session left administration officials dismayed at what they 
considered a soviet reversal on some aspects of the start talks 
the main problem they said was a change in the soviet position on 
including sealaunched and airlaunched cruise missiles in the pact 
and on provisions to guard against cheating 
specifically the soviets argued that the treaty should count 
airlaunched cruise missiles carried by tactical fighters as well 
as heavy bombers according to us officials 
the united states wants the rules to cover only heavy bombers 
and to count only those airlaunched cruise missiles with ranges 
above 600 miles the soviets want the range limit to be 360 miles 
the soviets also revived a demand they had dropped last fall 
that the proposed treaty require the two sides to declare limits on 
the number of sealaunched cruise missiles they would deploy 
administration officials have said they are willing to issue a 
separate declaration specifying the maximum number of sealaunched 
cruise missiles they plan to deploy but do not want that statement 
required by the strategic arms treaty 
lehman said he thought disagreement over cruise missiles could 
be ironed out before gorbachevs scheduled arrival may 30 for talks 
with bush 
but i cannot guarantee that lehman said if so i think 
we should be able to conclude a start treaty by the end of the year 
or early next year 
lehman declined to discuss a reported us proposal to limit the 
number of multiplewarhead mobile missiles on each side he 
referred to bakers comment last week that there are some things 
we just dont comment on and particularly if theres some chance 
that they are under consideration as part of our negotiations 
the issue is particularly sensitive because of uncertainty about 
how the soviets will respond and whether the matter could create a 
new obstacle to a start treaty 
one us official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
predicted that the issue would not hang up start 
despite disagreements over cruise missiles the two sides have 
reached agreement on most of the proposed 500page treaty us 
officials have said

tomato seeds distributed to schoolchildren 
were exposed to cosmic radiation during six years in space that 
could produce poisonous fruit it was reported today but a nasa 
scientist called the report unfounded and unreasonable 
there is no validity that this presents a hazard to school 
children said william h kinard chief scientist for the long 
duration exposure facility ldef which carried the seeds as one 
of 57 experiments 
an unsigned memorandum from a nasa contractor described the 
danger as remote according to the los angeles times which 
obtained a copy of the memo 
but the memo said the research director at park seed co which 
gave nasa the seeds seemed to favor against eating the 
tomatoes 
the times said the memo was written by nelson ehrlich associate 
director of the aerospace education services program at oklahoma 
state university which oversees nasas school programs 
there is a remote possibility that radiationcaused mutations 
could cause the plants to produce toxic fruit the memo said 
radiation levels in space are higher than those on earth 
no such warning was included in written materials sent to 
180000 teachers involved in the experiment designed to give 4 
million students the chance to study the effects of space exposure 
on living tissue 
kinard who is at the kennedy space center in florida said that 
no tomatoes have been grown from the seeds which were brought back 
to earth in january when the ldef was retrieved from orbit by the 
space shuttle columbia 
to think that from this very very small sample we have in 
space that something strange is happening is just unfounded and 
unreasonable he said 
kinard said he had been in contact with officials at the park 
company in greenwood sc and there is not a report from park 
that says that they are as much taken aback at the report as 
we in nasa are 
jim alston research director for the seed firm did not return 
telephone calls immediately 
the times said national aeronautics and space administration 
officials on thursday admitted there was an infinitesimal risk 
of poisonous tomatoes 
they defended the decision not to warn teachers and students 
about eating the tomatoes saying they should not be eaten as part 
of the experiment anyway the newspaper said 
the space exposed experiment developed for students seeds was 
among 57 experiments carried aboard an 11ton satellite launched by 
shuttle astronauts in april 1984 about 125 million seeds were 
stored on board in aluminum canisters 
the satellite laboratory was to remain in space only 10 months 
but because of delays and the challenger explosion it wasnt 
retrieved until january when the shuttle columbia brought it back 
to earth 
frank owens deputy director of nasas educational affairs 
division said the twopage document obtained by the times was not 
an official nasa memo 
the memo apparently was sent by mistake about two weeks ago to 
the nasajpl teaching center in suburban la crescenta which has 
been distributing the seeds throughout southern california 
it was not meant to get out like it has gotten out ehrlich 
said of the memo thursday even though the possibility is there 
it is extremely remote people shouldnt have fears 
he said the memo was meant as background information for 
about 30 employees making school presentations nationwide 
one los angeles participant in the experiment the cityrun 
barnsdall art park dropped out after learning of the memo this 
week a special planting ceremony involving children in an 
afterschool educaion program had been scheduled for wednesday but 
park officials at the last minute substituted potted seedlings for 
the spaceexposed tomato seeds 
i just couldnt believe that these would be handed out to kids 
to grow with such a potential for catastrophe said richard 
stretz the parks educational coordinator i immediately went 
out during my lunch hour and bought 12 different kinds of potted 
tomatoes and we planted those instead 
an official with the urban gardening program at the university 
of california cooperative extension in los angeles also expressed 
concerns 
i think it is a great project but i cant recommend it to any 
more schools just for safety reasons said rachel mabie youth 
gardening coordinator for the common ground garden program kids 
will eat anything that they grow

a team of wildlife conservationists 
recruited buddhist monks and students to help persuade a group of 
villagers to stop killing dolphins for food an american 
conservationist said friday 
michael bailey a director of earthtrust said he and six 
colleagues from the preservation group spent the past two weeks on 
penghu island where villagers for years have eaten dolphins 
bailey said in an interview that conservationists flew to 
penghu 60 miles southwest of the main island of taiwan last month 
when it was reported the villagers had captured 60 dolphins 
he said the residents slaughtered some for food and kept the 
rest in a pen as tourist attractions but bailey said several 
dolphins died because of polluted water in the harbor the 
conservation group based in hawaii helped teach the villagers how 
to keep dolphins in captivity for tourists 
he said penghu residents welcomed earthtrusts suggestion to 
develop the island known for its coral reefs and varied sealife 
into a tourist resort 
bailey said he also has encouraged taiwan authorities to enact 
legislation to ban the slaughter of dolphins 
this week three us tuna canners including the worlds 
largest starkist decided not to buy or sell tuna captured along 
with dolphins 
environmental groups predicted the move by companies selling the 
starkist bumble bee and chicken of the sea brands will save some 
of the estimated 100000 dolphins that die annually in huge nets 
used to catch schools of tuna

a man shot and killed one of a group of young 
men who robbed him on a subway car then fled at the next stop 
police said today 
the thiefs companions also fled when the train reached the next 
subway station in the borough of brooklyn 
the robbery was committed late thursday by a group of three 
young men in their teens or early 20s who were among a group of 
about 18 people traveling together transit authority police 
spokesman al oleary said 
the shooting recalled the 1984 case of bernhard goetz the 
subway gunman who shot four teenagers he said were about to rob 
him goetz was cleared of attempted murder charges but served a 
jail term for illegal gun possession 
oleary said robbery victim was described as being in his late 
40s or early 50s he said the robbers grabbed him lifted him up 
went through his pockets took his wallet and threw him back on the 
seat 
he said the group had a gun but it was not used by the robbers 
they apparently were passing it around examining it said 
oleary 
the assailants had a retractable razor knife he said 
the accosted man fired three shots one of which hit a robber in 
the chest the robbers and the shooter bolted at the next stop 
police were questioning companions of the robbers as well as 
independent witnesses to the shooting 
the dead mans identity was not released pending notification of 
family 
as in the goetz case the robbed man was white and the accosters 
were black but police are not ascribing racial motives to the 
incident oleary said 
he cautioned against comparisons to the goetz case 
the major difference is goetz believed he was going to become 
a crime victim and in cases since the people who reacted had 
already been victimized very different situations in the eyes of 
the law he said

the borders opened by a revolution were 
clogged by traffic friday as west germans celebrated their easter 
weekend by heading into suddenly fashionable east germany 
protesters upset with heavy traffic blocked a berlinarea bridge 
that was the scene of many spy swaps between east and west in past 
years 
the government of prime minister lothar de maiziere which 
assumed power thursday eased passport checks to deal with the 
holiday crush border guards were just glancing at the passports of 
germans rather than opening them to verify identifications 
long lines of cars clogged border points and most of the 
traffic was heading from west to east east germany and east berlin 
in general have become tourist meccas since the october revolt 
ended four decades of communism 
one hundred people have come through here at just my 
counter said peter muller an employee at an east berlin 
currency exchange office 
a line of eastbound bumpertobumper traffic stretching about 40 
miles was reported near the west german city of hannover a snarl 
of 30 miles was reported at the border crossing of helmstedt 
the glienicker bridge between west berlin and the east german 
city of potsdam the scene of numerous spy swaps between east and 
west during the cold war period was blocked by about 50 protesters 
for 30 minutes 
the protesters were angry about the heavy traffic and demanded 
the bridge be closed to vehicles 
in the historic east german city of weimar parking downtown was 
banned because of the crush the government news service adn said 
downtown parking also was banned in the east german city of 
schwerin 
traffic was reported heavy throughout the germanys on friday 
the traditional start of the long easter weekend most germans had 
the day off 
much of the traffic problems in east germany have been 
attributed to the antiquated system of roads some experts say it 
will cost billions of dollars to upgrade them to accommodate 
increased traffic from the west 
west germany expects to spend about 117 million this year just 
to make basic repairs to the new border crossings 
about 10000 propertydamage accidents involving west german and 
east german vehicles have occurred since jan 1 the huk 
association of auto insurers announced this month that compared to 
an average of 4500 for the same period in recent years

the soviet union today admitted for the first time 
that its secret police murdered 15000 polish officers during world 
war ii including thousands in the katyn forest in what it called 
one of the most horrifying stalinist crimes 
the tass news agency issued an official statement and apology as 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev met with polish president 
wojciech jaruzelski 
western historians concluded years ago that the soviets were 
responsible for killing the captive officers many of whom were 
shot in the back of the head but moscows refusal to admit it was 
a barrier to better sovietpolish relations jaruzelski is 
scheduled to visit katyn on saturday 
until today the soviet union had blamed nazi germany for the 
katyn massacre the katyn forest located near smolensk southwest 
of moscow was captured by germany during world war ii and later 
recaptured by the red army 
while the nazis invaded poland from the west in 1939 to start 
world war ii the soviets invaded from the east germany and the 
soviet union had signed a nonaggression pact that assigned them 
spheres of influence in eastern europe 
at the beginning of the war the soviets captured the officers 
whom the soviets could have considered a threat as potential future 
leaders stalin had killed many members of his own officer corps in 
the 1930s accusing them of disloyalty 
the katyn massacre of the polish officers was first disclosed in 
1943 by the nazis who attributed it to stalins secret police 
more than 4000 bodies have been found in a mass grave in the 
forest an additional 11000 polish officers were killed elsewhere 
and their bodies have never been found 
records indicate that only 394 of the prisoners held at katyn 
were transferred to the gryazovetsky prison camp and the rest were 
turned over to the nkvd the predecessor of the kgb 
although the tass statement referred specifically to katyn it 
tied the fates of all 15000 officers together all of the officers 
disappeared entirely from nkvd records tass said 
at their meeting in the kremlin gorbachev gave jaruzelski 
copies of material from soviet archives pertaining to the poles 
imprisoned in the nkvd camps tass reported it did not report any 
comments the two leaders may have made about the soviet statement 
on katyn 
the soviet statement said the archive material discovered 
recently allowed officials now to blame stalins secret police 
chief lavrenti beria his protege vn merkulov and their 
henchmen 
the soviet side expressing its deep regret in connection with 
the katyn tragedy states that it is one of the most horrifying 
stalinist crimes tass said 
todays soviet admission came one day after east germanys new 
parliament apologized to jews for nazi atrocities and apologized 
for the deaths of 20 million soviets during world war ii 
in warsaw poles received soviet acknowledgement of 
responsibility with renewed expressions of anger at the delay and 
tears over the massacre that has seared the national consciousness 
for 50 years 
i regret that my mother could not live until this day said 
wanda zadrozna crying as she recalled her fathers murder in the 
russian woods 
its good that criminals admit their crimes solidarity 
leader lech walesa said in gdansk he called the soviet admission 
an act of moral justice which has been awaited for a long time 
he said there must also be punishment of those guilty of the 
genocide reparations stemming from the soviet occupation of 
eastern poland in 1939 and free access to soviet territory that is 
emotionally important for poles 
several soviet newspapers reports recently have placed the 
blame for the murders on the soviet side but until today the 
government had not admitted it 
viktor filatov editor of voyennoistoricheskii journal said he 
plans to publish archives proving that josef stalins secret police 
killed at least 4500 of the 15000 polish prisoners the interfax 
news agency said thursday 
the fate of the rest is yet to be established he told 
interfax the information agency of radio moscow 
but he said the newly surfaced archival documents add to 
mounting evidence of the repressive policy that stalins regime 
pursued toward both soviet and foreign citizens 
filatov said he did not have the documents in hand and he did 
not give a date of publication 
on march 22 the weekly moscow news published a twopage report 
rebutting allegations that nazi invaders mowed down polish officers 
held prisoner just south of the western russian city of smolensk 
other articles have called for the truth about katyn and a 
special government commission was established last year to 
investigate the massacre no date has been given however for 
release of its findings

president bush today welcomed a 
declaration from soviet president mikhail s gorbachev that he 
wants to initial a nuclear arms agreement with the united states 
next month we are sending the same signals to our negotiators 
and policymakers bush said 
the president also expressed understanding for gorbachevs 
objections to lectures from washington about lithuania 
however bush said i will continue to say what i think 
bush made the comments as he flew to this atlantic ocean island 
for talks with british prime minister margaret thatcher on changes 
in eastern europe and bushs fiveday summit with gorbachev 
beginning may 30 
on an overcast day bush and mrs thatcher reviewed the bermuda 
regiment in front of the oceanside government house before sitting 
down for a closed meeting 
bush and mrs thatcher met for just over two hours in their 
morning session and according to a statement by presidential press 
secretary marlin fitzwater discussed a full range of 
international issues facing the north atlantic alliessional and political 
leaders it was added 
when he found professional organizations lacked basic texts even 
roberts rules of order 
american corporations would underwrite costs of the books 
their investment to be justified by the marketing and public 
relations dividends their sponsorship would deliver 
what a great way for american companies to become known in the 
new market economies of europe he muses contemplating how they 
might benefit from a simple notation on the rear cover 
compliments of xyz company for example 
foundations us government agencies associations and other 
groups might participate as joint sponsors 
title selection would be made by a board comprised of us 
publishers editors educators librarians and government 
officials educators and publishers in selected foreign countries 
might also make suggestions 
administration and development would be through a 
notforprofit organization perhaps international friendship 
books inc that benjamin is ready to develop and direct 
for benjamin the idea isnt new for years he has traveled the 
world and wherever he went the idea was nurtured earlier he had 
hoped to develop the plan for china and india but scarcity of us 
products there delayed him 
when eastern europes socialist nations decided on market 
economies rather than economies dictated centrally by communist 
officials the idea became more urgent 
much depends on the cooperation of us companies but benjamin 
thinks hell get it why first as media books are one of the 
few games in town he says in eastern europe he explains 
access to conventional advertising is either nonexistent or 
severely limited 
next he says books are highly revered and respected by these 
people read and reread passed on to others and read again 
theyre never discarded 
its a rare situation in which everyone seems to win benjamin 
a well trophied golfer who spends many hours on the course and who 
still must work at his own business says he isnt afraid of the 
added task 
he says simply id like to repay some of the dividends and 
fulfillment my work has given me over the years

a group of japanese women is trying to knock down a 
centuriesold rule that bars members of their sex from the sumo 
wrestling ring 
though the group argues that sexism has no place in national 
sport it is not pressing for women to actually participate in the 
2000yearold sport with the giant male grapplers 
instead the womens action group simply wants to send a woman 
into the ring to present its new women fans award 
but things are not that simple in this society where men still 
have a stranglehold on sumo wrestling 
i dont know why its just been that way since long long 
ago said a japan sumo association official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity its always been against the rules for 
women to get into the ring simple as that 
michiyo inobe a member of the womens action group said her 
group of 500 members mostly women decided against calling for the 
rules outright abolition because they were afraid public sentiment 
could go against them 
i think it is a kind of miniature of japanese society in 
general but many people in japan accept sumo as a mans world as 
a special society of its own inobe said 
the ban on women in the ring is believed to be based on beliefs 
in shinto japans native religion that women are impure 
at the very least we are more pure than the dirt and straw 
ring a statement from the group said 
the rule became an issue in december when the chief cabinet 
secretary at the time mayumi moriyama wanted to present the prime 
ministers cup to the winner of the new years tournament 
mrs moriyama a member of parliament and the first woman ever 
to hold the important cabinet post said she would present the 
government award from within the ring not from below 
sumo officials refused to part with their malesonly tradition 
saying the sumo ring a raised mound of clay 148 feet across is 
sacred 
the association also pointed out that the award was generally 
presented to the winning wrestler not by the chief cabinet 
secretary but by a noncabinet level vice minister 
after a flurry of media coverage mrs moriyama said she had 
made her point and dropped the request 
the affair didnt end there though 
at each of the six annual sumo tournaments 25 awards are 
presented including five by foreign embassies the womens group 
decided it wanted a woman to present its new women fans award 
sumo calls itself the national sport said the womens 
group women make up 51 percent of this nation a good deal of 
sumos popularity comes from the support of women 
indeed the 2000yearold sport has gained many female fans 
schoolgirls are allowed to join in local competitions 
its not true that they cant change the rule because it is 
part of sumo tradition inobe said they have made many changes 
to keep up with the times 
women were not allowed to even watch sumo bouts until 1778 and 
then only on a tournaments final day it took another hundred 
years for women to gain access to all 15 days of the tournaments

former sen lawton chiles one of 
floridas most popular politicians came out of retirement to enter 
the gubernatorial race and within hours was fielding questions 
about his use of an antidepressant drug 
the democrat resigned from the senate in january 1989 saying he 
was burned out by bigmoney politics and the grind of the 
federal bureaucracy he said thursday he wanted to keep florida 
from being beaten down by the same problems and vowed to unseat 
gov bob martinez with a nofrills campaign 
republican officials began circulating rumors about chiles 
depression almost immediately after his announcement and chiles 
discussed the issue with reporters from several newspapers 
ive had depression and sought treatment chiles was quoted 
as saying i think i was depressed about what was going on in the 
state now im going to do something about it 
chiles 60 said he has been taking the drug prozac the most 
frequently prescribed antidepressant since resigning from the 
senate he said he is just now completing his treatment with the 
drug and acknowledged that his depression could become an issue in 
the race 
he did not immediately return a phone call today by the 
associated press 
in entering the race chiles said he would limit campaign 
contributions to 100 even though his two democratic opponents 
rep bill nelson and state sen george stuart have already raised 
nearly 6 million between them for the sept 4 primary that figure 
has already been surpassed by martinez a republican 
i look around in this country and i hear those voices in the 
countryside chiles said one of those things i hear is that 
money doesnt vote people vote 
chiles literally walked across the state in his first successful 
senate campaign in 1970 he swept home in the 1976 and 1982 
reelections and became chairman of the influential senate budget 
committee 
his running mate will be former rep kenneth buddy mackay 
who lost his bid in 1988 to capture the senate seat vacated by 
chiles 
martinez who is winding up a tumultous first term in office 
said chiles candidacy only boosts his reelection bid 
they have some difficulty figuring out how theyre going to 
beat me he said its just part of their struggle to figure 
out how theyre going to stay in power in the state of florida when 
the tide is going against them 
after leaving the senate chiles became director of the leroy 
collins center for public policy a think tank at florida state 
university in tallahassee he resigned from that position late

under heavy security a day after religious 
riots pilgrims from around the world carted wooden crosses through 
jerusalems old city on good friday to commemorate the passion and 
death of jesus christ 
the traditional procession route along the via dolorosa or way 
of sorrow was jammed with people praying and singing the narrow 
street echoed with chants in greek english spanish italian and 
arabic 
security was heavier than usual following riots in the arab 
christian quarter of the old walled city a day earlier 
among those standing with candles watching fridays procession 
was rene koutroulis of new york city who was pleased to see people 
from different christian sects worshiping together 
everybody i think is united and i see on their faces that 
they came in good faith said ms koutroulis today we are 
united tomorrow we may fight again 
israeli police thursday fired tear gas and rubber bullets to 
break up demonstrations by greek orthodox clerics and 
stonethrowing palestinian youths protesting the establishment of a 
jewish settlement in the christian quarter 
a court ruling late thursday ordered the settlers out and 
appeared to cool tempers among the protesters the settlers said 
they would appeal the decision 
on friday scores of police and paramilitary border troops armed 
with assault rifles and teargas grenades patrolled the old city 
no major incidents were reported 
still pilgrims who paraded to the church of the holy sepulcher 
the basilica that covers the tomb of christ were reminded of the 
holy lands political problems 
an palestinian flag hung surreptitiously overnight by arab 
activists flew throughout good friday from the cross atop the 
venerated church palestinian flags are outlawed in israel 
jerusalems old city is divided into jealously guarded ethnic 
quarters that are home to 50000 moslems about 7000 christians 
and 4000 jews 
the entire area is caught up in the israelipalestinian problem 
since the old city is part of the land captured by israel from 
jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
for most christians good friday is the most solemn of holy days 
in the church calendar and the preface to one of the most joyful 
easter sunday 
lidwien van dongen 27 of denhaag the netherlands said she 
was very impressed that people from all over the world come to 
jerusalem to walk the way jesus walked 
mervat azer a travel agent from jersey city nj said she had 
not been able to anticipate the beauty of jerusalem or the feelings 
she would experience praying here 
we are praying near the place where christ was buried she 
said tomorrow his light will be very bright 
although thursdays violence had ended by the time of the 
christian processions the day was not without moments of drama 
at one point a man whose clothes were splattered with blood and 
mud ran through the crowd of pilgrims 
it turned out to be swedish actor dolph lundgren who was being 
filmed by an american crew for the movie cover up about a 
journalist in israel 
the script called for lundgren to fall to one knee get up and 
resume his run but an israeli plainclothes officer thinking 
lundgren was in trouble rushed to his assistance 
the scene was reshot 
the city was especially crowded because both the eastern 
orthodox churches and the western latin rite churches are 
celebrating easter week at the same time 
the christian feast this year also overlaps with ramadan the 
moslem month of fasting and passover the eightday jewish 
commemoration of the israelites flight from egypt 
israeli officials estimated 45000 foreigners would visit 
jerusalem during easter week

the bush administration is setting new 
immigration rules for foreigners with aids who want to attend 
conferences in the united states an administration source said 
today 
but the white house will not support a move in congress to take 
aids off a list of diseases used to bar entry to the country the 
source said 
the action would allow foreigners to come to the united states 
to attend a conference without revealing whether they are infected 
with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids 
said the source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
pressure has been building on the administration by aids 
activists to remove hiv from the list of contagious diseases 
dozens of organizations are protesting the policy by boycotting an 
aids conference in san francisco in june 
under current policy a foreigner with hiv who wants to come to 
the united states must apply for a waiver the justice department 
has been expediting that process for people who want to attend 
conferences including the aids conference in june 
under the new policy which was expected to be announced on 
friday foreigners who want to attend a us conference would not 
have to reveal whether they have hiv and would be allowed to enter 
the country for 10 days said the source 
the person will never be asked if they have aids so they 
wont have to lie or be recorded some place as having hiv the 
source said 
the new policy would apply only to individuals who are attending 
a business academic or scientific conference the source said 
this is our best assessment of what the best solution to the 
problem is the source said we were looking for something that 
will work and can happen 
congress in 1987 put hiv on the list of contagious diseases and 
though the federal centers for disease control recently recommended 
that it be removed the administration has said it lacks the 
authority to do so 
a bill introduced in congress last week would give the 
department of health and human services authority over the list 
opening the way for hhs to act on cdcs recommendation 
but the administration is convinced the bill introduced by rep 
rowland dga would not be passed even with white house support 
said the source

business inventories fell in february for the 
second time in three months while sales surged in another sign that 
the economy has avoided a recession the government said friday 
inventories on shelves and backlots shrank 04 percent the 
steepest drop since december 1986 to a seasonally adjusted 7946 
billion in february the commerce department reported 
sales meanwhile rose 13 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
5354 billion it was the largest increase in seven months all of 
the strength came in manufacturing the sector of the economy that 
had been most affected by sluggishness resulting from the federal 
reserve boards high interest rate policy 
in january business sales rose 04 percent enough to stay 
ahead of the 03 percent increase in inventories 
i think the economy is picking up a little steam and well see 
a decent first half said economist david berson of the federal 
national mortgage association 
he and other analysts view the combination of surging sales and 
falling inventories is a sign of strength a sharp buildup in 
inventories can lead to a recession retailers and wholesalers with 
too many goods stop ordering more in response factories cut 
production and lay off workers 
the february activity sharply reduced the ratio of business 
inventories to sales to 148 down from 151 in january that means 
it would take 148 months to exhaust inventories at the february 
sales pace 
that suggests as much as anything that this economy has 
skirted a recession said economist james annable of first 
national bank of chicago 
the inventory decline was steepest at retailers where backlogs 
dropped 09 percent production cutbacks by auto companies have 
allowed dealers to reduce their stock of cars by 22 percent 
despite sluggish sales 
wholesale inventories declined 02 percent while factory 
backlogs edged down 01 percent 
manufacturing sales surged 33 percent in february while retail 
sales fell 03 percent and wholesale sales declined 01 percent 
in an advance report earlier this week the department said 
march retail sales fell 06 percent

donald trumps new taj majal casino in 
atlantic city with its minarets and huge stone elephants has left 
many here wondering or worrying what the megadeveloper plans 
for an encore 
but details concerning trumps grand design for the site of the 
historic ambassador hotel remain by and large the sultans secret 
three months ago the new york billionaire revealed he had 
become a partner in a group that bought the boardedup hotel with 
the intention of razing it and building a new project the 
development at the 24acre site on wilshire boulevard would be 
trumps first in the nations secondlargest city 
hes hinted that he may try to put up the worlds tallest 
building a tower of 125 stories or more if plans for a similarly 
outsized building are thwarted in new york city 
such talk has worried environmentalists bob hattoy of the 
sierra club quipped that trump was giving the city an edifice 
complex but it remains just talk 
we havent formally announced anything in terms of how tall or 
how wide said barbara res the trump organization vice president 
who is shepherding the deal 
whatever its shape the 1 billion project would give los 
angeles something it lacks a landmark comparable to the eiffel 
tower or rockefeller center res said in a recent telephone 
interview 
we anticipate having a major shopping area a luxury hotel a 
very large one with a very very large banquet and ballroom 
facility maybe on the order of 50000 square feet a lot of 
office space and a housing element she said 
the ambassador was home to the cocoanut grove nightclub where 
the rich and famous in southern california came to play but is 
perhaps best known as the place where robert f kennedy was 
assassinated in 1968 the hotel its glamour now faded finally 
closed in january 1989 
with no specifics to react to yet not even an artists concept 
the potential opponents of trumps development are left with little 
to say 
theres nothing on the table said jay rounds executive 
director of the los angeles conservancy a nonprofit historic 
preservation group we dont deal in critiques of press 
conferences 
a spokesman for mayor tom bradley reflecting the views of 
several local politicians said we need to wait until we see 
specifics of the project before we can discuss it in detail 
the scarcity of details on design or financing has prompted 
speculation that trump wanted the publicity only to gain leverage 
against new york officials who have held up his plans for a 
150story tower on the hudson river 
perhaps the fact that i go out to la will change things in 
new york trump told the new york times in february he denied 
trying to play new york and los angeles off against each other but 
added his plans for the worlds tallest building could go to 
either place and it will only go to one 
could such a building be put up in an earthquakeprone area 
theres no inherent reason why you cant build a building in 
the range of 125 stories to be resistant to an earthquake said 
wilford iwan a professor of earthquake engineering at the 
california institute of technology 
but iwan added that really big structures tend to be quite 
flexible and the way such a building would sway in a quake or 
strong wind could make people inside feel uncomfortable 
another concern is fire especially since city fire officials 
acknowledged that the 1988 inferno in the 62story first interstate 
tower then the states tallest building came perilously close to 
exceeding the metropolitan areas firefighting resources 
among those who voice few doubts about trumps intentions is 
jackie goldberg president of the citys board of education 
the los angeles unified school district which is busing 4000 
wilshirearea students at a cost of 6 million a year wants to 
take over the property as the site for a desparately needed new 
high school but the board has found itself stymied repeatedly by 
the trump organization goldberg said 
were involved with somebody here who is accustomed to getting 
his own way and has the funds and the lack of public scrutiny to 
do it goldberg fumed 
when school officials asked the state allocation board for 120 
million to pay for the land they discovered that lobbyists hired 
by trump already had persuaded members of the obscure state agency 
to withhold the funds 
the board instead ordered district officials to work out a 
compromise with the billionaire developer whose representatives 
offered to find an alternate site for the school

roughly a quarter of a billion peeps 
and bunnies those ubiquitous easter marshmallow treats will 
be tucked in countless easter baskets sunday and many will go 
stale on purpose 
we make one for every man woman and child in the country 
said david shaffer vice president of just born inc a company 
fueled by sugar and nostalgia 
the bunnies and chicks called peeps by the company have 
been around since 1953 so baby boomers are instinctively filling 
their childrens baskets with the yellow pink and white 
confections he said 
i think nostalgia pretty much sums it up shaffer said 
thursday its kind of odd i never thought of it that way but 
weve had a product thats been around so long that it brings back 
childhood memories 
there is considerable debate over proper peep eating 
most people shaffer concedes like them stale 
its kind of ironic because we go to a great deal of expense 
to keep them fresh he said 
achieving that certain level of staleness is an art he said 
theres the slow process where theyll tear the cellophane 
and leave them out and theyll dry out and shrivel up 
others who cant wait that long and cant stand to see them 
die a slow death do the flashfreeze approach by putting them in a 
frostfree freezer a frostfree freezer sucks the moisture out 
and theyll do it to a peep in no time flat 
shaffers preference i personally dont care for fresh 
marshmallow he said i dont like them stale but a little 
firm

the grateful dead a san francisco bay 
area institution since the late 60s has been banned from the 
university of california berkeley and stanford university 
both bayarea schools have told the band it is no longer welcome 
to perform its annual concerts on their campuses because of 
troublesome deadhead fans some of whom who like to camp out 
and use drugs while awaiting concerts 
uc berkeley police lt pat carroll said 30 to 50 arrests are 
made each summer when the dead does its threeconcert stand most 
arrests are drugrelated carroll said 
at stanford police said they arrest about the same number of 
people and could arrest many more if they had the manpower 
one uc berkeley official said the problem is that deadheads 
fans who follow the band to their shows across the country come 
early and stay late 
they tend to come and camp for a week in the grove of trees 
outside frost the stanford amphitheater said stanford associate 
dean of students michael l jackson and they stay for days 
afterward 
band spokesman dennis mcnally expressed disappointment about the 
decisions saying the group has worked to discourage the 
bazaarlike atmosphere that develops outside the concerts 
he said the band is trying to halt sales of anything outside its 
concerts and discourages camping 
the grateful dead has been around since 1967 gaining attention 
as a hippie band that gave free concerts in golden gate park 
but it was the 1985 in the dark album that became the deads 
most successful to date producing the bands first no 1 hit 
touch of gray with its repeated lyric line we shall 
survive 
david gans an oakland author and dead expert said in the 
dark attracted a huge new generation of fans 
he said banning the dead from uc berkeleys greek theatre and 
stanfords frost amphitheater shows how our society has changed 
obviously there is a drug scene this is what the local 
constabulary has seized upon 
i know of grandmothers who are fans i know multigenerational 
families from san leandro who love the dead gans said

the state department said friday it welcomes 
an offer by iraq to destroy chemical weapons but does not believe 
the destruction should be part of a deal under which israel would 
destroy its chemical and nuclear arms 
we have made clear that we oppose linking the elimination of 
chemical weapons systems to other issues or weapons systems said 
richard boucher a state department spokesman 
that said we would of course welcome any offer to destroy 
chemical weapons he added 
on thursday sen james a mcclure ridaho said that during 
conversations in the iraqi city of mosul iraqs president saddam 
hussein repeated an offer to destroy his arsenal of chemical and 
other nonconventional weapons if israel agrees to eliminate 
chemical and nuclear weapons 
boucher noted that more than 70 nations are negotiating a treaty 
that would ban chemical weapons from the face of the earth 
were the question of chemical weapons to be linked to other 
issues we think it would only delay the conclusion of this very 
important treaty boucher said 
as far as nuclear weapons go we have consistently urged all 
countries to join the nonproliferation treaty and abide by its 
provisions and safeguards boucher said

alberto fujimori a softspoken agricultural 
engineer who enjoys growing rosebushes in his backyard has 
suddenly become the man most likely to take the helm of peru one 
of latin americas most ungovernable nations 
the 51yearold japanese peruvian came out of nowhere in 
sundays presidential election to rob a majority from novelist 
mario vargas llosa and force him into a runoff 
pollsters say the centrist independents popularity is growing 
daily as vargas llosas support declines with the likely support 
of leftist parties in a june runoff fujimori appears unbeatable 
the lima press dubbed his rise the fujimori phenomenon 
headlines told of vargas llosa getting swept away by a tsunami 
a tidal wave of fujimania 
imagine the inability of these political parties to manage an 
electoral campaign it makes me laugh that theyve come out looking 
so ridiculous fujimori said in an interview with the associated 
press one of his first since the election 
he compared his campaign strategy to the martial arts you 
take advantage of the forces of the other boom boom wherever they 
lead he said slicing his hand through an imaginary brick 
vargas llosa also an independent and his rightofcenter 
democratic front coalition spent more than 36 million on his 
campaign according to the respected news magazine caretas 
fujimori who sold a house his car and a tractor to raise 
campaign funds spent about 180000 
he claims to be the only candidate truly independent of 
professional politicians but he has shown political skill 
which some say he honed during his years as a university rector in 
a country where universities are highly politicized 
in the early days of his campaign he posed for photographers 
dressed as a samurai warrior and a karate expert he said it was 
necessary to get attention 
within days after sundays vote vargas llosa was meeting with 
advisers and pondering his political future at a friends beach 
home south of lima he reportedly considered dropping out of the 
race 
fujimori meanwhile was attending to the pack of reporters 
camped in front of his middleclass lima home posing for pictures 
with some chinese squash and handing out flowers from his garden 
fujimori has avoided specifics throughout his sixmonth 
campaign speaking instead of broad social goals like improved 
health care and revitalizing industry 
analysts say fujimoris success was due to voters alarm over 
vargas llosas explicit plan for drastic austerity measures and 
their wariness of the oldtime politicians in the democratic front 
fujimori is one of five children and the oldest son of japanese 
immigrants who came to peru in 1934 from the city of kumamoto on 
the southern japanese island of kyushu 
his father worked at various jobs including an upholstery shop 
he opened in downtown lima the family lost the business during a 
boycott of japanese businesses during world war ii 
fujimori earned a degree in agricultural engineering from the 
national agrarian university in 1960 and later served as the 
schools rector from 1984 to 1989 he has studied in france 
belgium and the united states he speaks spanish japanese 
english french and german 
though his parents were buddhists fujimori grew up a catholic 
in this overwhelmingly catholic country 
he doesnt mind if people view him as smart honest and 
hardworking because he is japanese but he says hes 100 percent 
peruvian and has only an ancestral connection to japan 
he describes himself as studious introverted without any 
common vices and says working is his hobby he works 12 to 13 
hours a day and refuses to eat or drink anything between meals i 
dont want to be distracted he said 
usually dressed in a threepiece suit fujimori appears stiff 
and serious when he meets with the public but voters have warmed 
to him and his promises of discipline and hard work 
he says his political movement called simply change 90 is an 
expression of people who are tired of the old corrupt political 
parties and who just want to work 
fujimori has support in perus growing evangelical community 
whose leaders see in him the simple honest president the country 
needs one of his two vicepresidential candidates is carlos 
garcia a baptist pastor the other is maximo san roman a bread 
factory owner who has perfected ways of making bread from carrots 
and sweet potatoes

king birendra has agreed to let an 
opposition alliance head an interim government a leader of the 
7weekold prodemocracy movement reported friday 
a separate opposition statement said it was willing to allow the 
king himself to head the government but it would step in if he 
chose not to the king who has generally stayed above the daily 
management of the government was believed unlikely to assume its 
leadership 
the political uncertainty stems from birendras proclamation 
five days ago after popular demonstrations that he would lift the 
29yearold ban on political parties birendra then invited the 
nepali congress party and united left front which together led the 
prodemocracy movement to join the interim government 
on friday after a 65minute meeting with the king at the royal 
palace in katmandu nepali congress leader ganesh man singh said 
the 44yearold monarch was ready to allow the opposition to lead 
an interim government until elections can be held 
the meeting was the first between birendra and the 75yearold 
singh since the prodemocracy movement burgeoned in february 
the government of this himalayan kingdom first reacted to the 
prodemocracy campaign with a bloody crackdown witnesses said 200 
people were killed when security forces fired on a crowd of 200000 
marching to the palace april 6 the government said 10 people were 
killed and 107 that day 
singh was invited to the palace friday after the nepali congress 
party and the sevenparty united left front set nine conditions for 
joining the interim government 
the conditions included an assurance that the new government 
would not be headed by a member of the nonpartisan national 
assembly the rashtriya panchayat which is dominated by loyalist 
legislators 
calling the king the lesser of the two evils the nepali 
congress said it was willing to allow the king to head the council 
of ministers until general elections can be held 
a statement issued by the nepali congress after the palace 
meeting said birendra agreed that in case he was not prepared to 
head the government permission be granted to the multiparty 
leaders to form the interim government 
singh said the king has also agreed to discuss the other eight 
conditions which include dismissal of the present government 
dissolution of the rashtriya panchayat and reforms in the 
constitution the constitution gives the king absolute legislative 
executive and judicial powers 
unless these preconditions are met we will not form the 
government nepali congress president kp bhattarai told 
reporters he said the king reacted positively to the demands 
however he did not elaborate 
singh said by next week we will sort it out 
by the end of next week a new government will be formed he 
added 
political observers have said that the king is unlikely to 
accept the governments leadership 
no royal spokesman was not available for comment 
while singh was meeting with birendra foreign minister 
pashupati rana indicated his government would not accept an 
opposition member as head of the interim administration 
our position is that the interim government has been 
constituted rana told reporters referring to the present 
government of prime minister lokendra chand appointed after his 
predecessor resigned april 5

dont tell 19yearold andrei umrikhin that 
president mikhail s gorbachev does not care 
after trying for a year and a half to buy some new socks in his 
small village in southern russia umrikhin sent a letter directly 
to gorbachev a little more than a month later the creaky soviet 
retail system coughed up new socks not only for umrikhin and his 
family but for the whole village 
it was not only socks that appeared in the local store 
toothpaste and soap did too 
to tell the truth i still wonder whether it was all a 
coincidence or whether the socks really were from the central 
committee said umrikhin reached by telephone in his village of 
beloye about 280 miles south of moscow 
at first i prayed for gorbachev but i dont believe in him 
any more because after five years of perestroika i had to write 
him a letter to get a pair of socks he added 
but personally i am very grateful to him and to the whole 
party apparatus for helping me out in such a predicament 
sergei borodin the ideology chief of the communist party in 
umrikhins district said the young man is really a nogood 
loafer he said umrikhin spent his time selling unofficial 
newspapers until authorities put a stop to it and he was trying to 
get back at them 
umrikhin said he endured holes in his socks for months until he 
was called for the spring draft 
it occurred to him he would have to appear before young nurses 
at the local clinic in his old socks and it was more than he could 
bear he wrote to gorbachev at the end of february 
dear mikhail sergeyevich please send me and my family some 
socks he recalled saying in his letter but because we are 
rather hard pressed financially send us cheap socks please if 
you can and i beg you not to think that this is some kind of 
prank i am positively serious about it 
umrikhins mother makes about 90 rubles a month just above the 
official poverty level as a cleaning woman he earns about the 
same amount and his twin brother has a students stipend of about 
70 rubles a month 
their 13yearold brother lives with them in about 20 square 
yards of space half a rundown duplex with no modern conveniences 
three weeks after writing gorbachev umrikhin received a 
postcard saying his letter had been registered at the the general 
department of the communist party central committee in moscow 
two weeks later the district party secretary called umrikhin 
and told him to go to his local distribution center for consumer 
goods 
there he was referred back to his local store and sold a pair 
of new socks for 170 rubles about the cheapest available in the 
soviet union 
and the next day after standing in line with other villagers 
this time i officially bought the same kind of socks for the rest 
of my family he said 
his story appeared in the kursk newspaper young guard under the 
headline socks from gorbachev at the beginning of april and was 
picked up by a national newspaper 
borodin the local communist party official said it all was 
done to embarrass party leaders 
it was an act of malice and revenge he said it was 
nothing substantial to make a fuss about just socks every region 
any time may be struck with a temporary shortage of something or 
other these things do happen so what should everybody write a 
letter to gorbachev

five police officers will stand trial on 
charges of using unnecessary force to break up a human chain 
peace demonstration in december police said friday 
the district commander who ordered force to be used in 
dispersing the protesters will be transferred from his post police 
said 
the state prosecutor dorit beinish recommended the actions in 
a report that blamed the police for aggravating the protest dec 
30 officers charged protesters clubbed them and fired tear gas 
and rubber bullets as they tried to link arms around jerusalems 
walled old city 
more than 50 people were injured in the melee including an 
italian tourist who lost her eye when a water cannon shattered the 
glass of her hotel window 
the source of escalation did not lie with the protesters but 
with the action of the police beinish wrote in the 17page 
report according to the haaretz and davar newspapers 
a justice ministry spokeswoman could not be reached for comment 
because of the passover holiday 
according to the newspapers the prosecutors report also 
criticized the internal police investigation of the affair for 
failing to identify the officers who fired the rubber bullets 
despite news photographs and tv footage of the incident 
the claim that it is impossible to identify those who opened 
fire is unacceptable and therefore the investigation must be 
completed beinish wrote 
her report also criticized the police commander on the scene for 
not having first warned the protesters to leave before ordering 
them dispersed by force 
police spokesman roni yeshayahu said police commissioner yaakov 
turner had adopted all the state prosecutors recommendations and 
would reopen the investigation 
he said criminal charges would be brought against three officers 
accused of beating a photographer and two other officers would be 
brought before a disciplinary court on charges of using unnecessary 
force 
the state prosecutors report resulted from appeals from peace 
activists and tourists who took part in the protest and complained 
of excessive use of force by police 
the police action prompted formal complaints from the italian 
government and european community and the european parliament 
recommended that some cultural and technological exchange 
activities between europe and israel be suspended

the past eight years if you could bottle it you could make a 
million dollars he was destined to be a leader 
hardisons mother adlene went to wake him thursday morning but 
found his bed had not been slept in she found him in the basement 
with four gunshot wounds three to the head police said there was 
no sign of a struggle robbry or forced entry leading 
investigators to believe that hardison knew his killer police said 
mrs hardison had arrived home the previous night and found her 
sons keys in the lock neighbors said he often forget to remove 
his keys from the lock mrs hardison apparently assumed hed gone 
to sleep 
students at milton high school where hardison was the 
topranked tennis player said the shooting may have been connected 
to an incident last year in which members of a boston gang crashed 
a party given by a friend of hardisons the party later turned 
violent 
hardison reportedly angered because one of his friends was 
injured cooperated with police pointing out the home of the 
girlfriend of one alleged gang member some students said

investigating the possibility of a gang link in the killing boston 
police deputy superintendent william celester who runs the police 
station in the gangplagued roxbury section said milton police had 
contacted detectives there about the killing 
school officials said hardison was not involved in gangs or 
drugs and had never been a discipline problem

assembly thursday a school official said 
at the assembly one student denied that her boyfriend 
reportedly a gang member had killed hardison said vice principal 
paul dorsey 
other students walked out as the girl was speaking he 
said my interpretation might have been that they didnt believe 
her 
eva price a neighbor of the hardisons who had known charles 
since he was 5 said the youth recently had helped a neighbor clean 
up his yard 
i looked out my window sunday morning and said i dont 
believe it he was helping him rake his leaves she said 
pointing to an adjacent lawn he was working harder than the 
guys son 
price said the killing raised concerns for the safety of her own 
three teenagers even on a street where birdcalls are louder than 
passing cars 
everybody wants to know what triggered this she said i 
wont let my kids stay alone here not until police tell me what 
happened it does worry us 
price also said she disagreed with neighbors who declined to 
talk to reporters hes a wonderful kid he died a violent death 
and it should be known that he was into good things she said

high schools students of african descent he was also the

nelson mandela said friday the 
government is not doing enough to control police and that police 
actions against peaceful demonstrators are damaging the climate for 
blackwhite negotiations 
also friday police fired tear gas to disperse about 1000 
moslems protesting growing drug use in their neighborhood 
witnesses said 
the marchers included mixedrace men women and children who 
gathered at a mosque in salt river outside cape town with 
placards that read we dont want drugs they said drug use and 
drug dealing had become a pervasive problem in the area 
mandela speaking in the northeastern town of likazi said the 
government should do more to reign in police 
police look at every grievance and demonstration by blacks 
as an act of war the african national congress leader said he 
said this has hurt the climate for formal negotiations between 
blacks and whites on changing the constitution to give blacks a 
share of power in south africa 
the anc postponed groundbreaking talks with the government after 
a police shooting last month left at least 11 protesters dead the 
discussions have been rescheduled may 24 
i told president fw de klerk at our last meeting that if 
one white person was killed by police white south africa would 
shout at the top of its voice mandela said if a number of 
whites were killed by police there would be a mass upheaval and 
the government would fall 
mandela addressing 1500 members of the militant south african 
youth congress called on young blacks to be disciplined and work 
to end the factional fighting that has claimed hundreds of lives 
since february 
if you are a member of the anc you will be tolerant of other 
peoples views mandela said those who use violence or 
coercion against other political or youth movements are not 
disciplined members of the anc 
a visiting european community delegation met friday in 
johannesburg with the pan africanist congress a rival of the anc 
the delegation led by irish foreign minister gerard collins 
held separate talks thursday with de klerk and leaders of the 
proapartheid conservative party 
our meeting with leaders from such opposing camps as the 
conservative party and the pan africanist congress is motivated by 
the desire to ensure that all political groups in south africa 
realize it is their responsibility to bring about change collins 
said 
police told organizers of the antidrug march that they lacked 
the manpower to protect the demonstrators and would have to break 
up the march the demonstrators decided to proceed but after they 
marched one block police fired at least 12 rounds of tear gas 
witnesses said 
the crowd quickly dispersed later the marchers regrouped at 
the mosque and accused several local youths on the streets of 
selling drugs there were several heated exchanges but no injuries 
or arrests were reported

four men including the son of a 
reputed crime family boss were convicted friday of using extortion 
in an attempt to collect a 40000 debt from a stockbroker who was 
later slain 
it was a good verdict based on the evidence said the 
prosecutor assistant us attorney kevin march 
convicted on two extortion counts were anthony accetturo jr 
24yearold son of a reputed captain in the lucchese crime family 
of northern new jersey brothers robert and raymond basha and 
michael monahan 
the men were accused of kidnapping stockbroker christopher james 
loiselle last fall threatening him and assaulting him in an 
attempt to collect 40000 he had borrowed from the bashas who own 
a jet ski business in hollywood 
on march 15 three days after the extortion trial was to have 
begun in tampa loiselle was found dead with five gunshot wounds to 
the chest us district judge anthony alaimo then moved the trial 
here because of publicity in tampa about the death 
authorities said all of the defendants have passed polygraph 
tests denying any knowledge of loiselles slaying which remains 
unsolved 
alaimo ordered the defendants held until sentencing and did not 
set a sentencing date the four men all from hollywood face up to 
20 years in prison on each of the two counts march said 
jurors who had been deliberating since wednesday were unable 
to reach a verdict on a racketeering conspiracy count and a charge 
that the defendants used violence to further their racketeering 
operations 
acceturro and raymond basha were found innocent of kidnapping 
scott stockholm a friend of loiselle the jury was unable to reach 
a verdict on that count against robert basha and monahan 
us attorney robert w genzman will have to decide whether to 
seek a new trial on the charges that were not resolved 
loiselle 30 a stockbroker who was living in largo borrowed 
the 40000 for his struggling brokerage business 
the bashas loaned loiselle the money last august at 50 percent 
interest telling him it came from organized crime and there would 
be violence if he did not repay prosecutors charged 
loiselle was kidnapped sept 27 after failing to repay 
prosecutors said monahan and the basha brothers threatened him 
then took him to accetturo who beat him and threatened him further 
before releasing him the government said 
loiselle went to authorities and arrests were made oct 24 
defense attorneys contended the bashas owners of rampr jet tech 
inc in hollywood were respected young businessmen who merely 
wanted to get their money back from loiselle the defense described 
loiselle as a con man and thief who needed the 40000 because he 
had stolen money from his business 
peter aiken an attorney for accetturo had argued that the 
governments case was an attempt to strike back at his father 
anthony accetturo sr who was acquitted in 1988 in newark nj 
following a 21month trial on racketeering charges

trade negotiators ended talks friday without 
reaching an agreement on us demands that japan remove 
restrictions on imports of wood products 
there are three areas in which washington has been trying to 
remove trade barriers and lumber products remain the only one 
unresolved 
there are still significant differences in our positions a 
us official in tokyo told reporters 
we have made substantial progress on many points but some 
issues remain to be discussed further said a foreign ministry 
official speaking on condition of anonymity we have concluded 
our talks at this round after agreeing to hold another round of 
talks in the near future 
the american official who also spoke on condition he not be 
named said us negotiators felt they could reach an agreement 
before june 16 when washington must decide whether to take 
retaliatory action for foreign trade practices it considers unfair 
i think there is momentum to resolve the negotiations the 
us official said there is strong interest in a resolution on 
both sides 
last year the bush administration designated japanese trade in 
wood products satellites and supercomputers as areas in which us 
products face unfair trade practices under the super 301 clause 
of the us trade law 
the two governments recently reached agreements on greater 
access to japans satellite and supercomputer markets talks on 
lumber trade which began monday faced mounting disagreement 
mainly because of japans complicated housing and construction 
regulations the japanese official said 
we have discussed their assertion that japans construction 
standards are so complicated that they are hard to understand he 
said our position is that we cant afford to lower our safety 
standards on housing 
us industry and government officials say a japanese law 
banning the construction of threestory wooden apartments unfairly 
limits wood imports 
they also say tokyos product specifications and tariffs for 
lumber unfairly discriminate against imports of highvalue finished 
and semifinished wood products by importing mainly raw timber 
they say japan is protecting its own uncompetitive traditional 
timber processing industry 
japanese officials say such restrictions are necessary safety 
precautions in earthquakeprone japan 
wooden structures are limited by law to singlefamily dwellings 
up to three stories and to twostory multiple family housing most 
apartment buildings in major cities are built of steel and concrete 
officials from both sides said progress had been made in all 
areas of discussion but declined to explain remaining disagreements 
the us official said he expected the talks to resume very 
soon but did not specify when or where the next round of 
negotiations would take place 
last year the united states exported 28 billion in wood 
products to japan mostly unfinished logs industry officials 
estimate that if trade barriers were eliminated the market would 
expand by 2 billion and 1700020000 new us jobs would be 
created

competition for students and drops in 
government support were the main reasons for huge tuition jumps at 
private and public colleges during the 1980s says a new study 
and while experts predict some relief in the 1990s they say the 
price of higher education will still rise faster than inflation 
at least until the baby booms babies start to hit college age 
the report by arthur hauptman an authority on higher education 
finances says the shrinking number of collegeage youths has 
played a major role tuition increases 
the continued decline in this age group through the mid1990s 
suggests that college charges probably will continue to outpace 
inflation for the forseeable future hauptman concludes 
but he adds that it is difficult to imagine that consumers 
will be unlimited in their willingness to pay steadily rising 
college prices and suggests they will rebel at some point against 
price increases that are double the inflation rate 
from 1980 to 1987 the average boost in tuition and fees was 
slightly under 10 percent annually nearly twice inflation 
the college tuition spiral hauptmans report for the 
college board and american council on education concluded that 
cutbacks in state aid during the early 1980s were a major factor in 
tuition increases at public colleges 
private colleges raised tuition to pay for better facilities 
services and faculty salaries in attempts to maintain their share 
of a shrinking pool of potential students the study said the 
schools also used some of the money to expand their own student aid 
programs a need provoked by cuts at the federal level 
furthermore hauptman wrote with stagnating enrollments 
schools could no longer spread fixed costs over a growing number of 
students plus they had to spend more to counsel and recruit 
nontraditional students 
hauptman said an economic downturn in the next few years could 
force public institutions dependent on strained state resources to 
raise tuition but prompt private colleges to hold the line to keep 
from discouraging prospective students 
the trend of the 1980s was in sharp contrast to the late 1970s 
when tuitions and other charges grew more slowly than inflation 
richard rosser president of the national association of 
independent colleges and universities representing 1600 schools 
said colleges had to charge more during the 1980s to catch up with 
needs that had gone unmet during the previous decade 
now there is probably going to be some leveling off and 
perhaps some decrease on the average rosser said but it will 
still be more than the rate of inflation because that doesnt 
relate very well to our true costs 
robert atwell president of the american council on education 
said it would be harder for lowerpriced schools to cut 
expenditures and keep tuition down because they are less 
selective and pretty strained already financially 
but he said a combination of market resistance the politics of 
the issue and a falloff in applications will force a general 
moderation a drop in applications is a powerful statement 
theres been some of that at some of the higherpriced 
institutions atwell said 
charles kolb an assistant education undersecretary for 
planning said his department is taking a a comprehensive look at 
college costs he said preliminary research indicates some colleges 
feel they can control many of the factors that fuel rising tuition 
but declined to be more specific 
a recent study by the associated press found many colleges and 
universities are starting the new decade with some of the smallest 
tuition increases in years 
stanford university raised fixed student fees by 525 percent in 
199091 to 20210 the smallest increase in 15 years and 
considerably less than the 8 percent hike in the current year 
massachusetts institute of technology announced in march its rates 
for the fall will rise to 20700 a 71 percent increase slightly 
less than the 72 percent the previous year 
the university of michigan and wayne state university in detroit 
are holding increases to the lowest level in years 65 percent a 
year ago michigan posted a 96 percent increase the ap study 
found

president bush appealed to moscow today 
to back off threatened new economic sanctions against the breakaway 
republic of lithuania now is no time for escalation he said 
it is time for talk 
at a joint news conference with british prime minister margaret 
thatcher the president commented on a news report that soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev had threatened to halt shipments of 
potential export materials to lithuania if officials there dont 
halt anticonstitutional actions 
bush stressed that he was reacting to a brief wire service 
report on the development he called the report deeply 
disturbing but said he had not had an opportunity to determine 
all the facts thatcher concurred saying i abide by the 
statement the president just made 
on arms control bush described as positive gorbachevs 
statement to a us senatorial delegation in moscow that he wants 
to initial an agreement on longrange nuclear weapons with the 
united states at next months scheduled summit 
the news conference was held after bush and thatcher had met for 
about four hours on this british island off the coast of north 
america 
both leaders emphasized their support for a reunified germany 
within the nato alliance bush said a united germany should have 
full control over all its territory without any new restraints 
imposed by the allies that won world war ii 
asked about an incident earlier this week in which british 
officials confiscated piping slated for shipment to iraq mrs 
thatcher said investigators still were trying to determine whether 
the piping was part of a huge gun 
if it were to prove to be part of a gun it would require a 
permit she said 
it was the second incident in recent weeks involving alleged 
efforts to ship weaponry to the arab country in the earlier case 
electronic equipment that officials said could be used as nuclear 
triggers was intercepted 
anything we can do to keep guns or chemicals out of the hands 
of terrorisrts should be done said bush i would encourage and 
offer cooperation to guarantee a ban of weapons to countries that 
are illegally getting them 
gorbachevs threat was contained in a letter addressed to the 
lithuanian government which declared independence on march 11 the 
text of the letter provided in english by the soviet news agency 
tass said shipment of products that are sold on external markets 
for freelyconvertible currency would be cut off from lithuania 
unless leaders there backed off recent steps toward independence 
coercion escalation is not the way to go said bush the 
way to go is dialogue 
asked if he planned to speak with gorbachev by telephone bush 
replied i dont know about the telephone i might i might 
not certainly its time to stay in close contact and we have many 
ways of doing that 
earlier before he was aware of the existance of the letter 
bush told reporters he felt sympathy for the soviet leaders 
objections to lectures from the united states about lithuania 
but bush said i will continue to say what i think 
bush and gorbachev will meet for a fiveday summit in the united 
states beginning may 30 
bush and mrs thatcher met for just over two hours in their 
morning session and according to a statement by presidential press 
secretary marlin fitzwater discussed a full range of 
international issues facing the north atlantic alliance 
their warm and production conversation focused on german 
reunification nato the status on talks on troop levels in europe 
lithuania iraqs weapons and eastwest trade 
fitzwater said the two leaders have mutually supportive views 
on these issues the special relationship between our two countries 
was evident as they considered a strong and steady western response 
to the changes in eastern europe 
during the twohour flight here bush noted that gorbachev and 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in a meeting with 
seven democratic senators from washington had said thursday that 
moscow wants to initial a treaty at the summit to cut longrange 
nuclear weapons 
he was quite upbeat there the president said i viewed 
that as a very positive statement we are sending the same signals 
to our negotiators and policymakers 
however highlevel ussoviet talks in washington last week 
raised doubts about whether an arms agreement will be ready by the 
time of the summit secretary of state james a baker iii expressed 
disappointment that the two sides remained at odds on a key 
stumbling block airlaunched and sealaunched cruise missiles 
acknowleding last weeks problems in arms negotiations bush 
said it was our feeling that things had walked back a little bit 
but now its encouraging 
in moscow gorbachev also told the lawmakers he would resolve 
the crisis in lithuania by peaceful means but without lectures 
or interference from washington 
on that point bush said i dont view that as a hostile 
comment but i view it as a reiteration of his wellknown 
position bush said 
i can understand his position he said adding that the 
soviet union regards lithuanias drive for secession as an internal 
problem because of history we dont view it that way i will 
continue to say what i think 
the united states has never recognized the forced annexation of 
lithuania or the baltic states of estonia and latvia into the 
soviet union 
discussing the east german legislatures resolution asking 
forgiveness for nazi atrocities bush said im inclined to think 
you ought to forgive not forget i think forgiveness is 
something i feel very strongly about

a man who was robbed while riding a subway train 
shot and killed one of the three men who accosted him then fled at 
the next station police said friday 
the robbery was committed late thursday by three men in their 
teens or early 20s who were among a group of about 18 people 
traveling together transit authority police spokesman al oleary 
said 
the shooting bore certain similarities to the bernhard goetz 
case of six years ago in which goetz shot four youths he said were 
about to mug him like the goetz case the unidentified robbery 
victim was white and his assailants were black 
however oleary cautioned against making comparisons the 
major difference is goetz believed he was going to become a crime 
victim and in cases since the people who reacted had already been 
victimized very different situations in the eyes of the law he 
said 
oleary also said police were not treating the shooting as 
racially motivated 
the trouble occurred about 11 pm on a no 4 train heading from 
brooklyn to manhattan 
the robbers armed with a retractable razor used for opening 
boxes approached the man grabbed him lifted him up went 
through his pockets took his wallet and threw him back on the 
seat oleary said he pulled a gun and fired three times 
one bullet hit one of the robbers in the chest the spokesman 
said it was uncertain where the other bullets went the man who 
was shot was identified by the medical examiners office as ricky 
pickett 25 of brooklyn he had been arrested five times for 
robbery according to police sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
when the train made its next stop the shooter believed to be 
in his late 40s or early 50s got out as did many of the young men 
traveling together but it was not known whether they were fleeing 
or chasing the man he said 
oleary said earlier reports that the robbers had a gun were 
incorrect he said although a gun had been passed around openly 
among the group the three robbers used the razor not a gun 
besides the group to which the robbers belonged there was at 
least one independent witness to the shooting who was being 
questioned said sgt peter berry spokesman for the city police 
roy innis chairman of the congress of racial equality issued a 
statement urging the shooter to turn himself in and pledging cores 
resources in his defense 
innis advocates using force in selfdefense against criminals

here is the text of the news conference 
held by president bush and british prime minister margaret thatcher 
thatcher mr president ladies and gentleman im very grateful 
to the president for coming to bermuda for these talks and weve 
had a very full and useful discussion lasting about four hours 
weve discussed just about everything and i think we agree on just 
about everything 
we both attach the greatest possible importance to preserving 
nato as the heart of the wests defense and to keeping american 
forces and their nuclear weapons in europe 
were both clear that a united germany should be part of nato 
youd be happy to see nato play a bigger political role within the 
atlantic community but the same time we want to see the csce 
developed as a forum not for defense but for wider eastwest 
political consultation and as a framework for drawing the east 
european countries into the mainstream of europe 
on defense we both believe nato will continue to need a mix of 
conventional and nuclear weapons and they must be kept up to date 
whether we can make further reductions in the overall number of 
nato nuclear warheads in europe is something which will need to be 
considered in nato as a whole with so much happening we shall 
need to consult particularly closely in nato this year and the 
president and i agreed to keep in very close touch on that 
we also of course discussed developments over lithuania and 
are very much agreed that this is a problem that must be worked out 
by dialogue and discussion we also covered a very large number of 
regional issues as well as matters such as the uruguay round the 
ebrd and relations between the european community and the united 
states 
we would like to see europe and the united states together 
trading and cooperating ever more closely in an atlantic community 
so very good talks conducted in a very friendly atmosphere 
with a very wide measure of agreement just as you would expect 
thank you 
bush thank you prime minister and first may i thank you and 
the governor general and the premier of bermuda for your wonderful 
hospitality its a pleasure to be here not least because the 
prime minister and i have had this opportunity to sit down and 
consult frankly and freely and openly at length about recent 
developments and what the future holds for europe 
naturally we talked about the prospects of a unified germany 
we both welcome the fulfillment of the deepest aspirations of the 
german people to end their artificial separation both of our 
governments have supported the unification of germany for more than 
40 years and we are glad that it is finally coming to pass in peace 
and in freedom 
the prime minister and i agree with chancellor kohl that germany 
should remain a full member of nato including its military 
structures and this is the view of the federal republic of 
germany the entire north atlantic alliance and several of the 
countries in eastern europe as well we believe that continued full 
german membership in nato is in the genuine security interest of 
all european states 
and in this context we also look forward to the continued 
development of the twoplusfour talks on the external aspects of 
the establishment of german unity these talks will focus on 
bringing to an end the special four power rights and 
responsibilities for berlin and germany as a whole a united 
germany should have full control over all of its territory without 
any new discriminatory contraints on german sovereignty 
now we also had a good exchange about the situation in the 
soviet union and lithuania we agree that these issues must be 
dealt with through dialogue so that the lithuanian peoples right 
to selfdetermination can be realized and just before coming here 
the last few minutes we were handed a deeply disturbing wire 
service report obviously theres been no time to look into this 
matter

president mikhail s gorbachev today warned 
lithuania that if it doesnt halt anticonstitutional actions 
in two days he will stop shipments of some products to the 
breakaway republic 
the tough new threat by gorbachev was contained in a letter 
addressed to the lithuanian government which declared independence 
on march 11 
the letter was carried by the official tass news agency and read 
on the nightly television news program vremya 
the letter did not specify what products would be halted but it 
said they were items the soviet union could export to other 
countries for muchneeded hard currency such as oil natural gas 
and coal 
the letter also signed by prime minister nikolai ryzhkov said 
the situation in lithuania tightens into an ever tighter knot 
assuming the nature of a political dead end 
lithuanias leadership it said continues to adopt 
legislative acts and decisions that set lithuania in oppostition to 
other republics and the soviet union as a whole 
the presidents letter warned that such actions can no longer 
be tolerated 
the letter mentioned as anticonstitutional actions the 
lithuanian legislatures decision to halt spring conscription into 
the soviet army attempts by the lithuanian authorities to seize 
property of the communist party of the soviet union and an april 5 
law that establishes identity cards for lithuanians that 
discriminates against soviet citizens in the republic 
the letter said lithuanias parliament should restore the 
republics position to that of march 10 1990 the day before 
independence was declared 
in the month since lithuania declared its independence the 
kremlin has been alternating its tone from threatening to 
conciliatory and back soviet troops have occupied some buildings 
in the capital vilnius and conscripts who refused to serve in the 
red army were detained some deserters were beaten 
on monday gorbachev and his top advisory body the presidential 
council said new economic and political steps would be taken to 
break lithuanias intransigent stand on independence 
the next day gorbachev spokesman arkady maslennikov said no 
economic blockade was planned however he implied that the soviet 
union might start demanding worldmarket prices from lithuania for 
oil gas and other raw materials the small republic needs 
he said this would cost lithuania 6 billion 
on thursday lithuania and the neighboring republics of latvia 
and estonia announced that they would form a baltic market to 
develop a common economic strategy and closer ties 
lithuania was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 along 
with estonia and latvia estonia and latvia also have declared 
their intention to seek independence but are proceeding more 
cautiously than lithuania

rival christian forces skirmished with 
machine guns for control of their tiny enclave friday as the 
nations civil war entered its 16th year the arab league made a 
new effort to settle the strife 
police reported no casualties on the 73rd day of fighting 
between troops of gen michel aoun and militiamen of samir geageas 
lebanese forces for control of the 310squaremile christian 
enclave 
the conflict the bloodiest fighting among christians in 15 
years of civil strife has left 875 people dead and wounded 2369 
saudi arabia morocco and algeria will soon provide lebanon 
with assistance to equip its armed forces and activate its 
economy arab league envoy lakhdar ibrahimi told reporters after 
meeting with lebanese president elias hrawi in moslem west beirut 
leaders of the three countries make up a committee designated by 
an arab summit last may to find a settlement to lebanons civil 
war in which more than 150000 people have died 
foreign ministers of the three states held a meeting in the 
moroccan capital of rabat last week and discussed ways of 
implementing a peace pact worked out by lebanese legislators under 
their auspices last october 
ibrahimi an algerian discussed the military and economic 
assistance during a onehour meeting with hrawi he did not specify 
if the aid would come as materiel grants or in other forms 
the two also discussed ways of eliminating difficulties 
preventing implementation of the october accord said a 
government source speaking on condition of anonymity 
ibrahimi who arrived in beirut late thursday said he is to 
hold talks with other lebanese government and militia leaders but 
not with aoun who rejected the accord altogether as a pact of 
capitulation and refused to recognize hrawi as head of state 
the accord distributes power equally among moslems and 
christians in this nation of 4 million which has traditionally 
been dominated by maronite catholics since its independence from 
france in 1943 
aoun geagea and hrawi are maronites the largest christian 
community in lebanon 
pope john paul ii in a good friday message to lebanese maronite 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir called for a halt to the fratricidal 
fighting stressing that the drama of lebanon must end 
referring to the intrachristian showdown the pontiff expressed 
solidarity with the clergymen in lebanon who have recently seen 
the sons of your churches oppose each other in fratricidal combat 
and witnessed the despair of those who in order to flee the 
destructive violence abandoned their homes their region and even 
their country 
at least 750000 lebanese have emigrated since the outbreak of 
the civil war in 1975 according to police 
about 400000 people or 40 percent of the christian enclaves 
population have fled to safer areas in lebanon and neighboring 
nations since the aoungeagea dispute broke out jan 30 police say 
asked whether he would hold talks with aoun ibrahimi told the 
moslem voice of the nation radio im not aware that any such 
contacts would be held 
aoun is regarded by supporters of the october accord as the 
obstacle blocking implementation of the peace plan the 
government source said 
geagea has declared loyalty to president hrawi and has called 
on the legitimate government to spread its authority to his areas 
of influence the source said aoun is the obstacle now

the 15 billion hubble space 
telescope nasas most valuable payload will be exposed to minimal 
contamination inside discovery while it awaits a second launch 
attempt the agency said friday 
weve kept this vehicle extremely clean said fred wojtalik 
a nasa project manager 
slightly more dust is expected to settle on the telescopes 
94inch mirror the finest ever made wojtalik said but the 
additional debris still will be well within contamination limits 
weve done all the cautionary things that we can he said 
were going to get some degradation some particles are going to 
come into the hubble that we just cant avoid 
once the telescope reaches orbit scientists want no more than 5 
percent of the surface of hubbles 94inch mirror covered with dust 
or other debris wojtalik said 
weve been doing things probably more meticulously than anyone 
has ever done in order to achieve that he said 
a 2 percent rate of contamination was expected had discovery 
been launched on time tuesday wojtalik said that is expected to 
rise to 21 percent as a result of the delay until the new launch 
date april 25 
clean air was being circulated inside discoverys sealed payload 
bay friday to reduce contamination of the telescope nasa planned 
to open the payload bay saturday so the telescopes nickelhydrogen 
batteries can be removed and taken to a kennedy space center 
laboratory for recharging 
a protective cover will not be placed over the telescopes 
aperture door because the procedure is difficult and might result 
in even more contamination or damage wojtalik said 
discoverys launch was postponed four minutes before liftoff 
tuesday when one of the shuttles three auxiliary power units 
failed technicians will replace the unit with a new one this 
weekend 
it will be the first time nasa has ever replaced an auxiliary 
power unit at the launch pad as a result the space agency has 
told technicians to take their time and that there is no schedule 
pressure there 
changing the apu is going to take what it takes said john 
tip talone a nasa administrator when we get to the 
changeout of the apu and get back into our normal standard 
operations well feel better about the 25th although i feel 
pretty good about the 25th right now 
auxiliary power units pressurize the shuttles hydraulic system 
which is used to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the ships 
braking and steering systems 
recharging hubbles batteries inside a laboratory rather than at 
the launch pad will extend their lifetime giving the national 
aeronautics and space administration more days to try a launch 
before the next recharging is necessary talone said 
hubble is to orbit 380 miles high studying stars and galaxies 
so distant that their light has been traveling toward earth for 14 
billion years scientists believe the universe was created about 15 
billion years ago

friday in the provincial city of taejon news reports said 
the protests were fueled by rumors the us army would be moving 
its south korean headquarters from seoul the capital to taejon 
expel us soldiers about 1000 students yelled as they 
marched from the campus of chungnam university according to 
yonhap the south korean news agency riot police fired tear gas to 
break up the demonstration 
about 800 students at taejons gongju university also fought 
riot police with rocks and firebombs to demand a us pullout 
yonhap said it said students announced an antius campaign to 
expel us soldiers 
the us army headquarters supervises the 43000 us troops 
stationed in south korea local residents and radicals a small 
minority on campuses have staged violent protests against any move 
of the us headquarters to taejon 
in seoul national police headquarters released a report friday 
saying a total of 777 us soldiers were charged under south korean 
law last year it said seven were charged with rape six with 
burglary and 231 with undefined violent acts most of the rest

soldiers and koreans in a popular shopping and entertainment 
district near us military headquarters in seoul

police numbers one official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said every gi who is turned over to us is dealt with every case

americans have been tried in korean courts but the figures were 
not given 
south korea has called for greater jurisdiction over crimes

the teenage son of gov george mickelson 
was involved in a drinking party at the executive mansion and was 
acquitted of a sexual offense charge stemming from the incident 
the governor acknowledged friday 
mickelsons statement to reporters was the first time he had 
even admitted his son david was present during the nov 28 party 
the governor and his wife linda met with reporters shortly 
after circuit judge marshall young sentenced three juvenile boys 
for underage drinking 
today judge young imposed a sentence on david for underage 
drinking which he readily admitted to mickelson said 
the three boys who admitted charges of underage consumption of 
alcohol were given varying terms of probation ordered to perform 
community service and undergo counseling for alcohol 
the governor said his son who was 17 at the time of the party 
was one of two juvenile boys acquitted of sexual offense charges 
during a twoday closeddoor trial last month one boy was 
acquitted of nonforcible rape and the other was acquitted of 
aiding and abetting rape 
but the two were ordered to pay the medical bills of the alleged 
victim 
even though judge youngs decision meant our son was not 
guilty it does not lift entirely the pain that this incident has 
caused mickelson said 
lawyers and court documents have referred to a 16yearold girl 
as the alleged victim in the case 
mickelson and his wife were out of town nov 28 but the 
whereabouts of their son had not been disclosed until friday 
the governor said he had limited his comments about the case 
because he believed it should be handled with the same privacy as 
other juvenile court cases 
but he said he regrets that he did not clarify a statement 
issued by his office in december when reports of an alleged rape at 
the mansion surfaced the statement which mickelson said he had 
approved said the whereabouts of his son on the night of nov 28 
were not relevant 
obviously davids whereabouts were relevant mickelson said 
mickelson who has two other children said he and his wife sat 
through last months juvenile court trial with the parents of the 
girl involved and with other parents and their children 
this has been an agonizing experience for all of us he said 
in case anybody believes differently we absolutely do not 
approve the party that was held in our house on november 28th it 
was without our permission it was without our knowledge 
mickelson said nor do we as parents approve of our sons 
actions and i can assure you that he is keenly aware of our 
feelings 
he said his family regrets the whole matter more than anyone 
will ever know 
in south dakota we have had for 100 years laws that provide 
that juveniles can make mistakes and still not lose their hope for 
a meaningful future the governor said linda and i hope this 
is true for all the young people involved in this matter

that the united states is alarmed over renewed political violence 
but pleased at steps taken to counter it the state department said 
friday 
bushs message to guatemalan president vinicio cerezo was 
delivered by us ambassador thomas strook following his recent 
recall to washington for consultations on the violence according 
to richard boucher the state departments deputy spokesman 
the ambassador and members of our embassy staff have made 
clear to the government of guatemala at all levels our concerns 
boucher said we will continue to monitor the human rights 
situation there very closely 
in recent weeks the guatemalan government has taken a number 
of steps and pledged to take additional measures to investigate 
outstanding cases of human rights abuse and to strengthen the rule 
of law boucher said 
a special police investigative unit has been set up and the 
government plans to submit to the guatemalan congress proposals for 
reforming the penal code he said 
the state department said later that it is understood that 
guatemalan police officers assigned to the new investigative unit 
will be chosen from among those who have received training through 
a program funded by the united states 
measures are also being taken to provide 24hour protection for 
judges and investigators and an office has been set up within the 
national police force to investigate police abuse 
we would also note the recent meeting in oslo between 
representatives of the national reconciliation commission and the 
leftist guerrillas which opens up the possibility for creating a 
dialogue to end the 30yearold internal conflict boucher said 
we applaud this process of dialogue he said 
but in the meantime he said there continue to be reports of 
violence 
for example were disturbed to note the recent killing of two 
members of a rural activist group and an attack by civil patrol 
members upon the deputy human rights ombudsman boucher said 
leftist guerrillas have been fighting for power in guatemala for 
more than four decades thousands have been kidnapped and slain by 
rightist death squads widely believed to be linked to the military 
mutual support a human rights group estimated that 40000 
people have disappeared probably kidnapped and slain for political 
motives in the 20year period ending in 1988 it said an average 
of 300 people disappeared every month in 1981 and 1982

for nine years through deportation and 
wars devastation helena krahelska kept shoes and shirts waiting 
but in 1948 she acknowledged that her beloved husband piotr had 
been among the polish army officers massacred by the soviet secret 
police in katyn forest 
it took the soviet government 42 more years to do the same 
mrs krahelska did not live to hear moscow finally confess 
friday that the crime it blamed on the nazis was actually committed 
by the soviet union in one of the gravest crimes of stalinism 
but her surviving daughter wanda zadrozna received the news 
with eyes filled with tears 
there is a great regret that it took 50 years and the wives of 
those people didnt live until this day mrs zadrozna said 
but whatever happens now it is good that the truth will be 
finally written in history 
mrs zadrozna was 12 when she last saw her father a landowner 
lawyer and town mayor in eastern poland as the soviet army swept 
into poland at the outbreak of world war ii in 1939 it interned 
15000 polish army officers 
we got three letters the last one was from march 5 1940 
mrs zadrozna recalled fingering the plastic wrapping around the 
worn pages that record her fathers last worries about his familys 
fate 
then no one got any letters any more she said 
in 1943 the nazis invading the soviet union unearthed the mass 
graves of officers whose bodies were stacked atop each other most 
were shot in the back of the head 
this news was so horrible no one wanted to believe it we 
treated it as propaganda mrs zadrozna said 
everybody was still waiting my mother had everything for him 
and it wasnt easy because we had nothing sometimes she would 
refresh the clothes because she hoped maybe he would come 
back 
after hiding from red army death squads and barely escaping 
transport to siberia mrs krahelska and her daughters were 
deported west at wars end from the sovietannexed eastern poland 
to the boundaries of the new polish communist state 
mrs krahelska gave up hope for her husband but she was never 
able to bury him or even mourn him openly the communist polish 
government backed the soviet explanation and during the stalinist 
years people died for speaking of such things 
mrs zadrozna remembers her mothers naive effort to get a 
widows pension in 1949 when it turned out my father was at 
katyn she was told to get out of the office as soon as possible 
or else you will find yourself where you dont want to be 
all through those years there were only silent memories only 
symbolic graves with no inscription but everyone knew here they 
should light candles mrs zadrozna said 
for her family the toll also includes another katyn victim her 
fathers brother stanislaw a cousin killed fighting for the allies 
in italy and an aunt a writer who died in a concentration camp 
this is my personal story it is not an exception there are 
different stories none less tragic she said 
but katyn is among the deepest wounds in muchscarred polish 
history 
those killed were doctors scientists professors the elite 
called up from the army reserve as stalin planned their places 
leading poland were taken by sovietbacked functionaries as the 
communists consolidated power after the war 
these were the best of their homeland mrs zadrozna said 
it is not only i who have been missing them personally but the 
whole country has been missing them 
mrs krahelska died at 84 in 1982 when nothing indicated that 
people would talk about this her daughter said and even now 
mrs zadrozna is surprised i never thought that they would 
recognize responsibility 
i have always felt sorry that not everybody has known the 
truth because at home and at school nobody spoke about this 
mrs zadrozna said now everybody who goes to school will know 
the history of this massacre my grandchildren will know the 
truth

president bush pledged to cooperate in 
tightening export laws if british investigators determine that an 
iraqbound shipment of tubing seized in london was really the 
makings of a huge gun 
british prime minister margaret thatcher meeting reporters with 
bush after several hours of talks on a variety of subjects said 
her investigators have not decided what to make of the eight 
sections of steel tubing confiscated thursday from the docks at 
middlesbrough england 
iraqi officials have said the tubing was intended for use in a 
petrochemical plant british customs officials said it could be 
used as an artillery barrel to fire a large projectile and was 
subject to export licensing controls 
the experts are still considering and confirming as to whether 
it is a gun or simply large steel piping the prime minister 
said they have not yet made up their minds if it is a gun 
bush commended british intelligence and law enforcement agencies 
for seizing the tubing shortly before it was to be shipped to iraq 
anything we can do to keep guns or chemicals out of the hands 
of terrorist nations we should he said if it turns out the 
tubing was an illegal weapons export i would encourage and would 
offer our cooperation to guarantee a total banning and firming up 
the ban of weapons or potential weapons to countries that are 
illegally getting them 
it is our purpose to keep such things out of the hands of the 
iraqi government bush said 
he said there was superb cooperation between the uk and the 
us in trying to avert such breaches in the law it isnt easy 
they got laws on their books we got laws on our books 
but he added if theres a way we can tighten up export 
controls certainly we ought to be doing it

its been a year since authorities found 
the seven bodies a year since the grisly massacre stunned the 
bucolic wine country of northern california 
and thats too long for prosecutor peter bumerts who is eager 
to get ramon salcido in front of a jury and try him for the april 
14 1989 bloodbath 
killed in a series of shooting and slashing attacks were 
salcidos wife two of their three daughters his wifes mother 
his wifes two younger sisters and a coworker at the winery where 
salcido worked 
the third daughter 3yearold carmina was found in a garbage 
dump next to the bodies of her sisters like her sisters she had 
her throat slashed but carmina survived telling investigators 
from her hospital bed dad hurt me her grandfather says shes 
doing well today 
bumerts doesnt want to speculate on salcidos motive his main 
concern has been the time pretrial maneuvering has consumed 
its amazing that it is a year and still theres no trial 
said bumerts 
as a former public defender he said he understands the need to 
protect a defendants rights but oftentimes theres nothing 
accomplished with all these delays he said it shouldnt take 
a year to do these things 
salcido 29 was captured in his native mexico five days after 
the killings charges included seven counts of firstdegree murder 
for which he could be sentenced to death 
the trial is scheduled to begin july 9 in redwood city south of 
san francisco where the case was moved because of publicity 
it was clear that pressures had been building in salcidos life 
there were drugs he was served with papers ordering him to pay 
back child support to a former wife his current wife angela was 
not aware salcido had been married before and made plans to leave 
him when she found out 
all of the above defense attorney marteen miller replied 
when asked what he thought was the main factor 
his world just came tumbling down said the public defender 
he was always drinking and then cocaine was added to it in 
addition miller said he was working on the theory his client had 
brain damage that made him explosive 
salcido left a note in the bloodsplattered car he abandoned 
before heading to mexico forgive me god but this law made me 
do it he wrote in spanish we could live better me and my 
children but what can i do 
people here still talk about it said dr john podboy a 
psychologist who lives a mile from the winery where salcido drove a 
forklift 
podboy who has worked on 150 homicides as an expert witness 
said he wont be involved professionally but sees several 
interesting aspects of the case 
for one thing he said men seldom kill their own children 
even more interesting is the allegation of a sustained period 
of rage said podboy people explode and then subside but here 
we have hours of homicidal conduct 
and although some people have tried to forget the crime spree 
robert richards cant the rampage took the lives of his wife 
marian louise 47 his daughters ruth 12 maria 8 and angela 24 
and angelas daughters teresa 1 and sofia 4 
the seventh victim was tracy toovey 35 an assistant winemaker 
at the grand cru winery in kenwood where salcido worked another 
coworker was wounded during the spree 
richards who lives in southern california with his surviving 
granddaughter says its hard for him to forget citing the 101 
things you see every day that remind him of his family 
many things like this i will have to live with the rest of my 
life he said 
but despite everything thats happened to her he said carmina 
is just like a normal child today its really an impressive 
recovery physically and mentally its really remarkable 
one of the questions most often asked of richards is what 
carmina saw the day of the killing spree of course no one 
knows he said i hope carmina never remembers what she has 
seen

it wont be in time for this easter but an 
agriculture department scientist says people one day will be able 
to buy blooming lilies throughout the year 
horticulturist mark s roh of the departments agricultural 
research service said a special treatment has been developed which 
brings a lily from a very small bulb to bloom in about 280 days 
instead of two to three years and in living colors not just 
traditional white 
he said the hybrid lily colors include red creamy yellow and 
bright lavender flowers on 12 to 25inch stems 
the new procedure bypasses the field production of lilies 
altogether allowing them to undergo forced controlled growth in 
greenhouses to reduce major viruses and soilborne fungal diseases 
that plague fieldgrown lilies 
roh said in a report by the agency that he plans to formally 
release the hybrid lilies to nurseries this year 
when the method is commercialized a company would probably 
offer the treated bulbils or small bulbs to nurseries that would 
in turn produce potted plants or cut flowers for consumers the 
report said 
us growers sold more than 9 million potted lilies in 1988 at a 
wholesale value of more than 34 million according to the most 
recent usda figures

the soviet union apologized friday for one of the 
grisliest crimes of the stalin era the murder of thousands of 
imprisoned polish officers shot during world war ii and buried in 
mass graves in the katyn forest 
the confession ended nearly 50 years of official soviet denial 
and had been almost a prerequisite for improved polishsoviet 
relations the soviet union previously insisted that nazi germany 
was responsible for the massacre 
polish and western historians long have blamed the nkvd josef 
stalins secret police for killing more than 4000 officers in the 
katyn forest near smolensk they were captured by the soviets at 
the beginning of world war ii 
more than 10000 other polish officers were killed in camps 
elsewhere their bodies have never been found but in its statement 
friday the soviet union clearly tied together the fates of all 
15000 officers some of the cream of prewar polish society 
the admission came 47 years to the day when the nazis announced 
the discovery of the katyn graves and it came one day after east 
germanys new parliament apologized for the holocaust and for the 
deaths of millions of soviets in world war ii 
the statement carried by the official news agency tass was 
issued as president mikhail s gorbachev met with polish president 
wojciech jaruzelski 
poland had urged the soviet union to admit responsibility for 
the mass slayings saying such blank spots in history were a 
barrier to better polishsoviet relations 
gorbachev gave jaruzelski copies of the material from soviet 
archives pertaining to the poles imprisoned in the nkvd camps tass 
reported 
in a speech at a dinner friday night honoring jaruzelski 
gorbachev referred to the massacre tass reported he said the two 
leaders talked about those historical knots that even many 
years later cast shadows on our relations many of them are undone 
already 
recently documents have been discovered which indirectly but 
convincingly testify that thousands of polish officers who died in 
the smolensk woods half a century ago became victims of stalins 
secret police chief lavrenti beria and his henchmen tass quoted 
gorbachev as saying 
the graves of the polish officers are near soviet peoples 
graves who fell from the same evil hand he said it is not 
easy to speak about this tragedy but we must speak about it for 
only through the truth there lies the way to genuine renewal and to 
genuine mutual understanding 
the earlier statement said the soviet side expressing its 
deep regret in connection with the katyn tragedy states that it is 
one of the most horrifying stalinist crimes tass said 
its good that criminals admit their crimes polish 
solidarity leader lech walesa said in gdansk but other problems 
remain including war reparations he said 
the massacre has caused bitterness among poles for years despite 
the previous communist governments loyal statements supporting the 
soviet union 
jaruzelski is scheduled to visit a memorial at katyn on 
saturday following pilgrimages of poles whose relatives and 
friends died in the massacre 
the officers were captured by the soviet union when it invaded 
eastern poland at the beginning of world war ii shortly after 
hitler sent his soldiers across polands western border to start 
the war 
they were shot in the back of the head and stacked in layers in 
mass graves the bodies were found in april 1943 by german soldiers 
who captured the area during world war ii they were immediately 
used for propaganda purposes 
stalin blamed the nazis for the deaths soviet historians 
recently began questioning that version but it stood until the 
soviet union admitted responsibility friday a us congressional 
committee in the early 1950s blamed the soviets 
under gorbachevs policy of glasnost the soviet union has 
brought to light many of the deeds of stalin and his henchmen but 
katyn was one of the final affairs to be touched by the greater 
openness 
records indicate that only 394 of the 15000 captured polish 
prisoners were transferred to the gryazovetsky prison camp the 
rest were turned over to the nkvd the predecessor of the kgb in 
smolensk voroshilovgrad in the ukraine and kalinin northwest of 
moscow all the officers disappeared from nkvd records tass said 
beria and others were executed after stalin died in 1953 
historian natalia lebedeva writing in the weekly moscow news on 
march 25 said the officers apparently were killed in a single 
operation as the nkvd evacuated three camps the soviets might have 
considered the polish officers a threat as potential future leaders 
of poland 
ms lebedeva who used soviet central archives and soviet army 
records called it a wellthoughtthrough and carefully planned 
operation 
in warsaw polish relatives of the victims were pleased the 
truth finally had come out but expressed regret it took so long 
i awfully regret that my mother could not live until this 
day said wanda zadrozna crying as she recalled her fathers 
murder there is a great regret that it took 50 years and the 
wives of those people didnt live until this day 
but whatever happens now it is good that the truth will be 
finally written in history she said

poles on friday sadly accepted a soviet 
acknowledgement of guilt for the massacre of thousands of polish 
officers 50 years ago but they said they want reparations and more 
details of war crimes 
its good that criminals admit their crimes said solidarity 
leader lech walesa in the northern city of gdansk he called the 
soviet admission an act of moral justice 
however he said there must be punishment of those guilty of 
the genocide reparations for the victims survivors and access 
for poles to the final resting places 
the massacre of 15000 polish officers at katyn and two other 
sites yet unknown had seared the national consciousness the pain 
had been made worse by the decades in which it was forbidden even 
to speak of soviet responsibility for the crimes 
the longawaited moment has come government spokeswoman 
malgorzata niezabitowska said friday after soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev handed over to president wojciech jaruzelski documents 
establishing dictator josef stalins secret police killed the 
officers on soviet territory in world war ii 
the event which took place 50 years ago in the smolensk forest 
has burdened relations between our two countries in the most 
painful way the polish spokeswoman said reconciliation can be 
built only on truth 
i feel a great joy now that after so many years the truth has 
been revealed said bozena lojek whose late husbands father 
died at katyn and who helps lead an group of victims relatives 
called the katyn family 
for us it is a great success she said leading to many 
political and economic consequences 
relatives have called for criminal proceedings against anyone 
still alive bearing responsibility and for payment of damages 
mrs niezabitowska said the polish government recognizes the 
significance of the official soviet statement but wants more 
questions cleared up 
we await an explanation of all the blank spots in our common 
history which the katyn crime symbolizes for us she said 
the bodies of more than 4200 officers who had been interned by 
the soviets at kozielsk were uncovered in the katyn forest but 
the remains of 10000 other officers captive at camps in 
starobielsk and ostashkow have never been found and word on their 
fate remains a key demand of their families 
the point is the russians dont want to reveal the other 
massacre sites said polish historian wojciech ziembinski its 
false its a lie just like for the last 50 years 
the katyn bodies shot in the back of the head and stacked in 
mass graves were found by the nazis in april 1943 and immediately 
used for propaganda purposes against the allies the soviets 
instead maintained the officers were killed in 1941 by the nazis 
after they invaded the soviet union 
although polands communist governments after the war echoed the 
soviet explanation most poles and western historians had long 
concluded that the massacre was committed by the soviet forces on 
stalins order in late april and early may 1940 
we all knew said bronislaw geremek the historian who heads 
solidaritys parliamentary caucus what todays communique 
brings it brings late and perhaps too little 
in london the british government welcomed the soviet admission 
foreign secretary douglas hurd said the terrible things that 
stalin did cannot be forgotten but he added the world should also 
remember the terrible things done to the soviets

king hussein said in broadcast remarks 
friday that jerusalem should be kept united and given special 
status but with arab sovereignty over the arab eastern sector of 
the city 
he attacked a nonbinding resolution by the us senate last 
month that recognized jerusalem as israels capital 
the king also repeated warnings that without action toward a 
peace settlement we are coming to a very very dangerous 
crossroads very very soon which could lead to an upsurge of 
extremism both in israel and the arab world 
hussein spoke in an interview carried by state jordan 
television the tv said the interview was conducted with cnn 
jordan ruled the eastern half of the holy city until israel 
captured it in the 1967 middle east war hussein said east 
jerusalem is part of the occupied west bank 
israel has annexed east jerusalem together with a wide swath of 
suburbs and says it will never give them up 
about 350 people staged a candlelight demonstration across the 
street from the us embassy in amman on friday night they were 
protesting the senate resolution a new israeli jewish settlement 
in the christian sector of jerusalem this week and alleged israeli 
mistreatment of clergymen 
it was the first officially permitted protest in many years 
outside the embassy and the first of any kind since a small 
illegal demonstration against the us bombing of libya in 1986 
the monarch said jerusalem is too important an issue to be 
dealt with as a political pawn 
it is too great a city to be only the capital of israel 
hussein indicated he favored giving the city special status 
in any arabisraeli peace settlements 
in the context of peace one does not envisage that jerusalem 
would be divided yet at the same time arab sovereignty over the 
arab part of the city has to be assured 
in such a way the rights of christians and moslems and jews 
can be safeguarded he said

of the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command 
it is part of an international conspiracy to settle these jews 
in palestine

nbc news urged a federal appeals court 
friday to reverse a 53 million libel judgment won by entertainer 
wayne newton saying a 1980 broadcast was guilty of only one thing 
aggressive journalism 
newtons lawyer morton galane argued that a jury found nbc had 
ill will toward newton and said the verdict should stand 
but nbc lawyer floyd abrams said the report linking newton to 
organized crime figures was correct abrams a noted first 
amendment lawyer argued that investigative reporting would suffer 
if the decision were upheld 
the two lawyers spoke during 30minute oral summations to their 
arguments at the hearing before the 9th us circuit court of 
appeal the courts decision will be announced at a later date 
a las vegas federal jury decided in december 1986 that the 
network had willfully libeled newton by claiming he had ties to 
organized crime the jury gave him the largest libel award in 
history 192 million in damages 
presiding us district judge myron crocker of fresno eventually 
reduced that award to 53 million 
numerous media groups including rival networks cbs abc and 
fox several major newspaper chains and the associated press have 
joined nbcs appeal of the libel verdict 
during fridays hearing judge william norris of the 
threemember panel likened the nbc team to robert woodward and carl 
bernstein the washington post reporters who broke the watergate 
scandal 
would a jury have a basis for finding carl bernstein and 
robert woodward had ill will in pursuing the watergate story he 
asked newtons lawyer 
galane said they would not because those reporters were ordered 
by their publisher to verify every fact through at least two 
sources 
but norris suggested the newton case might discourage 
investigative reporting and prevent stories comparable to a 
watergate scandal from being uncovered 
we tread a very fine line here to make sure that future 
woodwards and bernsteins are not inhibited in pursuing their 
stories said norris 
galane responded we are not intending to inhibit such 
goals and declared at one point were not here to launch an 
attack on the media or the first amendment 
but he maintained that nbc had erred by not interviewing newton 
about its allegations 
abrams countered that newton had refused numerous requests for 
such an interview 
newton who listened to the arguments from a front row seat 
later told reporters he still feels the impact of the 1980 
broadcast that linked him to reputed mob figure guido penosi 
the effects of what they said will last me the rest of my 
life he said 
nbc reporter brian ross said he and his codefendants producer 
ira silverman and executive producer paul greenberg were very 
optimistic about having the verdict overturned all three 
attended the hearing 
the case began oct 6 1980 with ross report wayne newton 
and the law ross reported that newton had gone to penosi for 
help with a problem and that unnamed federal sources were looking 
at newtons relationship to two east coast crime figures 
the reports said one mobster had bragged of earning an interest 
in las vegas aladdin hotel which newton owned at the time 
newton claimed the report left the impression that his october 
1980 purchase of the aladdin was tied to organized crime which he 
denies newton later sold the hotel 
abrams told reporters outside court i think that a loss in 
this case would make it very difficult for the press to report 
about investigations and suspicions about prominent public figures 
particularly in their own community 
judge dorothy nelson and chief appellate judge alfred goodwin 
joined norris on the panel nelson expressed interest in an nbc 
argument that the case should have been moved out of las vegas 
abrams said the defense submitted data on mr newtons general 
adulation in las vegas but was unable to win a change of venue 
it was nearly hopeless for us to get a fair trial in las 
vegas he said

being a musician is a wonderful profession masur said 
why should i change 
masur 62 spoke in a telephone interview while in paris to 
conduct a performance of bachs st matthew passion with the 
national orchestra of france and choral groups from leipzig at a 
medieval church in suburban saint denis 
it just isnt true that im leaving leipzig he said 
denying reports that surfaced after his new york appointment 
lots of conductors work with two even three orchestras at a 
time 
in fact ill be conducting fewer performances in new york 
than in leipzig he said i have an indefinite contract with 
the gewandhaus orchestra i grew up there i was taught by 
gewandhaus musicians and i would be foolish to leave an orchestra 
that we have built up as a wonderful family 
the new york philharmonic announced wednesday that masur would 
conduct a minimum of 14 subscription weeks and four weeks of other 
activities each season 
masur who succeeds zubin mehta in new york said he was very 
excited about the post which he has accepted for a fiveyear 
period beginning in 1992 
i would like to build up chamber music life inside the 
orchestra itself the way we did in leipzig he said it builds 
up the qualities of the orchestra and gives more exposure to the 
musicians 
last year masur played a major role in avoiding violence during 
the revolution that swept east germany in early october during a 
demonstration of thousands of people in leipzig he gathered a 
clergymen an opposition activist and three local communist party 
officials at his home and then taped a statement broadcast through 
loudspeakers saying the party committed itself to negotiation and 
nonviolence 
the statement represented a change in approach from that of 
hardline communist ruler erich honecker forced to resign oct 18 
i was needed at that moment and i did what was necessary he 
said i will live in leipzig hoping that life will go as we 
imagined it during the revolution 
masur said he was not sure that german unification would be 
beneficial to east german artists 
their future is in danger financially he said this is 
still a big question mark for me 
freedom is a wonderful gift for our country but like in 
sports where government subsidies for east german athletes are 
likely to be curtailed nobody should expect things to be better 
its simply not true

a colombian convicted of drug dealing 
testified friday that he gave ousted panamanian leader manuel 
noriega 4 million in cash for protection of a cocaine laboratory 
to be built in panama 
boris olarte morales has been a key prosecution witness in the 
trial of fellow colombian jose abello silva who is charged with 
conspiracy to import drugs into the united states 
olarte 27 who pleaded guilty in may 1987 and has been 
cooperating with the government said during defense 
crossexamination that he was smuggling marijuana and cocaine in 
1983 when he met noriega and asked him about doing business he 
said he returned to noriegas home a few weeks later 
i told him there were some people interested in opening a 
laboratory to process cocaine in his country and i asked him was 
it within his power to protect that operation olarte tetified 
he said noriega assured him he could provide protection 
olarte said he delivered 4 million in two large suitcases to 
noriega and received 10 percent of the money for setting up the 
operation 
his payment of that bribe is cited in a 1988 indictment in 
florida accusing noriega of drug conspiracy 
olarte said he returned to panama in early 1984 to let noriega 
know that his backers were unhappy with the protection 
the people that pay him through me to protect the operation in 
panama they were kind of upset olarte said i said you 
supposed to be protecting the operation over there and he didnt 
he said he protected what he was to be protecting but his 
people was doing more than they were supposed to do 
noriega is accused in the 1988 indictment of agreeing to permit 
the medellin cartel to establish and supply a cocaine laboratory in 
panama the indictment says a dispute developed between members of 
the cartel and noriega over the seizure of that cocaine laboratory 
despite payment by members of the cartel 
olarte also testified during crossexamination friday that he 
gave a fellow tulsa jail inmate 20000 as a down payment for an 
armed escape in which armed mercenaries in helicopters were to 
help him escape from jail he said the other inmate never carried 
through with the plan 
olarte was indicted in tulsa in 1986 for conspiring to import 
cocaine he testified that after he tried to get out of jail he 
agreed to plead guilty and work for the government by may 1987 
he said he then made a series of phone calls to drug partners in 
florida and aruba in which abello allegedly got involved in the 
conspiracy 
abello was indicted in september 1987 he was arrested in 
colombia and extradited last october to face charges in tulsa

pennsylvanias state superior court 
overturned two sentences against a man who pleaded guilty in 1988 
to forging a bogus lottery ticket so he could win an unclaimed 15 
million jackpot 
the court said in an opinion issued thursday that it agreed the 
five to 10year concurrent sentences against henry arthur rich on 
conspiracy and forgery charges were an abuse of discretion 
the court ordered rich to be resentenced on the charges 
but it left intact a two to fouryear sentence for theft by 
deception and a one to twoyear sentence for unlawful use of a 
computer rich worked for a computer firm used by the pennsylvania 
lottery 
in an appeal rich argued the conspiracy and forgery sentences 
exceeded guidelines set by the state and the judge failed to 
provide an explanation for the deviation as required during 
sentencing in december 1988 
michael moyle a spokesman for the state attorney general said 
the decision was under review he said the office might appeal to 
the state supreme court or wait for the resentencing 
during trial prosecutors said rich searched for highvalue 
unclaimed tickets in the lottery system and printed a nearperfect 
copy of a winning ticket from a july 1987 super 7 jackpot 
after forging the ticket authorities said rich enlisted mark 
s herbst a former video store clerk to turn in the ticket the 
lottery awarded the first installment nearly 470000 but 
officials detected the scam after noticing the ticket was not from 
the location where it had been sold 
herbst after pleading guilty to theft by deception and other 
charges was sentenced to a two to fouryear term

a british company accused of preparing steel tubes 
to make a 131footlong gun for iraq called the allegations absurd 
friday and said it had already shipped part of the order to baghdad 
customs officers on thursday seized eight sections of forged 
steel tubing on the docks at middlesbrough after a ministry of 
defense expert said they could be used to build a weapon 
some arms experts said such a gun could hit middle east targets 
hundreds of miles away others doubt the tubes could be used to 
make such a monster gun 
there is no question it could be used as a barrel of a large 
artillery gun to fire a projectile of some considerable size it is 
definitely subject to export licensing controls said douglas 
tweddle chief investigator for the customs and excise office 
iraqi officials and the manufacturer sheffield forgemasters 
say the tubing was intended for use in a petrochemical plant the 
company says the pipe sections were part of an assembly 5118 feet 
long 
i am sure that most people will recognize the absurdity of 
suggestions being made that these pipes are in fact guns company 
spokesman tony peck said 
the company said it had two contracts for 26 sections each and 
had delivered 44 sections to the ministry of industry and minerals 
in baghdad 
some weapons experts had said a gun with a barrel the size of 
the tube seized by customs 131 feet long with a 39inch bore 
could fire nuclear or chemical warheads as far as tehran or tel 
aviv each within 350 miles of iraqs borders 
if this is a gun we are probably going to have to rethink the 
laws of physics ian hogg a former lecturer in ordnance design 
and construction told the daily telegraph i cant see it 
withstanding the interior explosion of the size necessary to push a 
10ton missile up a 40meter tube 
if they did manage to get all the other necessary components i 
wouldnt stand within a mile of the thing if they tried to fire it 
it would blow itself to pieces said phillip wright chief 
executive of sheffield forgemasters 
prime minister margaret thatcher who talked with president bush 
in bermuda on friday said the experts are still considering and 
confirming as to whether it is a gun or simply large steel piping 
they have not yet made up their minds if it is a gun 
bush commended british intelligence and law enforcement agencies 
for seizing the tubing shortly before it was to be shipped to iraq 
anything we can do to keep guns or chemicals out of the hands 
of terrorist nations we should he said 
if it turns out the tubing was an illegal weapons export i 
would encourage and would offer our cooperation to guarantee a 
total banning and firming up the ban of weapons or potential 
weapons to countries that are illegally getting them 
it is our purpose to keep such things out of the hands of the 
iraqi government bush said 
tweddle said it wasnt necessary yet to determine whether the 
material was intended to be a gun only that it could be used that 
way and thus came within the provisions of britains embargo on 
arms shipments to iraq and iran 
the goods are now seized investigations will continue to 
prove intent and to establish whether offenses have been 
committed he said 
britain banned all arms sales to iraq and iran after the 
outbreak of the eightyear iraniraq war despite the 1988 
ceasefire the embargo remains 
the independent newspaper reported in friday editions the 
manufacturing method of special prestressed layered 
compressed steel the autofrettage technique was the same 
used to make gun barrels 
the times of london quoted an unidentified customs official as 
saying the seized materials matched a design by gerald bull an 
american arms expert found murdered in brussels last month janes 
defense weekly has identified bull as a designer of south africas 
g5 155mm howitzer which has been sold to iraq 
the times quoted the customs official as saying the manual 
describes precisely what we have got the manufacturing process 
the methods what it will fire the length of the barrel 
everything we are now absolutely certain that it is not only a 
gun but a gun made according to a bull design 
a customs spokesman could not be reached for comment on the good 
friday holiday no one answered the telephone at the agencys press 
office

arch a moore jr the patriarch of the 
state republican party and former threetime governor rode so high 
for so long against political odds that many thought he would never 
come down 
but now federal prosecutors have him in a box he has admitted 
kickbacks coverups and other crimes in office and agreed to 
testify possibly against other power brokers in west virginia 
politics 
moores image began unraveling when he met secretly with his 
former campaign manager in a parkersburg parking lot three months 
ago to discuss how they would both lie to a federal grand jury 
investigating moore authorities said 
the former governor told john f leaberry they would both 
falsely deny to federal investigators andor the grand jury that 
there had been cash collected or used illegally authorities said 
in an indictment announced thursday 
they discussed the fact that approximately 35000 in cash had 
been collected by them or others during moores 1988 election 
campaign according to the indictment 
two days later moore denied to federal investigators that he 
met with leaberry or knew about the 35000 in cash authorities 
said 
he denied both incidents again in a meeting last monday at the 
us attorneys office in charleston they said 
thats when federal prosecutors revealed that moores 
oncetrusted aide wore a microphone for the us justice department 
during the parking lot meeting and they had a tape of moores 
words to leaberry 
us attorney michael carey says the recording of moores jan 8 
conversation led directly to moores decision thursday to agree to 
plead guilty to five counts of extortion tax fraud mail fraud 
and obstruction of justice 
the strength of our case caused him to plead guilty and the 
tape was part of our case said assistant us attorney joe 
savage 
federal authorities friday refused to say why leaberry moores 
1988 campaign manager and a former state official wore the 
recording device they said only that leaberry had been subpoenaed 
to testify before the grand jury in charleston 
leaberrys lawyer john b carrico said leaberry was out of 
town friday but declined to comment further im not at liberty 
to discuss it he said 
prosecutors said that under the agreement with moore signed 
thursday he could be named in additional indictments as an 
unindicted coconspirator and he agreed to cooperate with federal 
prosecutors in other investigations 
the same officials would not elaborate friday on how they 
intended to use the exgovernor 
its premature to say hell be testifying in any specific 
trial savage said 
however the charleston daily mail quoting unidentified sources 
friday reported that moore will be a prosecution witness in the 
trial of william t ellis a limited partner in the tristate 
greyhound park dog track in nearby nitro 
ellis was indicted on charges of arranging a 100000 bribe to 
an unnamed state official and that officials political party 
moore was reached by telephone friday in west palm beach fla 
but he refused to talk to a reporter 
moore who turns 67 monday is scheduled for arraignment april 
26 authorities said he faces up to 36 years in prison and up to 
125 million in fines 
moore served as governor from 1969 to 1977 and 1985 to 1989 and 
was considered the dean of republican politics in this strongly 
democratic state 
he battled almost constantly with the democraticcontrolled 
legislature but won voter approval of a constitutional amendment 
giving the governor broad new power to set the state budget once 
before he had been indicted for wrongdoing in office but was 
acquitted 
hours after moores indictment thursday came another indictment 
of former state senate president larry tucker charging the 
democrat with two counts of obstructing the internal revenue 
service one count of lying to a grand jury and one count of 
perjury 
tucker who already has served half of a sixmonth federal 
sentence faces a maximum of 18 years in prison and 520000 in 
fines in connection with work he allegedly performed for a nursing 
home

president bush on friday reassured 
relatives of two pan am 103 victims that the united states is 
committed to bringing to justice the terrorists who bombed the 
plane 
we will continue to do everything we can in cooperation with 
the uk and other countries to get to the bottom of this cowardly 
dastardly incident bush said at the conclusion of a joint news 
conference with british prime minister margaret thatcher 
mrs thatcher said no one wants to solve that terrible tragedy 
more than we do 
but we simply cant pull solutions out of the hat its a 
question of patient continuous work on that investigation and 
patient continuous determination to try to defeat terrorism 
pan am flight 103 en route from london to new york exploded 
over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 1988 all 259 people on the 
plane and 11 people on the ground were killed 
bert ammerman of river vale nj and dr jim swire of 
bromsgrove england called on bush and mrs thatcher to issue a 
communique condemning the attack and renewing their determination 
to catch those responsible 
as the leaders of the two greatest powers in the free world 
it is incumbent upon you to form the nucleus of a concentrated 
effort to mobilize an effective global strategy to combat 
terrorism they said in a letter to bush and mrs thatcher 
if the united states and the united kingdom do not stand firm 
on combating terrorism but rather acquiesce to politically 
expedient solutions we will have compromised our nations ethics 
bush said the record of the united states and united kingdom in 
speaking out against terrorist acts was clear 
but i dont think it hurts to reiterate our conviction that 
these dastardly terrorist acts must stop 
he said the united states had formed a commission and i know 
great inquiry has gone on in the uk 
mrs thatcher said authorities had gotten quite a long way 
in the investigation but that it wasnt completed 
mrs thatcher said she understands the frustrations of the 
relatives 
we too wish there were far less terrorism in the world 
she said 
bush said we understand and we do care

president bush and british prime 
minister margaret thatcher urged soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev on friday to call off his threatened economic sanctions 
against breakaway lithuania 
now is no time for escalation bush said after he and the 
prime minister met for several hours of discussions it is time 
for talk between moscow and the lithuanians 
said mrs thatcher i abide by the statement the president 
just made 
the president and the prime minister met with reporters hours 
after the soviet news agency tass reported that gorbachev had given 
the lithuanian government two days to rescind its 
anticonstitutional actions or face the imposition of sanctions 
bush traveled to bermuda at mrs thatchers invitation to 
discuss a variety of global issues including german unification 
nato and the situation in lithuania in advance of his meeting 
next month with gorbachev 
the president said he would cooperate in tightening export laws 
if british investigators determine that a seized load of tubing 
destined for iraq amounted to an illegal weapons shipment 
both emphasized their agreement on most issues particularly on 
the position that a unified germany should be a permanent member of 
nato 
at a predinner black tie reception with mrs thatcher aboard 
the british naval vessel hms arrow the president plunged into a 
crowd of 400 to 500 cheering bystanders to shake hands 
bush was to play golf saturday before returning to washington 
the two leaders took a break from serious matters friday to join 
about 20 children in a good friday tradition of flying kites the 
bermuda ritual was begun by teacher trying to explain to his 
students christs ascension into heaven 
even as he criticized gorbachevs threatened sanctions bush 
welcomed as a positive statement the soviet presidents remark 
to a delegation of us senators on thursday that the two leaders 
might be able to initial an arms control pact when they meet in 
washington in six weeks 
bush said the slant of gorbachevs remarks to the senators 
was more encouraging than what he had heard from soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze when the two met last week 
reacting to a news agency report that gorbachev had tightened 
the pressure on lithuania with the threat of an economic boycott 
bush said there was little more the western allies can do to stay 
gorbachevs hand without risking a break in eastwest relations 
i am troubled by it the president said of the report 
adding that all he knew was what he had read in a brief dispatch 
from moscow 
i know there is a great desire on the part of americans to 
know what we might do what can be done bush said 
but he said that even if he had a response he was not sure he 
would make it public 
the answer in lithuania is dialogue and peaceful change 
bush said 
later white house spokesman marlin fitzwater was asked if the 
administration had anything further to say about lithuania he 
replied no actually it is less certain now what happened what 
we are trying to do is sort out what happened and what it means 
both bush and mrs thatcher reacted to gorbachevs statement to 
the visiting senators that he did not need further lectures from 
outside about his policy toward the lithuanian attempt to break 
free of soviet control 
mrs thatcher said she was not lecturing anyone but is 
entitled to express my view the problem cannot be solved by 
force 
we have a duty to say what we think she declared she said 
she thinks the situation should not be resolved by force 
bush said he felt he was on the rigt track in urging 
gorbachev to proceed with negotiations in lieu of using force 
mrs thatcher said british experts had not yet determined if a 
shipment of metal tubing for iraq halted thursday at the last 
moment contained the makings for an enormous gun barrel rather 
than as iraq claimed sections of pipeline 
bush praised the british for catching the shipment in time 
there has been superb cooperation between the united states and 
the united kingdom in trying to avert breaches in the law he 
said 
en route to bermuda for his sixth meeting with the british 
leader in his 15month presidency bush welcomed gorbachevs very 
positive statement on the prospects for reaching a nucleararms 
accord at next months superpower summit 
we are sending the same signals to our negotiators and 
policymakers bush told reporters aboard air force one 
earlier in the day the president was greeted by the prime 
minister under overcast skies at a breezy arrival ceremony on the 
grounds of the 33acre oceanside government house 
after reviewing brightly uniformed and helmeted members of the 
bermuda guard the two leaders went inside for their meeting 
in his remarks on the way to bermuda a selfruling british 
colony the president said he was very upbeat about the 
thatcher meeting one of a series of three facetoface 
presummit sessions with allied leaders 
he met with canadian prime minister brian mulroney in toronto on 
tuesday and plans to meet thursday in key largo fla with french 
president francois mitterrand 
the president said he welcomed gorbachevs comments on 
initialling a strategic arms reduction treaty start at their 
washington summit 
i viewed that as a very positive statement bush said 
he said he was eager to meet next week with senate majority 
leader george mitchell who headed the senatorial delegation that 
met with gorbachev 
bush shrugged off gorbachevs comment to the senators cautioning 
the united states against preaching to the kremlin about lithuania 
moscow views the baltic republics march 11 declaration of 
independence as illegal 
i dont view that gorbachevs remarks as a hostile comment 
but i view it as a reiteration of his wellknown position that 
the dispute in lithuania is an internal soviet matter bush said 
by the same token bush added i will continue to say what i 
think on this subject bush has voiced his support for the 
selfdetermination rights of lithuanians but has urged restraint on 
both sides 
asked if he feared that soviet hardliners advocating greater 
use of force in lithuania were gaining influence bush said 
there is some speculation on that but we cannot read the 
tea leaves with total clarity when it comes to pressures inside the 
kremlin 
he also welcomed the east german governments public apology to 
jews for nazi atrocities 
im one who believes in forgiveness the president said 
and this is a good day for forgiveness 
he added 
im inclined to think we ought to forgive but not forget im 
a christian i think forgiveness is something i feel very strongly 
about

interrupted by a passerby 
the charges against ray shawn jackson of kansas city were 
announced at a news conference held by police chief larry joiner 
jackson county prosecutor albert riederer and kansas city mayor 
richard berkley 
joiner said that the six strangled women had all been lured to 
the areas where they were slain in or near gillham park in 
midtown by the promise of obtaining crack cocaine 
many blacks have said authorities and the media failed to give 
the case adequate attention because the victims were black 
prostitutes and drug addicts gillham park has become a death 
trap for black women ron finley a member of the ad hoc group 
against crime said before jacksons arrest 
the chief said the charges were the outcome of thousands of 
hours of investigation that speeded up again last week after the 
death of michelle mitchell 22 
circulation of a composite drawing of a man believed to be a 
suspect in her death produced more than 300 phone calls joiner 
said detectives were told that jackson who is also black matched 
the description of the drawing and that he had been bragging about 
killing a woman in gillham park 
joiner said officers found him at a relatives house where he 
stayed periodically 
the chief said jackson had no history of violence or any prior 
arrest record but that it was his understanding he had used drugs 
i dont think i can get into his motives joiner said 
in addition to the killing of miss mitchell whose body was 
found on april 5 jackson is charged with killing annette stewart 
33 whose body was found sept 16 kimberly creer 22 found sept 
20 tresa williams 21 found oct 22 janice berryman 36 found 
oct 28 and tonya ward 23 found jan 18 
the investigation has not produced evidence linking jackson to 
the death of the seventh woman brenda mccoy 33 who was found 
sept 26 joiner said 
but the 27yearold black woman assaulted on monday night had 
identified jackson from a photograph as her assailant he said 
according to police statements the woman said she was walking 
on the street and noticed someone following her she said he asked 
to join her and she refused and that later the man came at her 
from behind knocking her down and dragging her into some bushes 
where he began choking her 
the woman said the assailant was scared away by a man out 
walking his dog 
jackson told detectives he killed the six women after offering 
to get cocaine for them according to police he said he packed mud 
in one womans mouth and removed his victims clothing and 
scattered it around after killing them

president bush said friday that he was 
inclined to forgive the east germans for their role in the murder 
of millions of jews during the holocaust 
the east german legislature accepted responsibility thursday for 
the nazi atrocities during world war ii and sought assurances of 
forgiveness from israel the soviet union and jews around the world 
im one who believes in forgiveness bush told reporters 
aboard air force one just before takeoff for bermuda and his 
oneday meeting with british prime minister margaret thatcher 
its a good day for forgiveness for those of us who have faith 
in a statement received in washington the simon wiesenthal 
center of los angeles said the presidents remark was morally 
wrong and politically dangerous because the generation of 
germans who perpetrated the holocaust can never be forgiven for 
their heinous crimes 
indeed the only people who could have granted them 
forgiveness perished in the gas chambers the center said in a 
statement 
while the jewish people do not hold those individuals born 
after the holocaust to be responsible for the crimes of their 
forefathers nonetheless the legacy of auschwitz must be 
permanently embedded into the conscience of the german nation 
the statement said 
the center is a private group devoted to education about the 
nazi murder of 6 million jews and the capture of nazi war criminals 
bush noted the start of the easter weekend he attended a 
sunrise good friday church service before leaving washington 
asked about the service bush joked with reporters we prayed 
for you 
he turned more solemn when asked about east germany and the 
holocaust 
for our family easter is a very special time of year and 
its a time to take stock and to be glad bush said 
im a christian he said and i think that forgiveness is 
something that i feel very strongly about 
but while bush advocated forgiveness he said the world should 
not forget the holocaust you learn from history what not to do 
wrong how to conduct oneself he said 
bush said his feelings about forgiveness were a personal 
observation its not a statement for our country 
in its statement the east german parliament said nationalism 
and racial madness led to genocide particularly of the jews in all 
european countries of the people of the soviet union the polish 
people and the gypsy people parliament admits joint 
responsibility on behalf of the people for the humiliation 
expulsion and murder of jewish women men and children

a greyhound bus was discovered parked near 
railroad tracks friday its engine still running and police said 
it apparently was abandoned after a failed attempt to park it 
across the tracks 
officials of strikebound greyhound lines inc had not reported 
the bus missing when police patrolling the suburb west of chicago 
found it about 130 am said maywood police sgt donald mobley 
the bus was about 2 feet from the tracks 
apparently they were trying to get it onto the tracks but it 
got stuck on the rocks near the tracks and whoever brought it there 
abandoned it mobley said 
greyhounds 6300 drivers and about 3000 office and maintenance 
workers walked out march 2 in an argument over wages and job 
security the company has been operating a reduced schedule since 
using permanent replacements and drivers willing to cross picket 
lines 
greyhound has reported more than 30 shooting attacks on its 
buses 70 bomb threats and more than 100 incidents of violence 
one picketing driver robert waterhouse 59 died when he was 
crushed by a bus driven by a replacement driver in redding calif 
the dead mans son bob waterhouse jr of wenatchee wash 
picketed the greyhound depot in his home town of wenatchee wash 
on thursday in protest after a shasta county calif district 
attorney decided not to charge the driver of the bus 
bill pearsall an official of the amalgamated transit union in 
chicago said strikers had nothing to do with the bus 
disappearance 
the bus arrived in chicago on thursday from milwaukee said 
greyhound spokesman bill kula 
the driver was told to drive another bus back to milwaukee and 
another driver was supposed to take the bus to the garage for 
servicing somehow or another that didnt happen said kula 
the wires got crossed 
someone started it and drove off unseen between 8 pm and 12 
am kula said 
to prevent similar incidents in the future greyhound is 
requiring drivers in chicago to show photo identification cards 
before they leave the terminal kula said 
elsewhere a new york state judge signed an order friday barring 
greyhound from employing strikebreakers within new york city 
but attorneys for striking workers said it was doubtful the order 
would be followed the order did not spell out any penalties or 
sanctions against greyhound if it failed to comply 
acting state supreme court justice diane lebedeff actually 
granted the temporary restraining order verbally last week basing 
it on an antistrikebreaking statute passed by the city council in 
1962 but never before applied 
lebedeff also allowed ronald l kuby an attorney for local 1202 
of the amalgamated transit union and cocounsel william kunstler 
to take depositions of greyhound drivers in new york city 
kunstler the noted civil rights attorney said the interviews 
would allow the unions to learn if replacement workers have 
criminal records bad driving histories or if they received bonuses 
to work for greyhound 
our effort will be to show theyre really hiring bums in order 
to break the union he said

lifting a slender 5foothigh cross before him 
pope john paul ii led a torchlight procession through the colosseum 
friday night to reenact jesus march to his crucifixion 
thousands of people bearing candles in red paper cones watched 
the good friday ceremony broadcast to millions throughout the 
world 
the ceremony was one of several worldwide that marked good 
friday thousands of pilgrims retraced the traditional procession 
route through jerusalems old city and hundreds of thousands of 
roman catholics turned out for the 146th annual reenactment of the 
crucifixion at an ancient indian ceremonial site in mexico 
in the philippines more than 20 filipino penitents were nailed 
to crosses today and others whipped themselves bloody as asias 
only predominantly christian nation marked the crucifixion the 
penitents were nailed to the crosses for up to 10 minutes 
traffic jams snared holidary travelers in east and west germany 
for the first time the ceremony in rome was transmitted to the 
soviet union the stateowned italian rai network said 
all of us who belong to the priestly people of the new 
covenant gaze upon the cross with veneration and recollection 
john paul said in a brief address in italian at the end of the 
procession of the via crucis or way of the cross 
we draw nourishment from the impenetrable mystery which human 
words cannot describe 
the procession from the colosseum to the edge of the ancient 
roman forum evoked the tortures jesus suffered as he made his way 
to his crucifixion on calvary hill in jerusalem 
at each of the 14 stops representing the stages of jesus 
suffering men and women read meditations written by the latin 
patriarch of jerusalem michel sabbah they asked for spiritual 
blessings for modern christians 
the pope wearing white robes and a crimson cape trimmed with 
gold carried before him a slender black cross made of lightweight 
wood he was followed by two men bearing torches and a group of 
cardinals and other priests 
thousands of nuns tourists and romans outside the colosseum 
prayed and sang in latin as the pope walked slowly between the 
stations a large cross made of candles flickered inside the 
colosseum 
the good friday ceremonies mark the most solemn day of the year 
for christians who celebrate jesus resurrection on easter sunday 
the papal tradition of marking the way of the cross was revived 
in 1964 by pope paul vi after an interruption of nearly a century 
following the creation of the modern italian state 
among the 14 stations of the cross are stops marking the three 
times jesus stumbles and falls under the weight of the cross 
in a good friday message issued earlier to maronite catholic 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir the pope appealed anew for a halt to the 
fratricidal fighting in lebanon 
the drama of lebanon must end lebanon must live again 
said the telegram which came on the 15th anniversary of the start 
of lebanons civil war 
the pontiff also celebrated a ceremony in st peters basilica 
friday afternoon marking jesus sacrifice he prayed for a variety 
of groups including jews may the lord our god who once spoke 
to their the jews fathers help them to always advance in the 
love of his name and in faithfulness to his alliance the pope 
said 
catholic church policy toward jews underwent a major change with 
the 1965 document nostra aetate which officially refuted the 
charge that jews bore collective responsibility for killing jesus 
just after noon john paul heard the confessions of 12 pilgrims 
in st peters basilica continuing a good friday tradition he 
began 11 years ago to emphasize the importance of the sacrament 
the pope will celebrate the easter vigil saturday night 
followed by an openair mass on easter sunday in st peters square

a city councillor from sinn fein the political 
wing of the irish republican army arrived in montreal from 
northern ireland to demand that belfasts main employer a 
canadianowned company hires more catholics 
pat rice a councillor in the belfast suburb of lisburn began a 
series of meetings friday to persuade the montrealbased bombardier 
inc to hire more catholics at its short brothers plc aircraft and 
missile manufacturing subsidiary 
bombardier bought the sprawling company which employs 7000 
from the british government in october for 60 million 
since june when the purchase was announced the ira has bombed 
short four times to protest what it called job discrimination no 
one has been injured in the bombings 
rice said the ira bombings of the short plant were not the 
ideal background for my visit 
but i can see certain advantages if you like as a shot 
across the bow to bombardier about a problem which they have 
inherited he said 
rice said just 11 percent of shorts workforce is catholic 
although catholics make up 36 percent of northern irelands 
population 
short has always been a symbol of discrimination he 
said 
bombardier officials were unavailable for comment friday 
but in a recent interview bombardier spokesman yvon turcot said 
the ira had the wrong address in bombing the plant 
he said short had a strong record in recruiting catholic workers 
and bombardier is certainly not going to jeopardize that record 
rice said that bombardier has expressed good intentions about 
hiring catholics 
but he added we have an expression in ireland words dont 
feed the brethren

northrop corp has launched a costcutting 
program to protect the 75 billion stealth bomber program 
including layoffs a trimmed inspection program and reduced 
security a spokesman said friday 
we have a costreduction effort said northrop spokesman 
tony cantafio but he noted the reductions were part of a 
longplanned companywide effort to trim expenses 
we are streamlining throughout the company last year we 
announced that this kind of undertaking would take place throughout 
the company cantafio said 
in addition to cost cuts northrop documents show the company 
also aims to boost profits on the sofar anemic b2 program 
increasing its goal from a 6 percent profit margin this year to 9 
percent 
the expensive stealth bomber program has been facing stiff 
congressional criticism 
the public debate has been on the cost said oliver boileau 
stealth division president it is prudent for management to 
always try to drive costs down we are doing our part 
cantafio said delaying the program adds to cost 
these are the things we are doing in the factory to cut costs 
the big thing with the b2 is the rate at which we build them 
he said 
though the company has not set a costreduction goal boileau 
said the current reductions should do enough to lower the overall 
cost of the program 
among the steps is laying off as many as 500 of the 12000 
northrop b2 employees at the stealth operations in pico rivera and 
palmdale the final number of layoffs is being worked out boileau 
said 
we had peak employment of 14500 during development of the b2 
and now we are at 12000 but we will also be hiring in palmdale 
said cantafio they are in a transition from development to 
fullscale production 
some positions will be eliminated but others will be 
created 
led by california democratic sen alan cranston critics of the 
b2 contend the perplane cost could run as high as 195 billion 
if the government cuts back on its plan to buy 132 bombers 
another costcutting step involves reducing security a 
highprice item on a program as highly classified as the b2 for 
years the company would not even admit the program existed 
security requirements have been reduced as far as the 
government wants to go boileau said 
other measures include having factory employees inspect some of 
their own work consolidating three computer centers into two 
cutting travel expenses and reducing outside contracting for labor

most cincinnati residents believe an art 
gallery should be allowed to show robert mapplethorpes 
controversial photographs according to a poll published friday by 
the cincinnati post 
the poll of 561 adults in hamilton county found that 59 percent 
support the contemporary arts center in displaying the photographs 
the art gallery and is director were indicted one week ago on 
misdemeanor obscenity charges for displaying seven photos that show 
naked children or homoerotic acts 
county prosecutor arthur ney jr tried to get the seven 
photographs voluntarily removed following the indictments but a 
federal judge granted the art gallery a protective order 
prohibiting authorities from interfering with the show 
prosecutors will have to convince a jury that the photos violate 
community standards in order to get an obscenity conviction 
the poll conducted by the institute for policy research on 
behalf of the newspaper found that a substantial majority wants 
the photos to be shown said al tuchfarber who directed the 
survey at the institute 
roughly 38 percent said the photographs shouldnt be shown and 
3 percent had no opinion 
support for the show came from all demographic groups 
tuchfarber said the strongest opposition came from the elderly and 
those who havent attended college 
younger residents tended to support the art gallery and men 
favored the exhibition in larger numbers than did women the poll 
found 
religion appeared to play no major role a majority of 
catholics 56 percent and protestants 57 percent supported it 
these numbers shatter the myth that this is a heavily 
conservative community tuchfarber said 
the telephone survey was conducted last wednesday and thursday 
it has a margin for error of 4 percent 
roughly 96 percent of those who were surveyed had seen read or 
heard about the exhibit 
that number is absolutely phenomenal for an issue like this 
tuchfarber said 
on another question about 55 percent said the government and 
courts should have no role in determining what is displayed at art 
museums about 42 percent said theyd support government 
involvement if displays seriously offend community standards 
in a related development friday mayor charles luken accused 
ney the county prosecutor of backing out of the obscenity case 
because he doubted he could win 
ney on thursday transferred the case to the city prosecutors 
office saying his office couldnt handle the case because the 
charges involved were only misdemeanors 
i think this is a politically hot potato and the reason mr 
ney is doing this is that he doesnt feel he can win luken said 
neys assistant chip gerhardt denied the accusation gerhardt 
said ohio law prohibits neys office from prosecuting misdemeanors 
the law is clear on this and mr lukens a lawyer and he 
should understand the law gerhardt said

thousands of loggers and mill workers 
jammed a downtown square friday to protest the movement to remove 
large tracts of timber from logging production to save forest owls 
some 8000 to 10000 people protested an emerging national 
policy to limit logging the last of the nevercut timber in the 
pacific northwest timber families fear they will be ignored by 
policymakers from outside the region 
environmentalists argue that the old growth timber must be 
protected to save the northern spotted owl from extinction they 
say the owl cannot survive outside the complex ecosystem anchored 
by centuriesold trees 
i know we care for our forests said audrey barnes whose 
familys ties to the timber industry stretch back three 
generations i know we can live with nature and nature with us 
organizers said 350 businesses around the state closed so their 
employees could attend some schools excused students so they could 
join their families at the hourlong rally at pioneer courthouse 
square 
douglas county officials gave 25 to 30 local government 
employees the day off with pay about 105 businesses closed and 500 
people came from the major mill town of sweet home 
bob and susan kasting owners of the busy bee restaurant in 
sweet home said shutting down the timber industry would devastate 
his business 
if they cant work they cant eat he said 
republican sen bob packwood said he had run out of patience 
with environmentalists seeking to end all logging in the state he 
told the crowd that their efforts could be condensed into two 
words no jobs 
you and i know we can have jobs forever packwood said 
coalition member evelyn badger said congress would be asked to 
set aside forest land specifically for timber harvests 
we are the dirtyhands people who feed clothe and shelter 
this nation she said 
environmentalist mari hoffman from vancouver wash who carried 
a sign advocating protection for old growth said she thought the 
timber industry had forced the debate over logging by overcutting 
the northwest woods 
were not opposed to logging she said were just opposed 
to the amount of logging thats taking place

former us sen lawton chiles the 
latest candidate in the democratic gubernatorial field 
acknowledges he is being treated for depression but his opponents 
friday shied away from making it an issue 
chiles 60 readily admitted thursday that he has been treated 
for the past year with prozac a revolutionary but expensive new 
antidepressant drug that came onto the market in late 1987 
i wish i had known about prozac earlier because it has helped 
me said chiles who said his condition stemmed partly from his 
retirement from the senate in january 1989 
ive had depression and sought treatment chiles told the 
palm beach post in a telephone interview thursday the post 
attributed the initial report about his ailment to unidentified 
republican officials but gop officials friday distanced 
themselves from the report 
i think i was depressed about what was going on in the 
state joked chiles who said he takes one pill a day and feels 
great now im going to do something about it 
chiles said in a telephone interview friday his treatment is 
near completion 
i think im finishing up chiles said it has really 
helped me i really feel great 
spokesmen for chiles two democratic opponents said their 
candidates were healthy and that chiles depression was not 
presently an issue 
were not making it an issue certainly at this stage said 
don pride press secretary for us rep bill nelson who had been 
considered the democratic frontrunner until chiles entry 
however pride said chiles decision to leave the senate after 
his third term because the senator claimed to be burned out was 
an issue 
prozac which costs between 125 and 160 a pill is the most 
frequently prescribed antidepressant in the country physicians in 
the united states write or renew about 650000 prozac prescriptions 
each month according to published reports 
a tampa pyschiatrist walter field said it would be 
disgraceful and irresponsible if someone questioned chiles 
abilities because he is taking prozac 
brian ballard operations director for republican gov bob 
martinez commented using this as an issue is not something 
were going to do 
the governor is saying its up to the democrats to decide 
whether that is an issue or not said ballard i know the 
governor does not think the campaign is based on that type of 
thing he wants to talk about the issues 
the governors campaign manager jm mac stipanovich said 
there isnt enough information available on the seriousness of the 
illness 
were not going to make it an issue now said stipanovich 
were waiting for a nominee 
scott sokol communications and political director for democrat 
george stuarts campaign said chiles medical standing was a 
private matter and should not be available for public examination 
aides for martinez stuart and nelson said all three would make 
their candidates medical records available 
nelson breezed through a complete nasa physical and mental 
checkup in september 1985 preceding his flight with space shuttle 
columbia in january 1986 pride said

environmentalists and lawmakers are hailing a 
decision by three us tuna canners including the worlds largest 
not to buy or sell tuna captured along with dolphins

tuna caught in association with dolphins and will sell only 
dolphinfree tuna

texan phil gramm one of the senates most 
ardent foes of abortion is backing a proposal by homestate 
republicans that would ban most abortions only after pregnancies 
pass the halfway mark 
yet republican gramm who has cosponsored five constitutional 
amendments to ban abortions even in cases of rape or incest 
insists he isnt waffling 
state sen hugh parmer a prochoice democrat who is running

trying to project a more moderate image on abortion to voters back 
home without really changing his stance

arms reduction may be the order of the 
day for the superpowers but indias drive to become the next 
military giant has scuttled hopes of a peace dividend in 
economically strapped south asia 
indias neighbors especially pakistan are following its lead 
in the buildup western military analysts and indian intellectuals 
fear another chapter of an expensive regional arms race is about to 
begin 
while the soviet union withdraws troops from eastern europe and 
the united states plans defense cuts the indian defense budget for 
1990 is more than 10 percent above last year 
between 1985 and 1989 india bought more weapons abroad 173 
billion worth than any country in the world 
in response president ghulam ishaq khan of pakistan said his 
country would continue stockpiling advanced weapons pakistan 
already allocates 52 percent of its 68 billion federal budget to 
defense 
china recently announced a defense spending increase of 152 
percent over 1989 
there will be no peace dividend in south asia said ian 
anthony an expert on the indian military at the stockholm 
international peace research institute in sweden india thinks a 
strong military will give it international prestige i think 
theyve got it wrong 
anthony and other western military analysts say india is the 
engine driving the regional arms buildup more important than 
recent tensions with pakistan they say is indias desire to 
achieve military might 
india already has enough troops to smother pakistan in a 
protracted war said a western military official in new delhi 
they have their sights on a longterm military role 
western economists and indian intellectuals say the buildup 
harms the indian economy and those of other developing nations in 
the region 
pakistans per capita gross national product of just 350 a year 
is the highest in the region and it faces a host of domestic 
problems that include a burgeoning drug trade and ethnic violence 
bangladesh and nepal two of the poorest countries in the world 
spend large amounts of their foreign exchange on weapons 
some say india seeks entry into the world military club for 
reasons of pride 
weaklings are not honored we want to be strong apj 
abdul kalam father of indias intermediaterange ballistic 
missile said soon after the rockets test firing in may 1989 
others feel india wants to assume the role its former colonial 
masters the british once played in south asia india is not 
seeking to colonize the region they say but wants to be viewed as 
its protector 
the british dominated the subcontinent they guaranteed its 
security said giri deshingkar director of the center for the 
study of developing societies indias military wants to do the 
same 
the fall of prime minister rajiv gandhi late last year led 
development experts to feel the defense budget which has risen 400 
percent in a decade might be reduced 
troubles with pakistan strengthened the military lobby experts 
said and hopes that prime minister vp singhs government would 
devote more money to education and health soon evaporated 
on march 19 the new government announced a 105 percent 
increase in defense spending to 93 billion most of the extra 
money went for weapons 
adm jg nadkarni argued in a speech last month that military 
might not economic development was the key to power 
there are few things that india can do that can get this 
country greater leverage with the great powers than interfere with 
their plans said nadkarni chief of the naval staff 
the mere capability to interfere with superpower movement in 
international waters he said would cause them to think twice 
about crossing india diplomatically 
its basic gunboat diplomacy a western military officer 
said we dont think it will work 
with 14 million men indias military is the fourth largest in 
the world after the soviet union china and united states the air 
force has 870 planes and is third behind moscow and washington in 
heavy combat airlift capacity 
india has built a blue water navy including two aircraft 
carriers with britishmade harrier jets 
in 1988 a sovietmade nuclear submarine joined indias 16 
conventional subs 
since independence from britain in 1947 indias soldiers not 
its diplomats have played the key role in most foreign policy 
crises 
a border dispute with pakistan over kashmir led to war in 1948 
and again in 1965 in 1971 indian military intervention in the 
pakistani civil war helped create the new nation of bangladesh from 
east pakistan 
india annexed goa a portuguese colony on its western coast in 
1961 by sending in the army 
the next year a border dispute with china brought india its 
only major defeat china seized 38000 square kilometers 15000 
square miles during the short war middleaged indians still talk 
about the humiliation 
most recently indian troops spent 32 months trying to quell a 
guerrilla uprising in sri lanka the island nation off its southern 
coast the last troops withdrew march 24 
in november 1988 indian paratroopers thwarted an attempted coup 
in the maldives during a recent trade dispute with landlocked 
nepal india closed 13 of the 15 border crossings and curtailed the 
passage of essential goods 
a bloody escalation of the independence movement in indias part 
of kashmir has prompted saberrattling toward pakistan which india 
accuses of financing and arming moslem separatists pakistan denies 
the charge 
the commitment to military growth could be weakening the 
economy in the 1960s india was about 15th in per capita 
industrial output but now its about 30th according to united 
nations figures 
arms purchas have contributed to a foreign debt of more than 63 
billion fourth largest in the world 
reliance on force is ironic in the nation that gave the world 
mohandas k gandhi and his philosophy of nonviolent political 
struggle said bhabani sen gupta a leading social scientist 
the rest of the world is changing but we refuse to do so 
he said we are obsessed with the sound of our shotguns

an unrepentant charles diggs jr 
is seeking a political comeback a decade after leaving congress in 
disgrace hoping voters will remember his accomplishments more than 
the kickback scandal that forced him from office 
that happened 10 years ago said diggs who is running for 
the maryland legislature and we fought it right to the end if 
that case had been brought up today it would have been thrown out 
should have been thrown out then 
diggs a democrat who represented michigan in the us house for 
25 years said he does not view his candidacy for the maryland 
house of delegates as a launching pad for a return to congress 
in fact he said he wants to serve just one fouryear term as a 
state lawmaker so he can help redraw marylands political district 
lines a process blacks hope will boost their numbers in the 
legislature and congress 
blacks are very underrepresented in several areas in this 
state diggs said i have been through redistricting in 
michigan theres negotiation give and take and i would be 
lending my experience to a situation that needs a remedy 
he was involved in michigan reapportionment negotiations that 
followed the 1960 census after the states house boundaries were 
realigned michigan became the first state since reconstruction 
with two black congressmen 
diggs one of five democrats seeking three delegate slots in 
marylands 26th house district now runs a funeral business in 
suburban prince georges county outside washington he said people 
in his district have not discouraged him from running because of 
his past legal troubles 
diggs 67 claimed he was a victim of selective prosecution and 
double standards when he was indicted in 1978 on charges of mail 
fraud and skimming 66000 from his staffers padded paychecks 
it was a position he maintained throughout a trial that produced 
guilty verdicts on all 29 counts a lengthy congressional inquiry 
that ended with a formal censure a sixmonth prison term and 
ensuing years of financial and legal trouble 
he offers the same defense even now saying he was dealt with 
more harshly than other lawmakers accused of ethical 
transgressions he believes his outspoken criticism of us policy 
toward africa was one reason 
i was the biggest antisouth african around diggs said 
they were very upset with me didnt allow me in the country for 
a long time there was a lot of speculation that people were trying 
to derail me because of the influence i was exerting regarding 
africa 
it was nearly 40 years ago that diggs launched his political 
career by winning a term in the michigan legislature 
he went on to become one of the nations most powerful black 
officials founding the congressional black caucus and chairing the 
house subcommittee on africa and the committee that oversees the 
district of columbia 
john kotelly the former assistant us attorney who prosecuted 
diggs said it was up to the voters to decide whether to give him 
another chance 
its ancient history said kotelly now a private attorney 
in washington i dont believe that anybody has to wear sackcloth 
forever after being convicted 
diggs was born into a politically active detroit family in 1922 
his father charles diggs sr was a wealthy funeral home director 
and real estate investor and the first man in town to sell blacks 
coffins made of material other than wood 
the younger diggs entered the family business and was elected a 
michigan legislator in 1950 four years later he won the first of 
13 terms in congress where his influence grew as he gained 
seniority 
a federal grand jury indicted diggs on kickback charges in 1978 
he was convicted on all counts but won reelection a month later 
and continued serving in congress while his sentence was appealed 
in june 1979 a republicanled effort to expel diggs from the 
house failed by eight votes a month later he stood silently at 
the front of the house chamber as his formal censure was read 
diggs resigned from congress in june 1980 after the supreme 
court declined to hear his appeal 
over the next several years he fought to regain his morticians 
licenses in several states clashed with the treasury department 
over payment of his courtordered fine and was charged with 
drunken driving three times 
he also graduated from howard university more than 40 years 
after leaving college to serve in world war ii 
diggs who lives almost within view of capitol hill said he 
doesnt miss his days in congress 
when i drive by or see it on tv its almost like an old 
dream he said its part of my experience but i dont sit 
around crying about it

working girl nbcs new comedy series 
premiering tonight is a harmless knockoff of the bigscreen tale 
of a secretary with a whole bunch of spunk but the tv versions 
shorthand needs work 
it takes more than a title to convert the major characters of a 
twohour movie into 22 minutes of mirth the sitcom struggles of 
valiant workingclass tess mcgill played here by sandra bullock 
just dont make you laugh 
the shows producers bought themselves a name some characters 
and carly simons theme song let the river run the song by 
the way was the only oscar winner among the movies six 
nominations and somebody else sings it on nbcs venture 
the movie was a boxoffice success largely due to the screwball 
premise that a clever resourceful ambitious secretary like tess 
forsaking her friends and upbringing could wangle a major wall 
street deal and have harrison ford fall in love with her 
but we knew we wouldnt have to come back to the theater next 
week to see how tess prevailed 
situation comedy is different you want the customers to keep 
coming back 
working girl the series is about a tess who tries to keep 
her staten island roots and make it in the junior executive program 
the premiere episodes writers producers robin schiff and larry 
konner give tess a couple of parents played by bj ward and 
david schramm who run an unbelievably spacious deli back on staten 
island 
they provide a kind of wonder bread ethnicity along with the 
meaningful conflict sample 
dad oh so you are gonna give up ah just like dat 
tess doesnt fare too well in the dialogue department either 
one of her lines dad you are driving me crazy 
presumably while mom and dad provide confused family 
relationships for tess her coworkers and superiors at monolithic 
trask industries provide the laffs this is theoretical right now 
there arent many yuks in tonights show and everything happens 
too quickly 
and theres no romance we only briefly meet the neighborhood 
hunk played by anthony tyler quinn tess it seems has refused to 
go out with him since the eighth grade we can suspect this might 
change 
nana visitor has quite a challenge in the sigourney weaver role 
trasks evil witch shes as blonde sleek and shallow as tess is 
dark sensitive and sweet her survival in the series will depend 
on how well she can vacillate between nasty and nice come to think 
of it though the robinson family never did kill that awful dr 
smith on lost in space 
judy prescott does a nice job in the joan cusack role of the 
diehard office pal with the nasal staten island accent tom 
orourke uttering five or six utterly convincing lines as 
selfmade jillionaire aj trask was just fine 
still even the greatest cast cannot overcome indifferent 
writing or the disappointed expectations of its likeliest viewers 
tess may do her best but theres not much room for working 
girl to succeed 
let the river dribble

roy benjamin would like to send hundreds of 
thousands of books each month to the soviet union and the nations 
of eastern europe where he believes there is a huge market for 
them 
benjamin is a publisher so you might think this just makes good 
sense just as it makes sense for example to hundreds of american 
companies with consumer goods or manufactured products to sell 
but his plan is very different he would donate his skills and 
time the books would be gifts he believes those who finance the 
idea those who read the books and the nations involved would be 
the better for it 
in his 73 years benjamin has learned that while good ideas are 
appreciated ideas backed by a practical plan of implementation are 
worth a hundred times more and so he has done the preliminary work 
his proposal international friendship books has been 
reviewed in publishing circles shown to the us government 
officials and tested directly on officials of the european nations 
that would benefit 
the responses have been uniformly good rita klimova 
czechoslovakian amabassador to the united states told him that the 
people of her country yearn for books that will tell the american 
story 
as chairman of the benjamin co based in elmsford ny roy 
benjamin has helped create hundreds of titles and tens of millions 
of books many of them under cooperative arrangements with 
corporations 
he is widely connected in publishing circles and experienced in 
bringing various groups together a requirement of the program he 
proposes these are the basics 
distribution of 100000 to 500000 or more copies of a single 
selected title each quarter eventually monthly through foreign 
schools colleges libraries education groups and other 
organizations 
government agencies or book distribution organizations in the 
recipient countries would be responsible for seeing that books 
reach the selected organizations 
a second phase sending selfcontained libraries or sets of 
books to business professional and political leaders it was added 
when he found professional organizations lacked basic texts even 
roberts rules of order 
american corporations would underwrite costs of the books 
their investment to be justified by the marketing and public 
relations dividends their sponsorship would deliver 
what a great way for american companies to become known in the

margaret atwood figures a really faithful 
adaptation of her book the handmaids tale would run nearly 
six hours 
the author however is not complaining about the 109minute 
film now playing in theaters she considers herself lucky very 
lucky the plot varies only slightly from her bestselling story 
about the republic of gilead a country ruled by rightwing 
fundamentalists who overthrew the united states 
but many writers arent quite as fortunate when hollywood takes 
their works and mounts them on screen something always manages to 
get lost in the translation hollywood tends to butcher books 
many authors understand william holdens quip in sunset 
boulevard in which he portrayed a luckless scriptwriter the 
last one i wrote was about okies in the desert bowl youd never 
know because when it reached the screen the whole thing played on 
a torpedo boat 
film is often stranger than fiction by the time bernard 
malamuds the natural reached the screen in 1984 slugger roy 
hobbs had magically reformed turning down the bribe he accepted in 
the book and hitting a gamewinning home run that caused hollywood 
sparks to fly 
the original ending of wuthering heights had cathy and 
heathcliff dying just like they did in emily brontes novel but 
when a sneak preview was poorly received producer samuel goldwyn 
superimposed ghostly figures of the two lovers walking hand in hand 
to heaven the next preview was rewarded with a long ovation 
in the wizard of oz dorothys silver slippers become ruby 
on the screen for the benefit of technicolor the 1933 film of noel 
cowards play design for living was so drastically changed 
that screenplay writer ben hecht boasted theres only one line 
of cowards left in the picture see if you can find it 
even titles are in danger the 1979 film of ann beatties novel 
chilly scenes of winter was called head over heels 
according to beattie the producers thought the original name 
sounded too serious like an ingmar bergman film 
so atwood feels grateful that her novel didnt get lost in the 
translation recalling that her reaction to the film was to 
breathe a sigh of relief 
she never imagined that a movie of her controversial book would 
star such bigname actors as robert duvall and faye dunaway have a 
screenplay by the celebrated english playwright harold pinter and 
attract a wellrespected director such as volker schlondorff 
death of a salesman the tin drum 
i thought it would take a lot of guts for anybody to do it 
atwood said in a recent interview but once given that nerve i 
could certainly see it visually and see it dramatically 
bobbie ann mason is also among the grateful although the film 
of her popular novel in country received mixed reviews the 
author was pleased that it stuck faithfully to her story of sam 
hughes a kentucky teenager trying to learn more about her late 
father 
mason was also glad that the movie didnt stereotype the 
country folks 
i think the story and the characters came across very well 
said mason who had high praise for stars emily lloyd and bruce 
willis and screenwriter frank pierson 
i thought the actors did add something extra emily lloyd 
really brought across sams energy and i thought bruce brought 
sams uncle emmett into a focus that i hadnt perceived 
but include fay weldon among the less grateful the author would 
rather not discuss shedevil which takes the sharp curves of 
her darkly funny the life and loves of a shedevil and turns 
them into flat ineffective comedy 
shedevil retains the basic plot of the ugly housewife ruth 
wrecking the life of beautiful romance novelist mary fisher whos 
run off with ruths husband bob but thats about all the two 
works have in common 
in the book ruth is a giant of a woman not in the movie shes 
played by the short fat compact roseanne barr in the book ruth 
spends years and millions of dollars having painful and 
revolutionary surgery to make her face look like marys and to chop 
bone from her thighs to make herself shorter none of this happens 
in the movie 
in the book ruth commits several crimes and has several sexual 
encounters after her husband runs off with mary fisher including a 
lesbian relationship not in the movie 
the film was poorly received especially compared to the 
acclaimed british broadcasting co miniseries run on pbs 
i thought meryl streep was wonderful was all weldon would 
say at first about shedevil which featured streep as mary 
fisher but the author seeking a way to phrase this tactfully 
then discussed the problems of handing over creative control 
if you sign an american contract you go to the american 
embassy and you undertake to sell your rights to the story 
weldon said in a telephone interview from her home outside london 
you also have to declare that youre in your right mind 
i thought i would be able to look at it dispassionately but i 
found that i wasnt 
for atwood the real hero is producer daniel wilson who has won 
18 emmys for his television specials including five for the abc 
afterschool special the late great me story of a teenage 
alcoholic 
the author said she chose wilson because he was passionate about 
the book and that he would make sure the film had the proper feel 
but atwood had one major complaint 
they did an outrageous poster in germany which makes it look a 
meninaraincoat film kind of soft porn theres going to be a 
lot of disappointed men in raincoats it was really quite 
astonishing thats what i was trying to avoid she said 
still atwood is eager to try it again she recently finished 
the script for her most recent novel cats eye and says the 
earlier works bodily harm and life before man have been 
optioned 
mason raved about the excitement of having in country made 
into a movie and has written a screenplay for the novel spence 
pluslila weldon said that a film of her novel puffball is 
being considered and admitted that even the disappointment of 
shedevil has not quite wiped the stars from her eyes 
yes of course i would do it again she insisted films 
much more fun i think the whole process is amazing and there is a 
feeling on the set of major films thats like nowhere else

what do you do with an obsolete border 
guardhouse especially if its right downtown turn it into a 
tourist office says a veteran us army sergeant at the 
checkpoint charlie crossing 
communism has crumbled in east germany the berlin wall is 
derelict and 30000 people pass through checkpoint charlie every 
day in both directions 
the fourpower agreements dividing berlin into us british and 
french sectors in the west and a soviet sector in the east remains 
in effect but berlin has been caught up in the wave of change in 
eastern europe 
for soldiers of the western allies the changes include 
canceling this years military parade and being able to visit east 
berlin in civilian clothes 
east germany has even made three new border crossings for 
western military personnel 
to air force capt janet bent of grand terrace calif and army 
staff sgt nathaniel brown of st louis mo the differences are 
important 
brown has worked at checkpoint charlie since may 1987 he has 
grim memories of the days before the wall fell in the peaceful 
revolution that ousted east germanys communist government last 
fall 
ive seen three people make escape attempts at this 
crossing and east german guards grabbed them kicked and beat 
them really got down and dirty with them he said 
now those same guards are out there smiling and waving people 
through the 39yearold sergeant said i never believed it 
would happen in my lifetime 
before the wall opened armed us patrols regularly drove along 
the barrier to monitor east german guards and possible soviet troop 
movements 
there are no more patrols brown said in an interview 
were armed as military police but about all we do is give out 
tourist information and advise people on visiting east berlin 
im thinking of putting in a work order to have a sign made 
up checkpoint charlie tourist information office he said 
laughing as an american soldier approached to ask advice about the 
east 
soldiers formerly had to sign a log at the checkpoint before 
crossing into east berlin brown said that changed early in april 
with the decision that all western troops based in berlin could 
visit the east out of uniform 
before west berlin troops had to be back here by midnight 
he said now they can stay for a weekend in east berlin if they 
want 
allied soldiers based in west germany still must wear uniforms 
when visiting east berlin 
checkpoint charlie is manned jointly by us british and french 
troops the united states has about 6000 soldiers in west berlin 
the british 4000 and the french about 2500 
about 350000 soviet troops are based in east germany city 
officials say most of them are at sites around berlin 
capt bent based in berlin since july said she often must 
cross the border to escort us air force officials visiting east 
berlin 
she said being allowed to wear civilian clothes was important 
for her 
from my standpoint as a female in uniform which the soviets 
and east germans dont see very often i got a lot of stares she 
said with civilian clothes its more comfortable 
she said she recently crossed into east berlin in uniform and 
an east german guard smiled and saluted me 
now we can go across by car on foot on a bicycle or train 
and can use public transport in east berlin she said before 
we couldnt 
klaus haetzel a spokesman for mayor walter momper of west 
berlin said the allies agreed to cancel the annual military parade 
because it no longer fits in the current situation with the wall 
open and military reduction talks 
the first parade was held june 17 1964 the anniversary of a 
workers uprising in east germany in 1953 to show western resolve 
to defend berlin the wall was built in august 1961

the way many analysts see it the sluggish 
behavior of the stock market in the first few months of 1990 
reflects more than just uncertainty about the outlook for interest 
rates or corporate profits 
stock prices have been left to drift in light trading activity 
they theorize as the very idea of acquisitive risktaking has 
undergone a temporary fall from favor 
the nation is preoccupied right now with cleaning up a series of 
financial messes among them the savings and loan debacle wall 
streets junkbond binge of the 1980s and a welter of bad loans in 
the banking business 
at the same time the freespending consumers of the past decade 
show signs of adopting a new ethic building up their depleted 
savings reserves instead of taking on bold new commitments 
all this tends to put a damper on both the economy and the 
markets which depend on the aggressive pursuit of wealth for much 
of their energy 
some say it raises the threat of a consumerinduced recession 
others worry about the possibility of a credit crunch in which 
constraints on lending create a scarcity of money for investment in 
business housing and bigticket consumer purchases 
but worrisome as these budding trends may be for the immediate 
future observers also argue they could be a significant plus for 
the economy and wall street over the long term 
if all goes right they say what is going on now could clear 
away past excesses and help build a stable base from which future 
opportunities and growth could arise 
the latest example of investors concerns is a sweeping inquiry 
by government regulators into the lending practices of banks which 
has evoked visions of a long dry spell for borrowers 
there is a lot to keep investors jumpy if not downright 
scared says michael sherman investment strategist at shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
are bank regulators going to create such havoc in the 
financial markets as to create a credit crunch and an economic 
downturn is the sampl contraction an openended sewer 
such questions arent easy to answer right now sherman says 
but he argues that the picture nevertheless has its positive side 
if you think the situation is fraught with peril today you 
should be glad the government didnt wait for tomorrow to staunch 
open wounds in the financial fabric at least were not living in a 
fools paradise 
if we survive the cure we will have a chance of living both 
better and longer in a financial sense 
furthermore sherman contends any squeeze on economic activity 
could well have a favorable impact by bringing interest rates down 
that decline would come quickly he adds because the 
areas of the economy most affected are also those that are most 
creditsensitive namely construction and real estate 
most observers agree that in intent at least the drive to 
clean up the financial environment is sensible and directed at the 
right targets 
the question they say is how decisionmakers and the markets 
are able to negotiate the distance between where things stand today 
and the goal 
as neal soss economist at first boston corp defined the 
problem being prudent like being sober or having a high saving 
rate is a good thing but getting prudent like getting sober or 
raising the saving rate involves a certain transitional 
discomfort

american businesses are becoming the fairy 
godmothers of the nations schools providing money manpower and 
expertise to fulfill dreams of firstclass programs and equipment 
even ringling bros and barnum amp bailey circus is getting in on 
the act 
addressing the need for reform in education is everybodys 
business says education secretary lauro cavazos 
louis v gerstner jr chairman and chief executive officer at 
rjr nabisco agreed noting the need for business to be an active 
partner in improving our childrens learning 
the nabisco foundation late last month selected 15 schools to 
share 85 million in grants the money is part of a fiveyear 30 
million program that funds innovative communitybased experiments 
whose successes can be replicated 
the education department reports that business and corporate 
partnerships with schools tripled from 46338 in 1983 to about 
141000 in 1988 such partnerships provide support to 40 percent of 
all public schools compared with 17 percent five years ago 
the business community through partnerships and tutoring has 
been signaling for three to four years that its interested in 
working with the education community said keith geiger 
president of the national education association 
businesses are worried about the bottom line and an impending 
labor shortage of the 38 million 18yearold americans in 1988 
fully 700000 had dropped out of school and another 700000 could 
not read their high school diplomas 
its good business to be involved in education said bernard 
gifford of apple computer inc 
the committee for economic development an independent research 
organization estimates that each years class of dropouts costs 
the united states more than 240 billion in lost earnings and tax 
income over their lifetimes 
the national alliance of business says employers already are 
spending 210 billion a year on job training and retraining by 
1995 it says the figure could reach 300 billion a year 
by that time the alliance says some 14 million americans will 
be unprepared for the jobs available 
business has been involved for many years in helping schools 
and school systems said alliance president william kolberg 
but much of this effort has been focused on tinkering at the 
margin 
now he says business is supporting systemic changes in 
educational programs 
the quality and type of partnerships vary widely from 
fullfledged programs aimed at producing longterm improvement for 
students to public relations ploys designed mainly to promote a 
companys name 
the council on economic priorities said the most prevalent forms 
of business involvement in education are adoptaschool 
arrangements including financial grants equipment gifts awards 
ceremonies or plant visits and tutoring 
the tandy corp last month gave a total of 350000 in cash 
stipends and scholarships to 100 students and 100 teachers 
recognized for outstanding accomplishments in mathematics science 
or computer science 
four years ago ringling bros decided to help tackle illiteracy 
an estimated 23 million american adults cannot read and kicked 
off a nationwide ringling readers program it uses a 25minute 
presentation performed by circus clowns to encourage youngsters to 
read 
when the circus came to the nations capital recently 
patches jim wade donned a clown face a colorful top hat over 
bushy hair and bright redstriped clown pants to visit 20 area 
elementary schools his message reading lets you imagine 
apple computers are being placed in thousands of kindergarten 
through 12th grade classrooms as part of an apples for the 
students program in more than 1000 communities in 38 states 
under the program schools collect receipts from 34 supermarket 
chains then turn them back to the supermarket in exchange for a 
computer 
international business machines corps support for education is 
similarly broad its activities involve more than 22000 employees 
in more than 750 local community partnerships 
kenneth lay director of ibms education programs said that in 
1989 the company spent more than 28 million in support of 
elementary and secondary education 
north carolina national bank last year began providing 2 
million a year to support leadership academies for superintendents 
and other administrators in 15 southern states participants learn 
how to apply management theory to a school setting 
the cocacola foundation has budgeted 50 million to support 
national education initiatives pepsico early last year announced a 
multimilliondollar pilot dropout prevention program while general 
electric budgeted 20 million for education 
us west in february announced it will invest 10 million over 
the next three years in earlychildhood programs in 14 western 
states 
campbell soup co meanwhile encourages teachers and students

when reporter maria montoya first visited key west 
it was just after midnight may 1 1980 and the boatlift of 
refugees from mariel cuba was in full swing 
but ms montoya was on the other side of the cameras 
a us coast guard ship had rescued her her husband eduardo 
and 10 other people packed inside a disabled 18foot boat adrift in 
the gulf stream after completing most of the 90mile journey from 
cuba 
the boatlift was only 10 days old and ms montoya and her 
husband got a warm reception they were cheered as they stepped 
onto us territory and welcomed by us soldiers and volunteer 
workers who gave them food and clothing 
one sight seemed strange though 
i saw 300 men their heads almost shaved sitting on the 
dock she said i asked why are those men sitting apart 
someone told me those are the criminals and the mental patients 
castro is sending us 
the boatlift then was being hailed as the freedom flotilla 
an embarrassment to fidel castros regime and a chance as 
president jimmy carter said to welcome with open arms those 
fleeing oppression 
but before it ended five months later when castro closed the 
port of mariel it had become a disaster costing hundreds of 
millions of dollars stirring murderous crime waves and escalating 
prejudices 
the whole mariel boatlift struck very deep nasty chords in 
the american public said frank sharry executive director of the 
immigration policy group the national forum 
marielito became a derisive label meaning misfits crazies 
hardcore criminals 
but you know what most of them did just fine sharry said 
ms montoya now 33 who risked a relatively comfortable life as 
a cuban radio and television actress is among dozens successful in 
the media and the arts others have made their marks in fields such 
as business education and sports and several boatlift children 
became honor students and valedictorians but the stigma remains 
even after the initial crime waves blamed on mariel refugees 
subsided their image was furthered by such cases as the 1984 
slaying of a miami beach police officer 1987 riots and 
hostagetaking by refugees in atlanta and oakdale la federal 
prisons and the fire last month that claimed 87 lives at the happy 
land social club in the bronx in which a mariel refugee is 
charged unlike many of the refugees ms montoya who recently 
returned to key west to film a report for spanishlanguage wltv 
television on the boatlifts anniversary never hesitates to tell 
when and how she arrived in this country 
bad people came and a lot of good people came she said 
i held back a lot when people were talking about how bad the 
mariel people were people would say to me oh you dont look 
like a mariel person that bothered me there was a stereotype 
and i am an individual 
nearly a month before her arrival ms montoya and her husband 
had dashed into the peruvian embassy in havana joining a confused 
desperate throng that finally totaled 10800 people 
i think castro never expected that many people wanted to 
leave when he saw that he wanted to spoil their image ms 
montoya said 
us sen bob graham was then in his second year as floridas 
governor he recalls attending a luncheon in washington in april 
1980 and being told by hastily scattering state department 
officials of the embassy situation 
within weeks the distantseeming foreign policy question became 
his states crisis when castro abruptly announced that mariel was 
open 
a ragtag armada of boats chartered by cubanamericans anxious 
to pick up relatives set sail and returned with some surprising 
cargo along with parents aunts and uncles friends and former 
political prisoners the boats brought passengers picked by the 
cuban government 
castro and the statecontrolled media crowed that the united 
states was getting the bums and scum 
we dont want them castro told a cheering havana crowd 
we dont need them 
by throwing in cuban miscreants castro portrayed the boatlift 
as a sweeping out of his society 
unleashed on american society from spartan cuban gulags the 
boatlifts criminal element spurred street crime explosions in 
miamis little havana and among the elderly of miami beach then 
spread into other us cities 
their crimes were the worst of many problems 
it had a human impact by adding 125000 people to the 
population reflected graham it contributed to a tense 
community situation by surfacing tensions i think it contributed 
to the may 1980 liberty city race riots 
castro was able to unload criminals and undesirable elements 
and there was an immediate and continuing strain on health and 
social institutions he said 
with the cuban economy stagnant and the government increasingly 
isolated by the crumbling of the socialist bloc us officials say 
they have readied contingency plans to prevent a new mariel 
castro has used opening up his borders as a tactic to relieve 
pressure graham said were in a dilemma because our national 
tradition is that we provide sanctuary but we ought to discourage 
a new boatlift and make sure its an orderly movement 
about onefifth of the mariel refugees had served jail time in 
cuba but for the great majority it was for petty offenses or 
political crimes 
today most authorities say fewer than 10 percent of the 
refugees were criminals some 2600 still are in federal custody 
173 were returned to cuba under a suspended immigration agreement 
and an estimated 4000 are in various state and local prisons 
i can tell you now that the impact was positive said miami 
city manager cesar odio only a small percentage created 
problems most have been good citizens but the immediate impact 
was negative for all cubans 
a gallup poll at the time indicated that cubans usually 
considered an immigration success story had become one of the 
nations most unpopular alien groups 
that image made resettling the immigrants difficult many were 
placed in refugee camps at us military bases in the florida 
panhandle arkansas pennsylvania and wisconsin frustrated 
refugees rioted in arkansas and there were disturbances in the 
other camps 
carter declared the boatlift illegal a month after it began 
boat captains were fined and had their vessels confiscated 
but it was too late about 70000 cubans already had arrived 
and more were on their way 
the only other time castro had opened a port camarioca in 1965 
the total number of refugees was fewer than 6000 
in the beginning we completely missed the boat said 
gunther o wagner who worked for the state departments 
cubanhaitian task force how did we know would we get 300 
3000 10000 we got 125000 
the criminal image and the large number of single men thousands 
of them homosexuals made finding sponsors difficult 
a lot of groups just gave up said sharry the church 
groups we were used to working with were nice suburban churches 
and now heres fileno with a tattoo on his eyelid ready to go to 
the church picnic

the last resettlement camp fort chaffee ark was open until 
feb 16 1982 nearly two years after the boatlift began 
the refugees kept asking when are you going to get me out of 
here ive been lied to and lied to sharry recalled we 
failed a lot of them 
sharry and others involved in the mariel resettlement can laugh 
now about some of their headaches 
sharry recalls one of the first refugees he found a sponsor for 
split for the coast with the sponsors very willing nice 
church lady wife wagner says one very industrious young man 
stole a bus and was found in seattle driving around town and 
collecting fares for his own gypsy bus service 
and they have warm memories of the refugees who overcame 
frustration and finally succeeded 
i am proud to have helped so many people find freedom 
wagner said

since five handcuffed cubans from the 1980 mariel 
boatlift boarded a government jet in december 1988 for the homeland 
they fled 168 more have followed 
some numbed by their years in jail went voluntarily feeling 
that as bad as cuba may be it beat the prospect of an indefinite 
stretch in a maximumsecurity prison in the united states 
but thousands more who have completed their sentences remain 
behind bars with no idea when or even if they will get out many 
eventually are freed but those identified as the tougher cases are 
not 
by law the united states can hold them as long as it wants 
even for life although no charges remain against them 
of those who have gone back to cuba we know of a few who have 
been released a few who are still in jail said decatur ga 
attorney gary leshaw who represents many detainees 
of those who went back id say about 30 of them went 
voluntarily not because they wanted to go back to cuba but because 
they thought they had a better chance for release there he said 
about once a month a few more judged deportable are taken from 
the federal prison at talladega ala to birmingham for the 
90minute flight back to cuba 
the great majority of the 125000 marielitos as they are 
known are lawabiding and have adjusted to american life in the 
decade since their arrival 
an estimated 80000 have become american citizens and the 
others are on immigration parole and have been told they wont be 
bothered if they stay out of trouble 
thus while marielitos have been in this country for a decade 
technically they arent really here and never have been the 
courts have ruled they have no constitutional guarantees 
people who enter the united states illegally must be released 
after six months if their native countries will not take them back 
but mariel cubans named for the port from which they left in an 
exodus authorized by cuban president fidel castro dont fit that 
category 
they are classed as excludable aliens 
i felt and i still feel that any person the attorney general 
holds beyond a reasonable time is entitled to a hearing to see if 
that reason is a sufficient reason said us district judge 
marvin shoob of atlanta who ruled in 1983 that the mariel cubans 
were entitled to limited due process 
he was reversed by a federal appeals court and the us supreme 
court declined to hear the case shoob said it is unlikely the case 
will get into the appeals court system again and that congressional 
legislative action is the only apparent avenue for change 
it was not a happy episode in us jurisprudence shoob said 
but he said the vast majority of those who deserve to get 
out have gotten out 
initially cuba agreed to take back the 2726 cubans jailed as 
of dec 14 1984 it accepted 201 before castro ended the agreement 
in 1985 in retaliation for the american broadcast of radio marti 
beamed at cuba 
of the 201 156 were reported free in cuba at one point after 
spending time in medical quarantine 
in late 1987 cuba agreed to accept the rest at a rate of up to 
100 a month sparking riots at federal prisons in atlanta and 
oakdale la where about 3800 cubans who had finished their 
sentences were detained by the us immigration and naturalization 
service 
of the 3800 leshaw said about twothirds have been freed 
after reviews by special justice department panels the reviews 
were one of the concessions made to the cubans in custody during 
the riots for surrendering control of the prisons 
but shoob said the review concession was less than it seemed 
under the agreements there are no requirements for the 
government to supply attorneys or for the cases to be heard before 
disinterested parties shoob said 
duke austin an ins spokesman in washington dc said reviews 
are all the law provides for 
it is not a judicial process it is an administrative record 
review only he said the majority are being paroled out 
the ins has paroled every detained cuban at one time or another 
but about 60 they all had a chance 
the 60 were identified on arrival as hardened criminals or 
severe mental cases and have been held since 1980 the rest are 
jailed for things that occurred after they got here about 2600 
are in ins custody now and the agency has detainers on another 
4000 who are serving sentences austin said 
lawyers who represent the cubans complain of arrogance and 
ignorance on the part of some review panel members 
i have never seen such a farce in my life reads a memo from 
lafayette la attorney judith gardner who represented a woman 
jailed for theft 
i will never forget the panel members they were cynical and 
accusatory ms gardner said they were disrespectful and 
seemed to revel in playing god over the lives of these people 
she said they accused her client of crimes she had never been 
charged with and told her she never would be released to an area 
near where her mother lives

know why 
martinez letter said he was moved to another prison and allowed 
to see a judge 
he said that we are peligrosos dangerous ones and also he 
said that we are not ready to make our lives within the community 
in other words we have received two and the half year sentence with 
the charge of peligrosidad dangerousness he wrote

in the early 1970s robert mapplethorpe took his 
first photographs with a polaroid camera it was the perfect tool 
for radical art 
what was radical about his work was not so much the subject 
matter but the process and materials he applied to a stagnant form 
adding fabric texture tone 
form and technique however are not what spring to mind these 
days when considering the late artist today it is the rough 
images he immortalized oral sex bondage homosexual fondling 
that make him an important force in 20thcentury art 
perhaps mapplethorpe never fully realized his destiny as an 
artist he died in march 1989 at the age of 42 of complications 
from acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
in death he is embroiled in controversy and has become a symbol 
for artistic freedom 
a mapplethorpe exhibit last june at the corcoran gallery of art 
in washington was canceled after sen jesse helms rnc declared 
some of the artists photographs to be obscene helms objections 
resulted in a move by congress to limit federal funds to the arts 
mapplethorpes works have been shown at the whitney museum of 
art in new york and in chicago philadelphia boston berkeley 
calif and hartford conn but a grand jury this month indicted 
the contemporary arts center in cincinnati ohio on obscenity 
charges for showing his works the center and its director will be 
arraigned monday 
i wasnt starting out to make a statement that isnt the way 
i work mapplethorpe once said the statement grows out of what 
i do 
in his 197677 work bill mapplethorpe placed a mirror 
between two panels of a man masturbating the idea is to have the 
viewer see him or herself flanked by two erect penises 
he used the same technique in 1979s easter lilies with 
mirror here four panels form a cross around a center mirror 
the lilies are shown in dramatic shadows a dusting of light 
illuminating their inner and almost religious beauty 
it is a way of engaging the viewer beyond mere voyeurism the 
viewer becomes a part of the work 
in the triptych brice marden 1976 mapplethorpe shows the 
artist fullfigure sitting with his own work in the background a 
closeup in the center panel and the last panel blank it is a 
wonderful study in depth perception 
but the intense shadow composition of another triptych jim 
and tom sausalito 197778 is obliterated by the action in the 
picture in which one man urinates on another around the same 
time mapplethorpe did a selfportrait posed partly naked in 
leather with the handle of a bullwhip in his rectum 
they are among his most disturbing photographs part of a period 
in which he unraveled a violent homosexual mystique for an 
unsuspecting audience they are terrifying sadomasochistic 
tableaux chained men leatherbound men men prepared for pain in 
an aristocratic setting 
but despite the frightening roughness of these sexual and 
psychological images mapplethorpe succeeded in crafting a rich 
tonal range 
he was involved in an incredibly wide variety of life the 
other side of which is death said the artist lowell nesbitt who 
first met and befriended mapplethorpe in 197172 
its very clear that much of his photographs were mirrors of 
his personal life i think that mapplethorpe really wanted to be 
censored he was pushing for it he was pushing the artistic 
barriers the way many artists have in the past to see how far he 
could push before he could met a boundary 
back in the early 70s a time of rainbow drugs and easy sex of 
troubled politics and an unpopular war mapplethorpe was into 
jewelry 
he was an artist but he wasnt exactly painting said 
nesbitt he would refashion jewelry by adding materials to 
customize a piece for the owner 
mapplethorpe was one of six children born to joan and harry 
mapplethorpe he fled his catholic childhood in floral park 
queens for the bohemian earthiness of brooklyn in the 1960s 
there he received his art education at pratt institute 
it also was there that he encountered and forged a lasting 
friendship with radical poet and musician patti smith together 
they shared in each others work and supported each others dreams 
they were avantgarde hippies while others were still beatniks 
punk before the first british rude boy spat out the word outlaws 
while others were simply radical 
he spent his artistic lifetime photographing smith her 
portraits range from early polaroids to the portrait he used on her 
1988 lp dream of life 
the 1978 triptych patti smith still moving shows smith in 
muted tones intertwined with a flimsy curtain her clothes falling 
away her features slightly blurred a portrait in 1976 shows a 
vulnerable naked smith curled up on her haunches clinging to 
pipes in a barren studio 
mapplethorpe said there was little difference in photographing 
men or women its like sculpture finally working with a 
threedimensional form most of the people i photograph are not 
trained models or actors but they all have strong personalities 
he did portraits of actor richard gere artists louise nevelson 
and alice neel lawyer roy cohn body builder lisa lyon and 
transvestite candy darling and they were as varied as his 
classically poetic studies of flowers fruit and vegetables 
his great mentor was sam wagstaff the museum curator 
nesbitt said he introduced mapplethorpe to what were the most 
advanced forms of art going on in the united states at that time 
he probably helped develop mapplethorpes very personal eye and 
incredible ability to use light which was somewhat prophetic 
a lot of photographers are equally capable technically but it 
takes an artistphotographer to distinguish himself and what does 
this is a very personal eye 
mapplethorpes eye consumed more than merely the flat surface of 
a photo he infused light and shadow certainly but he also 
applied textures and tones using fabric and paint such as platinum 
on linen or mesh wire overlays his early work utilized collage for 
drama and movement 
photographs became not an end in themselves but the raw 
material for a works foundation in 1971 he painted over a 
yellowed torn childhood photo of artist andy warhol leaving one 
smiling eye his mouth and shoulder untouched 
in his last years his work was austere beauty was found in 
simplicity a 1988 picture titled nipple could be a parched 
desert the moons surface or a dried river bed but it is a 
closeup of the human form 
calla lily 1988 is a stark portrait of the sculpted 
flower and his study of a man named thomas in 1986 showed 
mapplethorpe in classic form a naked man strains against a circle 
a geometric work reminiscent of leonardo da vinci 
im sure he felt he had made an amazing achievement 
artistically nesbitt said he had the selfsatisfaction of 
considering himself a major influence

an old man wagged his finger at 
prince sultan second in line to the throne and complained that 
his soldier son was assigned to a base far from his home in riyadh 
but your son has obligations as a soldier said the prince 
who also is the saudi defense minister 
he has obligations to his family the man retorted sultan 
consulted his advisors and announced that the young man would be 
reassigned in riyadh the kingdoms capital 
the exchange took place during a majlis or consultation 
sultan regularly holds with the people a foreign reporter was 
permitted to attend 
most days sultan and the scores of other princes in saudi 
arabias extended royal family open the doors of their palaces to 
the people they listen to complaints on all manner of issues and 
settle disputes 
its the nearest thing the saudis have to democracy and there is 
little demand for more from the estimated 8 million citizens of 
this desert kingdom which sits on onequarter of the worlds oil 
reserves about 3 million foreign workers also live in saudi arabia 
representative democracy is overwhelming communism in eastern 
europe and making inroads in the third world including neighboring 
arab countries 
in saudi arabia tribal tradition and huge oil profits let the 
royal bosses of the worlds richest familyoperated business 
provide opportunity public services and security that make 
democracy a nonissue 
the monarchy rules through wide consensus with all segments of 
society laws are based on the koran the holy book of islam 
considered to be godgiven to the prophet mohammed who founded the 
religion in the 7th century 
prince majed brother of king fahd and governor of the red sea 
province that includes the holy city of mecca told reporters 
recently that communism and other temporal ideologies are false 
and contrary to human nature 
the majlis system gives an estimated 250000 saudis access to 
princes and senior officials every year on behalf of their families 
in a social system fed by billions of dollars from oil revenue 
citizens pay no taxes 
education is free through university and each college student 
gets 800 a month in pocket money health services extensive and 
of high quality are free 
a jet air ambulance makes at least 200 flights a month to ferry 
patients from remote areas to riyadh for surgery at the lavish king 
faisal specialty hospital 
to build a home each saudi family gets a free plot of 625 
square meters about 750 square yards and a 30year loan of 
80000 free of interest 
people who build clinics factories workshops or hotels get 
interestfree loans equivalent to 70 percent of the construction 
costs 
generous pensions are paid on retirement 
so who needs democracy a western diplomat asked 
in tense times the saudi rulers customarily say they may 
establish a majlis alshura or consultative assembly a 
quasiparliament with most or all of the members chosen by the king 
such a council approved by islamic tradition was mentioned in 
1975 when a deranged nephew murdered king faisal and his 
successors were taking control 
the nephew was publicly beheaded a punishment decreed in the 
koran and imposed routinely for murder sex crimes or drug 
smuggling public executions take place in riyadhs main square on 
many fridays 
more beheadings and new mention of a majlis were decreed in 1979 
after a group of fundamentalist fanatics seized the great mosque of 
mecca that event sent shock waves through the royal family which 
pins much of its legitimacy to its piety 
the fundamentalists demanded an end to what they considered 
excessive western influence in saudi arabias rapid modernization 
during the oil boom years 
in 1987 after iranianbacked sabotage in the oil provinces and 
during the annual moslem pilgrimage to mecca fahd was said to be 
studying the majlis plan again 
still there is no council appointed or elected a handsome 
structure to house it stands empty in the grounds of fahds 
alyamamah palace in riyadh 
i believe it will come but its a matter of priorities 
said a senior saudi official like other sources he did not want 
his name used 
theres no groundswell of opinion for the majlis an 
influential newspaper editor said the people are satisfied with 
the tranquility stability security prosperity the freedom to 
travel 
unrestricted travel to the west is a safety valve for middle 
class saudis 
they mingle with westerners and indulge often ostentatiously 
in night life and the wests freewheeling culture at home they 
live under strict islamic rules that prohibit alcohol unveiled 
women in public women drivers or shopping or recreation during the 
five daily times of prayer 
tourism to saudi arabia is all but nonexistent apart from 
moslem pilgrims most visitors are businessmen or expatriate 
workers 
most westerners live in walled company compounds where the women 
can play tennis or swim in bikinis residents receive unpublicized 
shipments of liquor 
the royal family has more than 3000 princes 500 in the direct 
line of succession this has ensured stability through family unity 
and tight control of extensive security forces 
free enterprise and generous social programs have been crucial 
in transforming a seminomadic society with little upheaval into 
a modern one with a strong sense of islamic identity 
saudi officials say king abdulaziz ibn saud who conquered most 
of the arabian peninsula and founded modern saudi arabia in 1927 
with british backing established the consensus rule on which the 
countrys government is based 
abdulaziz is quoted as telling his sons the thread of 
consensus ties to the people is stronger than the iron bands of 
autocracy 
a saudi journalist with access to one of the top princes said 
that instead of creating a consultative council the rulers 
decided a few years ago to expand the open majlis system with 
fahd princes and top officials opening their palaces for regular 
meetings with citizens 
the atmosphere of the open majlis is informal the king is not 
addressed as your majesty but as fahd father of faisal 
or taweel al umur arabic for long life 
religious leaders are brought in on important decisions to avoid 
dissension and other important constituencies are consulted 
regularly 
an expert in saudi affairs said the 199095 economic plan was 
circulated for two years in advance among businessmen economists 
and others and many alterations were made as a result 
this gave a large number of key people the feeling and reality 
of participation he said 
saudis are concerned about tense relations with iran a major 
regional power and about a new arabisrael conflict and the 
vulnerability of their oil facilities to bombing or missile attacks 
they have forged close security ties with the united states and 
are a huge market for western arms sales 
to keep palestinian guerrillas from causing trouble in the 
kingdom as they have in other arab nations the saudis make 
generous contributions to the palestine liberation organization 
the only significant internal opposition to royal rule is the 
shiite moslem minority in the oilproducing eastern provinces along 
the persian gulf 
more than 90 percent of saudis belong to the mainstream sunni 
branch of islam but some usulis or fundamentalists among the 
several hundred thousand shiites are influenced by predominantly 
shiite iran they are blamed for the sabotage of oil installations

the 3000 princes of the ruling saud 
family are the cement that holds the kingdom together most experts 
agree any effective rebellion would have to be led from within the 
family 
the royal family controls every aspect of life and has remained 
united on the critical succession issue and important policy 
matters 
it has produced the arab worlds first astronaut prince sultan 
bin salman who flew on the us space shuttle discovery in 1984 
saudi arabias current rulers are descendants of king abdulaziz 
ibn saud who founded the kingdom in 1927 by conquering the desert 
tribes of the arabian peninsula 
the saud family has been largely responsible for guiding a 
tribal society of impoverished nomads into a cohesive modern state 
whose oil wealth has made it a financial superpower 
king fahd who has ruled since 1982 is believed to be the 
worlds second richest person fortune magazine estimated his 
fortune in 1988 at 18 billion the sultan of brunei is said to 
worth several billion more 
fahd has a lavishly furnished boeing 747 a 60 million yacht 
protected by stinger antiaircraft missiles and luxury homes in 
spain britain and france 
secrecy surrounds the private life of the chainsmoking monarch 
who in his youth was a playboy prince known in europes gambling 
clubs 
he is 69 the fourth son of abdulaziz to succeed his father who 
had 43 sons by 22 wives 
after crown prince abdullah 67 and defense minister sultan 
63 the succession is expected to go to the eldest of 20 younger 
brothers who is considered able 
the last son of abdulaziz sons will have the job with his inner 
circle of princes called those who tie and untie of selecting 
the eldest most respected from among the hundreds of male 
grandchildren 
family members who break the rules are dealt with quickly and 
firmly 
one of fahds younger brothers prince mishari then 19 was 
imprisoned in 1951 after shooting the british viceconsul in jiddah 
to death while drunk 
in 1965 when king sauds regime was discredited by widespread 
corruption and the kings profligate and irrational decisions the 
family supported his overthrow in favor of the respected faisal 
after faisal was assassinated by a deranged nephew on march 25 
1975 the crown passed quietly to khaled fahds halfbrother the 
nephew was beheaded khaled died in june 1982 
the only significant independent move against a saudi ruler 
since the state was founded occurred under king saud 
a group of his younger brothers critical of his misrule were 
influenced by egypts revolutionary leader gamal abdel nasser 
led by prince talal they organized the free princes 
movement to dump saud and create a constitutional monarchy the 
movement failed and the princes were exiled in 1962 
prince turki another of fahds brothers was fired as deputy 
defense minister in 1978 for drunkenness and an embarrassing 
marriage to the daughter of mohammed alfassi a doctor 
alfassi relatives used turkis money to buy a hollywood 
mansion which was then painted lime green they shocked even 
californians by highlighting the sexual organs of classical 
statuary in bright orange

think small think fast and think agile when you think about the 
1990 volkswagen corrado 
this is a car thats small on the outside surprisingly quick 
and an eyecatcher to boot 
the corrado marks something of a departure for volkswagen the 
no 1 carmaker in europe the car is designed as bill young vice 
president in charge of vwunited states put it to change the way 
you think about volkswagen 
forget about the nofrills vws of old the corrado is the first 
to offer at its initial debut in the market a host of standard 
features that would normally be optional on vws power windows 
air conditioning and heated outside mirrors its also the first vw 
to have a tilt steering wheel 
thats not all the corrado has a body by the same master 
european coachbuilders who brought us the cute little karmann ghia 
years ago plus a dashboard readout that details average fuel 
economy distance traveled and average speed just like the one you 
would find in many luxury cars 
most impressively the corrado also is the quickest volkswagen 
ever thanks to a special supercharger under the hood that spurs 
the little fourcylinder engine up to 158 horsepower 
helping the performance both in speed and fuel economy is a 
unique rear spoiler that rises automatically at 45 mph to help 
ensure the cars speedy movement through air with a minimum of 
rearend lift the spoiler begins to retract when speeds decline to 
12 mph 
the corrados sporty performance and wellpackaged amenities 
come at a base price of 17900 competitors include the ford probe 
gt which has a base price of 14726 the mitsubishi eclipse gs 
turbo at 14169 and the toyota celica gts at 16268 
one difference between the corrado and many other competitors in 
this segment however is the rearseat room vw says the corrados 
rear seating area is a bit larger than most other similar cars 
indeed despite the test cars compact size a bit over 13 feet 
long seating in back wasnt as bad as i feared though my view 
was wellblocked by the front bucket seats and headrests and my 
head brushed the ceiling i found the sculpted seats to be very 
comfortable and legroom was ok with the front seat moved up a 
ways legroom was at a minimum when the front seat was pushed all 
the way back although my knees still werent touching the rear of 
the front seats perhaps because the backs of the front bucket 
seats were designed to slant inward 
the rear seats are split onethird and twothirds so they can be 
folded down for more cargo space but first the rear center 
armrest must be raised and set between the two front seats watch 
when you replace the armrest in back so that you dont cover the 
seat belt connectors 
the corrado also has a nice storage shelf that covers the hatch 
area if needed 
the test car was fun to zip around in and the power is 
surprising the car is rated at a quick 75 seconds for its 060 
mph performance top speed is 140 mph 
yet the corrado got good mileage more than 24 mpg in mixed city 
and highway driving during the test the gearshift for the 
fivespeed manual transmission felt notchy but the transmission 
worked well with the fourcylinder engine 
the hatchback requires lifting items up and over the high rear 
body of the car and the storage space is raised slightly in the 
middle above the hidden spare tire compartment 
the corrado does not have airbags but frontseat passengers do 
get lap belts that automatically come across the body when the 
ignition is activated 
my complaints were minor having to use a large knob to recline 
the bucket seats a highpitched squeak that seemed to come from 
the lap belt connector on the driver side as i drove no light in 
the glovebox and a dashboard parking brake light that stayed on 
for nearly a block as i drove with a cold engine 
vw has sold more than 2000 of the cars since last falls 
introduction and hopes to sell 10000 a year 
volkswagen looks to attract both younger and older single men 
with this car one target group has median age of 30 and median 
household income of 40000 a year spokesman val brown said the 
second group has median age of 45 and household income of 75000 a 
year 
in both groups men are expected to predominate with 75 percent 
of buyers likely to be male brown said thirtyfive percent will 
be married 70 percent will be college graduates and 65 percent 
will be in upper white collar jobs 
because the corrado is a new model consumer reports magazine 
does not list owner reports of trouble

despite the absence of a major new fashion trend shoppers are 
giving this years spring lines a warm reception boosting business 
for apparel stores 
retailers specializing in clothing outperformed mass merchandise 
chains in march according to reports released thursday business 
was only soso for retailers overall reflecting a later easter 
selling season this year unsettled weather and generally sluggish 
economic conditions 
fred wintzer an analyst at alex brown amp sons inc in 
baltimore said the specialty apparel retailers he tracks have 
indicated that their warmweather collections appear to be popular 
with shoppers 
but he said nothing has taken the country by storm or caused 
women to want to discard their old wardrobes in favor of newer 
styles 
the general feeling is that theres nothing hot out there 
there are no fashion trends he said he said this seasons 
offerings havent sparked the shopping enthusiasm that the baggy 
look did that style featuring oversized blazers slacks and other 
clothes designed for comfort became the rage in 1984 before that 
the preppy look was in vogue 
among stores selling exclusively apparel that reported their 
march results thursday the gap inc posted a 20 percent sales 
jump sales at stores owned by the san franciscobased retailer 
open at least a year rose 12 percent 
results from stores open a year or longer known as same or 
comparablestore sales give a more accurate reading of a 
retailers performance 
baltimorebased merrygoround enterprises inc which sells 
trendy clothes for teenagers said its total march sales surged 61 
percent due in part to acquisitions but even excluding new stores 
it had a strong month samestore sales gained 32 percent 
the limited inc the biggest specialty apparel chain in the 
country said its sales rose 8 percent but were up a more modest 4 
percent on a comparable store basis the chain is based in 
columbus ohio 
for more than a year appareloriented retailers have done 
better than general merchandise chains that devote much of their 
business to costly durable goods subpar economic growth with 
workers in some industries worried about layoffs have made 
consumers cautious about spending heavily or going into debt to 
finance expensive purchases 
the governments retail sales report also issued thursday 
illustrated how a weak economy has flashed warning signals to 
consumers outlays have been curbed by the federal reserve boards 
high interest rate policy aimed at diffusing inflationary pressures

adjusted 06 percent in march from february the report covered 
sales at a wide range of establishments including stores auto 
dealerships and restaurants

the troy michbased discounter which ranked second in 
nationwide sales volume last year behind sears roebuck and co 
said total sales for the five weeks ended april 4 rose 86 percent 
but sales fell 11 percent at stores open at least a year 
last months sales were compared with a strong march 1989 when 
stores drew customers because of holiday promotions pushing 
everything from spring clothing to candy easter fell on march 26 
last year 
sales were strong in the first two weeks of march but because 
of the later date for easter in 1990 than in 1989 sales weakened 
in line with expectations in the latter part of the month said k 
mart chairman and chief executive officer joseph e antonini 
store executives and retail economists said april should turn 
out to be a better month as holiday promotions capitalize on a 
seasonal upsurge in demand for spring clothing and other 
merchandise

federation in new york said stores are looking forward to a 
successful easter sales period in april after an encouraging 
march

the rise of cattle futures prices to 
record levels this week hasnt brought euphoria to the industry 
where memories are vivid of the beefmarket crash that followed the 
previous highs a decade ago 
everyone is running scared right now and its the best 
thing said leon miller president of eagle passbased alta verde 
industries one of the nations top 20 cattle producers 
everyone remembers what happened when prices shot up last 
time if producers just keep selling especially with the prices 
up the market will continue to stabilize miller said 
live cattle futures reached a record price for the second 
consecutive day thursday on the chicago mercantile exchange with 
the april contract finishing at 8042 per hundredweight up from 
wednesdays 8040 
the previous high before this week 8025 per hundred pounds 
of beef in 1979 lasted only briefly before prices plummeted about 
25 percent 
although producers are mindful of that crash they say the 
market now isnt as vulnerable to a similar turnaround 
todays record prices reflect a seasonal peak in demand for beef 
and supply tightness stemming from delayed cattle marketings 
because of dry pastures in the southern plains last fall and winter 
we have a completely different situation said tommy beall 
director of research for cattlefax a denverbased market analysis 
company for the cattle 
the economics are different the prices we have seen recently 
accurately reflect the state of the industry the prices in 1979 
did not he said 
beall said liquidation by producers leaving the industry over 
the past decade has tightened the cattle supply and forced prices 
up 
the supply situation was much different in 1979 when inflated 
prices and overpopulated feed yards gave producers a false sense of 
security 
producers took females out of the slaughter and placed them in 
the breeding herds to multiply and cash in on the high prices back 
then miller said 
suddenly we had too many head of cattle and the bottom fell 
out miller said 
the 1979 crash caused prices to plummet from 80 per 
hundredweight to the 60 range in a matter of weeks 
that drop combined with rising production and grain costs and 
dry conditions have reduced the number of cattle head by 16 
million since the mid1980s beall said 
the industry is still recovering from the price drop said 
jim gill a market analyst for the texas cattle feeders 
association in amarillo the tight supply of cattle right now 
reflects the changes in the industry since the sharp drop in 
prices 
feeders and analysts agree that a new selling philosophy of 
expect less for cattle tomorrow than what you can get today 
has helped insure the market against another breakoff miller said 
industry officials said todays record futures prices would not 
affect retail beef costs because futures prices had been around the 
80 mark for two months 
the retail price increase has already been passed on to the 
consumer miller said when futures prices jumped from about 
74 to where they are now in february there was an increase in a 
few cents per cut 
most industry officials expect prices will ease in the next two 
months when grazing conditions are expected to improve and cattle 
can be beefed up more quickly but declines should be moderate 
they say 
i would expect the price to land at about 75 or 76 by june 
said milton rudder vice president of aztx cattle co based in 
hereford the number of cattle ready to be sold will increase 
significantly

a familiar figure is back in charge of 
daytoday operations at slumping winnebago industries after 
directors of the recreational vehicle maker fired another president 
the board of winnebago fired richard conner on thursday and said 
its executive committee had designated the companys chairman 
founder and principal stockholder john k hanson as acting chief 
executive 
conner had been president and chief executive for less than four 
months and became the fifth president dismissed by the board since 
1976 
there was no elaboration and neither hanson nor conner was 
available for comment said sheila davis a spokeswoman at 
winnebagos forest city headquarters calls to conners home were 
not returned 
the shakeup followed a series of recent setbacks for the 
company still wall street appeared to shrug off the news 
winnebago closed unchanged at 512 a share on the new york 
stock exchange 
theres been an awful lot of bad news recently said frank 
rolfes an analyst who follows winnebago for the minneapolis 
securities firm of dain bosworth its not like this is the first 
piece of bad news weve seen the stock probably has bottomed 
out 
among recent problems the company 
reported a loss of nearly 10 million or 40 cents a share 
for the six months ended feb 24 compared with a profit of 63 
million or 25 cents a share in the yearearlier period the 
market for its main product recreational vehicles has been 
sluggish 
disclosed it sold its portfolio of marketable securities and 
ious from dealers to reduce shortterm debt when it could not 
negotiate the interest rates it wanted from its lenders 
has struggled to make a go of its cyclesat subsidiary which 
conner once headed and which delivers television commercials to 
stations via satellite 
the dismissal of conner who was named president dec 15 is a 
sign winnebago is having trouble finding someone who runs the 
company the way john k wants rolfes said 
hanson 76 has a controlling interest in the companys stock 
on the surface it doesnt look really good said richard l 
hanley who heads an independent new york research firm bearing his 
own name reading between the lines it is not any great 
negative 
hanley said winnebago does have several positive factors in its 
favor it is nearly debtfree and has widespread recognition of its 
brands in the recreational vehicle market which leave it in good 
position to capitalize on any rebound in the market for motor homes 
he also said that despite conners ties to cyclesat company 
officials indicated his dismissal is not a signal of that ventures 
demise 
hanley said he thinks conners dismissal was related to the 
recent return of two former executives to take over product 
development and marketing winnebago realized it didnt need an 
active chief executive officer he said 
the executives are rex miner who returned after an absence of 
10 years to be head of product development and ronald jacobson 
who was appointed vice president of sales and marketing 
both executives moved to those positions when conner became 
president late last year 
it looks to me like the old regime coming back hanley said

media baron rupert murdoch says he is intent on 
improving earnings at news corp ltd and has no plans for more big 
acquisitions 
the australianbased news corp secured its place over the past 
decade among the global communications powerhouses partly by buying 
a us movie studio several television stations magazines and 
book companies 
but the acquisitions of the twentieth century fox metromedia tv 
stations tv guide and harper amp row publishers as well as costs in 
starting the fox tv network and the british satellitetv service 
sky television have left the company with a debt of more than 6 
billion 
murdoch disclosed his plans to forgo major acquisitions and 
focus on earnings improvement and the companys current businesses 
in an interview published thursday in the wall street journal he 
confirmed some of the details of that account by telephone 
we are not going to purchase anything major the chief 
executive of news corp said in the phone interview 
we are sorting out our portfolio of media assets our main 
concentration is going to be on developing our earnings he said 
only a year ago murdoch was planning to create a second company 
that would be used as an acquisition vehicle but the investment 
banker was able to line up only about half of the 1 billion sought 
and murdoch dropped the plan 
news corp reported in february that its earnings tumbled 67 
percent to 117 million in the six months ended dec 31 1989 even 
as its revenue rose 83 percent to 317 billion 
it cited startup losses in sky television higher interest 
expense and the impact of a labor dispute involving its airline in 
australia 
the companys stock also has been trading at relatively low 
levels 
in trading on the new york stock exchange news corps american 
depositary receipts finished unchanged at 1650 thursday the adrs 
have traded in a range of between 1487 and 2712 over the past 
52 weeks each adr is equivalent to two common shares of news corp 
stock 
murdoch said one of his top priorities would be sky television 
which offers four channels of programming and has 450000 paid 
subscribers in the britain 
the service launched last year already has cost about 400 
million and may cost another 150 million or more before it reaches 
the breakeven point of 2 million paid subscribers late next year 
murdoch said 
the service has been adding about 20000 new subscribers a week 
he said partly because sky television changed its marketing plans 
to allow people to rent the receiving dishes rather than buy them 
sky television may soon face competition however from a rival 
service from british satellite broadcasting corp 
news corp is among four companies attempting to reach agreement 
on launching an 108channel satellite tv service in the united 
states the service sky cable tentatively is scheduled to start 
operations in late 1993 
murdoch said he has no plans to make any major asset sales 
although he said there may be sales of some minor activities 
such as in book retailing or distribution 
the company announced in late march an agreement to sell star 
magazine a supermarket tabloid that features heavy doses of 
celebrity gossip along with health and beauty tips for at least 
400 million in cash and preferred stock to gp group inc the 
publisher of the archrival weekly the national enquirer 
media analyst peter appert of the investment firm cj lawrence 
morgan grenfell said he expected the investment community would 
take a positive view of murdochs plans to try to improve earnings 
from a strategic standpoint it probably makes sense for them 
to try to digest some of these properties they are not precluded 
from going back to the acquisition marketplace at some time in the 
future he said

fraud may have accounted for as much as 80 percent 
of the losses at the nations failed savings and loans regulators 
said citing a predominance of lavish lifestyles among thrift 
insiders 
regulators and prosecutors also cautioned that it is difficult 
to prosecute wrongdoers and may be harder still to recover 
substantial portions of the losses 
nevertheless the chairman of the house banking committee said 
he was satisfied with government efforts to track down fraud at 
banks and thrifts 
they have done as much as is humanly possible to do rep 
henry b gonzalez said thursday after ending two days of committee 
hearings in dallas 
the san antonio democrat had convened the hearings to examine 
how effective federal agencies had been in finding and prosecuting 
fraud in the troubled financial industry 
i dont think that the extent and depth of the problem is 
realized even now he said 
gonzalez warned that although much of the focus has been on 
texas the problems already are showing up in the northeast and 
elsewhere 
several times during the hearings witnesses were asked to 
quantify the industry losses attributed to fraud their estimates 
ranged from 10 percent to 80 percent 
william k black an attorney for the office of thrift 
supervision in san francisco suggested that when fraudulent 
activity leads to an institutions insolvency the entire loss 
should be blamed on fraud 
as an example he cited vernon savings and loan association 
closed in 1987 in a thenrecord 12 billion federal bailout 
seven vernon executives including a former president and former 
chairman along with three affiliated individuals have been found 
guilty of various crimes including misapplication of funds and bank 
fraud 
vernon was fronttoback fraud black said 
james e cooper deputy director of the dallas office of the 
resolution trust corp said fraud was present in as much as 80 
percent of failed texas and oklahoma thrifts 
our preliminary investigations have revealed instances of 
insider abuse and misconduct ranging from embezzlement and simple 
loan fraud to complex conspiracies and schemes to defraud 
institutions cooper said 
we noted a predominance of lavish lifestyles plush 
accoutrements expensive automobiles artwork airplanes and 
compensation incentives benefiting insiders at the expense of 
stockholders and depositors he said 
the hearings were held in dallas in part because the city has 
been the center of much of the activity and has the largest task 
force investigating bank and thrift crimes 
witnesses included fbi director william sessions three texas 
us attorneys plus current and former regulators from both state 
and federal agencies 
most said last years financial institutions reform recovery 
and enforcement act had provided adequate resources to find and 
prosecute the fraud 
but the three texas us attorneys called for more judges to 
hear the expected increase in fraud cases 
we can pour more cases in the funnel but every case must pass 
through the narrow neck of the judiciary said marvin s collins 
us attorney for the northern district of texas 
the witnesses agreed that the complexity of the fraud makes it 
difficult to prosecute in addition many of those charged are 
prominent members of the community making convictions difficult 
unless the evidence against them is overwhelming they said 
unless we are able to put some money a lot of money in 
somebodys pocket it is very difficult to convict them 
collins said 
the witnesses also warned there may be little chance to recover 
some losses 
rep thomas carper ddel and rep martin frost dtexas both 
urged prosecutors to seek as much restitution as possible 
but us attorney henry k oncken of houston said it is my 
opinion that expectations of vast amounts of restitution and high 
fines that are collectible may be overly optimistic many of the 
cases being investigated involve real estate ventures that used up 
large amounts of cash to keep them going 
when the real estate market fell there wasnt much cash and 
the value of the land buildings or other real property put up as 
collateral were greatly diminished oncken said 
people in jail dont pay a lot of restitution collins said

campeau corps federated and allied retailers 
have won approval to start a twoyear 25 million plan designed to 
keep key managers from leaving for other jobs 
creditors of the two companies which are operating under 
federal bankruptcy court protection went along with the plan 
thursday us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr gave his 
approval 
the plan is designed to benefit about 2300 managers of 
federated department stores inc and allied stores corp 
nationwide from senior executives to divisional merchandise 
managers it would provide a core of about 400 key executives with 
performance bonuses job security assurances and employment and 
severance agreement terms 
aug also approved payment of about 15 million in 1989 
performance bonuses to 396 executives of both divisions the 
cincinnatibased retailers have 260 stores and 100000 employees in 
28 states 
the companies have been required to seek augs approval for 
spending since they filed jan 15 for chapter 11 protection from 
creditors the companies listed 77 billion in debts acquired when 
campeau bought them in 1986 and 1988 
the judge postponed a ruling on the request by allied and 
federated to hire shearson lehman hutton inc as a financial 
adviser the retailers said they need the advice of the wall street 
house to work through the reorganization 
shearson did work for the retailers in february and march and 
needs to be hired formally to collect 500000 in fees lawyers for 
allied and federated said 
but us trustee conrad j morgenstern objected saying shearson 
should be disqualified under federal bankruptcy law from serving as 
a consultant because it underwrote federatedallied securities 
prior to the companies jan 15 filing 
david heiman a lawyer for federated and allied acknowledged 
the bond underwriting but said it was ancient history that 
occurred three years ago and would not affect shearsons ability to 
serve 
aug postponed resolution of the matter until a hearing april 26 
when he is to hear further testimony 
the judge also approved a request by allied and its allied 
stores marketing corp subsidiary to get out of a lease on six 
floors of office space in new york city where allied maintained 
its corporate headquarters until moving last year to cincinnati he 
did so over objections by new york businessman robert arnow who 
leased the space to allied for about 300000 a month under a 
25year lease that was to run through 1997 
allied said it no longer needs the space and that continuing to 
make lease payments could reduce the value of allieds estate for 
creditors 
the judge also heard a plea on behalf of about 40 retired senior 
executives of allied and federated or their surviving spouses who 
said some of their benefits had been stopped since the companies 
filed the reorganization petitions lawyer jeff ireland presented 
the claim behalf of former executives including exfederated 
chairman howard goldfeder and three members of the lazarus family 
which founded federated and its lazarus department store group 
members of the group are continuing to receive regular 
federally protected pensions and medical insurance coverage 
officials said but ireland said allied and federated have 
suspended other retirement benefits including supplemental 
pensions deferred compensation and retirement allowances 
lawyers for allied and federated said they are aware of the 
retirees claims and are trying to provide for them in the 
companies reorganization plan the lawyers declined to say when 
the reorganization plan will be filed

oil futures prices continued to gyrate after 
opecs acting president said the cartel ministers were considering 
holding an emergency meeting in an effort to halt the slide in 
world oil prices 
rumors that opec might call an early meeting to deal with the 
declines which have trimmed as much as 6 off the price of a 
barrel in recent weeks helped support the market on wednesday 
but on thursday prices kept fluctuating wildly and in late 
trading were down from wednesdays close 
analysts said they were skeptical the oil ministers would take 
effective steps against the recent steep price drop and predicted 
weak prices over the near term 
i think its really all noise and very little action said 
geoff pyne an oil analyst with the london investment firm ubs 
philips and drew 
prices have fallen more sharply than usual during the 
traditional spring slump when demand generally drops among 
consumer nations analysts blame the recent price drop on 
overproduction by some opec members 
acting opec president sadek boussena said thursday he had been 
conducting intensive consultations with his fellow ministers 
about the price slide 
options under consideration included an urgent meeting of the 
eightmember ministerial monitoring committee and an extraordinary 
meeting of all 13 members he said 
opecs monitoring committee studies oil market conditions and 
makes policy recommendations to the full opec conference while it 
formally has only the eight members its sessions tend to be 
attended by all opec ministers 
the acting president who is algerias oil minister made the 
comments in an official statement released thursday by the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries vienna secretariat 
opecs 13 oil ministers have a full meeting scheduled for may 25 
to set their output and price for the second half of the year 
nick clayton an analyst with smith new court plc predicted the 
ministers would gather in early may but pyne said he did not 
believe they would meet before may 25 unless prices fell further 
boussenas statement is a recognition that there are 
difficulties in the oil market clayton said 
the spot price of north sea brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil stood at 1545 a barrel late thursday 
unchanged from late wednesday the price stood at 1845 a barrel 
on march 16 
on the new york mercantile exchange the may contract for west 
texas intermediate crude finished down 28 cents from wednesday at 
1778 a barrel by comparison the nearmonth contract for wti 
settled at 2420 on jan 22 
the average price of a basket of seven crude oils monitored by 
opec was 1712 a barrel in the first week of april off from 
1726 in the last week of march and below the cartels minimum 
reference price of 18 a barrel 
stocks are very high opec has been producing too much for too 
long and the obvious reaction was that prices have to fall 
clayton said 
the cartels production last week came to just over 245 million 
barrels a day well over opecs cap of 221 million barrels a day 
for the januaryjune period estimated peter gignoux director of 
the international energy department at shearson lehman hutton in 
london 
it will be quite difficult to think of some mechanism by which 
they can reduce output pyne said no member country is willing 
to take on the burden he said 
in the nearterm there will be continual soft outlook for the 
markets pyne said but demand should start to pick up in early 
may he said 
opecs members are algeria nigeria iran iraq ecuador gabon 
indonesia saudi arabia the united arab emirates venezuela

a specialist firm on the new york stock exchange 
was fined 480350 for securities fraud by a judge who said he 
imposed the sentence as a deterrent 
the trading while in possession of confidential material is a 
crime us district judge charles haight said thursday at the 
sentencing of marcus schloss amp co it constitutes an affront to 
the fair operation of the marketplace 
prosecutors said marcus schloss was the first nyse firm to be 
convicted of felony charges related to insider trading 
the company was convicted last july of conspiracy to trade on 
inside information and of securities fraud in connection with its 
march 1986 purchase of stock in american brands inc it was 
acquitted of securities fraud charges for stock trades involving 
three other companies 
marcus schloss could have been fined a maximum of 1 million 
500000 for each of two counts 
haight however said he only considered a fine of 500000 
because both charges stemmed from the american brands deal 
from that amount the judge said he subtracted 19650 which the 
company previously paid the securities and exchange commission to 
settle civil charges stemming from the american brands trade 
the sec settlement reached in february 1988 involved other 
trades and required marcus schloss to pay a total of 410000 
the firms lawyer marvin schwartz said the sec settlement was 
the companys plain acknowledgement of wrongdoing he told the 
judge that any additional fine would be in the nature of a double 
hit 
marcus schloss former head of arbitrage d ronald yagoda was 
tried with the firm but was acquitted of all charges including 
perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with an sec 
inquiry 
schwartz has said he will appeal the companys conviction on the 
grounds that it was inconsistent to convict the firm on conduct for 
which yagoda was acquitted 
the government had charged that yagoda received inside 
information on pending stock transactions from andrew solomon a 
former marcus schloss analyst 
solomon was part of the yuppie five ring in 1986 solomon 
three other young wall street professionals and a client pleaded 
guilty to trading on inside information about corporate takeovers 
that they had obtained through their jobs 
marcus schloss and yagoda were indicted in 1988 along with two 
wall street arbitragers who were convicted last week at a separate 
trial 
victor teicher 38 who headed the arbitrage firm teicher amp co 
and ross frankel 33 former head of arbitrage research at 
nowdefunct investment house drexel burnham lambert inc were 
found guilty of 18 counts of securities fraud conspiracy and mail 
fraud 
teicher and frankel were convicted of trading the stocks of 
eight corporations based on stolen information 
they were to be sentenced by haight in june

a 48 million federal lawsuit against 
honeywell inc and unisys corp alleges that a sperry aerospace 
operation honeywell bought from unisys in 1986 has been defrauding 
the navy for the past 11 years 
the business which honeywell resold in 1988 repeatedly 
inflated its estimated cost for flight simulators used to train 
pilots of f18 and t45 jets according to a lawsuit filed thursday 
by the us attorney in brooklyn ny 
the suit seeks 48 million in claims on government contracts 
which is triple the governments alleged loss of 16 million it 
also seeks 5000 to 10000 for each allegedly false claim for 
payment that was submitted to the government 
tim morin a honeywell spokesman said the firm had not seen a 
copy of the suit and declined to comment 
the simulator suit involves a business unit that 
minneapolisbased honeywell owned from 1986 to 1988 although the 
alleged fraud occurred over a period extending back to the late 
1970s during that time the business unit was owned first by 
sperry based in new york and later by detroitbased unisys which 
was formed when sperry was acquired by burroughs corp in 1986 
the governments suit claims that in 1979 sperry deliberately 
underestimated the cost of an initial project for the f18 
simulator hoping to obtain the contract for it and later projects 
it succeeded in winning those contracts but then concealed its true 
estimates of what the later projects cost the suit says 
instead the suit says executives padded the cost estimate by 
as much as 30 percent presenting the higher numbers to the navy 
and concealing the added amounts in labor charges 
the suit says documents showing the added dollars were 
distributed to a committee of company executives then collected 
after each committee meeting 
the result was inflated contract prices awarded by the 
government the lawsuit alleges 
the suit alleges the flight simulator project for the t45 was 
similarly inflated 
officials at the us attorneys office said the suit was filed 
in brooklyn federal court because the alleged fraudulent activities 
occurred in corporate offices in the new york area 
the suit is the third legal obstacle honeywell has encountered 
as a result of acquiring the sperry aerospace operations 
the first episode involved hidden contract costaccounting 
problems in the albuquerque nm military aerospace operations 
those problems were mainly responsible for honeywells record loss 
of 435 million in 1988 as a result of those problems honeywell 
in 1988 sued unisys for more than 350 million mostly over alleged 
misstatements about the financial condition of the sperry aerospace 
operations 
the second episode arose last year when the government sued 
honeywell and unisys for about 48 million over alleged contract 
violations at operations in albuquerque 
honeywell has said a significant part of that suit involves 
alleged incidents that occurred before it bought the operations 
from unisys damages for the period before honeywells ownership 
would be covered by a contract clause under which unisys would bear 
the costs for its period of ownership morin said

president bush and his wife barbara paid 
101382 in federal income taxes last year and reported charitable 
contributions of 37272 that included gifts to hurricane and 
earthquake relief efforts 
a copy of the first couples joint 1989 federal return released 
thursday by the white house showed that the bushes reported total 
income of 456780 
both taxes and income were up sharply from the couples 1988 
return on which they reported total income of 287171 and taxes of 
62106 
the higher income came from bushs better pay as president 
200000 a year against his 115000 vice presidential salary and 
from a growth in business investments 
the bushes tax return showed that the bushes earned 208274 
last year from business holdings held in a blind trust up from the 
155662 the trust earned the previous year 
by contrast vice president dan quayle and his wife marilyn 
made less in 1989 than in 1988 but paid more in federal taxes 
the quayles whose return was released by his office paid taxes 
of 25479 on a total income of 133696 the year before they 
paid 24314 on a total income of 156546 
quayles 1988 income was boosted by nearly 53000 in speaking 
honoraria earned while he was a senator much of which was given 
to charities because he claimed fewer taxdeductible contributions 
in 1989 his overall tax liability rose 
bush who has energetically lobbied congress to lower the 
capital gains tax paid taxes on 36068 in capital gains posted by 
the blind trust the trust which masks the first familys 
investment portfolio was established in 1981 when bush became vice 
president 
the joint tax return filed by the president and his wife listed 
94702 in itemized deductions 
among the contributions was 3000 in cash for relief 
organizations to help victims of hurricane hugo in the virgin 
islands puerto rico and south carolina an additional 1500 was 
donated to similar efforts in the aftermath of the san 
franciscoarea earthquake 
bush divided profits of 14282 from his biography looking 
forward between two charities the united negro college fund in 
new york and the md anderson cancer center of houston 
in all the bushes gave 8141 to the black educational fund 
their largest contribution they also gave 5000 to a private fund 
that is building a new chapel at camp david the presidential 
retreat in the maryland mountains 
through a quirk of job and geography bush paid no state or city 
income tax 
texas his adopted home state has no income tax he doesnt 
spend enough time at his oceanside home in maine to be required to 
pay taxes there according to white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater the district of colombia exempts the president from its 
income tax 
most of quayles income consisted of his government salary 
106528 as vice president and 3715 as vice presidentelect 
before the jan 20 inaugural he resigned as a senator from indiana 
on jan 2 1989 
although the quayles hold assets valued at more than 14 
million the vice president showed relatively small business 
earnings in 1989 they reported 14572 in dividends on family 
stock holdings in central newspapers inc quayle also reported 
1858 in interest earnings on various savings accounts 
the quayles claimed a 5435 loss in renting their house in 
mclean va a washington suburb aides said the loss came because 
the house was on the market for several months before the quayles 
found a renter they now live in the official vice presidential 
residence

falling gasoline and vegetable prices pushed 
wholesale prices down 02 percent in march the first drop in seven 
months the government said today 
the decline in the labor departments producer price index 
followed no change in february and a huge 18 percent gain in 
january 
a cold snap in december caused the january price spurt by 
killing gulf coast vegetable crops and producing a fuel oil 
shortage 
energy prices began their recovery in february and were joined 
by food prices last month 
for the first quarter overall prices advanced at an annual rate 
of 67 percent well above the 48 percent rise for all of last 
year however analysts expect wholesale inflation for 1990 will be 
a little below last years rate they anticipate continued declines 
for food and energy in the next few months 
well probably get further downard pressure especially in 
energy in april said economist james annable of first national 
bank of chicago when we get into the spring were going to see 
that inflation is running about where it has been running which is 
about 45 percent 
meanwhile in a separate report the commerce department said 
business inventories fell 04 percent in february while sales 
surged 13 percent the report was taken as a sign of strength 
rising inventories can signal a recession 
the march wholesale inflation report was better than expected 
most economists had predicted a slight increase of 01 percent or 
02 percent 
food prices dropped 06 percent in march the sharpest decline 
since june vegetables particularly tomatoes celery and cabbage 
declined 255 percent the biggest drop on record going back to 
1967 however that marked only a partial recovery from gains of 
233 percent in february and 58 percent in january 
prices also fell for beef and veal dairy products and coffee 
they rose for eggs rice pasta pork chickens turkeys fish 
soft drinks and cooking oils 
energy prices overall dropped 24 percent in march following a 
fall of 5 percent in february and an increase of 136 percent in 
january 
gasoline was down 28 percent and natural gas declined 25 
percent fuel oil prices went up 106 percent but they had fallen 
302 percent the month before 
prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors rose a 
moderate 03 percent in march following gains of 04 percent in 
february and 01 percent in january economists look to these 
socalled core prices as a better indication of underlying 
inflationary pressures 
clothing prices for men and children rose while the cost of 
womens clothing fell passenger car prices in the face of weak 
auto sales declined 03 percent in march after no change in 
february and a 07 percent fall in january 
the various changes put the index for all finished goods one 
stop short of retail at 1170 in march that means a hypothetical 
selection of goods which cost 100 in 1982 cost 117 last month up 
from 11210 a year earlier 
price pressures in earlier stages of the production process also 
eased in march intermediate goods showed no change while crude 
goods fell 14 percent an example of the three processing stages 
would be bread for finished goods flour for intermediate and wheat 
for crude 
the moderate inflation report should please the federal reserve 
board which has been using relatively high interest rates to dampen 
demand and thus cool inflation 
but analysts cautioned against reading too much into recent 
months numbers which have been sent on a rollercoaster ride by 
the effect of the weather on food and energy prices 
the numbers in the next few months could give us a false sense 
of euphoria just as the number in january gave us a false sense of 
gloom said economist robert g dederick of northern trust co in 
chicago

when american appliance king whirlpool corp 
wanted to expand into europe as part of a strategy to dominate the 
world market it ran into the business version of a rough spin 
cycle 
the company found that although its name was a household world 
in the united states few europeans had heard of or could even 
pronounce the brand its big and american identity was no selling 
point either 
so whirlpool sought a kindred spirit on this side of the 
atlantic 
by entering a joint venture with the dutch electronics giant nv 
philips and adopting a paneuropean marketing strategy whirlpool 
may provide a valuable lesson for other us companies hoping to 
get inside the trade barrierfree europe planned for the end of 
1992 
our ultimate goal by the end of this century is to emblazon 
the whirlpool brand supreme around the world jan karel managing 
director of the joint venture told a convention of appliance 
dealers in france in january 
early last year whirlpool acquired a 53 percent stake in 
philips major domestic appliance business for 470 million it 
makes whirlpool the worlds no 1 maker of major domestic 
appliances the company says and gets it into the european market 
of 320million consumers without having to start from scratch 
whirlpool based in benton harbor mich had 4 billion in 
annual sales but none in europe it obtained instant access to 
philips 2 billion worth of european domestic appliance sales 
the joint venture called whirlpool international bv is based 
in comerio italy and employs 14000 people it has become the 
first company to sell a single brand of domestic appliances across 
europe an appliance market highly fragmented with a range of brand 
names and varying standards 
under the agreement whirlpool can use the philips brand name 
until the end of the decade 
after a year of research and development whirlpool has decided 
to use the name philips whirlpool and will gradually drop the name 
philips one country at a time 
whirlpool is virtually unknown said derek smith editor of 
the british weekly electrical and radio trading frankly i cant 
think of what else they would have done given that philips is a 
wellestablished brand in europe and the uk particularly 
whirlpool has had past success with what is known in the 
industry as transitional dual branding 
during the 1950s it acquired the air conditioning and electric 
stove businesses of radio corporation of america and called these 
products rca whirlpool for 12 years before dropping the rca 
for its latest branding attempt whirlpools parisbased 
advertising agency publicis fcs international devised seven 
candidate advertising campaigns in three languages after hiring 
researchers to interview a total of more than 1000 women consumers 
in britain france austria and spain 
the research helped the company learn the common denominators 
and what to avoid 
nick mote publicis international coordinator for the account 
said it is difficult it took us a year of development to find 
the key to the door we wanted to be as broadly appealing as 
possible 
whirlpool wanted to target housewives rather than professional 
women working outside the home who are proliferating in germany 
but remain a relative novelty elsewhere in europe 
because whirlpool is hard to pronounce in spanish or french the 
company decided to go with the english pronunciation 
the researchers found that the women interviewed were skeptical 
that the companys large size would guarantee quality and they 
discovered strong antiamerican sentiment among the british and 
austrian women 
they associated american with the disposable society and not 
technology mote said 
the end result is a 100 million philips whirlpool brings 
quality to life ad campaign launched in midfebruary 
the first television ad shown in 14 european countries looks 
futuristic with a touch of magic it shows a young mother entering 
a transparent kitchen made opaque by a golden swirl the whirlpool 
name and logo are spoken and shown repeatedly with no reference to 
the united states or the companys size 
a darkhaired actress was chosen because brunettes are spread 
throughout europe and blondes arent even her outfit was a 
headache because skirts are shorter in france than spain she wore 
pants because the chosen skirt turned out too tight 
you could alienate a lot of people if you went too sexy 
said brian kennerley managing director of whirlpool uk ltd 
asked his opinion of the campaign a buyer for a major british 
department store chain said people thought that philips 
whirlpool was a product they think it is a jacuzzi or a special 
product as opposed to a brand 
the buyer who requested anonymity added it occurred to me 
that it might have been better to promote it whirlpool philips 
to avoid confusion 
whirlpool says it went with philips whirlpool because philips 
already is a wellknown name in europe 
it says the whirlpool brand is catching on more quickly than it 
had hoped there is a total acceptance kennerley said im 
not sure we need to go beyond two or three years with the dual 
name

if you dont like the way the economy looks on 
the charts of wall street economists just wait an hour or two 
in keeping with the spring weather in the environs of new york 
city the prevailing forecast of the business and investment 
outlook seems especially changeable right now 
within the past few weeks alone recession fears have faded amid 
signs of gradually reviving growth only to be replaced by new 
worries about a slump induced by a shrinking supply of credit 
consumers meanwhile are variously portrayed as all spent out 
restocking their depleted pocketbooks or ready to launch a new 
assault on the malls 
some observers believe all this turbulence may have distracted 
the attention of many participants in the stock and bond markets 
from a favorable development of more than passing significance 
it is just possible they say that the economy has experienced 
its longawaited soft landing almost unnoticed 
if that is indeed the case federal reservewatchers add people 
who worry that the fed is trapped in a tight spot between the 
conflicting perils of inflation and recession could be missing an 
important point 
they suggest that the fed may be avoiding any overt changes in 
its credit policy right now simply because it is satisfied maybe 
even pleased with the way things stand 
it is axiomatic in the financial world that whenever things are 
moving in a favorable direction there is usually some prominent 
and highly publicized worry to serve as a sort of smoke screen 
in the optimists view that purpose is being fulfilled right 
now by talk of a credit crunch arising from a riskaverse mood 
among bankers and other wouldbe lenders including those who once 
were eager buyers of junk bonds 
if tougher lending practices are now producing a serious 
credit crunch then an economywide recession could unfold says 
edward yardeni economist at prudentialbache securities 
however we arent convinced that the current credit crunch is 
severe enough to cause an economywide recession 
lowquality borrowers who need to finance very risky 
activities are being turned away by the bankers but that leaves 
more lendable funds available for highquality borrowers 
or as kevin logan at swiss bank corp puts it business 
borrowing is stronger than many people think and economic growth 
may be more robust than many expect credit crunch dont bet on 
it 
given the uncertain climate of recent days many stock traders 
seem unwilling to stake much either for or against such a 
possibility but the market did manage to post some spotty gains in 
the past week before shutting down thursday night for a long 
holiday weekend 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 3468 points to 
275180 on top of a 991 advance the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 202 to 
18880 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
added 541 to 43631 and the american stock exchange market value 
index dropped 313 to 35788 
volume on the big board averaged 13363 million shares against 
14397 million in the previous week 
a steadyasshegoes approach is likely to remain the thrust 
of fed policy for quite some time maintains paul boltz 
financial economist at t rowe price associates in baltimore 
the fed isnt likely to launch a major new offensive against 
inflation until the pace of business activity gets a good deal 
stronger than it has been lately boltz says 
similarly he concludes ease would be called for only if 
the economy looks headed for a recession something not on the 
horizon

a record 300 shareholder resolutions on social 
concerns ranging from south african divestment to teenage smoking 
were filed this year for votes at annual meetings 40 percent more 
than last year 
but the fastest growth came in resolutions urging more corporate 
sensitivity to the environment 
people are so fed up with things like garbage barges and exxon 
spills says rosalyn will a researcher at the council on 
economic priorities a new yorkbased publicinterest group that 
follows shareholder resolution trends 
enough is enough she said 
the growing concern reflects an anxiety over pollution 
atmospheric warming and other signs of global deterioration that 
perhaps has been heightened by publicity about the 20th anniversary 
of earth day on april 22 
the biggest corporate target appears to be exxon corp the oil 
giant that came to symbolize recklessness for many naturelovers 
after the march 1989 oil spill that fouled valdez alaska 
the company will face eight environmentrelated resolutions at 
its annual meeting april 25 ranging from dismissing chairman 
lawrence rawl to pledging commitment to the valdez principles 
a set of guidelines for corporate behavior devised by a coalition 
of environmental groups after the spill 
the average person realizes that large companies can change 
what theyre doing environmentally hill said 
to a lesser extent shareholder activists say the environmental 
theme of the 1990 annual meeting season just getting under way also 
shows that south africa no longer is drawing the same level of 
attention it once did 
part of the reason is that many us companies have left south 
africa voluntarily already and the whiteminority government 
recently has taken some dramatic steps suggesting its willing to 
give the black majority more power 
the situation is moving there now said gordon davidson 
outgoing director of the social investment forum a national 
association of 375 investment funds that promotes what it calls 
socially responsible investing 
its a sign of the work weve done he said its not that 
were giving up on that issue 
south africa remains the biggest single area of social investor 
attention with about 120 resolutions filed this year the same as 
last year 
by contrast 45 environmentrelated resolutions were filed this 
year vs six in 1989 
i think a combination of environmental factors is 
responsible said timothy smith executive director of the 
interfaith center on corporate responsibility a new york 
churchactivist group 
obviously the oil spill galvanized americas attention he 
said the concern about global warming the ozone layer the rain 
forests reminds us of an international environmental crisis 
other recurring resolutions range from a moratorium on nuclear 
weapons to animaltesting bans to a review of business operations 
in britishruled northern ireland but a couple of important new 
themes have emerged as well 
the most notable are resolutions opposing tobacco product 
manufacturing and advertising which are on the agendas of leading 
cigarette producers such as philip morris cos american brands 
inc and loews corp 
the securities and exchange commission which oversees what 
resolutions can be included at annual meetings reversed an earlier 
position that cigarette smoking was not an area in which 
shareholders were entitled to vote 
infantformula marketing also has surfaced as a potential battle 
issue activists have introduced resolutions at bristolmyers 
squibb co and gerber products co challenging the companies 
practice of advertising formula directly to mothers claiming it 
undermines the practice of breastfeeding 
many companies facing shareholder resolutions on political and 
social issues fear the adverse publicity such issues create even 
if they have little chance of approval 
some have successfully negotiated settlements with the sponsors 
that get the measures off the agenda before the annual meetings 
amoco corp chevron corp mobil corp texaco inc and waste 
management co for example agreed to provide report cards on 
areas covered by the valdez principles and the sponsors agreed to 
withdraw their resolutions 
fastfood giant mcdonalds corp facing a resolution sponsored 
by church groups challenging its use of styrofoam packaging agreed 
to explore alternatives the sponsors withdrew their resolution 
theyre beginning to see the handwriting on the wall that the 
environmental movement isnt going away next year said davidson 
theyre trying to figure out how theyre going to cope with it 
on the other hand exxon atlantic richfield co and several 
other leading industrial corporations declined to make any 
concessions on environmental resolutions so they will come to a 
vote 
historically most social resolutions have been defeated easily 
by largescale shareholders who support managements positionbut 
under sec corporate governance rules concerning annual meetings a 
resolution needs only 3 percent support the year its introduced to 
remain on the ballot the following year the next year it needs 6 
percent of the vote and 10 percent thereafter 
of the total resolutions filed this year a record 250 are 
likely to come to a vote a 43 percent increase over 1989 when 175 
of the 214 proposals filed were voted upon ms will said 
some companies have been particularly singled out this year for 
what shareholder activists call unacceptable behavior regarding 
both south african involvement and the environment 
on monday for example american cyanamid co a worldwide 
pharmaceutical and pesticide producer faces what organizers call a 
massive protest planned for its annual meeting in south portland 
maine two south africa divestment resolutions are on the agenda 
activists contend the company has been dumping mercury 
contaminants in south africa mistreating black south african 
employees and selling products and services there that strengthen 
the apartheid system of racial segregation 
theyre on our strategic companies focus list said diane 
bratcher a spokeswoman for the interfaith center one of the 
protest sponsors what they do is pretty heavy stuff toxic 
dumping providing strategic chemicals to the goldmining industry 
that makes cyanamid a pretty worthy target 
cyanamid issued a statement this past friday rebutting the 
criticism it said the mercury waste shipped to south africa is 
safely recycled the company also said it has strictly adhered to 
the sullivan principles of racial equality signed by many american 
corporations that still operate in south africa

hallmark cards inc said friday that holders of 
more than 84 percent of the 270 million in junk bonds issued by 
its univision holdings inc unit have accepted terms of a buyback 
offer 
the response reduced the chance that univision which operates a 
spanishlanguage television network and eight tv stations would 
proceed with its threat to file for bankruptcy protection should 
the tender offers be unsuccessful 
hallmark a privatelyheld greeting card company based in kansas 
city mo said in light of the latest results it was extending 
until 5 pm edt tuesday its tender offers of 131 million in cash 
for the two debt issues 
the company has said that it must get at least 90 percent of the 
two issues before it will be obligated to buy any of the securities 
we are hopeful that all bondholders will now tender their 
securities and that the univision restructuring can be completed 
promptly hallmark said 
hallmark which owns 635 percent of univision offered to buy 
the securities at a sharp discount from face value after univision 
was unable to make 10 million in interest payments in february on 
its debts to bondholders and bankers 
univision was authorized to file for protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law if the tender offers 
were unsuccessful 
the offers were to have expired at 1201 am friday 
on thursday afternoon a bondholder group which represents 
holders of more than threefourths of the issues said it planned to 
accept the tender offers 
hallmark originally offered 106 million for the bonds but 
those offers attracted fewer than 10 percent of each issue tendered 
hallmark sweetened its offers on march 30 by about 25 percent 
and said it had reached an agreement in principle with univisions 
bank lenders 
wilbur ross senior managing director at rothschild inc which 
is the financial advisor to the bondholders committee said his 
company considered the offers fair and recommended that a committee 
representing the bondholders support them the committee said it 
intended to accept the offer 
hallmark is offering 553 cents on the dollar for univisions 
165 million in senior subordinated discount notes and said it had 
either been tendered or promised in excess of 90 percent of the 
notes under its tender offer 
it is offering 379 cents on the dollar for 1058 million in 
subordinated debentures and said nearly 85 percent of that issue 
was either promised or tendered 
hallmark has said it plans to defer the interest payments on the 
securities purchased in the tender offers for seven years 
univision was put together over the past three years as hallmark 
and first chicago venture capital which owns 215 percent of 
univision bought eight television stations and the univision 
network for 600 million 
the company offers spanishlanguage programming on a network 
that reaches an estimated 92 percent of the us hispanic 
population

its been more than six months since ralph 
ingersoll ii and his st louis sun swaggered into this midwestern 
city armed with catchy slogans and ideas about the newspaper 
business 
ingersoll chairman and chief executive officer of ingersoll 
publications co named himself editorinchief and promised that 
the new tabloid would be the first profitable startup of a daily 
metropolitan newspaper in 40 years 
today the colorful newspapers future seems anything but clear 
the sun is struggling to overcome higherthanexpected costs 
revolvingdoor circulation limited advertising and a murky image 
that has turned critics into fans and fans into critics from day to 
day 
it seems as if things are not sailing along as smoothly as mr 
ingersoll had planned said charles klotzer editor and publisher 
of the st louis journalism review 
ingersoll says rumors of the newspapers imminent demise are 
greatly exaggerated 
on april 1 the newspaper had circulation of 109000 its 
highest yet and up from a low of 80000 during the winter thanks 
to the start of a new bingo promotion ingersoll said 
ingersoll has guaranteed advertisers circulation of 105000 for the 
first six months of 1990 
and the paper had 181 pages of advertising in the first week of 
april the suns best week since it began sept 25 
we have plenty of good news but we also have some problems 
and we need to make some changes ingersoll said in a telephone 
interview thursday the changes are all evolutionary not 
revolutionary 
ingersoll said that debt problems facing ingersoll publications 
had cast a shadow over the sun although they had no impact on the 
newspapers success or failure because they involved a separate 
company owned ingersoll 
last month ingersoll announced a plan to buy back some of 
community newspapers incs highinterest junk bonds at cutrate 
prices to appease some of his bondholders who were worried about 
the companys fiscal health 
we felt we might have a good business opportunity so we made 
the offer ingersoll said the reaction has been what you would 
expect the bondholders who bought the bonds at a low price are 
enthusiastic the bond holders who bought them at a higher price 
are less enthusiastic and thats where we are 
but although the two dont have a direct connection the 
publicity the bonds generated has spilled into the sun and its 
newsroom 
richard stevens the suns metro editor said editors are 
working hard to make sure the newsroom focused on business rather 
than rumors and gossip 
any time that we spend dealing with this kind of stuff is a 
negative but as far as it wasting a lot of our time its not a 
factor said stevens 
its unclear what the general reaction has been in st louis to 
the new newspaper 
although the sun has not weighted its local coverage toward 
sensational or titillating tabloidtype topics it still has gotten 
complaints from some readers that it sensationalized certain 
stories drawing criticism for example were its coverage of a 
politician involved in a sexual assault and of the fiveyear 
anniversary of an accident in which a man nearly was sawed in two 
the newspaper also has been chided for running photos of new 
womens swimsuits and lingerie 
but the sun also has been praised for its coverage of the effort 
to build a new domed stadium downtown and for its attention to the 
troubles facing st louis major air carrier trans world airlines 
some critics look down their noses at the suns flood of 
promotions fluorescent green billboards and many contests but sun 
executives defend the practice as the best way to attract new 
readers 
the papers marketing and editorial aspects are the least of 
ingersolls troubles 
the sun is losing more money than it expected according to 
ingersoll mainly because of higherthanexpected circulation costs 
and a whopping turnover rate among home subscribers 
ingersoll said the company has been forced to spend 5 million 
more than planned to distribute the sun because twice as many 
readers as expected wanted their papers delivered 
advertisers consider that to be very good but its much more 
expensive than we planned for ingersoll said 
home subscribers also have been canceling their subscriptions at 
a high rate which has left the newspaper with a 300 percent 
churn rate the churn rate is the rate at which a newspaper 
must sign up new subscribers to keep circulation at existing levels 
for example if a newspaper has 50000 home subscribers and it 
has to sign up 25000 new subscribers each year to keep its 
homedelivery base at 50000 the newspaper would have a churn rate 
of 50 percent 
ingersoll said the paper was researching the cause of its 
extremely high churn rate

wholesale prices helped by a record drop in 
vegetable costs and lower gasoline prices fell in march for the 
first time in seven months the government said friday 
the labor departments producer price index declined 02 percent 
last month after no change in february and a huge 18 percent gain 
in january the largest in 15 years vegetables prices were down by 
255 percent 
an unusually severe cold snap in late december followed by 
unseasonably mild temperatures in january and february caused the 
topsyturvy price pattern fuel oil and vegetable costs rocketed in 
january energy recovered a month later but food prices didnt 
start their decline until march 
in a separate report the commerce department said business 
inventories fell 04 percent in february while sales surged 13 
percent 
that report was taken as a sign of economic vigor rising 
inventories can signal a recession 
analysts say more good news is ahead 
energy prices are still coming down and in fact we have a 
little more to go in vegetables april should be a minus sign 
said economist donald ratajczak of georgia state university 
excluding the food and energy gyrations wholesale inflation has 
been remarkably stable for nearly two years economists look to 
these socalled core prices up 03 percent in march and 04 
percent in february as a better barometer of underlying 
inflationary pressures 
they foresee little change at least until next year the 
federal reserve board they said is keeping interest rates high 
enough to dampen both growth and price pressures but not high 
enough to derail the economy into a recession or substantially cut 
inflation 
i think this year inflation is going to stay stuck said 
economist james annable of first national bank of chicago 
without a recession you cant bring down inflation quickly 
prices rose 48 percent last year although the annual rate for 
the first three months of 1990 hit 67 percent economists expect 
the wholesale inflation rate by the end of the year will come in 
close to last years rate 
the march wholesale inflation report was better than expected 
most economists had predicted a slight increase of 01 percent or 
02 percent 
food prices dropped 06 percent in march the sharpest decline 
since june 
vegetables particularly tomatoes celery and cabbage fell 255 
percent the biggest drop on record going back to 1967 however 
that marked only a partial recovery from gains of 233 percent in 
february and 58 percent in january 
prices also fell for beef and veal dairy products and coffee 
they rose for eggs rice pasta pork chickens turkeys fish 
soft drinks and cooking oils 
energy prices overall dropped 24 percent in march after a 
decline of 5 percent in february and an increase of 136 percent in 
january 
gasoline was down 28 percent and natural gas declined 25 
percent fuel oil prices went up 106 percent but they had fallen 
302 percent the month before 
clothing prices for men and children rose while the cost of 
womens clothing fell passenger car prices in the face of weak 
sales declined 03 percent in march after no change in february 
and a 07 percent fall in january 
the various changes put the index for all finished goods one 
stop short of retail at 117 in march that means a hypothetical 
selection of goods that cost 100 in 1982 cost 117 last month up 
from 11210 a year earlier 
price pressures in earlier stages of the production process also 
eased in march intermediate goods showed no change while crude 
goods fell 14 percent an example of the three processing stages 
would be bread for finished goods flour for intermediate and wheat 
for crude

nabisco brands plans to sell its pet snacks 
division which makes milk bones dog biscuits to concentrate on 
making human foods a company official confirmed friday 
john manfredi a senior vice president of the rjr nabisco inc 
subsidiary said the decision was announced to employees thursday 
the company had not yet received any offers he said 
the pet snacks division employs about 275 people at a plant in 
buffalo and 12 at a kennel in sherburne 40 miles southeast of 
syracuse where its products are tested those jobs should not be 
in jeopardy manfredi said 
our assumption is that anyone who buys that milk bones 
business will certainly want to keep it going he said in a 
telephone interview from his home in montville nj its a very 
profitable business 
the pet snacks division had about 150 million in sales last 
year its profits were not disclosed separately from nabiscos 
manfredi said the division makes a variety of milk bones brand 
biscuits such as ones formulated to curb tartar buildup on dogs 
teeth 
nabisco decided to sell the division because it was not a 
strategic fit with the rest of its business he said 
their business is all in the human foods area he said 
this is the only one thats not 
since rjr nabisco was bought out for 2453 billion by kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co last year the company has sold numerous 
assets to reduce debt 
among other assets the company has sold five european food 
businesses for 25 billion its chun king division for 52 
million its associated biscuits international ltd for 44 
million del monte fresh fruit operations for 875 million and del 
montes canned food business for 148 billion 
in a related move friday nabisco said it plans to disband the 
12member sales force of its nabisco foods division headquartered 
in parsippany nj which had included the pet snacks operation 
manfredi said the company believes sales could be handled more 
efficiently by independent brokers than by inhouse salesmen 
the majority of the sales force likely will take jobs with those 
brokers who already handle about 70 percent of the companys 
sales manfredi said others might take jobs elsewhere at rjr and 
few would be left without a job

trade negotiators ended talks friday without 
reaching an agreement on us demands that japan remove 
restrictions on imports of wood products but another round of 
discussions is planned 
lumber products trade is the only unresolved issue among three 
areas in which washington has been seeking to remove trade barriers 
under a section of us trade law known as super 301 
there are still significant differences in our positions a 
us official in tokyo told reporters 
we have made substantial progress on many points but some 
issues remain to be discussed further said a japanese foreign 
ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity we have 
concluded our talks at this round after agreeing to hold another 
round of talks in the near future 
the us official who also spoke on condition he not be named 
said us negotiators felt they could reach an agreement before 
june 16 when the us administration is legally required to decide 
whether or not to take retaliatory action for foreign trade 
practices it says are unfair 
i think there is momentum to resolve the negotiations there 
is strong interest in a resolution on both sides the us 
official said 
last year the bush administration designated japanese trade in 
wood products satellites and supercomputers as areas in which us 
products face unfair trade practices under the super 301 clause 
the two governments recently reached agreements on greater 
access to japans satellite and supercomputer markets but talks on 
lumber trade which began monday faced mounting disagreement 
mainly because of japans complicated housing and construction 
regulations the japanese official said 
us industry and government officials say a japanese law 
banning the construction of threestory wooden apartments unfairly 
limits wood imports 
they also say tokyos product specifications and tariffs for 
lumber unfairly discriminate against imports of highvalue finished 
and semifinished wood products by importing mainly raw timber 
they say japan is protecting its own uncompetitive traditional 
timber processing industry 
japanese officials however argue that such restrictions are 
necessary safety precautions in earthquakeprone japan and thus 
cannot be eased unconditionally 
while traditional japanese architecture is based on wooden 
construction modern japan has strict building codes to minimize 
the risk of damage and fire from earthquakes 
wooden structures are limited by law to singlefamily dwellings 
up to three stories and to twostory multiple family housing most 
apartment buildings in major cities are built of steel and concrete 
officials from both sides said they felt technical questions 
regarding the safety of wooden housing had been cleared up they 
said progress had been made in all areas of discussion but 
declined to explain remaining disagreements 
the us official said he expected the talks to resume very 
soon but did not say exactly when or where the next round of 
negotiations would take place 
last year the united states exported 28 billion in wood 
products to japan mostly unfinished logs industry officials 
estimate that if trade barriers were eliminated the market would 
expand by an additional 2 billion and between 17000 to 20000 new 
us jobs would be created

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca was the only 
big three automaker chief executive who got a raise in 1989 
pulling in 4 million or 81 percent more than he collected in 
1988 the companys proxy statement said friday 
earnings last year for the nations no 3 automaker were down 
658 percent from the year before 
iacoccas compensation in 1989 salary and stock and in bonuses 
earned from the year before topped the 25 million received by 
general motors corp chairman roger b smith it was less however 
than the 66 million awarded to ford motor co chairman donald e 
petersen who retired march 1 
earlier this week after gm and ford issued their proxy 
statements the united auto workers union called the executives 
compensation levels for 1989 a disease 
the unions offices were closed for the good friday holiday 
last years proxy statements showed that iacocca and smith 
collected 37 million each and petersen got 105 million mostly 
in stock 
iacocca would have received more for 1989 had the company not 
withheld bonuses because of low corporate earnings the 
chrysleruaw contract calls on executives to forego cash bonuses in 
years when earnings dont reach the threshold for profitsharing 
checks for unionrepresented workers 
in 1989 chrysler earned 359 million far below the 105 
billion in profit the company reported for 1988 gm and ford made 
enough money to give their eligible workers profitsharing checks 
of 50 and 1025 apiece respectively 
chryslers proxy statement said iacoccas 889151 salary for 
1989 was increased by 525000 in cash compensation paid last year 
from 1988 earnings the colorful executive also was awarded 26 
million worth of stock 
other top chrysler executives compensations contained in the 
proxy statement included vice chairman gerald greenwald 11 
million chrysler motors chairman ben bidwell 976709 chrysler 
motors president robert a lutz 951436 and executive vice 
president robert s miller jr 874266 
although none of the executives will be receiving bonuses based 
on 1989 earnings the board of directors has set aside 22 million 
from corporate earnings for compensation later 
the two issues up for shareholder votes at chryslers annual 
meeting would change the number of votes each shareholder could 
cast in elections for the board of directors and require that each 
director hold at east 2000 shares of chrysler common or preferred 
stock 
the board opposes both motions

retail beef prices are likely to keep rising at least through 
this month because of unusually tight cattle supplies a situation 
already reflected in record high prices for live cattle futures 
analysts say 
but prices should ease significantly toward the end of may as 
cattle placed on feedlots during the winter reach marketable 
weights 
recordbreaking cattle futures prices shared the spotlight with 
tumbling crude oil and gasoline futures prices on the nations 
commodity markets in the past week elsewhere precious metal 
prices fell and grains and soybeans were mixed 
live cattle for april delivery rose to 8040 cents a pound 
wednesday on the chicago mercantile exchange surpassing the 
previous high of 8025 cents set in the spring of 1979 on 
thursday the last trading session before easter the contract 
climbed to 8047 cents before settling at 8042 cents 
the high futures prices reflect conditions in the cash cattle 
market where meat packers reportedly paid 81 cents to 82 cents a 
pound for topquality cattle in recent days 
on the retail level a weekly price survey of 15 cuts of beef in 
nine us cities by the knightridder financial news service found 
an average price of 241 per pound thursday compared with 239 a 
week earlier and 229 a year ago 
analysts said the main reason for the rising prices is tight 
supplies of marketready cattle the situation reflects a decline 
in feedlot placements last year after cattle prices fell during the 
summer to less than 70 cents a pound said thomas morgan president 
of sterling research corp in arlington heights ill 
he said cattle typically are marketed within five months of 
being placed on feedlots to be fattened 
morgan said feedlot placements picked up again last fall and 
winter after dry weather caused poor grazing conditions in the 
southern plains 
the winter wheat wasnt growing enough to pasture so they 
pulled cattle off the pastures and sold them to feedlots in october 
through january he said 
morgan said those cattle were lighter in weight than the average 
feedlot placements so they are being kept longer before marketing 
theyll start coming midmay through july he said 
that should bring cattle prices down with retail beef prices 
likely to follow within a few weeks 
how far and quickly prices will fall is anyones guess the 1979 
highs were followed by a collapse of more than 20 cents in less 
than three months 
i think people are cognizant of that said phil stanley an 
independent futures trader and consultant for dec futures inc in 
lincoln neb 
on any sign of weakness in the cash market youll probably see 
some pretty active selling come into the futures he said

the advertising agency wells rich greene inc 
said friday it will sell a 40 percent stake to a french firm and 
join an international ad agency network in an effort to give its 
clients more worldwide services 
in a separate development wells rich founder mary wells 
lawrence said she was stepping aside as chairman and chief 
executive and that the agencys board had elected kenneth olshan to 
succeed her 
ken and i have been moving toward this day for five years 
mrs wells said calling it another step in the natural evolution 
of the agency 
the 60yearold mrs lawrence has been withdrawing from 
daytoday involvement with the agency over the past three years to 
spend more time with her family she said she also wanted an 
orderly succession 
olshan 56 has been with the agency for 15 years and most 
recently has been chairman of its wells rich greene worldwide unit 
the privatelyheld wells rich greene handles billings of about 
850 million a year and its clients include international business 
machines corp ford motor co procter amp gamble hertz and mci 
communications corp 
it has created ads for alkaseltzer plus cold medicine benson amp 
hedges cigarettes and pringles potato chips and developed the i 
love new york theme for the state of new york 
the agency said it was joining a union of advertising agencies 
formed by the french ad agency bddp over the past six years that 
includes agencies throughout europe and the far east 
as part of that agreement bddp has agreed to purchase 40 
percent of the stock in wells rich greene for an undisclosed amount 
in turn wells richs management group will obtain an 
unspecified stake in bddp through stock purchases and exchange of 
shares the firms statement read 
olshan said bddp executives approached wells rich greene about 
joining its agency network several months ago 
bddp needs a major american agency for their union just as we 
need the right partners in their markets he said 
he said the association would build the bddp network into the 
kind of substantial talented and realistic resource we want for 
our clients 
bddp was founded in 1984 by a group that included the managers 
of the ad agencies young amp rubicam and ogilvy amp mather in europe 
its clients include bmw grand metropolitan plc polaroid 
hertz mcdonalds and electrolux 
it has developed its ad network by setting up agencies and 
buying stakes ranging from 20 percent to 100 percent in others the 
agencies are selected for the creative capabilities and management 
of each agency is kept in local hands 
the bddpled networks billings now exceed 14 billion 
in a telephone interview mrs lawrence said there was no 
relation between the two announcements it was all evolving at 
the same time she said 
wells rich greene has offices in five cities new york 
chicago detroit st louis and los angeles but no international 
presence other than a stake in an agency in london 
i had been looking for an international solution for quite 
awhile now mrs lawrence said 
but she said the prospective partners either wanted to buy her 
whole company served clients who may have posed a conflict with 
clients of wells rich greene or were simply not people we wanted 
to deal with 
the prospective removal of trader barriers within europe in 1992 
made it more important that wells rich find an international 
partner though 
the time has come when it would be dangerous not to be fully 
represented there mrs lawrence said 
she said she had been the agencys majority shareholder but 
would be selling some of her stock as part of the transaction with 
bddp 
she declined to say how much she would be left with or how much 
she was being paid for her interest nor how large a stake she 
planned to buy in bddp

companies call it good corporate citizenship 
skeptics call it greenwashing and some hardline environmentalists 
call it ecopornography 
theyre talking about the deluge of products services and 
business advertising timed to coincide with celebrations and 
publicity marking the 20th anniversary of earth day on april 22 
this past week for example shell oil co announced an 
environmentally enhanced gasoline to cut pollution hj heinz 
co announced a new effort to turn empty plastic condiment bottles 
into carpeting and the nations biggest tuna canners promised to 
stop buying or selling tuna caught in nets that also snare dolphins 
many of these efforts stem from what business executives call a 
sincere sensitivity to the environment spawned by growing problems 
that range from groaning land fills to acidrain pollution and 
beaches tainted by oil spills 
shells chief executive frank richardson for example in 
explaining the motive for selling a reducedemission gasoline said 
it reflects shells ongoing commitment to make environmental 
considerations a priority in our development of new products and 
processes 
environmental groups generally have welcomed this trend but as 
earth day draws closer and more companies seek to exploit its 
popularity by touting themselves as environmentalists some 
activists are growing alarmed that the event is turning into a 
hyperidden corporate sales campaign 
we think earth day is a good thing were also convinced it 
has some extremely negative side effects said peter dykstra 
spokesman for washingtonbased greenpeace one of the most visible 
and militant environmental groups 
theres a lot of greenwashing going on dykstra said it 
is frequently pursued most energetically by the companies with the 
worst records the dolphin problems have been known for a quarter 
century that canners timed their policy change now is certainly 
not coincidence 
some industries accused by the environmental movement of the 
most serious pollution history such as lumberproduct companies 
have incensed earth day celebrants by claiming to be their allies 
the american forest council for example a group of timber and 
paper companies has taken out large magazine ads that say for 
us every day is earth day 
that goes beyond greenwashing dykstra said its 
ecopornography it exploits environmental concern just as 
pornography is commonly considered offensive and exploitative 
still the announcements this past week by the nations three 
largest sellers of canned tuna heinzs starkist seafood cos 
subsidiary van camp seafood cos chicken of the sea brand and 
bumble bee seafoods inc were regarded as a major victory by 
environmental activist groups that long have sought to end the 
killing of dolphins in giant fishing nets 
at the same time the only substantial proof of a policy change 
was offered by starkist chicken of the sea and bumble bee both 
owned by foreign companies by friday had not disclosed precisely 
how they intended to ensure they only will use dolphinfree tuna in 
the future 
we do know that heinz is willing finally to go the limit 
said brenda killian a national organizer for the save the dolphin 
project of the earth island institute a san franciscobased 
environmental group if the others dont well expose them 
to some extent the socalled greening of corporate america is 
founded on consumerbased economics surveys have shown that a 
majority of shoppers will avoid buying a product if they know it 
will hurt the environment and will spend a few more cents for a 
product packaged with recyclable materials 
marketing intelligence service a research group in naples 
ny has tracked the introduction of more than 700 products 
described as environmentally friendly since 1985 ranging from 
biodegradable diapers to dioxin free coffee filters 
unfortunately for the consumer and the environment not all of 
these products are as green as they claim the council on 
economic priorities a publicinterest group that monitors 
corporate behavior said in its april newsletter many questions 
about green products remain unanswered who will distinguish 
between true environmental product improvements and false ones is 
there any agreement about what safe for the environment really

a federal bankruptcy judge should appoint an 
outsider to take control of eastern airlines because management is 
unable or unwilling to face market realities an adviser to the 
carriers unsecured creditors testified friday 
arthur newman managing director of investment banking at 
chemical bank said he had never seen a company miss its financial 
forecasts as frequently or by such large amounts as eastern has 
newman was the first witness at a hearing in us bankruptcy 
court to consider the creditors request for the appointment of a 
special trustee to run the airline something easterns unions have 
long sought 
present in the packed courtroom were frank lorenzo chairman of 
easterns parent texas air corp and eastern president phil bakes 
who have opposed the idea of relinquishing control of the 
financially pressed airline 
joel zweibel attorney for the committee representing the 
unsecured creditors said they wanted a trustee not to liquidate 
eastern but to sell it as a going concern 
this debtor has lost an extraordinary amount of money since 
commencement of the case he told the court 
bankruptcy judge burton r lifland expressed impatience with 
eastern which has been attempting to reorganize since it entered 
chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings more than a year ago 
the judge who repeatedly has postponed proceedings to address 
the trustee issue told the companys attorneys you people have 
been squandering the time thats been allotted to ou 
at about 7 pm friday lifland adjourned the hearing until 
monday morning newman the first of three witnesses the creditors 
planned to call was the only one to testify on friday 
in arguing for a trustee newman said the airlines management 
was unable or unwilling to face the realities that are there in 
the marketplace for eastern 
eastern plans to call eight witnesses and they are expected to 
include lorenzo and bakes it would be the first time lorenzo has 
testifed in court since the carrier filed for bankruptcy 
eastern also is asking the judge for permission to withdraw 80 
million from an escrow account for to cover second quarter 
operations a request lifland said he would consider monday 
bruce zirinsky one of easterns attorneys said the airline 
needs the cash by monday or tuesday after the hearing though 
texas air spokesman art kent said eastern has sufficient 
resources to keep flying at least through the end of the month 
pressure to appoint a trustee mounted this past week when the 
unsecured creditors voted to reject the airlines latest 
reorganization proposal and later asked the court to name a trustee 
who would sell eastern 
easterns devastating constantly expanding and unending 
losses are extremely damaging to unsecured creditors the 
creditors motion said 
before that the creditors committee had supported eastern 
throughout its 13monthlong bankruptcy proceeding and had objected 
to the unions calls for the appointment of a trustee 
the pilots machinists and flight attendants unions struck 
eastern on march 4 1989 forcing the miamibased airline into 
bankruptcy protection five days later the machinists union remains 
on strike against eastern 
the unions long have accused lorenzo of funneling eastern assets 
to parent texas air and sister carrier continental airlines 
a report by courtappointed examiner david i shapiro filed in 
early march suggested texas air had victimized eastern by 
underpaying for the airline and some of its assets by hundreds of 
millions of dollars 
eastern recently asked lifland to accelerate approval of a 280 
million payment by texas air to settle the potential claims raised 
by shapiros report 
the trustee issue prompted the collapse last spring of a 
proposed buyout of eastern by the unions and former baseball 
commissioner peter v ueberroth 
eastern came under additional pressure monday when the 
committee representing its preferred shareholders proposed a 
reorganization plan that would give the airline to the 
shareholders unsecured creditors and new managers 
it was the first competing proposal to easterns own 
reorganization plan 
eastern owes the unsecured creditors around 980 million while 
the preferred shareholders are due 680 million the airlines most 
recent reorganization plans proposed to pay the two groups only a 
fraction of what they are owed 
eastern also has about 830 million in unfunded pension 
liabilities according to the pension benefit guaranty corp a 
government agency eastern claims its liability is only 3767 
million

mgmua communications co said friday 
it lost 98 million in the second quarter and revenue fell 27 
percent primarily because it had few movies in release as a result 
of trying to sell the company 
the loss for the quarter ended feb 28 the equivalent of 19 
cents per share compared with a loss of 147 million or 29 cents 
per share in the same period a year earlier

feature films segment declining by 33 percent to 1408 million 
controlling shareholder kirk kerkorian had mgmua in the auction 
block for the better part of two years nearly drying up the

pathe communications corp is trying to complete a buyout of 
mgmua for 127 billion analysts say restarting film production

million or 23 cents per share compared with 542 million 108 
per share in the same period a year earlier revenues fell 6 
percent from 4122 million to 3883 million 
operating revenues decreased during both periods primarily due 
to a lack of feature films in theatrical release mgmua chairman 
jeffrey c barbakow said 
however for the first six months of fiscal 1990 the company 
posted operating gains due to our successful control of overhead 
costs as well as the continued outstanding sales performances of

the business information marketer said the planned sales are 
part of its previously announced strategy to sharpen the companys 
focus on key markets 
the three businesses which are being offered for sale 
separately had combined revenue of 200 million last year and were 
said to be profitable 
they are

of subscriptionfulfillment services for more than 270 publications 
zytron based in menlo park calif a company that transfers

microfiche 
petroleum information based in littleton colo which 
publishes information on drilling production and natural gas 
transportation for the oil and gas industries

subsidiaries is expected to be offset by investing and redeploying 
the cash proceeds from the sales 
while all these are profitable businesses we believe that it 
is in the best interests of dampbs shareowners to simplify dampbs 
business mix and focus our investments and resources on those key 
markets in which dampbs participation and leadership positions are

national intergroup inc filed two lawsuits 
thursday to try to stop the hostile takeover attempt by the new 
yorkbased centaur partners 
one suit filed with the us district court in pittsburgh seeks 
an injunction to stop the defendants efforts to gain control of 
the pittsburghbased holding company 
the suits named centaur partners walker street associates and 
its affiliates as defendants 
centaur said it would vigorously defend itself 
niis board of directors is desperately trying to intimidate 
us and other shareholders it said 
the federal suit alleged the defendants furnished false and 
misleading information to nii shareholders in order to gain control 
of their stock 
defendants false and misleading consent materials and the 
apparent infirmities in their disclosures about their cooperative 
efforts have resulted in irreparable harm by creating confusion in 
the marketplace and interfering with the free and informed exercise 
of the shareholders franchise niis court documents said 
centaur is seeking to gain seats on national intergroups board 
restructure the company and sell off assets it has claimed it 
could receive 2934 a share by breaking up nii 
centaur said its figure of 2934 a share is based on an 
independent analysis conducted by painewebber inc and is 3 less 
than national intergroups book value 
but national intergroup said in the lawsuit that those figures 
are wrong because painewebber would earn 10 percent of whatever 
profit centaur may make from breaking up the company 
the second lawsuit filed in common pleas court of allegheny 
county is seeking a judgment from the court that ultimately would 
decrease the percentage of national intergroup common stock owned 
by the defendants and increase the percentage owned by other 
shareholders 
as of jan 26 centaur partners owned at least 1653 percent of 
niis outstanding shares and walker street has increased their 
ownership through open market purchases to about 84 percent the 
state lawsuit alleged 
national intergroup stock closed at 1587 thursday down 87 
cents on the new york stock exchange
